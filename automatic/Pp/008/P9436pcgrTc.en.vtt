out<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.900> it<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:25.150> eventually<00:01:26.150> strip<00:01:26.780> off

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
out of it and eventually strip off

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.270 
out of it and eventually strip off
though<00:01:27.260> you<00:01:27.470> know<00:01:27.590> wants<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:27.950> close<00:01:28.070> all<00:01:28.250> the

way through when these rip you have no
teeth<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.520> then<00:01:32.439> you<00:01:33.439> know<00:01:33.590> your<00:01:33.770> belt<00:01:34.040> could

teeth and then you know your belt could

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.280 
teeth and then you know your belt could
easily<00:01:34.340> just<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.790> know<00:01:34.909> shred<00:01:35.510> you<00:01:35.990> keep

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
easily just you know shred you keep

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.469 
easily just you know shred you keep
spinning<00:01:36.470> you<00:01:36.950> know<00:01:37.100> up<00:01:37.760> to<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.090> point<00:01:38.330> where

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
spinning you know up to the point where

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.640 
spinning you know up to the point where
it<00:01:38.540> shreds<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:38.960> then<00:01:39.080> you're<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:39.530> know

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
it shreds and then you're you know

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.260 
it shreds and then you're you know
timings<00:01:40.070> off<00:01:41.229> you<00:01:42.229> know<00:01:42.350> maybe<00:01:43.310> you're<00:01:43.520> just

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
timings off you know maybe you're just

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.429 
timings off you know maybe you're just
stuffs<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:44.810> know<00:01:44.900> where<00:01:45.020> your<00:01:45.140> engine<00:01:45.350> will

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
stuffs you know where your engine will

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.320 
stuffs you know where your engine will
stop<00:01:45.560> working<00:01:45.710> as<00:01:46.040> I<00:01:46.130> had<00:01:46.280> no<00:01:46.400> timing<00:01:47.170> or<00:01:49.330> if

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
stop working as I had no timing or if

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.510 
stop working as I had no timing or if
you<00:01:50.420> see<00:01:50.600> this<00:01:50.659> cracks<00:01:50.930> up<00:01:51.080> top<00:01:51.320> if<00:01:52.070> they<00:01:52.340> get

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.680 
how nicely well when that is no signs of
any<00:02:21.600> ripping<00:02:22.290> IT<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.650> any<00:02:22.739> kind

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
any ripping IT of any kind

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.220 
any ripping IT of any kind
so<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.930> can<00:02:25.050> pair<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.350> old<00:02:25.590> one<00:02:27.020> then<00:02:28.020> you

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
so you can pair to the old one then you

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.750 
so you can pair to the old one then you
and<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> old<00:02:30.800> look<00:02:31.800> actually<00:02:32.370> now<00:02:32.459> see<00:02:32.730> I

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and the old look actually now see I

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.309 
and the old look actually now see I
think<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:33.030> one's<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.360> better<00:02:33.569> quality<00:02:33.840> belt

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
think this one's a better quality belt

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.270 
think this one's a better quality belt
in<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.739> one<00:02:35.870> like<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.080> see<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.380> lot<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.800> we

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
in this one like I see a lot of like we

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.559 
in this one like I see a lot of like we
know<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.550> weaves<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.090> one<00:02:39.239> is<00:02:39.330> bigger

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
know the weaves on this one is bigger

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.380 
know the weaves on this one is bigger
than<00:02:39.780> these<00:02:40.010> so<00:02:41.010> smaller<00:02:41.340> meaning<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.760> higher

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
than these so smaller meaning is higher

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.880 
than these so smaller meaning is higher
texture<00:02:43.130> meaning<00:02:44.130> it's<00:02:44.280> stronger<00:02:45.890> also

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
texture meaning it's stronger also

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.729 
texture meaning it's stronger also
another<00:02:47.340> thing<00:02:47.959> when<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.080> change<00:02:49.380> these

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
another thing when you change these

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.770 
another thing when you change these
timing<00:02:50.190> belts<00:02:50.489> you're<00:02:50.700> supposed<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.390> change

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.960 
timing belts you're supposed to change
the<00:02:52.650> tensioner<00:02:53.160> with<00:02:53.190> them<00:02:53.459> this<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.670> what

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the tensioner with them this is what

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.620 
the tensioner with them this is what
this<00:02:54.150> belt<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:54.780> for<00:02:55.620> contour<00:02:56.160> but<00:02:56.489> XC<00:02:57.330> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
would have more life left in it if

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.229 
would have more life left in it if
somebody<00:03:43.829> had<00:03:44.040> done<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.609> right<00:03:44.640> thing<00:03:45.060> and
