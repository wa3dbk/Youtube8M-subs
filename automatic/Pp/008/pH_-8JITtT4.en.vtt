looking<00:00:43.830> for<00:00:44.010> sustainable<00:00:44.550> solutions<00:00:45.590> we

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
looking for sustainable solutions we

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.800 
looking for sustainable solutions we
often<00:00:46.890> ask<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.730> wrong<00:00:47.879> questions<00:00:48.449> and<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.660> get

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
often ask the wrong questions and we get

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.350 
often ask the wrong questions and we get
stuck<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.230> them<00:00:49.470> we<00:00:50.220> say<00:00:50.370> what's<00:00:50.550> better<00:00:50.760> paper

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
stuck on them we say what's better paper

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.819

or plastic when for instance we build a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.160 
or plastic when for instance we build a
building<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.720> we're<00:00:57.720> going<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.870> think<00:00:58.110> about

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
building and we're going to think about

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.600 
building and we're going to think about
maintenance<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.920> think<00:00:59.130> about<00:00:59.190> how<00:00:59.460> we're

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
maintenance we think about how we're

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
maintenance we think about how we're
going<00:00:59.700> to<00:00:59.760> clean<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> outside<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.510> that

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
going to clean the outside of that

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.650 
going to clean the outside of that
building<00:01:01.760> what<00:01:02.760> detergent<00:01:03.270> are<00:01:03.360> we<00:01:03.450> going<00:01:03.600> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
building what detergent are we going to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.430 
building what detergent are we going to
use<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.020> so<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:04.800> get<00:01:04.920> into<00:01:05.899> what's<00:01:06.899> the<00:01:07.259> least

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
use and so we get into what's the least

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.810 
use and so we get into what's the least
toxic<00:01:07.710> detergent<00:01:08.600> what's<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.869> least<00:01:10.080> energy

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
toxic detergent what's the least energy

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.190 
toxic detergent what's the least energy
intensive<00:01:11.820> form<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.330> sandblasting<00:01:13.020> or

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.090 
intensive form of sandblasting or
whatever<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:14.450> bio<00:01:15.450> mimic<00:01:15.840> would<00:01:16.020> ask<00:01:16.200> how<00:01:16.950> does

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
whatever a bio mimic would ask how does

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.919 
whatever a bio mimic would ask how does
nature<00:01:17.250> clean<00:01:18.920> if<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> bio<00:01:20.369> mimic<00:01:20.700> asked<00:01:21.090> what

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
nature clean if the bio mimic asked what

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.340 
nature clean if the bio mimic asked what
detergent<00:01:22.530> does<00:01:22.709> nature<00:01:22.920> use<00:01:24.229> you<00:01:25.229> would

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
detergent does nature use you would

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.990 
detergent does nature use you would
quickly<00:01:25.590> find<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.130> nature<00:01:26.399> doesn't<00:01:26.610> use<00:01:26.819> to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
quickly find that nature doesn't use to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.680 
quickly find that nature doesn't use to
charge<00:01:27.209> it<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.009> that's<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.130> hint<00:01:29.690> Nature

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
charge it and that's a hint Nature

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.419 
charge it and that's a hint Nature
doesn't<00:01:30.720> use<00:01:31.200> detergent<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.890> yet<00:01:32.069> it<00:01:32.190> needs

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
doesn't use detergent and yet it needs

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.910 
doesn't use detergent and yet it needs
to<00:01:32.729> keep<00:01:32.880> very<00:01:33.149> very<00:01:33.390> clean<00:01:33.690> how<00:01:34.619> does<00:01:34.770> nature

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
to keep very very clean how does nature

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.499 
to keep very very clean how does nature
keep<00:01:35.250> itself<00:01:35.550> clean<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:37.170> next<00:01:37.440> question<00:01:37.890> is

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
keep itself clean the next question is

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.400 
keep itself clean the next question is
what<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.630> nature<00:01:41.270> needs<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.660> stay<00:01:42.899> clean<00:01:43.200> in

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
what in nature needs to stay clean in

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.109 
what in nature needs to stay clean in
order<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:43.920> its<00:01:44.039> survival<00:01:44.340> because<00:01:44.970> that's

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
order for its survival because that's

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:45.980 
order for its survival because that's
where<00:01:45.300> you're<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.569> find<00:01:45.599> the<00:01:45.869> best

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
where you're going to find the best

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.219 
where you're going to find the best
ideas<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.789> a<00:01:47.789> biologist<00:01:48.450> would<00:01:48.569> answer<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
ideas and a biologist would answer a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.800 
ideas and a biologist would answer a
leaf<00:01:49.709> because<00:01:50.550> if<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.789> leaf<00:01:51.000> gets<00:01:51.270> muddy<00:01:51.539> or

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
leaf because if a leaf gets muddy or

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.070 
leaf because if a leaf gets muddy or
dirty<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.590> can't<00:01:53.039> gather<00:01:53.789> solar<00:01:54.149> energy<00:01:55.250> so

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
dirty it can't gather solar energy so

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.600 
dirty it can't gather solar energy so
they<00:01:58.080> looked<00:01:58.380> some<00:01:58.619> scientists<00:01:59.099> looked<00:01:59.399> at

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
they looked some scientists looked at

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.320 
they looked some scientists looked at
the<00:02:00.450> sacred<00:02:00.899> lotus<00:02:01.399> which<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.610> Asia<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
the sacred lotus which in Asia is a

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.600 
the sacred lotus which in Asia is a
symbol<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.810> purity<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.890> plant<00:02:05.160> that<00:02:05.280> grows

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
symbol of purity it's a plant that grows

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.960 
symbol of purity it's a plant that grows
out<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.360> mud<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:07.250> of<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.310> very<00:02:08.520> swampy

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
out of the mud out of a very swampy

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.120 
out of the mud out of a very swampy
environment<00:02:09.479> but<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.840> always<00:02:10.050> looks<00:02:10.440> dry<00:02:10.770> and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
environment but it always looks dry and

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.860 
environment but it always looks dry and
clean<00:02:11.459> why<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.940> they<00:02:12.330> took<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.660> leaf

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
clean why is that they took the leaf

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.740 
clean why is that they took the leaf
they<00:02:13.410> put<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.250> under<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.520> microscope<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.480> what

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
they put it under a microscope and what

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.260 
they put it under a microscope and what
they<00:02:15.870> found<00:02:15.900> was<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:17.090> there<00:02:18.090> were

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
they found was that there were

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.080 
they found was that there were
microscopic<00:02:19.200> hills<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.160> valleys<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.760> was<00:02:20.940> not

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
microscopic hills and valleys it was not

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.790 
microscopic hills and valleys it was not
smooth<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:22.170> was<00:02:22.290> actually<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:22.680> a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
smooth it was actually like a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.780 
smooth it was actually like a
mountainscape<00:02:23.930> now<00:02:24.930> what<00:02:25.080> happens<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.710> if<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
mountainscape now what happens is if the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.850 
mountainscape now what happens is if the
leaf<00:02:27.000> had<00:02:27.180> been<00:02:27.330> smooth

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
leaf had been smooth

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.940 
leaf had been smooth
dirt<00:02:28.730> particles<00:02:29.030> would<00:02:29.390> adhere<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.770> leaf

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
dirt particles would adhere to the leaf

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.910 
dirt particles would adhere to the leaf
and<00:02:31.250> when<00:02:32.030> water<00:02:32.330> hit<00:02:32.750> rainwater<00:02:33.380> or<00:02:33.530> whatever

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
and when water hit rainwater or whatever

and when water hit rainwater or whatever
it<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.370> water<00:02:34.550> would<00:02:34.700> spread<00:02:35.030> out<00:02:35.240> and<00:02:35.480> it

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
it the water would spread out and it

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.490 
it the water would spread out and it
here<00:02:36.100> instead<00:02:37.100> with<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:38.230> peaks<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.440> valleys

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
here instead with the peaks and valleys

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.250 
here instead with the peaks and valleys
dirt<00:02:40.460> particles<00:02:40.730> sort<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.300> Teeter<00:02:41.960> on<00:02:42.170> the

surface of those Peaks and then when
rain<00:02:45.710> comes<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.220> balls<00:02:46.580> up<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.900> actually

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
rain comes it balls up and it actually

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.130 
rain comes it balls up and it actually
picks<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:49.190> dirt<00:02:49.370> particles<00:02:49.670> up<00:02:50.110> like<00:02:51.110> a

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
deeper principle so a company in Germany

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.850 
deeper principle so a company in Germany
called<00:03:30.580> if<00:03:31.580> so<00:03:32.110> created<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.170> building<00:03:33.500> facade

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
called if so created a building facade

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.820 
called if so created a building facade
paint<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.370> when<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.150> paint<00:03:35.450> dries<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.590> has

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
paint and when that paint dries it has

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.949 
paint and when that paint dries it has
the<00:03:37.010> rough<00:03:37.220> surfaces<00:03:37.850> similar<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.690> lotus

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
the rough surfaces similar to the lotus

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.479 
the rough surfaces similar to the lotus
leaf<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:39.620> that<00:03:39.769> rain<00:03:40.070> cleans<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.910> building

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
leaf so that rain cleans the building

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.990 
leaf so that rain cleans the building
that's<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.700> very<00:03:43.730> different<00:03:44.209> paradigm<00:03:46.000> than

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
that's a very different paradigm than

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.820 
that's a very different paradigm than
sitting<00:03:47.810> around<00:03:47.870> thinking<00:03:48.290> of<00:03:48.620> what

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
sitting around thinking of what

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.509 
sitting around thinking of what
detergent<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.430> use<00:03:50.019> very<00:03:51.019> different<00:03:51.410> paradigm

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.800 

so<00:03:55.540> it's<00:03:56.540> ancient<00:03:57.370> how<00:03:58.370> did<00:03:58.549> we<00:03:58.730> why<00:03:59.510> are<00:03:59.570> we

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
so it's ancient how did we why are we

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.810 
so it's ancient how did we why are we
just<00:04:00.019> getting<00:04:00.140> back<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.680> it<00:04:00.799> now<00:04:01.010> why<00:04:01.760> is

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
just getting back to it now why is

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.440 
just getting back to it now why is
biomimicry<00:04:02.360> starting<00:04:02.989> to<00:04:03.110> have<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.230> resurgence

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
biomimicry starting to have a resurgence

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.940 
biomimicry starting to have a resurgence
why<00:04:05.450> haven't<00:04:05.750> we<00:04:05.840> been<00:04:06.049> doing<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:06.470> all<00:04:06.680> along

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
why haven't we been doing this all along

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.920 
why haven't we been doing this all along
and<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:08.690> think<00:04:08.900> one<00:04:09.049> of<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.230> reasons<00:04:09.410> is<00:04:09.890> that

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
and I think one of the reasons is that

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.490 
and I think one of the reasons is that
we<00:04:11.930> honestly<00:04:12.170> believe<00:04:14.019> that<00:04:15.019> we<00:04:15.200> are<00:04:15.350> not

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
we honestly believe that we are not

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.849 
we honestly believe that we are not
nature<00:04:15.920> that<00:04:16.729> we're<00:04:16.910> different<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:18.440> nature

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
nature that we're different that nature

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.000 
nature that we're different that nature
that<00:04:19.160> we<00:04:19.310> have<00:04:19.459> technologies<00:04:20.890> but<00:04:21.890> that

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
that we have technologies but that

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.159 
that we have technologies but that
