00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.730 
to fly a quadcopter in this video we're
just<00:00:05.310> going<00:00:05.520> over<00:00:06.029> basic<00:00:06.690> hovering<00:00:07.259> but<00:00:07.620> in

animals around you so first we're going
to<00:00:37.800> check<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:38.700> all<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.090> our<00:00:39.210> controls

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
to check and see if all of our controls

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.959 
to check and see if all of our controls
are<00:00:39.780> working<00:00:40.140> properly<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> lot<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.640> times

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
are working properly so a lot of times

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.280 
are working properly so a lot of times
when<00:00:42.239> people<00:00:42.270> are<00:00:42.629> building<00:00:42.840> their<00:00:43.110> first

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
when people are building their first

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.830 
when people are building their first
quadcopter<00:00:44.190> they'll<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:45.059> about<00:00:45.180> three

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
quadcopter they'll get about three

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.720 
quadcopter they'll get about three
inches<00:00:46.170> off<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.410> ground<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.520> whole

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
inches off the ground and the whole

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.880 
inches off the ground and the whole
thing<00:00:48.000> will<00:00:48.210> either<00:00:48.420> flip<00:00:48.809> over<00:00:48.989> or<00:00:49.379> start

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
thing will either flip over or start

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.639 
thing will either flip over or start
rotating<00:00:50.329> uncontrollably<00:00:51.329> most<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> time

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
rotating uncontrollably most of the time

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.369 
rotating uncontrollably most of the time
is<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:53.160> their<00:00:53.340> gyros<00:00:53.850> are<00:00:54.120> reversed<00:00:54.539> if

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
is because their gyros are reversed if

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.200 
is because their gyros are reversed if
this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> case<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.370> any<00:00:56.520> direction<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
this is the case in any direction it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.760 
this is the case in any direction it
makes<00:00:57.420> will<00:00:57.690> actually<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.140> increasing<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
makes will actually be increasing the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.979 
makes will actually be increasing the
problem<00:00:59.190> causing<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.879> flip<00:01:00.090> over<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:00.690> keep

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
problem causing it to flip over or keep

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.619 
problem causing it to flip over or keep
rotating<00:01:01.289> more<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.100> more<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.399> more<00:01:02.629> so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
rotating more and more and more so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.080 
rotating more and more and more so
basically<00:01:03.989> what<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.470> do<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.339> go

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
basically what you want to do is just go

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.960 
basically what you want to do is just go
up<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.360> about<00:01:06.540> 10%<00:01:07.049> throttle<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.100> then<00:01:08.340> move

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
up to about 10% throttle and then move

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.490 
up to about 10% throttle and then move
all<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.240> controls<00:01:09.540> around<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.350> make

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
all your controls around just to make

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.460 
all your controls around just to make
sure<00:01:10.530> everything's<00:01:11.100> working<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> now<00:01:16.290> we're

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
sure everything's working so now we're

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.660 
sure everything's working so now we're
ready<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.710> slide<00:01:17.040> around

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
ready to slide around

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550 
ready to slide around
it's<00:01:18.270> basically<00:01:18.630> what<00:01:18.840> we're<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.320> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
it's basically what we're going to do is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.120 
it's basically what we're going to do is
just<00:01:20.220> keep<00:01:20.400> slowly<00:01:20.880> increasing<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> throttle

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
just keep slowly increasing the throttle

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.530 
just keep slowly increasing the throttle
until<00:01:23.130> we're<00:01:23.340> about<00:01:23.520> an<00:01:23.640> inch<00:01:23.880> off<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> ground

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
until we're about an inch off the ground

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.230 
until we're about an inch off the ground
and<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.770> screw<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.580> around<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.119> of

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and then just screw it around to kind of

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.940 
and then just screw it around to kind of
get<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> feel<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:27.840> how<00:01:28.259> sensitive<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
get a feel for how sensitive the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.320 
get a feel for how sensitive the
controls<00:01:29.310> are

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.300 

if<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:35.960> feel<00:01:36.200> like<00:01:36.380> you're<00:01:36.590> drifting<00:01:36.860> way<00:01:37.250> too

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
if you feel like you're drifting way too

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.310 
if you feel like you're drifting way too
fast<00:01:37.760> all<00:01:38.120> you<00:01:38.270> have<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.480> do<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:38.780> throttle<00:01:39.020> down

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
fast all you have to do is throttle down

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.890 
fast all you have to do is throttle down
it's<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.340> lot<00:01:40.490> better<00:01:40.790> than<00:01:40.880> trying<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.480> correct

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
it's a lot better than trying to correct

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:53.580 
it's a lot better than trying to correct
and<00:01:42.200> crashing

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.950 

also<00:01:54.310> if<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.610> end<00:01:54.760> up<00:01:54.909> landing<00:01:55.180> extremely

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
also if you end up landing extremely

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.870 
also if you end up landing extremely
close<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.409> something<00:01:56.619> just<00:01:56.830> pick<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.460> copter

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
close to something just pick the copter

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.520 
close to something just pick the copter
up<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.240> place<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:58.780> back<00:01:58.930> where<00:01:59.260> it<00:01:59.290> was

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
up and place it back where it was

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.590 
up and place it back where it was
because<00:02:00.190> most<00:02:00.430> likely<00:02:00.640> if<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.180> weren't<00:02:01.479> able

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
because most likely if you weren't able

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.109 
because most likely if you weren't able
to<00:02:01.960> keep<00:02:02.409> it<00:02:02.590> away<00:02:02.740> from<00:02:02.950> whatever<00:02:03.549> it<00:02:03.790> is<00:02:03.850> that

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
to keep it away from whatever it is that

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.640 
to keep it away from whatever it is that
you're<00:02:04.240> flying<00:02:04.540> into<00:02:04.900> you're<00:02:05.290> not<00:02:05.409> going<00:02:05.590> to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
you're flying into you're not going to

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.560 
you're flying into you're not going to
be<00:02:05.740> able<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:05.979> get<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.220> back<00:02:06.369> so<00:02:06.700> now<00:02:07.420> we're

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
be able to get it back so now we're

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.889 
be able to get it back so now we're
ready<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.900> go<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.080> little<00:02:08.229> bit<00:02:08.470> higher<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:10.600> again

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
ready to go a little bit higher so again

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.420 
ready to go a little bit higher so again
we're<00:02:11.050> just<00:02:11.080> going<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.410> raise<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.890> all<00:02:12.160> up

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
we're just going to raise it all up

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.059 
we're just going to raise it all up
until<00:02:12.819> we<00:02:12.940> get<00:02:13.090> about<00:02:13.450> two<00:02:14.290> or<00:02:14.440> three<00:02:14.709> feet<00:02:14.920> off

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
until we get about two or three feet off

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.390 
until we get about two or three feet off
the<00:02:15.100> ground<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:16.709> actually<00:02:17.709> once<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.100> get<00:02:18.280> up

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
the ground and actually once you get up

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.479 
the ground and actually once you get up
there<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:19.260> easier<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.380> fly<00:02:20.620> then<00:02:21.160> on<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
there it's easier to fly then on the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.890 
there it's easier to fly then on the
ground<00:02:21.760> because<00:02:22.360> there's<00:02:22.540> less<00:02:22.690> turbulence

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
ground because there's less turbulence

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.479 
ground because there's less turbulence
okay<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:25.959> now<00:02:26.320> that<00:02:26.380> you're<00:02:26.709> actually<00:02:26.920> able<00:02:27.250> to

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
okay so now that you're actually able to

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.190 
okay so now that you're actually able to
hover<00:02:27.700> around<00:02:27.940> without<00:02:28.390> drifting<00:02:29.080> into

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
hover around without drifting into

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.740 
hover around without drifting into
anything<00:02:29.670> we<00:02:30.670> can<00:02:30.850> go<00:02:31.060> ahead<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.510> start

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
anything we can go ahead and start

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.720 
anything we can go ahead and start
learning<00:02:32.440> how<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.590> hop<00:02:32.860> around<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.370> basically

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
learning how to hop around so basically

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.340 
learning how to hop around so basically
we're<00:02:37.000> just<00:02:37.030> going<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.300> pick<00:02:37.540> two<00:02:37.810> targets

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
we're just going to pick two targets

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.320 
we're just going to pick two targets
like<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:39.790> spot<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.300> oil<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:41.110> then<00:02:41.739> also<00:02:42.330> over

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
like this spot of oil and then also over

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
like this spot of oil and then also over
here<00:02:43.989> this<00:02:44.560> tire<00:02:44.950> mark<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:46.110> we're<00:02:47.110> just<00:02:47.200> going

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
here this tire mark and we're just going

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.110 
here this tire mark and we're just going
to<00:02:47.470> keep<00:02:47.590> going<00:02:47.800> back<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.160> forth<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.880> try<00:02:49.060> to

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
to keep going back and forth and try to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.540 
to keep going back and forth and try to
land<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.690> target<00:02:50.050> basically<00:02:50.950> what<00:02:51.430> this

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
land on the target basically what this

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.000 
land on the target basically what this
is<00:02:51.610> doing<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:52.330> it's<00:02:52.780> improving<00:02:53.319> in

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
is doing is it's improving in

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.059 
is doing is it's improving in
maneuvering<00:02:54.580> skills<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.470> also<00:02:56.470> your<00:02:56.680> landing

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
maneuvering skills and also your landing

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.370 
maneuvering skills and also your landing
skills<00:02:57.870> now<00:02:58.870> we're<00:02:59.049> going<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.200> learn

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
skills now we're going to learn

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.240 
skills now we're going to learn
orientation<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:02.200> do<00:03:02.320> this<00:03:02.500> first<00:03:02.920> we're<00:03:03.130> going

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
orientation to do this first we're going

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.039 
orientation to do this first we're going
to<00:03:03.310> rotate<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.880> quad<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.510> ten<00:03:04.810> o'clock

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
to rotate the quad to the ten o'clock

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.930 
to rotate the quad to the ten o'clock
position<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.890> then<00:03:06.489> we're<00:03:06.640> just<00:03:06.670> going<00:03:06.880> to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
position and then we're just going to

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.520 
position and then we're just going to
try<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.180> hover<00:03:07.450> therefore<00:03:07.989> as<00:03:08.079> long<00:03:08.140> as<00:03:08.410> you

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
try to hover therefore as long as you

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.880 
try to hover therefore as long as you
can

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.260 

and<00:03:13.400> then<00:03:13.520> we're<00:03:13.640> going<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.790> be<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.030> same

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
and then we're going to be the same

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:25.050 
and then we're going to be the same
thing<00:03:14.600> for<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.990> two<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.290> box<00:03:15.560> position

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.420 

now<00:03:25.630> we<00:03:25.690> can<00:03:25.959> move<00:03:26.110> all<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.650> way<00:03:26.709> over<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.190> nine

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
now we can move all the way over to nine

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.250 
now we can move all the way over to nine
and<00:03:28.180> although<00:03:28.390> it<00:03:28.569> doesn't<00:03:28.720> really<00:03:28.959> seem<00:03:29.230> like

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
and although it doesn't really seem like

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.809 
and although it doesn't really seem like
it<00:03:29.500> it's<00:03:29.830> a<00:03:29.950> lot<00:03:30.160> harder<00:03:30.430> than<00:03:30.610> ten

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.460 

you

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.200 

and<00:03:38.920> then<00:03:39.100> we're<00:03:39.250> also<00:03:39.430> going<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.790> do<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:40.000> same

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
and then we're also going to do the same

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.390 
and then we're also going to do the same
thing<00:03:40.540> obviously<00:03:40.750> for<00:03:41.470> three

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.250 

so<00:03:47.180> now<00:03:47.330> we're<00:03:47.450> going<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.599> do<00:03:47.840> what's<00:03:48.170> called

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
so now we're going to do what's called

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.009 
so now we're going to do what's called
nose<00:03:48.769> in<00:03:49.129> hovering<00:03:49.670> so<00:03:50.450> we're<00:03:50.569> going<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.750> pick

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
nose in hovering so we're going to pick

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.410 
nose in hovering so we're going to pick
the<00:03:51.140> quad<00:03:51.409> up<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:51.879> rotate<00:03:52.879> it<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.180> it's

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
the quad up and rotate it so that it's

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.589 
the quad up and rotate it so that it's
facing<00:03:53.629> towards<00:03:54.319> us<00:03:54.519> so<00:03:55.519> now<00:03:55.730> right<00:03:56.090> we'll<00:03:56.420> be

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
facing towards us so now right we'll be

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.789 
facing towards us so now right we'll be
left<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.489> backwards<00:03:58.489> will<00:03:58.730> be<00:03:58.849> forwards<00:03:59.799> so

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
left and backwards will be forwards so

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.050 
left and backwards will be forwards so
this<00:04:00.950> is<00:04:01.069> probably<00:04:01.280> going<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.459> be<00:04:01.549> extremely

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
this is probably going to be extremely

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.819 
this is probably going to be extremely
hard<00:04:02.390> at<00:04:02.569> first<00:04:02.750> but<00:04:02.989> one<00:04:03.200> way<00:04:03.379> to<00:04:03.440> think<00:04:03.680> about

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
hard at first but one way to think about

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.009 
hard at first but one way to think about
it<00:04:04.129> is<00:04:04.579> it's<00:04:04.760> kind<00:04:04.849> of<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:05.299> balancing<00:04:05.930> a

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
it is it's kind of like balancing a

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.740 
it is it's kind of like balancing a
stick<00:04:06.379> whichever<00:04:07.280> way<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.670> stick<00:04:07.970> is<00:04:08.150> falling

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
stick whichever way the stick is falling

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.449 
stick whichever way the stick is falling
that's<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.440> direction<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:10.040> your<00:04:10.190> hand

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
that's the direction that your hand

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.759 
that's the direction that your hand
needs<00:04:10.670> to<00:04:10.760> go<00:04:11.000> in<00:04:11.750> order<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.290> balance<00:04:12.530> the

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
needs to go in order to balance the

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.160 
needs to go in order to balance the
stick<00:04:13.159> directly<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:14.360> again<00:04:14.750> if<00:04:14.959> you're

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
stick directly and again if you're

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.870 
stick directly and again if you're
drifting<00:04:15.379> into<00:04:15.769> something<00:04:16.190> just<00:04:16.579> pick<00:04:16.760> the

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
drifting into something just pick the

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.460 
drifting into something just pick the
copter<00:04:17.269> up<00:04:17.419> and<00:04:17.600> put<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.870> back<00:04:17.989> where<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.290> needs

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
copter up and put it back where it needs

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.680 
copter up and put it back where it needs
to<00:04:18.560> go<00:04:18.789> so<00:04:19.789> now<00:04:19.940> it's<00:04:20.120> time<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.419> go<00:04:20.539> a<00:04:20.570> little

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
to go so now it's time to go a little

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.439 
to go so now it's time to go a little
bit<00:04:20.930> higher<00:04:21.109> again<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:22.060> just<00:04:23.060> like<00:04:23.240> before

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
bit higher again and just like before

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.590 
bit higher again and just like before
once<00:04:24.440> you<00:04:24.590> get<00:04:24.740> just<00:04:25.460> three<00:04:26.150> feet<00:04:26.419> off<00:04:26.570> the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
once you get just three feet off the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.860 
once you get just three feet off the
ground<00:04:27.880> everything<00:04:28.880> becomes<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.419> lot<00:04:29.660> of<00:04:29.810> you

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
ground everything becomes a lot of you

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.150 
ground everything becomes a lot of you
here<00:04:32.199> now<00:04:33.199> we're<00:04:33.350> going<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.500> be<00:04:33.650> hopping<00:04:34.070> to

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
here now we're going to be hopping to

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.570 
here now we're going to be hopping to
different<00:04:34.520> targets<00:04:34.940> again<00:04:35.979> now<00:04:36.979> this<00:04:37.460> is

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
different targets again now this is

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.150 
different targets again now this is
going<00:04:37.699> to<00:04:37.789> be<00:04:37.910> extremely<00:04:38.479> hard<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:39.160> even

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
going to be extremely hard and even

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.189 
going to be extremely hard and even
people<00:04:40.340> who<00:04:40.669> aren't<00:04:40.940> beginners<00:04:41.419> are<00:04:41.900> going<00:04:42.110> to

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
people who aren't beginners are going to

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.379 
people who aren't beginners are going to
have<00:04:42.350> a<00:04:42.620> hard<00:04:42.860> time<00:04:43.039> doing<00:04:43.340> this<00:04:43.610> so<00:04:43.910> just<00:04:44.210> take

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
have a hard time doing this so just take

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:56.690 
have a hard time doing this so just take
your<00:04:44.539> time

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.700 

so<00:04:57.700> now<00:04:57.820> you're<00:04:58.000> almost<00:04:58.210> there<00:04:58.720> really<00:04:59.560> all

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
so now you're almost there really all

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.010 
so now you're almost there really all
you<00:04:59.860> need<00:04:59.890> to<00:05:00.010> work<00:05:00.160> on<00:05:00.370> now<00:05:00.580> is<00:05:00.880> your<00:05:01.300> sevens

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
you need to work on now is your sevens

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.400 
you need to work on now is your sevens
and<00:05:03.010> then<00:05:03.220> your<00:05:03.400> five<00:05:03.670> and<00:05:04.600> then<00:05:04.960> everything

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
and then your five and then everything

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.990 
and then your five and then everything
else<00:05:05.590> in<00:05:05.770> between<00:05:05.890> will<00:05:06.310> pretty<00:05:06.520> much<00:05:06.730> just

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
else in between will pretty much just

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.500 
else in between will pretty much just
feeling<00:05:08.130> flying<00:05:09.130> a<00:05:09.250> quadcopter<00:05:09.940> is<00:05:10.030> not<00:05:10.240> easy

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
feeling flying a quadcopter is not easy

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.720 
feeling flying a quadcopter is not easy
but<00:05:10.990> as<00:05:11.080> long<00:05:11.290> as<00:05:11.470> you<00:05:11.620> practice<00:05:11.890> on<00:05:12.400> the

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
but as long as you practice on the

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.190 
but as long as you practice on the
maneuvers<00:05:13.120> that<00:05:13.300> you're<00:05:13.450> not<00:05:13.660> good<00:05:13.900> at<00:05:13.930> and

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
maneuvers that you're not good at and

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.470 
maneuvers that you're not good at and
you<00:05:14.530> keep<00:05:14.740> doing<00:05:15.070> that<00:05:15.220> every<00:05:15.280> day<00:05:15.760> you'll<00:05:16.300> be

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
you keep doing that every day you'll be

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.070 
you keep doing that every day you'll be
a<00:05:16.510> lot<00:05:16.780> better<00:05:16.960> at<00:05:17.170> flying<00:05:17.410> in<00:05:17.680> no<00:05:17.830> time
