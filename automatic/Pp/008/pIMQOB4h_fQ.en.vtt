have to learn to let some things go I

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.029 
have to learn to let some things go I
think<00:05:16.129> me<00:05:16.249> and<00:05:16.489> you<00:05:16.729> win<00:05:17.119> with<00:05:17.299> that<00:05:17.389> strategy

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
think me and you win with that strategy

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.609 
think me and you win with that strategy
especially<00:05:19.039> because<00:05:19.999> if<00:05:20.419> it<00:05:20.719> is<00:05:21.229> in<00:05:21.409> line<00:05:21.589> with

00:05:21.609 --> 00:05:21.619 
especially because if it is in line with

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:23.350 
especially because if it is in line with
some<00:05:21.889> of<00:05:22.039> my<00:05:22.159> earlier<00:05:22.489> tips<00:05:22.819> in<00:05:23.029> terms<00:05:23.239> of

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
some of my earlier tips in terms of

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.950 
some of my earlier tips in terms of
influencing<00:05:23.629> people

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.680 

how<00:05:28.380> does<00:05:28.560> someone<00:05:28.770> read<00:05:29.160> your<00:05:29.430> emails<00:05:29.880> now

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
how does someone read your emails now

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.309 
how does someone read your emails now
this<00:05:31.139> is<00:05:31.319> not<00:05:31.520> read<00:05:32.520> every<00:05:32.970> email<00:05:33.000> but<00:05:33.660> when

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
this is not read every email but when

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.170 
this is not read every email but when
you're<00:05:34.500> sending<00:05:34.830> emails<00:05:35.100> to<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.370> VP<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:36.090> the

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
you're sending emails to the VP and the

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.290 
you're sending emails to the VP and the
SVP<00:05:36.539> or<00:05:36.990> directors<00:05:37.590> even<00:05:37.889> you<00:05:38.789> want<00:05:39.030> to<00:05:39.150> make

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
SVP or directors even you want to make

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.360 
SVP or directors even you want to make
sure<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.569> your<00:05:39.870> language<00:05:40.410> is<00:05:40.620> very<00:05:40.650> concise

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
sure that your language is very concise

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.650 
sure that your language is very concise
if<00:05:41.639> there's<00:05:41.819> no<00:05:42.030> room<00:05:42.270> for<00:05:42.509> misinterpretation

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
if there's no room for misinterpretation

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.839 
if there's no room for misinterpretation
I<00:05:43.819> think<00:05:44.819> it's<00:05:44.940> also<00:05:45.240> important<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:46.699> you<00:05:47.699> know

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
I think it's also important to you know

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.020 
I think it's also important to you know
not<00:05:48.060> throw<00:05:48.389> people<00:05:48.630> under<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.020> bus<00:05:49.340> in<00:05:50.340> those

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
not throw people under the bus in those

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.719 
not throw people under the bus in those
sorts<00:05:51.330> of<00:05:51.389> a<00:05:51.479> nice<00:05:51.780> to<00:05:51.990> is<00:05:52.680> very<00:05:53.009> concise<00:05:53.490> if

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
sorts of a nice to is very concise if

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.900 
sorts of a nice to is very concise if
there's<00:05:53.940> no<00:05:54.120> room<00:05:54.389> for<00:05:54.599> misinterpretation<00:05:54.750> I

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
there's no room for misinterpretation I

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.719 
there's no room for misinterpretation I
think<00:05:56.910> it's<00:05:57.060> also<00:05:57.360> important<00:05:58.110> to<00:05:58.370> not<00:05:59.370> throw

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
think it's also important to not throw

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.029 
think it's also important to not throw
people<00:05:59.970> under<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:00.360> bus<00:06:00.449> in<00:06:00.960> those<00:06:01.680> sorts<00:06:01.979> of
