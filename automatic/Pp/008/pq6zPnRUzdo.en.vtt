00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
large dog a small dog actually has less

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.550 
large dog a small dog actually has less
hair<00:00:25.949> follicles<00:00:26.570> second<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.750> want<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.349> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
hair follicles second you want to get a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.320 
hair follicles second you want to get a
long-haired<00:00:29.340> dog<00:00:29.609> now<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.000> sounds

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
long-haired dog now that sounds

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.970 
long-haired dog now that sounds
counterintuitive<00:00:30.750> if<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.560> don't<00:00:31.800> want

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
counterintuitive if you don't want

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.160 
counterintuitive if you don't want
shedding<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.520> believe<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.239> or<00:00:33.329> not<00:00:33.480> long<00:00:33.870> hair

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
shedding but believe it or not long hair

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.840 
shedding but believe it or not long hair
is<00:00:34.260> genetically<00:00:34.710> triggered<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.309> fall<00:00:35.579> out

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
is genetically triggered to fall out

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850 
is genetically triggered to fall out
less<00:00:36.149> often<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.290> got<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> small

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
less often so you got a small

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.709 
less often so you got a small
long-haired<00:00:38.460> dog<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.030> keep<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.420> trimmed

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
long-haired dog and you keep it trimmed

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
long-haired dog and you keep it trimmed
short<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.440> that's<00:00:40.680> gonna<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.190> least

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
short and so that's gonna have the least

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.910 
short and so that's gonna have the least
amount<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.059> hair<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.510> your<00:00:42.899> house<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.620> want<00:00:43.860> to
