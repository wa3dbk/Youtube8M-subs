00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 and hello to all dear friends with you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.900
 mister max 100 psi-9 and in this video I 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.460
 I'll show you how to scrub a portal in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.710
 edge or someone 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:22.980
 call ender world so let's start somewhere 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.730
 we will need a 12 m portal frame and 12 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.930
 ender's eye 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.420
 and so we put them here and such a way 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.060
 way so wait now let me 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.390
 make day 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.390
 3 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.670
 one two Three 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:47.770
 one, two, three, so now we do 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.770
 pit here fossa 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:57.330
 next we need to insert eyes 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.330
 for we insert so that the vase 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.470
 looked in the middle 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.259
 sometimes it's easy to make a portal to the edge 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.259
 sometimes it's hard 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.689
 I think I already have a mistake 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.580
 although no no see all here is our portal 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.580
 at 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.640
 so now damn 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.740
 here is our portal to the edge 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.740
 ready 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.259
 here 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.960
 in such a way he is such that 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:52.030
 chernenky such such sims 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.479
 parla dots and fly here and so we 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.479
 scraper 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:02.780
 ender world but now let's get into it 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:06.470
 let's go natural kill dragons not 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.950
 I will be very sorry for him 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.200
 actually erase almost nothing 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.920
 no ordinary room but we need from here 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.990
 somehow leave 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.650
 somehow up I don't know of course how we 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.580
 get out of here because I don't understand how 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.900
 someone would leave if it were not ender 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.150
 the world would not even imagine because 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.829
 see for yourself 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.829
 to this hole not fianeta 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.700
 here about everything finally i found here 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:50.510
 always we are almost always closed and here 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.489
 here we are here we are all a winder world and here 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:00.349
 we everywhere endermen teleports and 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:02.920
 Wow, ohhh, this is time 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:07.650
 prepared the leaves written off 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.829
 see both no longer want to embarrass 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.680
 I really did not do it, just go 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:18.629
 his scruff oh god tag has never 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:22.590
 there was such a cross oh well and here is our ender 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:25.109
 a dragon who will replenish his 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.470
 liquid or your life or your health 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:31.140
 with these tricks we expect 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.540
 surprise at what and when we come 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.040
 such we climb finally I got 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.829
 oh it's only the first is still much 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.950
 Now Iâ€™ll quickly blow it and see if it was cool 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.950
 but 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.470
 and so here in the first blast in the second 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.140
 fly off 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.540
 and come up and immediately you die so 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.250
 I advise you to take a mod to when 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.340
 you died things were not taken away from you 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.950
 because that is, things did not fall and experience 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.190
 didn't get lost because it would be very 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.910
 very sad if because of one such 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.160
 turrets from one such crap not 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:14.129
 understand this shorter 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:21.489
 we explode sepo yes well, that was such 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:23.889
 you can say and have ander world here from 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.410
 him we will never get out of now 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.090
 he can only get out if we 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.310
 will die 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.229
 or only if we kill the ender dragon well 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.810
