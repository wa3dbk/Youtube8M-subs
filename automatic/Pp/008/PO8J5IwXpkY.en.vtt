00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.300
 let's proceed to apply the inflation of the fans that has just gone 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.289
 one of his patria sponsors not 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.199
 it's the culin 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.700
 it's very ugly 220 bp i exclude 2 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.400
 12 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.519
 0 1 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.699
 per cent the hard one we explain first difference between both 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.279
 the suicide 120 pesos 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.660
 is the one with pwm 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.190
 while the epp buick 2 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.020
 12 0 1 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.230
 does not have 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.420
 otherwise or 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.890
 exactly the same 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.300
 for the jagged democracy of such form one by the front and another by the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.780
 back so you can see that the back are all the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.000
 characteristics features peter a and in the front 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.780
 the fan 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.070
 Through the window 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.070
 ken we come to madrid and the first thing we find 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.180
 the screws 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.180
 the antivibration system 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.830
 the fan 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.490
 the suicide 120 pesos the pwm cable since it is the only one that brings said system 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.670
 the 12 0 1 does not bring it therefore does not bring cable 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.770
 saints now 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.160
 the fan 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.940
 to see it and without proceeding with the installation 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.910
 and as you can see 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.750
 nevertheless striking 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.750
 yellow ochillo 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.090
 what we are going to do more until the time to quote the order 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.070
 the side of a chassis is worth 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.410
 in this case 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.390
 let's work with the side of the housing ficg num 2 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.549
 that did not happen 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:50.740
 in his day 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.740
 biomax than in the manufacturer 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.100
 precedes mojama 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.520
 I will turn around and as you can see 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.919
 we already have world put so that you see how it is but now 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.520
 what we are going to do is put another one so that you can see that 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.859
 as easy as putting 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:12.769
 Match doloow holes in the chassis with the fan 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.749
 we put it and once 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:20.569
 well then that we turn around holding it so that it does not move 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.999
 site and now we proceed 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.149
 a thousand billion actor 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.229
 so that it stays fixed 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:30.889
 like you and seeing another one we already put it 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.119
 except one screw 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:38.350
 So, from there, how easy would be the installation that is like 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.989
 put the tormillo defending that it already comes in the b in the fan case 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.009
 and screw it 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.799
 In this way it is already a day 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.039
 set 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.039
 the fan and you should not do anything else 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.649
 However 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:59.029
 to act as the world's fan skin when the cable starts 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.209
 that leads to the fan itself 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.219
 our motherboard 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.709
 in this case we have taken a 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.779
 that is not what we have done with debt since with what we have done 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:11.979
 rediu and ela test 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:12.879
 m6 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:13.569
 p 6 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.289
 n the Latin clip and although he did not give it 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.659
 m yes you will remember 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.529
 I liked him now he is moving 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:23.319
 where 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.290
 have to go 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.549
 the fan cable 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.029
 and the only thing we have to do 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.459
 it's correct 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.639
 I placated 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.249
 the fans 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.799
 the Swiss 12 0 1 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.459
 however for the 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.479
 the story 120 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.110
 we advise 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.819
 do it and using wm cables 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.189
 It's worth it if you have this system 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.639
 It is advisable to use it 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.639
 and it's an easy how to catch the cable 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:59.290
 and on the side that we are designing today to connect 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.499
 the fan cable 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:02.619
 adapter 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:04.359
 and the adapter 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.459
 at the same time 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.479
 to the plate 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.479
 It's as easy as that 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.300
 and it would be left of him 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.300
 said form 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.029
 comment also 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.400
 what 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.320
 as any entity or can be put as a guest from there as much as 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.699
 air extractors 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.169
 and with all this 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.259
 hope you liked it 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:34.839
 a greeting
