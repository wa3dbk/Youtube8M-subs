00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.660
 Talking people on the car has gone up 0 2 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.189
 All right, guys, and today I'm 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:26.930
 here for a neighbor to show a 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:26.930
 My new acquisition is not this here with 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.669
 a little paper 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:51.360
 even if I do not know how to speak I do not know 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.149
 which one is right to pronounce 615 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.539
 gallery she is a very very good friend 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.340
 It's really not best of course it's 920 is 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.920
 better than I think 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:13.560
 I'm not sure but only what 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:21.990
 it comes in very close to the 920 very good 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:24.000
 and I bought in bacon on ebay for 39 was 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.299
 so dear Fred was salesmen then everything 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.170
 He gave around $ 50 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.930
 I've always been so expensive already other animals 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.520
 each is about 12 years old 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.930
 so I bought this one 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.970
 mainly because of a 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.310
 characteristic of it is different from 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:50.840
 others below it that had that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:56.420
 also for those who do not know that after 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.420
 change your focus is in front for example 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.090
 For there to be no focus does not help by 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.240
 That you can not read anything here. 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.240
 O 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.000
 It's basically for this and I understood 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.340
 very safe people only know how to buy with 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.470
 the consumer who is right and I go 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.370
 Thus it came to show see if peck 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:38.340
 each 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:44.250
 I did it so it turns here on the fifth day. 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:55.380
 this opening can stand upright and 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:03:13.040
 also the computer can put too much 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:13.040
 right here too 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.100
 so they put a more 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.940
 quoted 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:39.150
 she had everything cool and that she still 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:39.780
 has the support of ipec ó in any 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.880
 place 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.109
 This will help a lot because I'm going to have 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.900
 to hold with one hand to do with 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.639
 another I made my phone plus 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.760
 a much better camera 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:59.010
 so I'm going to pass on to her this one 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:04.530
 image here actually I think the 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:08.340
 difference not realizing that it will have 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.680
 a much better image quality beyond 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.680
 also have the built-in microphone here 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.859
 inside is very good and very good and 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.209
 can help some light something 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.209
 so the video 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:28.530
 We are already here in the camera image. 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.409
 the fifth table here in lighting does not give 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.909
 You only see that I left both 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.689
 things here to do the tests for 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.099
 you 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.689
 the first thing I'm going to put here 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.610
 You're seeing here, it's very clear. 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:40.919
 very good picture table she's up to 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.210
 giving shock yes because she wants to focus 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.889
 exactly why 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.870
 so we'll put it in the front 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.789
 I need to see how the camera focuses 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.189
 You have already seen that when I put a 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.189
 image came right in front of her so 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:55.050
 she will focus on the featured image 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:57.419
 or you can see in my arm 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.340
 left what he is totally 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.020
 blurry can not even see the hairs 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.120
 of the right arms we approve of good 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.490
 black people but here it is already more 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.840
 close that is very focused and I go 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:13.759
 away that got a little 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.830
 Only in a moment it will focus 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:22.919
 received a move or 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:30.949
 will make people put our hand 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:30.949
 today that the agent controls xbox 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:46.919
 study now understands everything of everything 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:49.589
 I put it there was something focused 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:55.610
 she's going to focus she focused this part 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:55.610
 from a distance it seems that all this put 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:07.349
 again for you a little bit of how 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.339
 focus on 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:15.199
 I'll auto-focus and and change 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.199
 the focus is very focused 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:25.169
 I just want it this way then 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.250
 It looks really good. 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:35.009
 and here again because otherwise we will 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:37.169
 stay here beauty and we're going to film 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.650
 here now our things much easier 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.850
 two-handed back 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.540
 I can put a file had a good 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.740
 time here, your potato has touched books more 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.020
