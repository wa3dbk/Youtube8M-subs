just unsanitary when you're like kind of

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.060 
just unsanitary when you're like kind of
pouring<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.750> out<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.290> then<00:02:19.320> I<00:02:19.470> get<00:02:19.680> too<00:02:19.890> much

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
pouring it out and then I get too much

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.310 
pouring it out and then I get too much

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
and I have to put some back I I'm the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.690 
and I have to put some back I I'm the
only<00:02:22.440> one<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.770> uses<00:02:22.920> its<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.430> don't<00:02:23.610> really

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
only one that uses its I don't really

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.880 
only one that uses its I don't really
care<00:02:24.000> but<00:02:24.240> if<00:02:24.540> anybody<00:02:25.110> else<00:02:25.290> were<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.590> use

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
care but if anybody else were to use

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.820 
care but if anybody else were to use
it's<00:02:26.130> just<00:02:26.490> not<00:02:26.700> sanitary<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.110> really<00:02:28.620> like

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
it's just not sanitary so I really like

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.949 
it's just not sanitary so I really like
the<00:02:28.980> pump<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.550> if<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.240> were<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.540> ever<00:02:30.660> buy

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
the pump and if I were to ever buy

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.990 
the pump and if I were to ever buy
another<00:02:31.410> one<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.860> would<00:02:32.040> definitely<00:02:32.250> keep<00:02:32.790> this

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
another one I would definitely keep this

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.479 
another one I would definitely keep this
pump<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.660> just<00:02:33.840> by<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.050> one<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.680> doesn't

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
pump and just by the one that doesn't

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.600 
pump and just by the one that doesn't
have<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.730> pumps<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.390> it's<00:02:36.590> cheaper<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.860> think

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
have the pumps that it's cheaper I think

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.240 
have the pumps that it's cheaper I think
at<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.910> Clinique<00:02:39.300> counter<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:40.110> not<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.709> 25

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
at the Clinique counter it's not just 25

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.120 
at the Clinique counter it's not just 25
cents<00:02:41.670> more<00:02:42.300> it's<00:02:42.660> actually<00:02:43.170> maybe<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.560> few<00:02:43.860> I

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
cents more it's actually maybe a few I

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.220 
cents more it's actually maybe a few I
think<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.489> couple<00:02:44.520> dollars<00:02:45.030> or<00:02:45.360> something<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.200> I

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
think a couple dollars or something so I

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.250

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
was just nothing that I would be able to

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.269 
was just nothing that I would be able to
wear<00:06:37.029> so<00:06:37.479> I<00:06:37.509> saw<00:06:37.869> that<00:06:38.139> and<00:06:38.409> i<00:06:38.499> swatched<00:06:38.860> and<00:06:39.159> I

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:39.279 
wear so I saw that and i swatched and I

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.089 
wear so I saw that and i swatched and I
really<00:06:39.549> really<00:06:39.849> liked<00:06:40.089> it<00:06:40.299> I<00:06:40.509> did<00:06:41.379> see<00:06:41.679> a<00:06:41.709> lot

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:42.099 
really really liked it I did see a lot

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:46.350 
really really liked it I did see a lot
of<00:06:42.129> Bobby<00:06:42.489> Brown<00:06:42.909> like<00:06:44.309> highlights<00:06:45.309> I<00:06:45.639> think

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
of Bobby Brown like highlights I think

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.769 
of Bobby Brown like highlights I think
it's<00:06:46.479> the<00:06:46.569> four<00:06:46.989> brick<00:06:47.289> one<00:06:47.709> where<00:06:48.099> it's<00:06:48.249> like

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:48.779 
it's the four brick one where it's like

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:51.569 
it's the four brick one where it's like
probably<00:06:49.779> four<00:06:50.049> shades<00:06:50.349> of<00:06:50.589> pink<00:06:50.799> and<00:06:51.099> i

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:51.579 
probably four shades of pink and i

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:53.909 
probably four shades of pink and i
swatched<00:06:52.089> those<00:06:52.479> those<00:06:52.839> are<00:06:52.869> so<00:06:53.559> finely

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
swatched those those are so finely

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.339 
swatched those those are so finely
milled<00:06:54.339> and<00:06:54.579> the<00:06:55.269> shimmer<00:06:55.539> and<00:06:55.659> there<00:06:55.899> is<00:06:56.019> just

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:56.349 
milled and the shimmer and there is just

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.109 
milled and the shimmer and there is just
perfect<00:06:56.799> for<00:06:56.949> highlighting<00:06:57.399> but<00:06:57.729> it<00:06:57.939> was

00:06:58.109 --> 00:06:58.119 
perfect for highlighting but it was

00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:59.999 
perfect for highlighting but it was
thirty<00:06:58.419> dollars<00:06:58.929> and<00:06:59.199> I<00:06:59.259> really<00:06:59.589> didn't<00:06:59.860> want
