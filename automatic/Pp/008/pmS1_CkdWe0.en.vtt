00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.990
 Hello, I collect furniture 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.450
 I use fasteners with 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.960
 hole diameter 4 and 4 and a half 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.490
 millimeter whether plastic corners 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.449
 either metal and in order to 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.689
 screw the screws 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.170
 exactly along the hole axis so that there is no 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.779
 offsets to one of the walls 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:33.690
 I use this centering 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.770
 drill idea I took in my opinion in some kind 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.340
 american magazine 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.200
 but about incarnation completely mine it 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.010
 centering drill has a guide 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.329
 bushing which is spring loaded and that's it 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.340
 Here's the way in that cone put 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.770
 chamfer 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.770
 corner hole and when i click on 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.760
 screwdriver starting to drill 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.900
 drill advancing drill exactly in the center 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:19.340
 holes this happens next 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:19.340
 the way i take the same angle from 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:30.470
 I install it in my place and then 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:33.470
 just resting the sleeve and into the hole 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.470
 drill 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:56.580
 drilled channels need to happen 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:59.520
 sawdust especially this fixture 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:17.580
 indispensable when installing counter strips 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:21.260
 loops and now only remains 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.260
 secure it all with screws 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:58.610
 Now in this way as seen in the displacement 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:03:01.070
 I don't have a fixture completely 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.570
 homemade used in it drill 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.940
 with a diameter of 17 millimeter inside there 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.630
 spring 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.840
 movable sleeve stationary and myself 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:22.390
 fixture body which is inserted 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.390
 into the sleeve and with the help of two screws on 4 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.590
 which clamp the drill 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.890
 allowing you to adjust the drill reach 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.350
 relative to the movable sleeve with 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.770
 of these screws this design is assembled into 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.650
 a bunch 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.519
 u have such a simple fixture on this 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.080
 Thank you all for your attention
