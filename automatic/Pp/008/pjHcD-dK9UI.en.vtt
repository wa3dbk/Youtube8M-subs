00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
over again like three times it will do a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.540 
over again like three times it will do a
normal<00:00:48.960> wash<00:00:49.289> without<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> resistance<00:00:49.890> for

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
for a little load I might do a little

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.890 
for a little load I might do a little
bit<00:01:18.210> more<00:01:18.360> than<00:01:18.510> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
after the spin dry cycle they're

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.080 
after the spin dry cycle they're
basically<00:03:14.110> dry<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.470> took<00:03:14.890> maybe<00:03:15.160> four<00:03:15.820> or<00:03:15.910> five

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090

hours to dry them and it cleaned them

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.610 
hours to dry them and it cleaned them
great<00:03:19.600> like<00:03:19.810> they<00:03:19.930> were<00:03:19.990> covered<00:03:20.470> and

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
absolutely filth and it had no problem

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.240 
absolutely filth and it had no problem
seeing<00:03:22.900> them<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.470> because<00:03:23.740> they<00:03:23.860> only<00:03:24.010> had

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
seeing them and because they only had

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.280 
seeing them and because they only had
like<00:03:24.400> half<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.850> load<00:03:25.030> we<00:03:25.330> just<00:03:25.660> had<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.960> use<00:03:26.080> the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
like half a load we just had to use the

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.900 
like half a load we just had to use the
medium<00:03:26.680> wash<00:03:26.890> which<00:03:27.190> doesn't<00:03:27.550> use<00:03:27.640> this<00:03:27.760> as

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
medium wash which doesn't use this as

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:35.640 
medium wash which doesn't use this as
much<00:03:28.090> water<00:03:28.330> which<00:03:28.600> is<00:03:28.750> nice

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.640 

the<00:03:36.159> full<00:03:36.459> heavy<00:03:36.940> cycle<00:03:37.510> with<00:03:37.810> or<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.470> full

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
the full heavy cycle with or the full

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.490 
the full heavy cycle with or the full
normal<00:03:38.950> cycle<00:03:39.250> with<00:03:39.370> rinse<00:03:39.580> and<00:03:39.730> spin<00:03:40.500> from

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
normal cycle with rinse and spin from

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.039 
normal cycle with rinse and spin from
start<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:41.890> finish<00:03:41.920> takes<00:03:42.430> about<00:03:42.549> 35<00:03:43.299> to<00:03:43.690> 42

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
start to finish takes about 35 to 42

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.430 
start to finish takes about 35 to 42
minutes<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.799> doesn't<00:03:45.040> take<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.220> long<00:03:45.549> time

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
minutes so it doesn't take a long time

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.930 
minutes so it doesn't take a long time
but<00:03:47.440> like<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.680> said<00:03:47.739> it<00:03:47.950> doesn't<00:03:48.129> dry<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:48.489> spin

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
but like I said it doesn't dry it spin

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:58.430 
but like I said it doesn't dry it spin
some<00:03:49.299> almost<00:03:49.750> dry

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.850 

when<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.130> first<00:03:59.370> got<00:03:59.670> this<00:03:59.880> in<00:04:00.530> be<00:04:01.530> really

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
when we first got this in be really

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.280 
when we first got this in be really
careful<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.250> tighten<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.880> this<00:04:03.630> part<00:04:03.960> really

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
careful to tighten this this part really

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.600 
careful to tighten this this part really
tight

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
tight

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.370 
tight
there's<00:04:05.940> no<00:04:06.090> leaking<00:04:06.480> here<00:04:06.750> as<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:07.020> can<00:04:07.050> see

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
there's no leaking here as you can see

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.900 
there's no leaking here as you can see
but<00:04:07.560> when<00:04:07.710> we<00:04:07.800> first<00:04:08.100> put<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.400> in<00:04:08.520> we<00:04:08.670> didn't

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
but when we first put it in we didn't

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.410 
but when we first put it in we didn't
really<00:04:09.690> like<00:04:09.990> wrench<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:10.710> and<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:12.000> started

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
really like wrench it on and it started

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.540 
really like wrench it on and it started
leaking<00:04:12.600> not<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.320> lot<00:04:13.620> but<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> little<00:04:14.130> bit<00:04:14.370> so

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
leaking not a lot but a little bit so

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.240 
leaking not a lot but a little bit so
make<00:04:14.700> sure<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.210> is<00:04:15.390> really<00:04:15.660> tight<00:04:16.250> and

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
make sure that this is really tight and

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:28.990 
make sure that this is really tight and
there<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.580> go

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.700 

I<00:04:29.030> hope<00:04:29.630> you<00:04:29.750> can<00:04:29.930> hear<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.320> because<00:04:30.500> that's

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
I hope you can hear that because that's

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.020 
I hope you can hear that because that's
about<00:04:30.920> as<00:04:31.070> loud<00:04:31.250> as<00:04:31.430> it<00:04:31.460> gets

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
about as loud as it gets

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.210 
about as loud as it gets
see<00:04:32.780> if<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:32.930> open<00:04:33.290> it<00:04:33.670> it'll<00:04:34.670> stop<00:04:36.010> nose<00:04:37.010> when

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
see if I open it it'll stop nose when

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.460 
see if I open it it'll stop nose when
it's<00:04:37.310> open<00:04:37.640> and<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.300> starts<00:04:38.540> again

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.490 

so<00:04:44.980> that<00:04:45.190> is<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.880> higher<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:47.340> HL<00:04:48.420> p21<00:04:49.420> n<00:04:49.570> right

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
so that is the higher the HL p21 n right

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.580 
so that is the higher the HL p21 n right
here<00:04:52.950> it<00:04:53.950> weighs<00:04:54.160> about<00:04:54.340> 50<00:04:54.850> pounds<00:04:54.880> as<00:04:55.590> you

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
here it weighs about 50 pounds as you

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.620 
here it weighs about 50 pounds as you
can<00:04:56.800> see<00:04:57.070> is<00:04:57.310> lower<00:04:57.580> this<00:04:57.850> is<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:58.060> standard

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
can see is lower this is a standard

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.810 
can see is lower this is a standard
thing<00:04:58.990> top<00:04:59.260> in<00:04:59.440> an<00:04:59.530> apartment<00:05:00.010> so<00:05:00.520> we<00:05:00.670> actually

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
thing top in an apartment so we actually

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.150 
thing top in an apartment so we actually
just<00:05:01.150> fit<00:05:01.390> it<00:05:01.510> over<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.410> side<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.770> think<00:05:03.010> in

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
just fit it over the side to think in

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.150 
just fit it over the side to think in
this<00:05:03.280> little<00:05:03.550> sort<00:05:03.790> of<00:05:03.850> cubby<00:05:04.270> holes<00:05:04.570> here

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
this little sort of cubby holes here

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.940 
this little sort of cubby holes here
it's<00:05:06.160> compact<00:05:06.670> little<00:05:06.850> machine<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:08.770> would

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
it's compact little machine and I would

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.010 
it's compact little machine and I would
highly<00:05:09.400> recommend<00:05:09.430> buying<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.180> if<00:05:10.450> you<00:05:10.780> are
