00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.589
 a greeting to all from the not enough 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.319
 we do a very simple thing as 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.880
 tomorrow nicotine begins weaning 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.690
 and we will also need cheese 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.730
 grated 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:19.619
 I'll show you how to grate the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:23.430
 cheese you use does not like meals I have 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.070
 already covered between the two 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.010
 the two parts of the lid already put the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.869
 piece of transparent film as I have 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.460
 done when I made icing sugar 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.110
 to prevent them from popping out of gods 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.430
 small pieces and here there are about two ounces 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.090
 of cheese already cut into cubes now 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.039
 usually it takes about a minute e 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.899
 middle to do all the work depends on 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.500
 how hard your cheese is mine 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.420
 it is not seasoned simo if you use it anymore 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:03.000
 seasoned you will need a little bit of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:05.719
 extra time at the old about 30 minutes 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.719
 of wrist 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.869
 then it should be enough already 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.030
 but there are shredded as you see 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.520
 still pieces 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.899
 here goes, for example, those nearest 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.340
 the crust a little bit harder here 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.030
 there is another one 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.479
 so now that there aren't that many anymore 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.479
 big pieces 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:02.560
 the value 7 of the programming and it 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.600
 let's work about a minute and if 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.280
 discounted well heard even when I have 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.590
 stopped having small pieces because 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.509
 it really changes the noise it makes 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.510
 the food inside the pot 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:19.680
 while being beaten by the blades and into 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.680
 we move a minute we go 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.760
 finished in my opinion of the noise there is 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.680
 still some breakers but they are really 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.190
 small bits I show it yes 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.330
 says one more piece 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:39.020
 this is right next to the crust 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:41.880
 see darker the rest is 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.620
 completely chopped up too 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:50.640
 chopped now let's go one more 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.360
 po or for such a small piece 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.610
 I would sincerely remove it useless 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.380
 heat all the rest of the cheese if 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.110
 you want me to do it again 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.090
 a 30 seconds to make you feel that 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.650
 when it is also broken if there is 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.390
 he does it because now in the midst of the tide 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.190
 of the rest of the grated cheese 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.850
 it is not certain that the blades will succeed in 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.470
 hit it anyway if you heard it 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.150
 he felt a little banging the 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.239
 lid usually when I'm gone 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.070
 pieces you no longer feel we find before a 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.600
 30 seconds with these are then ve 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.300
 I take it out if I let them hear it 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:33.200
 difference that I make you cook ad 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:33.200
 ear then we see another 30 seconds 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.289
 according to me from the dock there is still a 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:14.699
 at this point, however, here it is 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:17.669
 here in fact I take it off has become the 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.150
 meta and in the meantime, however, according to me 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.159
 work cheese a lot and then 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.389
 it starts to heat up like it did yesterday 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.860
 with sugar when he made me 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.830
 see how to make icing sugar 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.270
 honestly not worth it a 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.960
 overheat all the cheese for 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.909
 this piece here so I do it 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.650
 share a moment but really place 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.560
 how to make you feel that you will no longer have to 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.069
 hear the sound of the flapping of the 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.069
 piece 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.710
 even ten seconds is enough 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.770
 maybe not everyone can perceive 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.810
 that is no longer that taxed 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:10.400
 cake head that felt of the piece that 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:14.300
 went to vote around I wanted to tell you 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.280
 also a trivial thing known that many 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.580
 people are intimidated by this 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.130
 object use it facts let us of the 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.690
 evidence does not bite 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.070
 at most they were careful with the 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.620
 blades because we have already said that 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.200
 cut, however, basic does not bite then 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.050
 you tried I told you a minute and 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.300
 it takes you two minutes because you have a 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:39.669
 nice Parmesan 30 months of seasoning 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:42.169
 which is nice hard it will take two minutes 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.790
 however the cheese is also a consistency 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:45.740
 different heats up differently 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:49.310
 from this that if I remember correctly 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:54.020
 I'm a good 18 months a 20 months so not 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:55.820
 is there for seasoned do you like the 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.950
 fresh cheese makes it in 30 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.950
 seconds or stops after 30 seconds 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.470
 adapt the timing of what you have 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:11.390
 inside the pot and don't follow the 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:12.950
 recipes I go from to ab and c to last night 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.840
 for example I made a cream I did 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.570
 a recipe book cream the recipe book 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.240
 he would cook for 15 minutes after 15 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.760
 minutes it was liquid I gave him others 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.310
 five minutes didn't satisfy me yet 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.850
 after another five minutes it was for me 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.770
 right then always adapt what 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.700
 you are cooking a grandmother's greeting 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.700
 stefania hello hello
