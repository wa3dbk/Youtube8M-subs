00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 I bathe the health of his music lovers 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.240
 who opposes the axé but in wintzenheim 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.240
 czapnik mertian than mike with cerium 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.340
 better people it's times that matter 3 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.750
 1 Thursday I hope you're fine 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.280
 I say we meet for the magazine 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.529
 the exceptional of thiago silva version 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.240
 totti team of the ear with blue card 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.160
 available in the bins since yesterday 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.270
 until tomorrow because tomorrow these are the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.220
 midfielders who are back 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.630
 tomorrow Wednesday obviously yes I stalled 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.490
 in my brazil and deny that it's a 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.050
 blue player will have to beat me the 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.020
 blue thumb record for this video 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.610
 because here it is exceptional it is 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.019
 exceptional there you have the statins 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.640
 are scrolling I invite you 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.890
 to pause to put back 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.780
 since there is a lot of 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.550
 hidden glass of glass almost it's 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.370
 just abused for a central defender 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.809
 to note nevertheless that it is a review 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 of a defender doubt is a lot of 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.140
 defensive phase of recovery phase 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.190
 it's a lot more recovery phase 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.519
 because for me it's 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.040
 really his biggest quality and 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.269
 some offensive actions rare but 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.500
 this is just to tell you to 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.269
 be very, very careful 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.250
 watch well watch when thiago 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.940
 silva has the ball or makes a 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.229
 recovery 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.190
 so it's that if he goes all there is this 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.770
 that can be said of him so as I 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.130
 explained it a pass quality of 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.200
 just outstanding raise I'm not going 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.939
 lie to you I abused the triangle m1 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.149
 with him for the simple reason she 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.590
 got me very long lobed g pass because 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.789
 it's completely tchit with this 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.469
 player I'm not going to lie to you it's 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.789
 shit and you'll see that in seven 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.920
 matches I made 4 assists 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.210
 I did both cases and that 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.070
 this is the first time I have people 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.539
 succeed and and I succeeded 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.729
 we are on a year with this folder must 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.659
 you will see then after I do it again 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.460
 the more you do not worry but it was 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.770
 just really tried to bottom tiago silva 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.960
 I did everything I tried everything and it was 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.729
 market the esaïe cases so quality of 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.100
 go really exceptional frankly 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.960
 me who likes it and on this fifa 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.810
 to restart properly is enough 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.090
 complicated given that low being 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.200
 given the limits forced to bourriner 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.609
 front each time because there is 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.819
 often counter problems like 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:00.069
 that but frankly not really there 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.299
 with him, can you try to 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.189
 put your game directly 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.810
 so after that it's true that you have when 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.859
 even that is complicated in the sense that you 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.569
 have always friend who comes very this is 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.679
 a lot but that's his quality of 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.490
 pass allows you to do stuff 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.050
 really 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.480
 really very very good very very good 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.540
 after in this head game this is it 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.990
 excellent meter 83 that could pose 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.580
 problem in the past there for me there 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.780
 no longer really a problem then 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.440
 it is true that you take anyway 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.210
 goals of the head 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.470
 I put me for what followed the live 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.830
 yesterday because I did a live yesterday 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.620
 evening I took a goal of the head by 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.970
 and frankly the problem is a 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.220
 slider problem more than anything else 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.990
 with one or two seconds compared to 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.580
 low compared to players because that 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.270
 I have trouble selecting thiago 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.550
 silva 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.750
 I still managed to get him 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.250
 take the ball to catch the ball 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.510
 of the head while I had a lot 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.730
 delay is to say how much 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.440
 its relaxing and just awesome so 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.960
 of the head is very good you are you 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.560
 swings it's exceptional after we go 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.380
 still talk about his qualities 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.340
 defensive because that 's a defender 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.630
 so interceptions tackle mud lo 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.730
 that's it it's thiago silva it's like 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.900
 the true ie bah thiago silva 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.080
 it is true that it is a player who tackles 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.330
 who rarely tackles it rarely tackles and 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.910
 balas and that that characterizes even if in 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.630
 tackle slipped a statistic of over 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.680
 95 mud tackle 99 interceptions very 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.000
 big stage by cons I remember 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.400
 more exactly but appeared in the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.050
 90 he has a good vision of the game too 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.700
 it's a little more that made me laugh 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.630
 it's good vision of the game and for the 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.160
 set kicks as you could 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.390
 see then in stats in free kicks he 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.340
 there's really a way to notice blows 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.300
 francs with him and it was not fair 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.370
 to test something 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.170
 he is 85 years of precision of free kicks 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.090
 for 91 punching power 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.410
 so frankly there really is way to 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.750
 there's really a way to score shots 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.610
 francs with after another thing that 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.710
 symbolizes the most this diagnosis owes its 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.820
 re his speed 87 in speed for a 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.390
 central defender it's just the 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.620
 fastest central defender of the game 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.730
 finally in one of the fastest that this 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.370
 would be that there are money advocates to 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.200
 more than 90 speed but 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.299
 here are days we will say that they 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.739
 are not you can not play against 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.360
 fat big players because otherwise you'll 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.519
 to make you cold these guys Czech too 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.319
 do not see any concern so the speed the 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.760
 physical physically that's simple 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.980
 could be problematic the fact that before 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.440
 he's a stat in force good but 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.950
 mean here it goes to over 88 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.170
 in strength 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.370
 frankly the physical is more of a 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.260
 problem for him so there you have a 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.639
 little illustration of the speed and the 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.060
 and rhesus navas who did not arrive at the 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.489
 catch up 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.930
 besides this clip and the following clip 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.580
 it is extremely beer I 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.660
 apologize for the quality but I 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.740
 really wanted to get them back because 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.900
 that it's clip that illustrates is 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.039
 still good speed and I wanted 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.360
 finish with a goal anyway 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.039
 thiago silva I wanted to finish the 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.229
 gameplay with a small goal of thiago 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.430
 silva a goal before center a goal 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.419
 from center-forward I have not scored on 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.910
 corner unfortunately I do not have 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.990
 succeeded each time the heads were 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.860
 either on the guardian on the last in 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.380
 made beautiful parries 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.750
 but here I do not have I do not have 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.979
 scored two goals on a corner 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.930
 but I put on a beautiful dress isolated so 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.060
 thiago silva tocci 20 of 20 august a 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.740
 none - so for those who will say the 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.150
 price in the east - the guys are talking about 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.090
 tocci players so it makes sense that he 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.770
 be expensive and for me frankly he 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.000
 is not expensive in the sense that I 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.280
 I really expected that from the 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.110
 first night the rates of 6 is +2 to 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.150
 plus 2 million limits because that's 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.849
 true that it's huge stats and in 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.000
 price terms here we've touched a 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.470
 20000 million credit I sell the 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.580
 yard sold a little over 800000 so 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.229
 it's to tell you I still 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.789
 lost credits but that I knew 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.919
 I had already said in the live football 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.630
 by stauff credits then saw the most 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.570
 quickly possible and that's what I 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.650
 done but wells fargo silva here I have 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.120
 lost anyway credits but for 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.160
 tell you that an outstanding player to 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.360
 less than a million it's heavy here 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.560
 so after in the more what is that 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.699
 so I put in the most of everything 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.010
 scenario is no longer so the strokes of 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.020
 foot stopped penalty stage album 83 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.830
 free-kicks 85 years accuracy 91 in 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.419
 striking power 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.330
 you can cherish a little room 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.530
 Then ATTANE in the highest 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.240
 jumps because he has a relaxation of 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.750
 sick so vision the little vision of 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.870
 game I talked about it quickly 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.700
 southern limit lives there he has more vision 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.810
 that certain offensive circles is 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.580
 to tell you a little something 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.620
 then in the most I put the speed 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.790
 the ball checks played to talk about 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.080
 but here he is fooling himself 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.540
 just outstanding is really very 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.790
 very right his right physical foot 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.960
 longshot the long shot I have not talked about 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.020
 but there really good through agreements 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.910
 and with already basic the regular 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.200
 jaidee long shot every time I have 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.270
 typed I never put any more with him 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.770
 except on last year on fifa 13 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.690
 May on x 14 I never had but it 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.130
 really does not go away every time and 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.570
 the oil to this one I think there is 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.570
 really mean especially that he took 80 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.130
 tagging he is very very he is very 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.930
 often on the ball carrier 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.630
 aggression very big stats in 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.090
 aggression I head interceptions tackle 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.120
 slipped mud tackle his pass quality 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.470
 which for me is his big at most and 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.150
 finally the hitting power because 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.360
 it written hits very very hard in the 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.250
 ball 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.630
 so that's all for the thiago review 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.510
 silva everything if I hope that this review 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.770
 you were pleased that you liked it 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.000
 if this review has you more like I said 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.740
 you have to see a blue track record 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.300
 blue guy so inches comments 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.100
 share to your friends share to your 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.810
 family before you the chain if not 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.220
 not already done me I tell you to the 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.390
 next and I was taking care of you 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.440
 by everyone 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.150
 oh yes and to note as it is the 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.850
 first time I'm doing a game makes a 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.979
 central defender in review because that 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.390
 they asked me I said I hesitated 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:06.650
 I hesitated but that's as if the rate 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.490
 of 6 here I said I was doing a 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.830
 player by line 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.180
 I said I 'll do it tell me what 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.919
 I could improve for the next 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.380
 because yes I forge defenders 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:16.700
 because even if it's a bit more 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.880
 complicated that it's a bit more 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.200
 purists let's say to watch that rest 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.300
 defenders and it's still interesting 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.070
 anyway for people who 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.600
 wish to buy defenders 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.440
 so that was the end of the game 81st hd 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.450
 I tell you next time and I 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.450
 taking care of you by everyone
