have your gameplay that you just played
so<00:02:31.579> let's<00:02:31.730> see<00:02:31.880> I've<00:02:32.060> any<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.810> my<00:02:32.930> gameplay

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
so let's see I've any of my gameplay

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.600 
so let's see I've any of my gameplay
that<00:02:33.349> I<00:02:33.500> recorded<00:02:34.450> right<00:02:35.450> there<00:02:36.310> all<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.370> this

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
that I recorded right there all of this

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.960 
that I recorded right there all of this
going<00:02:37.880> in<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.920> that's<00:02:40.400> basically<00:02:40.819> how

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
going in and that's basically how

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.809 
going in and that's basically how
flashback<00:02:41.480> recording<00:02:41.959> works<00:02:42.140> when<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.769> do<00:02:42.950> go

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
flashback recording works when you do go

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.170 
flashback recording works when you do go
back<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.239> get<00:02:45.230> your<00:02:45.440> recording<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.610> resets

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
back and get your recording it resets

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.660 
back and get your recording it resets
the<00:02:47.390> timer<00:02:47.660> reset<00:02:48.230> what<00:02:48.980> it's<00:02:49.099> been<00:02:49.250> recording

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
the timer reset what it's been recording

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
the timer reset what it's been recording
so<00:02:49.790> let's<00:02:50.000> say<00:02:50.090> you've<00:02:50.180> been<00:02:50.209> playing<00:02:50.420> for<00:02:50.510> 20

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
so let's say you've been playing for 20

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.690 
so let's say you've been playing for 20
minutes<00:02:51.079> and<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.230> want<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.530> get<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.680> game<00:02:51.920> back

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
minutes and you want to get a game back

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.520 
minutes and you want to get a game back
