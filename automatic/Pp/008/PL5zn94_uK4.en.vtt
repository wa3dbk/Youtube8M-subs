00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:17.440
 and good today in the boxing department 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.029
 we have this sony xperia type type or 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.070
 how do you want to say the language that you 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.590
 you want to say it also known in 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.619
 other parts like the sony tapiocca as well 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.490
 they also knew each other and well then that's the 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.100
 number or the original name is st 21 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.140
 to that as you can find out there 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.480
 in the network or something the guy that the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.880
 manufacturer and all the manufacturers 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.920
 they are changing the name of the product 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.900
 depending where the country or the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.670
 region because there are words that then do not 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.420
 they are good in lakes and us but 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.090
 good xperia type or are we going to have the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.060
 box we go to a boxing quiet without 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.610
 no fright taking care perfectly 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.710
 each of the elements that we have 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.500
 here because then people get upset 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.409
 because I grabbed and made a box in 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:14.230
 common extreme 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:17.110
 equipment manuals angry 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.740
 usb charger cable that should be 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.940
 ecological etcetera etcetera and the equipment 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 the phone is of bed let's say it's 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.400
 camera 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.720
 low not very low but low end is a 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.310
 team that as you can see a little bit 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.170
 chubby 103 mm x 57 and 13 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.960
 millimeters of thickness to 1 centimeter with 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.590
 3 millimeters thick weighs 100 grams 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.880
 and we are going to learn it obviously in what 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.310
 what a pledge we are going to see what he has of the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.590
 lakes connector microusb here has the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.170
 camera does not have flash here has 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.420
 only part of the microphone button to 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.490
 raise and lower the volume that is the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.600
 noise cancellation system that 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.880
 they usually have all the equipment 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.490
 now some years ago 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.929
 there he is learning he had a mica 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.050
 protective that at this moment is the 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.489
 we are going to remove and ready you same there in 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.650
 the screen you do not see it on your screen 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.330
 but I can tell you here that nothing else 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.400
 it has 320 by 420 pixels resolution 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.800
 on a 3.2 inch screen that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.140
 it's because it looks good but does not break 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.960
 no definition and clarity record 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.660
 high definition and the most 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.900
 interesting is that we're going to see what 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.270
 version of the operative has 4.04 to that 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.190
 a sandwich is a phone with finally 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.440
 the last best way almost last 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.570
 operative version and good the 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.220
 most important characteristics are that 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.200
 has a card a slot to put 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.410
 a micro sd up to 32gb comes with 3 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.720
 gb internal storage 512 megs 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.670
 in ram is a phone that works with 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.190
 the network http or with the high network 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.480
 speed of course 3g has wifi 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.000
 has it works as a hotspot for 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.870
 share the internet connection 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.840
 bluetooth 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.209
 if you have 2.1 and you also have other 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.750
 interesting features like 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:23.410
 example the microusb port I never know if 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.940
 is micro micro usb microphones and has 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.870
 a camera 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.590
 now fulfilled 3.15 megapixels no longer 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.860
 it's more than that 3.15 megapixels it takes 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.790
 video emerges at 640 x 480 we already said that 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.890
 has an android 4.0 point 30 swing 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.640
 sandwich and the processor is a qualcomm 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.310
 that runs at 800 megahertz the screen 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.860
 although it works it does not have the sensitivity 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.010
 from other phones because I insist it's a 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.350
 low-end range phone 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.040
 it's okay to be going to put here this 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.130
 I play for good but you will not have a 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.440
 experience like that of a team of 10 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.480
 thousand or 12 thousand pesos and it is that this is 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.290
 totally like anything not if you 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.719
 tea 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.939
 you travel to a plane there and you see there are 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.980
 Cubans of the old comfortable and those who 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.870
 they go back very tight for the lord 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.060
 go ahead for more if you will take them back 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.340
 we paid less but finally he took 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.310
 I took the plane to the same place 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.930
 because this is not about the same for 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.880
 this equipment I can pay less and 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.949
 finally it will serve to navigate to 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.960
 speak by voice and to see my chorus and everything 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:36.620
 but I'm going to pay a little less this 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:41.590
 is the former pirate with hesperia type who already 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.590
 is coming to the stores and well then 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.980
 the pile we're going to see how many miriam 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.980
 Perez is 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:57.250
 thousand five hundred thousand apps in the range 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.960
 reasonable the most powerful we know 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.850
 is the motorola review max with three 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.370
 thousand and a thousand thousand this is half 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.170
 here is the slot for the sim card no 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.600
 it is micro sim because a microsd card 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.910
 to save information made in china 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.130
 Well, it's not made in China now and 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.920
 well this is the xperia thai because 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.050
 we present here in this man zinc today 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.500
 that was not so meta times x sony 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.480
 ericsson some remnants there of those 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.860
 brands that is already the reason and you have to 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.230
 remember who they are and bought me the part 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.240
 of ericsson's business and good deals 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.080
 meet the domino test 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.600
 if it's not pretty graf has a 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.400
 surface and resistant but it is not 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.420
 gorilla glass and I'm seeing that he has 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.380
 FM Radio 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.380
 and point
