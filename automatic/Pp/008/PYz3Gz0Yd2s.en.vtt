00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
many animals to care for someone could

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.979 
many animals to care for someone could
have<00:02:27.640> three<00:02:27.970> snakes<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.510> not<00:02:28.630> have<00:02:28.870> the

ability to take care of those three

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.160 
ability to take care of those three
snakes<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.090> they<00:02:31.390> would<00:02:31.510> be<00:02:31.599> considered<00:02:32.019> a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
snakes and they would be considered a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.410 
snakes and they would be considered a
hoarder<00:02:32.650> or<00:02:32.829> someone<00:02:33.220> could<00:02:33.310> have<00:02:33.459> 30,000

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
hoarder or someone could have 30,000

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.150 
hoarder or someone could have 30,000
snakes<00:02:34.660> but<00:02:34.840> take<00:02:35.110> care<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.470> each<00:02:35.650> one<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:35.980> them

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
snakes but take care of each one of them

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.979 
snakes but take care of each one of them
with<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.670> proper<00:02:37.090> care<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:37.569> they<00:02:37.810> would

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
with the proper care and they would

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.900 
with the proper care and they would
still<00:02:38.260> not<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.530> considered<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.190> hoarder<00:02:39.549> so

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
still not be considered a hoarder so

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.210 
still not be considered a hoarder so
again<00:02:40.209> how<00:02:40.660> many<00:02:40.690> animals<00:02:41.049> I<00:02:41.500> don't<00:02:41.890> know<00:02:41.980> look

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
again how many animals I don't know look

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.890
