00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
edges we'll take a spatula and we'll

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.410 
edges we'll take a spatula and we'll
just<00:01:54.320> push<00:01:54.530> into<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.980> center<00:01:55.400> so<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:56.300> the

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
just push into the center so that the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.600 
just push into the center so that the
raw<00:01:56.600> egg<00:01:56.840> can<00:01:57.350> go<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.650> bottom<00:01:57.800> of<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.130> pan

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.510 
raw egg can go to the bottom of the pan
and<00:01:58.730> we<00:01:59.270> keep<00:01:59.450> doing<00:01:59.510> that<00:02:00.020> as<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:01.100> egg<00:02:01.220> keeps

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
and we keep doing that as the egg keeps

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.640 
and we keep doing that as the egg keeps
cooking<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:02.900> we<00:02:03.050> cook<00:02:03.260> evenly<00:02:05.590> all<00:02:06.590> the

process

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
process

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.949 
process
and<00:03:07.060> we<00:03:08.060> want<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.299> make<00:03:08.450> sure<00:03:08.480> it's<00:03:08.810> not

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
and we want to make sure it's not

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.990 
and we want to make sure it's not
sticking<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:09.950> we<00:03:10.069> give<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.430> little<00:03:10.610> bit<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:10.910> a

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
sticking so we give it a little bit of a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.360 
sticking so we give it a little bit of a
shake<00:03:11.329> we<00:03:12.079> know<00:03:12.230> it's<00:03:12.410> moving<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:13.099> it'll<00:03:13.280> be

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
shake we know it's moving so it'll be

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.940 
shake we know it's moving so it'll be
very<00:03:13.640> easy<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.090> get<00:03:14.299> out<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.599> the<00:03:14.690> pan<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.260> then

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
very easy to get out of the pan and then

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.000 
very easy to get out of the pan and then
it<00:03:16.099> just<00:03:16.250> flips<00:03:16.610> out<00:03:16.819> real<00:03:17.360> easily<00:03:17.829> onto<00:03:18.829> your
