two<00:01:10.799> units<00:01:11.100> are<00:01:11.280> our<00:01:11.549> most<00:01:11.760> popular<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
two units are our most popular and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.630 
two units are our most popular and
they're<00:01:13.439> popular<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:13.979> two<00:01:14.100> reasons

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
they're popular for two reasons

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.270 
they're popular for two reasons
the<00:01:14.939> first<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.540> mentioned<00:01:15.710> this<00:01:16.710> unit<00:01:17.130> is

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the first as I mentioned this unit is

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.240 
the first as I mentioned this unit is
made<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.119> metal<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.750> what<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.860> means<00:01:20.070> is

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
made out of metal so what that means is

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.730 
made out of metal so what that means is
it's<00:01:20.460> heavy<00:01:20.700> enough<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.659> weigh<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.200> down<00:01:22.229> so

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
it's heavy enough to weigh it down so

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.380 
it's heavy enough to weigh it down so
that<00:01:22.770> when<00:01:22.979> you're<00:01:23.100> outside<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:24.060> not<00:01:24.240> going

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that when you're outside it's not going

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.660 
that when you're outside it's not going
to<00:01:24.450> get<00:01:24.570> blown<00:01:24.780> over<00:01:24.960> by<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.259> wind<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.460> at<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
to get blown over by the wind but at the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.520 
to get blown over by the wind but at the
same<00:01:26.850> time<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.390> too<00:01:27.780> heavy<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.350> it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
same time it's not too heavy so that it

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.039 
same time it's not too heavy so that it
becomes<00:01:28.770> difficult<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.250> move<00:01:29.720> there's<00:01:30.720> also<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
becomes difficult to move there's also a

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.170 
becomes difficult to move there's also a
carry<00:01:31.710> handle<00:01:31.799> here<00:01:32.340> where<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.820> makes<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> very

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
carry handle here where it makes it very

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.819 
carry handle here where it makes it very
easy<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.810> pick<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.530> move<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.400> a-frame<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
easy to pick up and move the a-frame and

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.200 
easy to pick up and move the a-frame and
the<00:01:37.829> metal<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.220> also<00:01:38.610> painted<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:39.090> an

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the metal is also painted with an

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.210 
the metal is also painted with an
exterior<00:01:39.570> paint<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> makes<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.710> resistant

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
exterior paint so it makes it resistant

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.889 
exterior paint so it makes it resistant
to<00:01:41.549> rusting<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:44.159> sign<00:01:44.430> face<00:01:44.790> as<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.720> see

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
to rusting the sign face as you can see

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.319 
to rusting the sign face as you can see
here<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.649> slide<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.070> very<00:01:47.399> easily<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.119> it

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
here can slide out very easily and it

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.789 
here can slide out very easily and it
can<00:01:48.450> be<00:01:48.540> replaced<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.079> new<00:01:49.290> sign<00:01:49.530> face

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
can be replaced with a new sign face

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.340 
can be replaced with a new sign face
whenever<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.850> want<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:52.079> makes
