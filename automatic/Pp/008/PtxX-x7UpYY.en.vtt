is a programming
well<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:40.910> just<00:00:40.940> programming<00:00:41.600> but<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:41.960> learn

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
well you just programming but you learn

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.290 
well you just programming but you learn
more<00:00:42.350> than<00:00:42.500> that<00:00:42.680> you<00:00:43.520> will<00:00:43.670> be<00:00:43.820> studying

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
more than that you will be studying

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.500 
more than that you will be studying
subjects<00:00:44.840> related<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.260> network<00:00:45.940> data<00:00:46.940> and

computer engineering um
the<00:00:49.760> others<00:00:50.000> were<00:00:50.120> telling<00:00:50.420> me<00:00:50.449> about<00:00:50.890> systems

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
the others were telling me about systems

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.830 
the others were telling me about systems
and<00:00:52.190> information<00:00:53.000> management<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.750> you're

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
and information management and you're

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.920 
and information management and you're
talking<00:00:53.989> about<00:00:54.170> engineering<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:56.540> difference

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
talking about engineering the difference

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.350 
talking about engineering the difference
is<00:00:57.199> that<00:00:57.229> computer<00:00:58.070> science<00:00:58.489> has<00:00:58.940> greater

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
is that computer science has greater

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.960 
is that computer science has greater
focus<00:00:59.720> on<00:01:00.140> application<00:01:00.769> developed<00:01:01.129> market<00:01:01.550> if

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
focus on application developed market if

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.250 
focus on application developed market if
you<00:01:02.180> have<00:01:02.449> a<00:01:02.659> good<00:01:02.839> experience<00:01:03.140> with<00:01:05.260> software

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
you have a good experience with software

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.500 
you have a good experience with software
you<00:01:06.950> know<00:01:07.159> that<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:07.550> has<00:01:07.729> been<00:01:08.000> developed<00:01:08.420> by

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
you know that it has been developed by

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.090 
you know that it has been developed by
great<00:01:09.350> high<00:01:09.650> skilled<00:01:10.100> computer<00:01:10.510> scientists

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
great high skilled computer scientists

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.620 
great high skilled computer scientists
say<00:01:13.100> for<00:01:13.280> example<00:01:13.790> think<00:01:14.150> about<00:01:14.450> an

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
say for example think about an

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.219 
say for example think about an
application<00:01:15.290> that<00:01:15.530> uses<00:01:15.850> GPS<00:01:16.850> coordinates<00:01:17.540> so

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
application that uses GPS coordinates so

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.830 
application that uses GPS coordinates so
