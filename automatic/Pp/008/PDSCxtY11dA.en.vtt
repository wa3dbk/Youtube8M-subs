00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
and incorporate any idea is to picked up

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.870 
into their own lives in their own
communities<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.739> think<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.370> important<00:03:25.700> thing

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
communities I think the important thing

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.259 
communities I think the important thing
about<00:03:26.260> I'm<00:03:27.260> facing<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.799> challenges<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.580> we

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
about I'm facing the challenges that we

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.080 
about I'm facing the challenges that we
do<00:03:29.450> is<00:03:29.629> the<00:03:30.290> solutions<00:03:30.739> need<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:30.950> be<00:03:31.090> locally

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
do is the solutions need to be locally

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.880 
do is the solutions need to be locally
driven<00:03:32.209> there's<00:03:33.049> no<00:03:33.140> point<00:03:33.380> one<00:03:33.530> person

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
driven there's no point one person

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.229 
driven there's no point one person
coming<00:03:34.130> up<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.340> said<00:03:34.459> I've<00:03:34.580> got<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.880> solution

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
coming up and said I've got the solution

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.180 
coming up and said I've got the solution
for<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.480> world<00:03:35.690> because<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.650> world's<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:36.980> huge

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
for the world because the world's a huge

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.759 
for the world because the world's a huge
mix<00:03:37.370> of<00:03:37.549> cultures<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.150> religions<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.870> ideas

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
mix of cultures and religions and ideas

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.069 
mix of cultures and religions and ideas
and<00:03:40.040> stories<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:41.420> so<00:03:41.569> I<00:03:41.599> think<00:03:41.720> it's<00:03:41.900> by

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
and stories and so I think it's by

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.979 
and stories and so I think it's by
giving<00:03:43.069> people<00:03:43.220> ideas<00:03:43.810> questioning<00:03:44.810> things

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
giving people ideas questioning things

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.180 
giving people ideas questioning things
and<00:03:45.260> letting<00:03:45.380> when<00:03:45.530> people<00:03:45.769> come<00:03:45.950> up<00:03:46.010> with

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
and letting when people come up with

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.220 
and letting when people come up with
solutions<00:03:46.819> that<00:03:46.880> meet<00:03:47.540> their<00:03:47.720> needs<00:03:47.959> and

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
solutions that meet their needs and

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.920 
solutions that meet their needs and
where<00:03:49.040> they<00:03:49.130> live

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.869 

you'll<00:03:52.560> have<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.890> completely<00:03:53.250> moneyness<00:03:53.700> I

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
you'll have to completely moneyness I

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.280 
you'll have to completely moneyness I
think<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.269> know<00:03:54.390> it<00:03:54.510> my<00:03:54.870> deal<00:03:55.079> were

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
think you know it my deal were

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.380 
think you know it my deal were
definitely<00:03:55.879> but<00:03:56.879> I<00:03:56.939> think<00:03:57.150> it's<00:03:57.299> very

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
definitely but I think it's very

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.619 
definitely but I think it's very
transition<00:03:57.930> so<00:03:58.739> each<00:03:59.519> person<00:03:59.849> situation<00:04:00.540> is

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
transition so each person situation is

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.839 
transition so each person situation is
different<00:04:01.019> you<00:04:01.200> know<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.319> family<00:04:01.650> for<00:04:02.099> and

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
different you know a family for and

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.099 
different you know a family for and
can't<00:04:03.209> live<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.510> way<00:04:03.540> I'm<00:04:03.689> living<00:04:03.810> right<00:04:03.989> now

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
can't live the way I'm living right now

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.779 

I<00:04:43.610> began<00:04:44.180> this<00:04:44.599> in<00:04:44.810> November<00:04:45.169> 2008<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.099> the

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
I began this in November 2008 and the

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.330 
I began this in November 2008 and the
first<00:04:47.030> few<00:04:47.270> months<00:04:47.360> were<00:04:47.629> quite<00:04:47.960> difficult

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
first few months were quite difficult

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.469 
first few months were quite difficult
I'd<00:04:49.340> establish<00:04:49.879> a<00:04:49.940> whole<00:04:50.120> new<00:04:50.270> set<00:04:50.449> of

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
I'd establish a whole new set of

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.339 
I'd establish a whole new set of
routines<00:04:50.810> and<00:04:52.960> everything<00:04:53.960> took<00:04:54.110> much<00:04:54.319> more

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
routines and everything took much more

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.219 
routines and everything took much more
time<00:04:55.360> don't<00:04:56.360> feel<00:04:56.539> up<00:04:56.629> wash<00:04:56.810> my<00:04:56.990> clothes

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
time don't feel up wash my clothes

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.969 
time don't feel up wash my clothes
instead<00:04:57.590> of<00:04:57.710> just<00:04:59.740> stick<00:05:00.740> them<00:05:00.800> in<00:05:00.919> the

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
instead of just stick them in the

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.369 
instead of just stick them in the
machine<00:05:01.280> for<00:05:01.580> you<00:05:01.970> know<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.300> hang<00:05:03.199> off

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
machine for you know and hang off

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:05.020 
machine for you know and hang off
there's<00:05:03.680> something<00:05:03.979> outside<00:05:04.159> to<00:05:04.490> like<00:05:04.639> engage

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
there's something outside to like engage

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.909 
there's something outside to like engage
in<00:05:05.240> a<00:05:05.509> process<00:05:05.930> where<00:05:06.139> I<00:05:06.259> make<00:05:06.440> my<00:05:06.590> own<00:05:06.620> soap

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
in a process where I make my own soap

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.279 
in a process where I make my own soap
first<00:05:07.819> and<00:05:08.090> hand<00:05:08.270> wash<00:05:08.449> them<00:05:08.659> then<00:05:08.930> ring<00:05:09.139> him

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
first and hand wash them then ring him

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:10.270 
first and hand wash them then ring him
to<00:05:09.620> hang<00:05:09.830> him<00:05:09.949> up

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
to hang him up

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.249 
to hang him up
I<00:05:10.310> find<00:05:10.970> that<00:05:11.120> washing<00:05:11.659> clothes<00:05:11.870> could<00:05:12.110> take

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
I find that washing clothes could take

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.559 
I find that washing clothes could take
two<00:05:12.409> and<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.560> half<00:05:12.650> hours<00:05:13.009> sometimes<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:14.240> start

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
two and a half hours sometimes and start

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.490 
two and a half hours sometimes and start
to<00:05:14.659> finish<00:05:14.780> so<00:05:15.880> yeah<00:05:16.880> at<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:17.900> start<00:05:18.169> of<00:05:18.259> felt

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
to finish so yeah at the start of felt

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.409 
to finish so yeah at the start of felt
like<00:05:18.590> God<00:05:19.220> can<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.490> do<00:05:19.610> this<00:05:19.669> for<00:05:19.970> a<00:05:20.000> year<00:05:20.060> and

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
like God can I do this for a year and

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.749 
like God can I do this for a year and
then<00:05:21.229> after<00:05:21.560> about<00:05:21.680> six<00:05:22.039> months<00:05:22.340> it<00:05:22.430> just<00:05:22.460> felt

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
then after about six months it just felt

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.879 
then after about six months it just felt
like<00:05:22.789> the<00:05:22.909> most<00:05:23.030> normal<00:05:23.240> thing<00:05:23.419> today<00:05:23.889> like

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
like the most normal thing today like

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.460 
like the most normal thing today like
it's<00:05:25.069> me<00:05:25.159> a<00:05:25.190> lot<00:05:25.280> of<00:05:25.370> hope<00:05:25.520> for<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:25.789> future<00:05:25.819> and<00:05:26.690> I

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
it's me a lot of hope for a future and I

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.770 
it's me a lot of hope for a future and I
think<00:05:27.770> we<00:05:28.280> are<00:05:28.310> most<00:05:29.090> people<00:05:29.389> are<00:05:29.509> very

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
think we are most people are very

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.249 
think we are most people are very
addicted<00:05:30.319> to<00:05:30.409> what<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:30.979> life<00:05:31.190> today<00:05:31.430> right<00:05:31.699> now

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
addicted to what to life today right now

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.129 
addicted to what to life today right now
but<00:05:33.259> I<00:05:33.620> think<00:05:34.190> one<00:05:35.030> change<00:05:35.360> is<00:05:35.539> necessary<00:05:35.990> we

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
but I think one change is necessary we

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.100 
but I think one change is necessary we
can<00:05:36.169> do<00:05:36.409> it<00:05:36.530> and<00:05:37.419> also<00:05:38.419> short<00:05:38.659> period<00:05:38.900> of<00:05:38.930> time

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
can do it and also short period of time

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.439 
can do it and also short period of time
we<00:05:39.229> can<00:05:39.380> forget<00:05:39.650> that<00:05:39.710> it<00:05:40.130> ever<00:05:40.550> was<00:05:41.090> any<00:05:41.330> way

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
we can forget that it ever was any way

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.659 
we can forget that it ever was any way
different

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.249 

I'm<00:05:45.669> I<00:05:45.969> think<00:05:45.999> there's<00:05:46.389> two<00:05:46.599> ways<00:05:46.809> things

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:47.259 
I'm I think there's two ways things

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.489 
I'm I think there's two ways things
could<00:05:47.499> go<00:05:47.679> I<00:05:47.979> think<00:05:48.879> change<00:05:49.149> is<00:05:49.299> inevitable<00:05:49.539> so

00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:50.499 
could go I think change is inevitable so

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:54.659 
could go I think change is inevitable so
I<00:05:50.529> think<00:05:50.649> we<00:05:50.799> either<00:05:50.919> embrace<00:05:51.369> change<00:05:51.699> and<00:05:53.669> be

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
I think we either embrace change and be

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.729 
I think we either embrace change and be
positive<00:05:55.149> about<00:05:55.209> it<00:05:55.359> I'll<00:05:55.749> actively<00:05:56.139> seek<00:05:56.499> to

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:56.739 
positive about it I'll actively seek to

00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:59.459 
positive about it I'll actively seek to
do<00:05:57.129> things<00:05:57.309> differently<00:05:57.669> I<00:05:57.879> find<00:05:58.869> that<00:05:59.079> if<00:05:59.379> you

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
do things differently I find that if you

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:00.779 
do things differently I find that if you
do<00:05:59.649> that<00:05:59.769> it<00:05:59.979> could<00:06:00.069> be<00:06:00.159> much<00:06:00.309> more<00:06:00.489> enjoyable

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
do that it could be much more enjoyable
