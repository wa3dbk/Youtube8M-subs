feet tall and what I did was I made it

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.680 
feet tall and what I did was I made it
out<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.639> PVC<00:00:08.940> as<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.050> can<00:00:10.230> see<00:00:10.440> here<00:00:11.690> the

out of PVC as you can see here the
camera<00:00:12.929> just<00:00:13.469> there<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.740> go<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:15.260> it's<00:00:16.260> kind<00:00:16.529> of

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
camera just there we go and it's kind of

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.279 
camera just there we go and it's kind of
quarter<00:00:17.400> circles<00:00:17.940> because<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.900> don't<00:00:19.080> want<00:00:19.199> to

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
quarter circles because I don't want to

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.720 
quarter circles because I don't want to
completely<00:00:19.770> 180<00:00:20.279> degree<00:00:20.970> round<00:00:22.609> but<00:00:23.609> what<00:00:23.699> I

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
completely 180 degree round but what I

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.179 
completely 180 degree round but what I
did<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.330> started<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> bottom<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:28.189> and

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
did is I started at the bottom here and

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.359 
did is I started at the bottom here and
made<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> back<00:00:30.390> piece<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.109> then<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.070> front

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
made the back piece and then the front

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.740 
made the back piece and then the front
piece<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:33.390> bet<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.440> thing<00:00:35.120> just<00:00:36.120> using<00:00:36.570> my

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
piece and I bet this thing just using my

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.979 
piece and I bet this thing just using my
foot<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> bending<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> tubes<00:00:38.660> now<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
foot and bending the tubes now for the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.330 
foot and bending the tubes now for the
back<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> did<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.910> put<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> piece<00:00:42.930> of

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
back one what I did was I put a piece of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.729 
back one what I did was I put a piece of
conduit<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.550> there<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.660> rigid<00:00:45.899> so

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
conduit in there so that it's rigid so

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.350 
conduit in there so that it's rigid so
it's<00:00:46.920> PVC<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> outside<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.210> got

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it's PVC on the outside but it's got

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.479 
it's PVC on the outside but it's got
conduit<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> inside<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.500> what<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.649> did<00:00:49.770> was

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
conduit on the inside so what I did was

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.410 
conduit on the inside so what I did was
I<00:00:50.670> put<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.449> there<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.780> then<00:00:51.840> put<00:00:52.050> these

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
I put that in there and then put these

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.580 
I put that in there and then put these
these<00:00:54.420> corners<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:55.489> as<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.670> see<00:00:56.789> I

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
these corners on there as you can see I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.439 
these corners on there as you can see I
bent<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> PVC<00:00:59.280> as<00:00:59.399> best<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.789> could<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.210> Mike

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
bent the PVC as best I could with Mike

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.340 
bent the PVC as best I could with Mike
with<00:01:00.750> my<00:01:00.989> foot<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:02.870> put<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> inside

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
with my foot and then put it inside

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.160 
with my foot and then put it inside
these<00:01:04.530> corners<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.330> let<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.750> sit<00:01:07.140> out

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
these corners and then I let it sit out

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.560 
these corners and then I let it sit out
in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> Sun<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:07.710> two<00:01:08.549> weeks<00:01:08.580> while<00:01:09.060> while

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
in the Sun for two weeks while while

in the Sun for two weeks while while
that<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.140> heat<00:01:10.320> warmed<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.330> did<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
that the heat warmed it up I did the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.100 
that the heat warmed it up I did the
same<00:01:12.689> thing<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.439> one

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
and I did the same thing with the top

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.210 
and I did the same thing with the top
one<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:25.180> you<00:01:25.330> can<00:01:25.510> see<00:01:25.720> there<00:01:25.990> now<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.740> top<00:01:27.040> and

the bottom had the same kind of L balls
on<00:01:29.710> them<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:31.180> one<00:01:31.660> that<00:01:31.810> goes<00:01:31.930> up<00:01:31.960> 90s<00:01:32.680> 90<00:01:33.220> in

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
on them now one that goes up 90s 90 in

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.640 
on them now one that goes up 90s 90 in
two<00:01:33.430> different<00:01:33.580> ways<00:01:33.850> but<00:01:34.750> for<00:01:34.960> this<00:01:35.080> one<00:01:35.320> here

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
two different ways but for this one here

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.770 
two different ways but for this one here
I<00:01:35.680> had<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.070> make<00:01:36.370> something<00:01:36.700> because<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.630> I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
I had to make something because that I

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.610 
I had to make something because that I
couldn't<00:01:38.170> they<00:01:38.680> didn't<00:01:38.980> have<00:01:39.010> a<00:01:39.840> elbow<00:01:40.840> for

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
couldn't they didn't have a elbow for

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.380 
couldn't they didn't have a elbow for
what<00:01:41.800> I<00:01:41.830> needed<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.310> do<00:01:42.490> here<00:01:42.760> which<00:01:42.940> was<00:01:43.180> I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
what I needed to do here which was I

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.890 
what I needed to do here which was I
needed<00:01:43.900> a<00:01:44.020> tee<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.950> but<00:01:45.910> I<00:01:45.940> needed<00:01:46.300> it<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:46.870> come

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
needed a tee and but I needed it to come

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.350 
needed a tee and but I needed it to come
out<00:01:47.080> in<00:01:47.470> a<00:01:47.560> 90<00:01:47.980> like<00:01:48.130> this<00:01:48.340> too<00:01:48.580> so<00:01:49.510> what<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:49.780> did

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
out in a 90 like this too so what I did

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.200 
out in a 90 like this too so what I did
is<00:01:52.410> I<00:01:53.410> bought<00:01:53.650> some<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:53.979> these<00:01:54.220> threaded

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
is I bought some of these threaded

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.170 
is I bought some of these threaded
threaded<00:01:55.870> ends<00:01:56.110> here<00:01:56.950> hopefully<00:01:57.760> you<00:01:57.820> can<00:01:57.940> see

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
threaded ends here hopefully you can see

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.320 
threaded ends here hopefully you can see
that<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.740> light<00:01:59.950> seems<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.430> be<00:02:00.580> not<00:02:00.790> adjusting

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
that the light seems to be not adjusting

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.490 
that the light seems to be not adjusting
very<00:02:01.510> well<00:02:03.780> okay<00:02:04.780> maybe<00:02:05.020> this<00:02:05.260> is<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.410> little

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
very well okay maybe this is a little

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.250 
very well okay maybe this is a little
better<00:02:05.800> angle<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:07.210> what<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.450> did<00:02:07.750> was<00:02:08.020> I<00:02:08.229> took

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
better angle and what I did was I took

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.750 
better angle and what I did was I took
the<00:02:08.560> team<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.640> drilled<00:02:10.060> out<00:02:10.420> one<00:02:10.750> side<00:02:11.760> on

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
the team and I drilled out one side on

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.130 
the team and I drilled out one side on
the<00:02:12.880> on<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.180> other<00:02:13.209> side<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.630> course<00:02:13.810> I

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
the on the other side of course I

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.850 
the on the other side of course I
drilled<00:02:14.740> out<00:02:14.860> one<00:02:15.130> side<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:17.410> then<00:02:17.709> I

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
drilled out one side and and then I

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.390 
drilled out one side and and then I
screwed<00:02:18.340> this<00:02:18.640> into<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.480> team<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:21.100> really

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
screwed this into that team and really

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.780 
screwed this into that team and really
can't<00:02:21.730> see<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.120> you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.699 

okay<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.569> think<00:02:26.689> this<00:02:26.959> angle<00:02:27.349> is<00:02:27.439> getting<00:02:27.680> a

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
okay I think this angle is getting a

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.679 
okay I think this angle is getting a
little<00:02:27.769> bit<00:02:28.069> more<00:02:28.250> better<00:02:28.640> light<00:02:28.849> on<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.569> as

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
little bit more better light on it so as

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.240 
little bit more better light on it so as
you<00:02:29.810> can<00:02:29.900> see<00:02:29.959> I<00:02:30.170> took<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.470> tee<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:30.829> drilled<00:02:31.189> a

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
you can see I took this tee I drilled a

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.490 
you can see I took this tee I drilled a
hole<00:02:31.280> into<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.849> and<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.629> took<00:02:32.689> this<00:02:33.019> threaded

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
hole into it and I took this threaded

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.280 
hole into it and I took this threaded
end<00:02:33.829> on<00:02:34.129> here<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.610> basically<00:02:35.599> screwed<00:02:36.019> it<00:02:36.140> in

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
end on here and basically screwed it in

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.270 
end on here and basically screwed it in
it<00:02:36.799> took<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.760> took<00:02:37.819> some<00:02:38.150> drilling<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.629> used<00:02:38.900> a

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
it took it took some drilling I used a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.949 
it took it took some drilling I used a
3/4<00:02:40.280> inch<00:02:40.310> drill<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.060> then<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.540> had<00:02:41.689> to<00:02:41.780> take<00:02:41.930> a

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
3/4 inch drill and then I had to take a

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.229 
3/4 inch drill and then I had to take a
file<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.560> kind<00:02:42.799> of<00:02:42.890> continue<00:02:43.370> filing<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.090> to

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
file to kind of continue filing it to

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.600 
file to kind of continue filing it to
finally<00:02:44.599> get<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:44.989> there<00:02:45.260> but<00:02:46.099> once<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.400> got

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
finally get it in there but once I got

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.039 
finally get it in there but once I got
it<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:46.879> there<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.239> thread<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:47.690> there<00:02:47.900> it's

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
it in there and thread it in there it's

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.990 
it in there and thread it in there it's
this<00:02:48.409> it's<00:02:48.769> pretty<00:02:48.920> solid<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:49.549> now<00:02:49.700> I'm<00:02:49.879> able

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
this it's pretty solid so now I'm able

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.880 
this it's pretty solid so now I'm able
to<00:02:50.209> get<00:02:50.420> something<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.379> goes<00:02:51.560> straight<00:02:51.829> up

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
to get something that goes straight up

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.319 
to get something that goes straight up
this<00:02:52.370> way<00:02:52.430> this<00:02:53.060> way<00:02:53.269> in<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.810> way<00:02:54.670> now<00:02:55.670> the

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
this way this way in this way now the

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.780 
this way this way in this way now the
angle<00:02:56.989> although<00:02:57.379> unfortunately<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.459> angle

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
angle although unfortunately the angle

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.819 
angle although unfortunately the angle
wasn't<00:02:59.150> quite<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.690> right<00:02:59.810> angle<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.349> kind<00:03:00.709> of

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
wasn't quite the right angle it kind of

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.130 
wasn't quite the right angle it kind of
tilted<00:03:01.489> out<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.670> little<00:03:01.849> bit<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:02.690> end<00:03:03.079> up

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
tilted out a little bit so I end up

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.800 
tilted out a little bit so I end up
having<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.530> heat<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:03.920> PVC<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:04.819> basically<00:03:05.659> what

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
having to heat the PVC so basically what

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.839 
having to heat the PVC so basically what
I<00:03:05.840> did<00:03:05.900> is<00:03:06.079> I<00:03:06.230> just<00:03:06.260> took<00:03:06.409> a<00:03:06.530> piece<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.459> conduit

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
I did is I just took a piece of conduit

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.670 
I did is I just took a piece of conduit
in<00:03:08.030> here<00:03:08.299> and<00:03:08.450> took<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> heat<00:03:09.139> gun<00:03:09.349> and<00:03:09.409> just

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
in here and took a heat gun and just

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.039 
in here and took a heat gun and just
kept<00:03:09.980> heating<00:03:10.370> up<00:03:10.459> right<00:03:10.519> here<00:03:10.849> and<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.480> bent<00:03:11.840> it

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
kept heating up right here and I bent it

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.470 
kept heating up right here and I bent it
so<00:03:12.319> that<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.739> would<00:03:12.859> it<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.340> was<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:14.000> angle<00:03:14.329> I

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
so that it would it it was the angle I

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:25.400 
so that it would it it was the angle I
needed<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.700> I<00:03:17.480> did<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:17.930> on<00:03:18.109> both<00:03:18.290> sides

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.850 

so

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
so

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.490 
so
I<00:03:27.920> bent<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.820> I<00:03:29.150> bent<00:03:29.480> these<00:03:29.690> three<00:03:30.110> pieces

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
I bent the I bent these three pieces

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.910 
I bent the I bent these three pieces
here<00:03:30.980> first<00:03:31.370> top<00:03:32.120> middle<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.720> bottom<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.590> I

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
here first top middle and bottom and I

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.040 
here first top middle and bottom and I
left<00:03:34.070> him<00:03:34.250> sit<00:03:34.520> outside<00:03:34.700> for<00:03:35.300> a<00:03:35.330> couple<00:03:36.020> weeks

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
left him sit outside for a couple weeks

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.190 
left him sit outside for a couple weeks
in<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.920> Sun<00:03:37.190> they<00:03:37.460> warmed<00:03:37.850> up<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:39.020> when<00:03:39.170> I

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
in the Sun they warmed up so that when I

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.560 
in the Sun they warmed up so that when I
went<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.620> cut<00:03:39.920> these<00:03:40.460> these<00:03:40.970> center<00:03:41.360> pieces

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
went to cut these these center pieces

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.140 
went to cut these these center pieces
out<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.020> put<00:03:42.140> another<00:03:42.350> T<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.950> then<00:03:43.790> across

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
out and put another T and then across

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.350 
out and put another T and then across
another<00:03:44.540> T<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.830> PVC<00:03:46.670> kind<00:03:46.940> of<00:03:47.030> held<00:03:47.180> its

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
another T the the PVC kind of held its

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.940 
another T the the PVC kind of held its
shape<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.840> actually<00:03:48.020> has<00:03:48.410> held<00:03:48.740> its<00:03:48.890> shape

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
shape and it actually has held its shape

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.790 
shape and it actually has held its shape
so<00:03:49.310> this<00:03:49.790> morning<00:03:50.270> what<00:03:50.450> I<00:03:50.480> did<00:03:50.750> is<00:03:50.870> I<00:03:50.960> came<00:03:51.590> out

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
so this morning what I did is I came out

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.030 
so this morning what I did is I came out
and<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.490> cut<00:03:52.790> these<00:03:53.030> here<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.780> then<00:03:54.740> I<00:03:54.830> put<00:03:55.010> a

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
and I cut these here and then I put a

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.810 
and I cut these here and then I put a
tee<00:03:55.280> there

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
tee there

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.860 
tee there
I<00:03:56.920> put<00:03:57.920> across<00:03:58.250> there<00:03:58.550> and<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.850> T<00:03:59.120> on<00:03:59.270> top<00:03:59.540> now

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
I put across there and the T on top now

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.949 
I put across there and the T on top now
inside<00:04:00.350> this<00:04:00.620> upright<00:04:01.100> is<00:04:01.280> also<00:04:01.760> conduit<00:04:02.390> so

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
inside this upright is also conduit so

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.440 
inside this upright is also conduit so
it's<00:04:03.440> nice<00:04:03.740> and<00:04:03.770> nice<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:04.610> firm<00:04:05.090> it's<00:04:05.300> not

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
it's nice and nice and firm it's not

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.540 
it's nice and nice and firm it's not
bending<00:04:07.060> these<00:04:08.060> back<00:04:08.420> pieces<00:04:08.780> here<00:04:09.350> as<00:04:09.550> well

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
bending these back pieces here as well

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.780 
bending these back pieces here as well
have<00:04:10.940> conduit<00:04:11.870> in<00:04:12.080> them<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:12.739> again<00:04:13.550> they're

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
have conduit in them so again they're

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.340 
have conduit in them so again they're
nice<00:04:13.970> is<00:04:14.239> strong<00:04:14.600> and<00:04:14.900> they're<00:04:14.989> not<00:04:15.080> going

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
nice is strong and they're not going

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.710 
nice is strong and they're not going
anywhere<00:04:18.130> now<00:04:19.130> my<00:04:19.340> idea<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.090> take<00:04:20.390> my

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
anywhere now my idea is to take my

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.010 
anywhere now my idea is to take my
pixels<00:04:21.230> and<00:04:21.850> attach<00:04:22.850> them<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.180> this<00:04:23.540> clear

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
pixels and attach them to this clear

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.230 
pixels and attach them to this clear
tubing<00:04:24.530> I<00:04:24.740> bought<00:04:25.280> this<00:04:25.460> clear<00:04:25.760> tubing<00:04:26.150> I

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
tubing I bought this clear tubing I

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.430 
tubing I bought this clear tubing I
thought<00:04:26.419> it<00:04:26.510> might<00:04:26.660> be<00:04:26.780> easier<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.230> work<00:04:27.260> with

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
thought it might be easier to work with

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.090 
thought it might be easier to work with
and<00:04:28.300> I'm<00:04:29.300> going<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.870> it's<00:04:30.380> not<00:04:30.530> attached<00:04:30.860> right

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
and I'm going to it's not attached right

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.469 
and I'm going to it's not attached right
now<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.310> just<00:04:31.669> stuck<00:04:31.850> here<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.150> show<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.360> guys

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
now I just stuck here to show you guys

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.719 
now I just stuck here to show you guys
but<00:04:33.169> I'm<00:04:33.320> going<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.740> attach<00:04:34.100> it<00:04:34.130> at<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.490> top

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
but I'm going to attach it at the top

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.820 
but I'm going to attach it at the top
and<00:04:35.620> then<00:04:36.620> attach<00:04:36.950> it<00:04:36.979> at<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.430> bottom<00:04:38.830> and

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
and then attach it at the bottom and

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.560 
and then attach it at the bottom and
then<00:04:40.010> you<00:04:40.190> know<00:04:40.250> every<00:04:40.610> I'm<00:04:40.820> gonna<00:04:40.970> have<00:04:41.090> 24

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
then you know every I'm gonna have 24

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.270 
then you know every I'm gonna have 24
strands<00:04:42.020> on<00:04:42.140> here<00:04:42.380> so<00:04:42.560> it's<00:04:42.680> going<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.890> be<00:04:43.010> 12

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
strands on here so it's going to be 12

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.820 
strands on here so it's going to be 12
on<00:04:43.520> this<00:04:43.700> side<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.270> 12<00:04:44.930> on<00:04:45.140> that<00:04:45.380> side<00:04:45.650> and

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
on this side and 12 on that side and

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.110 
on this side and 12 on that side and
your<00:04:45.979> lights<00:04:46.190> are<00:04:46.340> going<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.490> be<00:04:46.669> attached<00:04:46.970> to

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
your lights are going to be attached to

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.690 
your lights are going to be attached to
that<00:04:47.330> so<00:04:47.990> I'm<00:04:48.200> hoping<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.740> clear<00:04:49.010> tube<00:04:49.280> you

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
that so I'm hoping the clear tube you

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.420 
that so I'm hoping the clear tube you
won't<00:04:49.880> really<00:04:50.030> see<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.600> you<00:04:51.280> won't<00:04:52.280> be<00:04:52.370> able

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
won't really see the you won't be able

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.420 
won't really see the you won't be able
to<00:04:52.550> see<00:04:52.729> it<00:04:52.850> at<00:04:52.970> night<00:04:53.440> well<00:04:54.440> there<00:04:55.130> might<00:04:55.220> be<00:04:55.280> a

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
to see it at night well there might be a

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.560 
to see it at night well there might be a
little<00:04:55.610> bit<00:04:55.700> of<00:04:55.760> reflection<00:04:55.910> on<00:04:56.240> it<00:04:56.270> but<00:04:56.479> they

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
little bit of reflection on it but they

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.060 
little bit of reflection on it but they
didn't<00:04:56.840> have<00:04:56.960> black<00:04:57.290> tubing<00:04:57.710> that<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:57.919> could

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
didn't have black tubing that I could

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.440 
didn't have black tubing that I could
use<00:04:58.250> that<00:04:58.460> was<00:04:58.550> this<00:04:58.669> flexible<00:04:59.210> I<00:05:01.450> was

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
use that was this flexible I was

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.880 
use that was this flexible I was
originally<00:05:02.840> thinking<00:05:03.110> about<00:05:03.320> hanging<00:05:03.530> it<00:05:03.740> on

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
originally thinking about hanging it on

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.719 
originally thinking about hanging it on
this<00:05:04.070> wall<00:05:04.310> here<00:05:05.380> but<00:05:06.380> at<00:05:06.800> this<00:05:07.040> point<00:05:07.340> I'm<00:05:07.550> a

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
this wall here but at this point I'm a

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.610 
this wall here but at this point I'm a

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
you know right now that I see it can

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.650 
you know right now that I see it can
really<00:05:09.830> pretty<00:05:10.070> much<00:05:10.220> free<00:05:10.669> stand<00:05:11.060> on<00:05:11.330> its<00:05:11.510> own
