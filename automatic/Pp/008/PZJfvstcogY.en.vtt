00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.900
 so much 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.750
 charlie stefanon comanda wanted me to explain a bit about two types of brakes 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.580
 for rotating kings dale if we do not have the mechanic the centrifuge well 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.050
 and eta the 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.819
 magnetic connect and tortilleros 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.819
 Here we have a bogart corner and toilets 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.119
 I think I took good here 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.250
 the centrifugal brake 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.310
 this one requires 6 pins 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.900
 air liquide in with two pins with four 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.550
 Theft unr and the purely ludic know the brand war cia 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.490
 of excellent quality is already good 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.970
 this refuge ana 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.079
 ford friction or that there is a pressure on what is the tambo 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.489
 because 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.610
 between the centrifuges 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.740
 the centrifugal brake 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.750
 so a friction on the drum 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.670
 thing that the farinÃ³s magnetic does not 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.830
 rock this we are going to leave like this 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.910
 properly to show what a brake is 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.400
 manifested 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.400
 it's romantic is the best thing that exists 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.170
 To trow 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.320
 I'm going to check all brands have this type of brake floor 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.930
 It is special and if there is no gentleman and many thousands who bring only 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.670
 the mechanic 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.550
 and I go in the day feel and leak and give more assiduously 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.220
 - event the riles is the magnificent also good here what we have is a 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.120
 rite centrifugal environment 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.210
 but with doping only 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.610
 roque yes cc very well 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.610
 the best that exists to launch 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.670
 so that one can not do was certain 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.400
 it's the magnetic 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.159
 a magnetic brake here we do not have because the gazette is produced 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.090
 the appointment occurs because the reel 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.940
 it rotates faster than the late kansas 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.810
 I do not know if asia and the appointment 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.819
 what is good about the magnetic fact that regulates it 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.059
 it does not regulate very, very well 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:13.819
 putting away 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.479
 wasser c 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.329
 to the metallic reel and regulates it without a pink house 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.529
 that's how good it is 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.799
 because the launch is much more free and it can not be a shot 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.379
 much, much longer 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.379
 that with another type of brake that can assist 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.679
 well we have another example 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.179
 4 ferrer 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.129
 of the magnetic 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.129
 this official or down 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.559
 not approaching as inter showed a little while ago 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.299
 the best thing to launch what would not have automatic winding 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.039
 so that it does not slow down so much the shot 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.039
 make it more free like and terry 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:06.689
 it is terrible very good but they have this thing that did series 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.429
 they arrested to subtract the rogue 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:12.429
 12 wind affected from the explanation of 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.519
 of the brakes for the protas of 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.619
 Well ok 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:18.349
 again until you 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.509
 consultations paper box approval dotcom 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:22.319
 Right
