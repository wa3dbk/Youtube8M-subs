00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:06.759 
it in this hotel and in this map idea

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.640 
it in this hotel and in this map idea
this<00:04:06.939> is<00:04:07.120> where<00:04:07.329> you<00:04:07.449> spawn<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:08.229> have<00:04:08.349> to<00:04:08.500> get

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
this is where you spawn you have to get

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.619 
this is where you spawn you have to get
out<00:04:08.769> of<00:04:08.799> this<00:04:09.009> and<00:04:09.250> that's<00:04:09.759> where<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.329> allows

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
out of this and that's where it allows

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.890 
out of this and that's where it allows
you<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:11.019> go<00:04:11.280> through<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.849> streets<00:04:13.239> this<00:04:13.720> is

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
you to go through the streets this is

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.990 
you to go through the streets this is
basically<00:04:14.290> like<00:04:14.409> another<00:04:14.769> transit<00:04:15.489> map<00:04:15.669> I

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
basically like another transit map I

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.810 
basically like another transit map I
mean<00:04:16.209> this<00:04:16.630> would<00:04:16.870> map<00:04:17.049> would<00:04:17.229> be<00:04:17.409> huge<00:04:17.859> if<00:04:18.340> you

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
mean this would map would be huge if you

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.689 
mean this would map would be huge if you
