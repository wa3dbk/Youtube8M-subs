00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.210
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.950
 a new fashion preview and today 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.080
 I introduce you to the mob mainboard 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.880
 As the name of the mod says , he adds 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.130
 but adding a few pugs is a small one 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.439
 place so only four pugs are added 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.270
 come and we will not catch this time 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.210
 the forces recipes but with the 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.830
 mods because the crafting recipes I say 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.620
 Mach's home would be to the pug and 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.180
 I do not want that, of course 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.220
 For the first time you can see the wars here 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.780
 I no longer killed a panda 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.129
 he has suits me 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.540
 we'll just go there one can 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.150
 here just a panda spawn would 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.019
 so easy in the day in the beach bums 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.790
 pon 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.949
 and he looks like this 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.479
 usually an aggressive mob and 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.760
 why would you have him as thyme 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.729
 stop only five hearts and works part just 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.180
 panda much what you can do I show 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.070
 you still 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.960
 However, you can tame and 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.670
 Although with panda feed I show too 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.950
 how to have it crafted so now we have 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.900
 Tame him and what you can do now 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.320
 if you could do second panda 10 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.000
 you could resist that and baby 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.530
 Let's do it and then you do it here 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.789
 comes faster 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.649
 I also feel extremely and as such is 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.149
 a cute little panda baby come undone 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.460
 and of course that's exactly 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.640
 counted and on the side is indeed 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.090
 would not help you in the fight 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.350
 but only if the mobs the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.539
 But if you were here you would provoke 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.979
 for example sport would have anyway 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.409
 Then the ideas would be too 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.359
 attacking you thus help the panda 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.340
 usually has five hearts if you can 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.929
 he has ten butts and then he can 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.219
 Unfortunately, I do not kill him anymore 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.450
 I do not want you anymore and they are now 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.490
 here the whole are here unfortunately 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.920
 the whole stay while you you the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.560
 to introduce another pug yet 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.530
 the next mob is the penguin 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.219
 You can find it in this organic tiger 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.780
 or even plan ice or how that 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.149
 means I do not know if that exactly 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.249
 correct this plan would have to be right 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.729
 and halt tiger and so what this snow 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:14.480
 biome looks so very small 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.830
 even untamed 25 hearts yes I say 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.890
 yes, especially for purposefully that means one 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.000
 Namely, he can be untamed above all else 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.860
 can him 10 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.780
 and with raw fish that's all 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.190
 just ok then maybe one 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.630
 that's how the hearts and hearts come 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.610
 heart warm and hot you can get two here 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.340
 do it again and with the raw fish 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.130
 you can then drive directly 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.560
 let me turn around again 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.750
 and if you like it in 10 75 hearts 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.980
 if you have not tamed him 25 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.080
 and headless to the little penguin 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.880
 will help you again my fight like 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.140
 but you see , that is the same 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.220
 not even at but he has little 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.930
 hearts and such is perhaps not now 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.830
 as helpful are he does not 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.120
 a lot of damage like a panda but good the 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.570
 I think you can do that too 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.920
 also kill the very easy the targeted 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.540
 panthers unfortunately still can 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.370
 is in ghent back or something like that 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.870
 but also can not kill white 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.780
 one of not square 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.630
 Well then we come now to the penultimate 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.260
 mob exactly and yes us right back 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.290
 the penultimate mob is the orca something 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.650
 bigger, bigger and more aggressive 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.330
 as boll as each left ttp 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.800
 because the remains come follow me all the 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.970
 you do not know if you can do it this way or 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.080
 with the right one would have to the 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.220
 actually bring to a stop 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.660
 but that does not work right 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.760
 stay for a moment 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.220
 after that they will not care 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.370
 please come to the orga slightly larger motto 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.810
 but the murder pug but ashore 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.850
 can not survive long 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.959
 then of course you would be in the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.470
 you have to attack water then you have to 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.760
 crib 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:54.000
 Normally he would have to do it now 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.100
 start to get hurt oh me 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.660
 did not want zombies therefore now 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.420
 the damage gets that way and you can 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.130
 Of course, patching and the drops 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.630
 Actually, that's why that's up 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.190
 now it is seldom the fifth or 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.900
 so I think I have a thing because of 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.480
 doped see how long we just 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.040
 until we get this thing 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.430
 There were just a few more here 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.130
 pandas attacks the one there we have yes 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.570
 Perfect so see that maybe takes 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.870
 a bit until you get something but 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.510
 here 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.640
 you get an orca find orca fin 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.350
 and what we are doing honestly too 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.810
 We will come to the last one now 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.310
 By the way, nothing is over the hearts 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.510
 but a bit more we said 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.220
 since have seen a few suggestions 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.450
 plugged in and more you learn 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.550
 not about the orca except that you guys 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.480
 of course would attack and land 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.100
 can not survive 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.650
 well then we come to the last mob and 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.240
 then to some kÃ¶rting recipes so then 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.650
 let's get to the last mob and 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.240
 actually synonymous without just if the 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.560
 maybe just the world 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.030
 bit embellished you see i have 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.650
 No spawnen called because I have to 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.700
 Unfortunately, there is no spawn act yet 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.720
 Do we want the eighth I would 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.800
 Now all say away 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.300
 butterflies people butterflies yes 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.530
 one of these is blaugrana the winner 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.030
 not because he's a bit faster 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.630
 I can do if the centers but the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.610
 is blue 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.620
 then there are some in yellow and 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.640
 orange I do not think maybe 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.860
 I am now here in the region that was there 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.880
 there is a butterfly in the back, yes 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.010
 look who is orange or I think 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.330
 yellow I do not know I can get it anyway 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.420
 do not separate the orange or 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.100
 yellow know the both and there's of it 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.080
 just three varieties but the droppen stop 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.650
 you can not see very hard either 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.870
 had 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.750
 and yes I do not know if you can 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.010
 I can owe everything at all 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.680
 nothing would go wrong because of that 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.430
 it does not do anything at all that last one 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.750
 here 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.000
 meets lady you do not even meet that 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.880
 far too difficult in any case easy 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.610
 just to beautify the environment or 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.010
 no idea but still only 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.510
 cool thing you can just have a look 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.070
 few children even if it does not work 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.300
 Incidentally, orca would be exactly the same here 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.400
 So squid would be easy 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.260
 attack because he bows too hard and there 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.570
 We come now to the forces emaciated 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.820
 it is a bit unusual the forces 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.310
 to show recipes at the end of the video 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.380
 but followed by a pandemic 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.330
 Of course, I can do it, too 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.590
 you can from the orca fans just 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.080
 make tools 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.180
 all sorts of things just like normal 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.010
 tools and that are about as strong as 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.450
 iron does not know if they are one 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.040
 bit stronger or weaker are on 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.740
 The site is however only as well as iron does 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.300
 and yes you can out of it in any 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.780
 make case and cases from the panda 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.210
 Can you make armor which 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.430
 terrible massacre but you have to 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.810
 but also wearing something is synonymous 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.050
 not really strong i can give you now 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.380
 Tighten times is not really 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:41.730
 thanks i followed the panda leader 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.520
 from a two man to the army yes 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.930
 in many cases quite cool is actually 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.850
 and very cool but that's just it 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.940
 about as much as I can I leather 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.900
 Show me the time and go out of fashion 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.820
 there, then 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.419
 yes, but a bit stronger, I believe 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.490
 in any case worse than iron and 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.150
 gold global or so strong gold i know 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.440
 not now 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.910
 So something could happen in between 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.370
 between leather and gold but so 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.389
 strong it is not on everyone right now 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.639
 not as strong as iron or 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:11.850
 diamond and then there is that 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:13.860
 last crafting zepp namely that japan 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.050
 Just duffy the lining for the panthers 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.570
 Herbert do not care about that out there 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.610
 that lining for the couple for the 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:24.750
 nee thought the lining for the 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:26.460
 pandas from a shooter kane and one 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.289
 wheat makes you look that because that 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.310
 you can do the themes and unfortunately never 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:31.080
 get rid of it again
