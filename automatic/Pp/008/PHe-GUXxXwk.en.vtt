00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
to the 280 I started the 290 r9 290 but

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.970 
to the 280 I started the 290 r9 290 but
nearly<00:02:09.149> guaranteed<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.709> ridiculous

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
nearly guaranteed it's just ridiculous

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.000 
nearly guaranteed it's just ridiculous
court<00:02:12.250> I'm<00:02:13.120> not<00:02:13.420> here<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:14.170> hold<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.800> know<00:02:14.950> I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
court I'm not here to hold it you know I

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.559 
court I'm not here to hold it you know I
can<00:02:15.190> either<00:02:15.340> Panchgani<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.090> stuff<00:02:16.239> but<00:02:16.420> it's

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
can either Panchgani and stuff but it's

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.540 
can either Panchgani and stuff but it's
not<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:16.840> bad

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
not that bad

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.630 
not that bad
but<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:19.030> know<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:21.090> mean<00:02:22.090> it's<00:02:22.390> not<00:02:22.510> crushed<00:02:22.840> yet

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
but you know I mean it's not crushed yet

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.080 
but you know I mean it's not crushed yet
so<00:02:24.640> obvious<00:02:25.360> it's<00:02:26.170> not<00:02:26.590> in<00:02:27.489> too<00:02:27.519> bad<00:02:27.670> they'd

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
so obvious it's not in too bad they'd

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.570 
so obvious it's not in too bad they'd

fine<00:04:32.610> now<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:33.759> as<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.120> can<00:04:34.180> see<00:04:34.240> now

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.159

my show performance you see there is the

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.749 
my show performance you see there is the

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.230

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
if you won't get ok so I I think I'll

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.340 
if you won't get ok so I I think I'll
leave<00:04:55.960> it<00:04:56.020> there

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350
