00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.380 
going to put it on a low setting and
then<00:01:47.490> I'm<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.790> put<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> high

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
then I'm going to put it on a high

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.749 
then I'm going to put it on a high
setting<00:01:48.829> for<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.040> you're<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> brush

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
setting for this you're going to brush

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.149 
setting for this you're going to brush
up<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.360> through<00:01:51.869> when<00:01:52.259> you're<00:01:52.409> drawing<00:01:52.590> onto

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
up and through when you're drawing onto

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.620 
up and through when you're drawing onto
the<00:01:53.250> brush<00:01:53.460> now<00:01:53.850> my<00:01:54.000> brush<00:01:54.240> has<00:01:54.390> got<00:01:54.540> these

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the brush now my brush has got these

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.999 
the brush now my brush has got these
little<00:01:54.810> holes<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.680> means<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.950> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
little holes in it so it means that the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.319 
little holes in it so it means that the
heat<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.369> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.549> go<00:01:56.640> straight<00:01:56.820> through<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
heat is going to go straight through and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.969 
heat is going to go straight through and
also<00:01:57.780> because<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> bristles<00:01:58.409> are<00:01:58.680> coming<00:01:58.890> in

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
also because the bristles are coming in

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.109 
also because the bristles are coming in
metal<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.340> means<00:01:59.490> that's<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> heat<00:02:00.090> up

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
metal it means that's going to heat up

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.969 
metal it means that's going to heat up
slightly<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:01.200> why<00:02:01.380> I'm<00:02:01.469> not<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.829> use

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
slightly that's why I'm not going to use

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.310 
slightly that's why I'm not going to use
an<00:02:02.100> overly<00:02:02.549> hot<00:02:02.729> setting<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.840> front<00:02:04.170> of

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
an overly hot setting it's the front of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.660 
an overly hot setting it's the front of
the<00:02:04.409> hair<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.829> really<00:02:05.280> want<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.579> have

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the hair that you really want to have

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.160 
the hair that you really want to have
volume<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.360> back<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.930> going<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
volume in the back of it's going to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.380 
volume in the back of it's going to
gradually<00:02:07.590> taper<00:02:08.099> almost<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.060> you've<00:02:09.209> got<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
gradually taper almost like you've got a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:18.390 
gradually taper almost like you've got a
slope<00:02:09.810> up<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.319> front<00:02:10.530> okay<00:02:11.069> let's<00:02:11.550> do<00:02:11.640> this

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.850 

now<00:02:19.030> I've<00:02:19.239> got<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.629> basic<00:02:20.170> shape<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.620> does

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
now I've got the basic shape it does

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.960 
now I've got the basic shape it does
look<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.040> bit<00:02:21.069> of<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.250> mess<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:21.550> I'll<00:02:21.640> sort<00:02:21.849> that

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
look a bit of a mess but I'll sort that

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.820 
look a bit of a mess but I'll sort that
in<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.150> minute<00:02:22.239> I'm<00:02:22.900> now<00:02:23.200> going<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.500> put<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.709> onto

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
in a minute I'm now going to put it onto

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.130 
in a minute I'm now going to put it onto
a<00:02:23.950> fool<00:02:24.400> setting<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.269> full<00:02:25.480> power<00:02:25.690> setting

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
keeping the medium heat and that just

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.570 
keeping the medium heat and that just
going<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.780> blast<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.379> slightly<00:02:29.590> more<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.129> help

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
going to blast it slightly more and help

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
through that to give it the volume so

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.399 
through that to give it the volume so
it's<00:02:50.189> coming<00:02:50.459> up<00:02:50.579> this<00:02:51.239> sharp<00:02:51.689> ledge<00:02:52.109> that

fringe<00:03:35.280> with<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.030> sides<00:03:36.269> just<00:03:36.359> keeping<00:03:36.780> it

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
fringe with the sides just keeping it

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.750 
fringe with the sides just keeping it
neat<00:03:37.079> depending<00:03:37.560> how<00:03:37.769> long<00:03:37.799> your<00:03:38.219> hair<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.459> if

it<00:03:38.909> is<00:03:39.060> slightly<00:03:39.239> longer<00:03:39.510> then<00:03:40.079> you're<00:03:40.169> going

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
it is slightly longer then you're going

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.020

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
to want to brush it down if it's really

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.330

all over paying particular attention to

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.740 
all over paying particular attention to
the<00:05:42.470> fringe<00:05:42.830> just<00:05:43.700> to<00:05:43.910> keep<00:05:44.060> it<00:05:44.180> in<00:05:44.270> place<00:05:44.510> and

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
the fringe just to keep it in place and

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.020

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
that is it done so we've got this big

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.460 
that is it done so we've got this big
quiff<00:05:52.550> fringe<00:05:53.000> at<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.270> front<00:05:53.510> coming<00:05:53.930> up<00:05:54.170> in
