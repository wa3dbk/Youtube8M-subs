00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.069 
what I mean by that here's some here's
an<00:00:50.460> inference<00:00:50.760> down<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.629> let<00:00:51.750> me<00:00:51.840> start

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
an inference down here but let me start

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
an inference down here but let me start
with<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.440> fact<00:00:53.629> Marlin<00:00:54.629> hovers<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.489> if

this is true perhaps but it's not an

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
very good question to keep asking

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.030 
very good question to keep asking
yourself<00:03:32.299> as<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:33.139> look<00:03:33.380> at<00:03:33.500> all<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.769> facts

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
yourself as you look at all the facts

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.430 
yourself as you look at all the facts
you<00:03:34.760> look<00:03:35.090> at<00:03:35.209> each<00:03:35.389> fact<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:35.989> think<00:03:36.260> yeah

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
you look at each fact and you think yeah

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.430 
you look at each fact and you think yeah
but<00:03:36.650> why<00:03:36.950> does<00:03:37.489> he<00:03:37.519> behave<00:03:37.910> this<00:03:38.090> way<00:03:38.150> why<00:03:39.019> does

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
but why does he behave this way why does

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.490 
but why does he behave this way why does
he<00:03:39.590> say<00:03:39.889> this<00:03:40.250> bit<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.910> dialogue<00:03:41.329> why<00:03:42.079> does<00:03:42.349> he

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
he say this bit of dialogue why does he

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.759 
he say this bit of dialogue why does he
respond<00:03:42.980> this<00:03:43.310> way<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:44.359> why<00:03:44.660> questions<00:03:45.260> will

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
respond this way the why questions will

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.460 
respond this way the why questions will
draw<00:03:46.609> you<00:03:46.669> deeper<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.209> deeper<00:03:47.660> into<00:03:47.870> the

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
draw you deeper and deeper into the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.430 
draw you deeper and deeper into the
psychology<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.489> character<00:03:50.260> let's<00:03:51.260> say

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
psychology of the character let's say

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.229 
psychology of the character let's say
you<00:03:51.500> do<00:03:51.859> have<00:03:51.889> some<00:03:52.400> inferences<00:03:52.910> about<00:03:52.970> the

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
you do have some inferences about the

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.420 
you do have some inferences about the
character<00:03:53.840> some<00:03:54.500> conclusions<00:03:55.160> that<00:03:55.280> you've

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
character some conclusions that you've

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.089 
character some conclusions that you've
drawn<00:03:55.730> from<00:03:56.120> all<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.419> facts<00:03:56.720> now<00:03:57.680> you've<00:03:57.889> got

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
drawn from all the facts now you've got

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.339 
drawn from all the facts now you've got
to<00:03:58.250> put<00:03:58.430> this<00:03:58.549> into<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:58.940> thesis<00:03:59.299> statement<00:04:00.109> a

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
to put this into a thesis statement a

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.909 
to put this into a thesis statement a
thesis<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.669> simply<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:02.989> one<00:04:03.169> sentence<00:04:03.680> that

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
thesis is simply the one sentence that

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.390 
thesis is simply the one sentence that
sums<00:04:04.400> up<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:05.000> main<00:04:05.239> point<00:04:05.599> you<00:04:05.870> want<00:04:06.139> to<00:04:06.230> make

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
sums up the main point you want to make

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.699 
sums up the main point you want to make
so<00:04:07.400> this<00:04:07.700> is<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.150> sentence<00:04:08.569> that<00:04:08.810> says<00:04:09.109> I'm

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
so this is the sentence that says I'm

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.849 
so this is the sentence that says I'm
going<00:04:10.129> to<00:04:10.190> prove<00:04:10.489> this<00:04:10.819> to<00:04:11.030> you<00:04:11.359> reader<00:04:11.959> my

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
going to prove this to you reader my

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.879 
going to prove this to you reader my
interpretation<00:04:13.669> is<00:04:14.109> this<00:04:15.109> and<00:04:15.410> then<00:04:15.769> the

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
interpretation is this and then the

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.529 
interpretation is this and then the
whole<00:04:16.039> essay<00:04:16.430> is<00:04:16.579> going<00:04:16.639> to<00:04:16.849> prove<00:04:17.180> that<00:04:17.479> that

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
whole essay is going to prove that that

was<00:04:17.930> a<00:04:18.109> reasonable<00:04:18.739> logical<00:04:19.639> conclusion<00:04:20.209> that

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
was a reasonable logical conclusion that

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.930 
was a reasonable logical conclusion that
I<00:04:20.389> drew<00:04:20.750> from<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.019> facts<00:04:21.440> my<00:04:22.070> inference<00:04:22.520> makes

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
I drew from the facts my inference makes

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.760 
I drew from the facts my inference makes
sense<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:23.479> I'm<00:04:23.570> going<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:23.719> prove<00:04:24.050> it<00:04:24.229> with<00:04:24.530> all

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
sense and I'm going to prove it with all

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
sons now this could be unpacked and

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.780 
sons now this could be unpacked and
explained<00:04:44.900> so<00:04:45.650> that<00:04:45.680> makes<00:04:46.160> it<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.370> good<00:04:46.520> thesis

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790

for<00:04:47.120> an<00:04:47.240> essay<00:04:47.600> for<00:04:48.350> example<00:04:48.830> I've<00:04:49.040> said<00:04:49.580> that

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
for an essay for example I've said that

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.780 
for an essay for example I've said that
Marlin<00:04:50.470> discovers<00:04:51.470> inner<00:04:51.920> resources<00:04:52.490> my

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
Marlin discovers inner resources my

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.370 
Marlin discovers inner resources my
essay<00:04:53.180> is<00:04:53.270> going<00:04:53.390> to<00:04:53.450> have<00:04:53.570> to<00:04:53.690> prove<00:04:53.960> that<00:04:53.990> he

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
essay is going to have to prove that he

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.280 
essay is going to have to prove that he
does<00:04:54.620> do<00:04:54.920> that<00:04:55.130> so<00:04:55.940> perhaps<00:04:56.600> my<00:04:57.050> first

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
does do that so perhaps my first

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.990 
does do that so perhaps my first
paragraph<00:04:57.920> will<00:04:59.080> assert<00:05:00.080> that<00:05:01.000> certain
