00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.044
Hello !

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.380
It's moon shooting challenge today.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.920
Did you know we had Blue Moon few days ago ?

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:19.840
I used my new lens TAMRON SP 70-300mm F/4-5.6 Di VC USD.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.280
I have lens review video of this lens, please watch it if you haven't yet.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.980
The video link is above here.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.480
Do you know Blue Moon by the way ??

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.780
I didn't know it till few days ago.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.360
Blue Moon means... Full moon appears 2 times in a month.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.000
We had 2 times full moon on last July. 31st was the second full moon night.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.920
Next Blue Moon will be in January 2018.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.160
It sounds like a big event, must be a special moon...,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.160
but actually the moon is not really special.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.620
and,

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.580
the moon color is not blue at all, lol.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.700
anyway, let's look at the pictures of blue moon.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.720
I didn't edit any on the pictures.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.620
I took them with 300mm.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.340
the moon is pretty small at 300mm angle of view,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.680
I'll crop the pictures later and show you.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.580
Camera dial setting was manual, focus was also manual,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.840
and,  OFF the vibration control on the lens.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.600
cause I was using tripod.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.360
I was getting focus on the screen behind the camera at the beginning

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.160
because I could  expand the moon.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.280
but it was very difficult to get focus because

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.940
the moon was too blurred due to the brightness itself.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.640
but I kept trying to get focus... ( it was not a good idea...)

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.800
but I realized that looking at the finder is much accurate to get the focus.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.880
but I still had a problem...

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.320
the moon size in the finder is not enough big for me,

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.600
because my eyesight is pretty poor,

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.620
of course I always wear contact lenses,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.160
but the corrected visual acuity wasn't enough.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.860
so, I repeated looking at the finder with right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye....

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.400
yes, very troublesome !

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.180
I took so much time to find the focus.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.340
You must have seen some moon colors on the last pictures.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.660
the moon colors are not edited.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.680
white balance option made the colors.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.960
this is Fluorescent light setting,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.560
it's sun light setting,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.700
it's auto white balance.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.020
it's bulb light setting.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.000
this is sunny-shade setting.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.860
I used bulb light setting mostly at the shooting

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.280
because moon turns into blue. It's blue moon shooting :)

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.900
I don't usually stare at the moon for 10 minutes,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.320
but I had to...  at the shooting.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.020
then,  I noticed that

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.640
the moon moves very quickly.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.020
that means I have to change the position of the tripod,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.100
and I had to get focus at the same time, which is very troublesome for me...

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.460
so it was pretty busy shooting.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.560
please watch it,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.400
the moon moves this much distance in 5 minutes.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.300
OK, now let's see the cropped pictures.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.500
I added contrast on the editing.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.340
the size of these cropped picture is quite small,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.820
the size is 1024px Ã— 768 px.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.840
it should be blur if you watch this video on a big screen.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.100
so, I recommend you to look at them on a smaller screen.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.680
how did you like them ?

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.200
I could see the crater, but

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.760
sharpness has gone because of the cropping.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.580
so, now, I want to get a bigger zoom lens... mmm.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.040
I'll put the pictures with the date on my photo blog.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.400
please check it out.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.140
blog address is on the description box below.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.860
we'll have super moon next month.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.960
It'll be a good chance to shoot moon again. Let's try it.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.820
OK, see you soon at the next video again, bye !
