think other reasons include just the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.300

fact<00:03:57.330> that<00:03:57.420> like<00:03:57.510> videos<00:03:58.379> tournament<00:03:58.950> system

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
fact that like videos tournament system

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.100 
fact that like videos tournament system
is<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.819> little<00:04:00.000> bit<00:04:00.180> tough<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.420> break<00:04:00.720> away<00:04:00.840> from
