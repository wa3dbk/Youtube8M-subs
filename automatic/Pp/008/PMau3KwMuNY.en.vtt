this<00:00:14.719> is<00:00:15.820> wafer-thin<00:00:17.110> dichroic<00:00:18.110> you<00:00:18.320> can<00:00:18.500> see

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
this is wafer-thin dichroic you can see

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.820 
this is wafer-thin dichroic you can see
by<00:00:19.790> myself<00:00:20.180> today<00:00:20.300> filming<00:00:20.630> as<00:00:20.960> usual<00:00:21.380> guys<00:00:21.560> so

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830

by myself today filming as usual guys so
bear<00:00:22.039> with<00:00:22.070> my<00:00:22.340> lovely<00:00:22.640> hands<00:00:23.060> here

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
bear with my lovely hands here

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.380 
bear with my lovely hands here
this<00:00:24.050> is<00:00:24.230> wafer-thin<00:00:24.529> dichroic<00:00:25.220> it's<00:00:25.400> 90<00:00:25.910> co<00:00:26.210> e

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
this is wafer-thin dichroic it's 90 co e

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.009 
this is wafer-thin dichroic it's 90 co e
that's<00:00:26.960> 90<00:00:27.380> co<00:00:27.619> e<00:00:27.939> the<00:00:28.939> thickness<00:00:29.810> of<00:00:29.900> the

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
that's 90 co e the thickness of the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.830 
that's 90 co e the thickness of the
dichroic<00:00:30.289> is<00:00:30.500> only<00:00:31.180> 1.7<00:00:32.180> a<00:00:32.330> millimeter

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
dichroic is only 1.7 a millimeter

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.170 
dichroic is only 1.7 a millimeter
thickness<00:00:33.260> of<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.559> glass<00:00:33.680> rather<00:00:34.129> is<00:00:34.339> 1.7

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
thickness of the glass rather is 1.7

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.510 
thickness of the glass rather is 1.7
millimeter<00:00:36.110> so<00:00:36.559> what<00:00:36.710> does<00:00:36.860> that<00:00:36.890> mean<00:00:37.129> for<00:00:37.340> us

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
millimeter so what does that mean for us

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.610 
millimeter so what does that mean for us
that<00:00:38.090> means<00:00:38.329> we<00:00:38.510> can<00:00:38.690> get<00:00:38.780> a<00:00:38.840> lot<00:00:38.989> of<00:00:39.050> layering

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
that means we can get a lot of layering

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.979 
that means we can get a lot of layering
in<00:00:39.829> with<00:00:40.700> this<00:00:40.820> dichroic<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:41.480> not<00:00:41.629> having<00:00:41.840> to

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
in with this dichroic and not having to

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.069 
in with this dichroic and not having to
worry<00:00:42.850> so<00:00:43.850> much<00:00:43.910> about<00:00:44.090> volume<00:00:44.690> control<00:00:45.050> so

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
worry so much about volume control so

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.270 
worry so much about volume control so
i'm<00:00:45.230> going<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.379> show<00:00:45.469> you<00:00:45.620> how<00:00:45.770> to<00:00:45.800> layer<00:00:46.039> this

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
i'm going to show you how to layer this

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.400 
i'm going to show you how to layer this

the foresight to think about what's

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.600 
the foresight to think about what's
underneath<00:04:00.350> what<00:04:00.709> kind<00:04:00.920> of<00:04:00.980> depth<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.400> there

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
underneath what kind of depth is there

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.190 
underneath what kind of depth is there
and<00:04:02.209> let<00:04:02.330> me<00:04:02.420> show<00:04:02.570> you<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.720> really<00:04:02.959> cool<00:04:03.140> trick

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
and let me show you a really cool trick

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.900 
and let me show you a really cool trick
let's<00:04:03.680> say<00:04:03.800> you<00:04:03.890> want<00:04:04.100> your<00:04:04.250> base<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.490> be<00:04:04.880> a

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
let's say you want your base to be a

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.650 
let's say you want your base to be a
piece<00:04:05.390> of<00:04:05.690> black<00:04:06.380> back<00:04:06.740> dichroic<00:04:07.190> glass<00:04:07.660> okay

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
piece of black back dichroic glass okay

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.699 
piece of black back dichroic glass okay
for<00:04:09.910> beginner<00:04:10.910> fusing<00:04:11.360> purposes<00:04:11.900> you<00:04:12.110> won

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
for beginner fusing purposes you won

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.110 
for beginner fusing purposes you won
over<00:04:12.830> one<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.370> cardinal<00:04:13.730> rules<00:04:13.760> if<00:04:14.090> you

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
over one of the cardinal rules if you

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.430 
over one of the cardinal rules if you
work<00:04:14.390> in<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.540> deck<00:04:14.690> row<00:04:14.810> because<00:04:15.020> you<00:04:15.140> can't

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
work in a deck row because you can't

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.280 
work in a deck row because you can't
fuse<00:04:15.709> coating<00:04:16.220> side<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:17.359> coating<00:04:17.720> side<00:04:17.930> okay

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
fuse coating side to coating side okay

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.900 
fuse coating side to coating side okay
just<00:04:18.560> like<00:04:18.650> irid<00:04:18.919> eyes<00:04:19.040> glass<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.459> can't<00:04:19.669> fuse

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
just like irid eyes glass you can't fuse

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.210 
just like irid eyes glass you can't fuse
irin<00:04:20.180> eyes<00:04:20.330> glass<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:20.780> dichroic<00:04:21.140> no<00:04:21.709> coding

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
irin eyes glass to dichroic no coding

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.830 
irin eyes glass to dichroic no coding
side<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.640> coding<00:04:22.970> side<00:04:23.150> so<00:04:23.390> what<00:04:23.540> could<00:04:23.720> you

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
side the coding side so what could you

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.700 
side the coding side so what could you
do<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.530> could<00:04:24.650> have<00:04:24.830> this<00:04:25.100> slip<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:26.150> piece<00:04:26.360> of

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
do you could have this slip a piece of

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.499 
do you could have this slip a piece of
clear<00:04:26.830> glass<00:04:27.130> in<00:04:27.370> between<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.910> as<00:04:28.030> a<00:04:28.060> buffer

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
clear glass in between it as a buffer

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.719 
clear glass in between it as a buffer
and<00:04:28.740> then<00:04:29.740> go<00:04:29.919> ahead<00:04:30.009> and<00:04:30.130> put<00:04:30.370> coding

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
and then go ahead and put coding

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.700 
and then go ahead and put coding
decoding<00:04:31.180> you've<00:04:31.780> got<00:04:31.960> a<00:04:31.990> buffer<00:04:32.380> what<00:04:32.590> you're

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
decoding you've got a buffer what you're

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.110 
decoding you've got a buffer what you're
also<00:04:32.830> doing<00:04:33.130> with<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.370> clear<00:04:33.610> glass<00:04:33.789> is<00:04:34.000> you

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
also doing with that clear glass is you

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.499 
also doing with that clear glass is you
are<00:04:34.270> causing<00:04:34.509> depth<00:04:35.020> between<00:04:35.259> layers<00:04:35.710> okay<00:04:36.509> so

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
are causing depth between layers okay so

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:38.850 
are causing depth between layers okay so
that's<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.780> really<00:04:38.050> cool<00:04:38.199> trick<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.680> it's<00:04:38.800> a

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
that's a really cool trick and it's a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.320 
that's a really cool trick and it's a
really<00:04:39.009> cool<00:04:39.250> effect<00:04:39.340> if<00:04:39.669> you<00:04:39.759> can<00:04:39.910> see<00:04:40.120> this

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
really cool effect if you can see this

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.700 
really cool effect if you can see this
will<00:04:40.630> bring<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:40.990> up<00:04:41.050> close<00:04:41.259> to<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.500> camera

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
will bring it up close to the camera

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.460 
will bring it up close to the camera
here<00:04:42.750> okay<00:04:43.750> and<00:04:44.229> out<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:45.610> see<00:04:45.880> that<00:04:46.470> that's

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
here okay and out and see that that's

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.520
