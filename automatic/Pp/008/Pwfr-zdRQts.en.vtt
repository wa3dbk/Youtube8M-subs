starting to brown here or fade a little
bit<00:00:13.170> where<00:00:13.889> it's<00:00:14.009> getting<00:00:14.400> above<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
bit where it's getting above the

his number 32 35 thank you and this is
very<00:00:28.410> similar<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.980> taxus<00:00:29.670> baccata<00:00:29.869> fastigiata

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
very similar to taxus baccata fastigiata

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.120 
very similar to taxus baccata fastigiata
except<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> leaves<00:00:34.350> are

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
except you see that the leaves are

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.400 
except you see that the leaves are
needles<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.700> shinier<00:00:36.270> they're<00:00:36.600> much<00:00:36.750> coarser

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
needles are shinier they're much coarser

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
needles are shinier they're much coarser
looking<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.670> much<00:00:38.850> coarser

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
looking and it's a much coarser

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.479 
looking and it's a much coarser
arrangement<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.230> would<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> fantastic

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
arrangement this would be a fantastic

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.520 
arrangement this would be a fantastic
plan<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:44.629> you<00:00:45.629> know<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> nice<00:00:45.960> big<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.410> in

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
plan to have you know a nice big one in

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.440 
plan to have you know a nice big one in
the<00:00:46.559> gardens<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.700> wouldn't<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.180> going

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the gardens but it wouldn't it's going

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.880 
the gardens but it wouldn't it's going
to<00:00:48.480> need<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> really<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.920> protected<00:00:50.700> spot

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
to need a really really protected spot

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.410 
to need a really really protected spot
yeah<00:00:52.890> I'm<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.670> quite<00:00:53.820> excited<00:00:54.270> when<00:00:54.390> we

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
yeah I'm really quite excited when we

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.080 
yeah I'm really quite excited when we
got<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.170> couple<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.710> years<00:00:55.770> ago<00:00:56.039> 45<00:00:56.789> years

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
got this a couple of years ago 45 years

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
got this a couple of years ago 45 years
ago<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.260> relatively<00:00:58.680> slow

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
ago you can see it's relatively slow

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.160 
ago you can see it's relatively slow
growing<00:00:59.280> right<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> edge<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.750> hardiness

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
growing right on the edge of hardiness

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.860 
growing right on the edge of hardiness
so<00:01:01.460> probably<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.879> gets<00:01:03.120> older<00:01:03.629> what

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
so probably when this gets older what

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.270 
so probably when this gets older what
we're<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.619> start<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
we're going to have to start to do is

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.690 
we're going to have to start to do is
wrap<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.939> burlap<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:08.010> protect<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.520> unless

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
wrap it in burlap to protect it unless

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.149 
wrap it in burlap to protect it unless
we<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.000> global<00:01:09.420> warming<00:01:10.010> acceleration<00:01:11.010> I'm

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
we get global warming acceleration I'm

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.310 
we get global warming acceleration I'm
all<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.490> global<00:01:11.880> warming<00:01:11.960> give<00:01:12.960> us<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.200> know

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
all for global warming give us you know

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.980 
all for global warming give us you know
another<00:01:13.530> five<00:01:13.770> degrees<00:01:14.570> in<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> winter<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
another five degrees in the winter and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.950 
another five degrees in the winter and
I've<00:01:16.320> been<00:01:16.439> fine<00:01:17.330> we<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.450> grow<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> lot<00:01:18.810> more

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I've been fine we can grow a lot more

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.219 
I've been fine we can grow a lot more
things<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.470> won't<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.920> move<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:22.110> it

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
really really elegant to classy but

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.520 
really really elegant to classy but
fairly<00:01:26.340> rare<00:01:27.150> plant<00:01:27.540> no<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> see<00:01:28.049> fairly<00:01:28.290> rare

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
fairly rare plant no I see fairly rare

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
fairly rare plant no I see fairly rare
but<00:01:28.770> you're<00:01:29.280> all<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:30.030> where<00:01:30.270> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
but you're all going to know where that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.640 
but you're all going to know where that
you're<00:01:30.540> going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.720> source<00:01:31.020> these<00:01:31.290> things

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
you're going to source these things

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.640 
you're going to source these things
because<00:01:32.130> you're<00:01:32.820> professionals<00:01:33.450> right<00:01:33.689> so

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
because you're professionals right so

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.410 
because you're professionals right so
the<00:01:34.799> obvious<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.280> whistling<00:01:35.759> gardens<00:01:36.180> but

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the obvious one is whistling gardens but

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.929 
the obvious one is whistling gardens but
I<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:37.079> probably<00:01:37.229> find<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.860> five<00:01:38.369> nursery

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
I can probably find this in five nursery

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.359 
I can probably find this in five nursery
you<00:01:39.720> go<00:01:39.840> back<00:01:40.020> 15<00:01:40.500> years<00:01:40.650> ago<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.009> couldn't
