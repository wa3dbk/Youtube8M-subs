hey everybody my name is dole mail and
this<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.660> my<00:00:15.660> tutorial<00:00:16.170> about<00:00:16.199> step<00:00:16.859> animation

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
this is my tutorial about step animation

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.519 
this is my tutorial about step animation
and<00:00:17.580> more<00:00:17.730> specifically<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.840> move<00:00:19.140> from

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and more specifically how to move from

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.480 
and more specifically how to move from
step<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.029> final<00:00:21.420> smooth<00:00:21.750> animation<00:00:22.289> and

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
step to the final smooth animation and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.310 
step to the final smooth animation and
that's<00:00:23.490> something<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.359> lot<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.539> my<00:00:24.779> students

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
that's something a lot of my students

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.290 
that's something a lot of my students
have<00:00:25.650> been<00:00:25.800> asking<00:00:26.070> me<00:00:26.279> about<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.820> even

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
have been asking me about and even

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.200 
have been asking me about and even
colleagues<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:28.050> well<00:00:28.429> and<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.609> never<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
colleagues as well and I never have the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.179 
colleagues as well and I never have the
time<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.630> sit<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> fully<00:00:31.380> explain<00:00:31.830> everything

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
time to sit and fully explain everything

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.180 
time to sit and fully explain everything
and<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:33.149> hope<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.570> will<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> trick<00:00:34.380> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and I hope this will do the trick and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.680 
and I hope this will do the trick and
the<00:00:35.280> reason<00:00:35.579> I'm<00:00:35.670> doing<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.149> English<00:00:36.239> which

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
the reason I'm doing it in English which

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.330 
the reason I'm doing it in English which
is<00:00:36.870> not<00:00:37.050> my<00:00:37.230> native<00:00:37.410> language<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.190> can

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
is not my native language as you can

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.810 
is not my native language as you can
hear<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.600> more<00:00:39.780> people<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.230> enjoy<00:00:40.290> it

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
hear is so that more people can enjoy it

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.569 
hear is so that more people can enjoy it
so<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> hope<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.360> enjoy<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.579> let's

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
so I hope you do enjoy it and let's

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.690 
so I hope you do enjoy it and let's
begin<00:00:45.320> what<00:00:46.320> we're<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.739> talk<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.129> in

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
begin what we're going to talk about in

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.630 
begin what we're going to talk about in
this<00:00:48.120> first<00:00:48.690> part<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> tutorial<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.920> why

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
this first part of the tutorial is why

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.670 
this first part of the tutorial is why
you<00:00:50.700> stepped<00:00:51.239> at<00:00:51.420> all<00:00:51.600> what's<00:00:52.350> good<00:00:52.649> about

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
you stepped at all what's good about

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.529 
you stepped at all what's good about
step<00:00:53.930> method<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.879> unhappy

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
step method so we have this unhappy

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.900 
step method so we have this unhappy
green<00:00:58.260> guy<00:00:58.500> which<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.920> did<00:00:59.100> from<00:00:59.340> primitives

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
green guy which I did from primitives

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.209 
green guy which I did from primitives
it's<00:01:00.149> not<00:01:00.329> even<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> rig<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.620> reason<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.010> did

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
it's not even the rig the reason I did

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.429 
it's not even the rig the reason I did
it<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.489> way<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.149> probably<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.840> make<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
it this way is probably to make it a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.109 
it this way is probably to make it a
femaie<00:01:04.920> little<00:01:05.220> bit<00:01:05.309> more<00:01:05.519> simple<00:01:05.970> and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
femaie little bit more simple and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.620 
femaie little bit more simple and
universe<00:01:07.189> Universal<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.460> all<00:01:08.640> programs<00:01:11.630> so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
universe Universal for all programs so

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.870 
universe Universal for all programs so
here<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.710> we're<00:01:14.220> gonna<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.640> this

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
here here we have we're gonna have this

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.170 
here here we have we're gonna have this
guy<00:01:17.900> look<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.049> little<00:01:19.259> bit<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> side<00:01:20.180> we're

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
guy look a little bit to the side we're

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.670 
guy look a little bit to the side we're
gonna<00:01:21.479> design<00:01:21.979> this<00:01:23.150> pose<00:01:24.150> move<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.200> body<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
gonna design this pose move this body a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.560 
gonna design this pose move this body a
little<00:01:25.860> bit<00:01:26.060> because<00:01:28.700> buddy<00:01:29.700> always<00:01:30.119> moves<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
little bit because buddy always moves a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
little bit because buddy always moves a
little<00:01:30.689> bit<00:01:30.930> whenever<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.890> move<00:01:32.130> something

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
little bit whenever we move something

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.899 
little bit whenever we move something
and<00:01:33.180> ok<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.579> eyebrows<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.939> find<00:01:36.329> it

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
and ok with the eyebrows just find it

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.010 
and ok with the eyebrows just find it
subtle<00:01:38.909> eyebrow<00:01:39.299> thing<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:41.210> yeah<00:01:42.210> I'm<00:01:42.840> not

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
subtle eyebrow thing here yeah I'm not

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.170 
subtle eyebrow thing here yeah I'm not
gonna<00:01:43.170> put<00:01:43.439> too<00:01:43.710> much<00:01:43.890> time<00:01:44.189> into<00:01:44.250> really

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
gonna put too much time into really

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.219 
gonna put too much time into really
making<00:01:45.570> these<00:01:45.720> these<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.770> poses<00:01:47.040> wonderful

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
making these these this poses wonderful

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.410 
making these these this poses wonderful
that's<00:01:49.229> not<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> point<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.460> of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that's not really the point of this of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.730 
that's not really the point of this of
the<00:01:51.720> exercise<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:53.509> guess<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.930> good<00:01:55.470> enough

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the exercise I guess this is good enough

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.420 
the exercise I guess this is good enough
is<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.189> open<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.729> side

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
is just open to the side

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.840 
is just open to the side
okay<00:01:59.480> and<00:02:00.480> as<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.930> see<00:02:01.310> first<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.610> I

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
okay and as you can see first of all I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.100 
okay and as you can see first of all I
don't<00:02:03.300> I<00:02:04.260> don't<00:02:04.680> really<00:02:05.240> care<00:02:06.240> about<00:02:06.480> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
don't I don't really care about the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.320 
don't I don't really care about the
timing<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.950> moment<00:02:08.310> I'm<00:02:08.490> just<00:02:08.550> designing

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
timing at the moment I'm just designing

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.930 
timing at the moment I'm just designing
these<00:02:09.840> drawings<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:11.100> call<00:02:11.370> them<00:02:11.550> drawings

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
these drawings and I call them drawings

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.940 
these drawings and I call them drawings
because<00:02:12.390> coming<00:02:12.690> from<00:02:12.810> 2d<00:02:13.350> it's<00:02:13.470> very<00:02:13.680> natural

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
because coming from 2d it's very natural

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.580 
because coming from 2d it's very natural
for<00:02:14.400> me<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.760> work<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:16.730> defining<00:02:17.730> moments

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
for me to work with defining moments

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.740 
for me to work with defining moments
what<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:19.710> doing<00:02:19.950> now<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.430> I'm<00:02:20.670> defining<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
story point we fight which I designed

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.800 
story point we fight which I designed
earlier<00:02:39.420> on<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:41.190> where<00:02:41.670> he<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:41.940> very<00:02:42.330> surprised

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
earlier on is where he is very surprised

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.980 
earlier on is where he is very surprised
about<00:02:43.020> something<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.090> what<00:02:45.090> I'm<00:02:45.209> doing<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.750> is

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
about something and what I'm doing it is

about something and what I'm doing it is
I'm<00:02:46.320> flipping<00:02:47.190> these<00:02:47.400> drawings<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:48.600> see<00:02:48.870> how

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
I'm flipping these drawings to see how

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.600 
I'm flipping these drawings to see how
my<00:02:49.640> scene<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.670> playing<00:02:51.030> out<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.459> can<00:02:53.459> also

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
my scene is playing out so I can also

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.540 
my scene is playing out so I can also
flip<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.060> flip<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.810> timing<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:56.070> go<00:02:56.370> like

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
flip it flip it in timing like go like

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.310 
flip it flip it in timing like go like
ah<00:02:58.730> alright<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.000> then<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.630> can<00:03:00.810> see<00:03:00.990> if<00:03:01.110> my

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
ah alright and then I can see if my

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.360 
ah alright and then I can see if my
story<00:03:01.680> points<00:03:02.250> work<00:03:02.910> together<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:04.190> then<00:03:05.190> why

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
story points work together and then why

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.270 
story points work together and then why
what<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:06.000> do<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:07.010> time<00:03:08.010> this

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
what I can do is I can just time this

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.180 
what I can do is I can just time this
whole<00:03:08.519> thing<00:03:08.790> put<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:10.010> on<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.730> timeline<00:03:12.239> and

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
whole thing put it on the timeline and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.100 
whole thing put it on the timeline and
press<00:03:14.190> play<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.820> see<00:03:15.360> if<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.750> what<00:03:16.080> I

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
press play and see if this is what I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.040 
press play and see if this is what I
wanted<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.560> see<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:18.390> that's<00:03:18.540> pretty<00:03:18.780> good

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
wanted to see and that's pretty good

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:30.170 
wanted to see and that's pretty good
ah<00:03:22.489> right<00:03:24.380> so<00:03:26.630> that's<00:03:27.630> all<00:03:27.840> very<00:03:28.080> easy<00:03:29.180> but

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
ah right so that's all very easy but

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.550 
ah right so that's all very easy but
what<00:03:30.330> happens<00:03:30.920> if<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.130> don't<00:03:32.310> work<00:03:32.430> instead

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
what happens if I don't work instead

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.380 
what happens if I don't work instead
let's<00:03:34.560> see<00:03:34.790> I'm<00:03:35.790> gonna<00:03:36.030> just<00:03:36.360> make<00:03:37.970> this<00:03:38.970> into

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
let's see I'm gonna just make this into

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.070 
let's see I'm gonna just make this into
a<00:03:39.420> linear<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:41.790> lot<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.090> strange<00:03:42.540> things<00:03:42.930> are

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
a linear and a lot of strange things are

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.150 
a linear and a lot of strange things are
going<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.500> happen<00:03:43.650> now

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
going to happen now

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.960 
going to happen now
and<00:03:44.250> there<00:03:44.730> are<00:03:44.850> several<00:03:46.010> reasons<00:03:47.010> for<00:03:47.340> this

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
and there are several reasons for this

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.110 
and there are several reasons for this
one<00:03:48.330> reason<00:03:48.540> is<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:50.220> didn't<00:03:50.610> really<00:03:50.910> work

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
one reason is that I didn't really work

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.780 
one reason is that I didn't really work
in<00:03:51.600> an<00:03:51.690> organized<00:03:52.110> way<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.650> don't<00:03:53.010> have<00:03:53.220> keys<00:03:53.550> on

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
in an organized way I don't have keys on

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.140 
in an organized way I don't have keys on
all<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.120> all<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.049> elements<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:56.150> car

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
all the all of the elements of the car

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.390 
all the all of the elements of the car
they're<00:03:57.450> here<00:03:57.750> but<00:03:58.560> that's<00:03:58.739> part<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
they're here but that's part of the

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.570 
they're here but that's part of the
point<00:03:59.640> that<00:03:59.790> I'm<00:03:59.940> going<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.269> make<00:04:01.310> when<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.340> work

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
point that I'm going to make when I work

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.310 
point that I'm going to make when I work
in<00:04:02.730> step<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.239> don't<00:04:03.450> have<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.870> work<00:04:04.049> in<00:04:04.200> an

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
in step I don't have to work in an

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.800 
in step I don't have to work in an
organized<00:04:04.709> way<00:04:04.890> because<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:06.120> doesn't<00:04:06.480> have<00:04:06.630> to

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
organized way because it doesn't have to

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.660 
organized way because it doesn't have to
play<00:04:07.020> smoothly<00:04:07.500> from<00:04:07.830> one<00:04:07.920> -<00:04:08.370> not<00:04:08.640> from<00:04:09.209> one

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
play smoothly from one - not from one

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.960 
play smoothly from one - not from one
pose<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.150> other<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:12.280> it's<00:04:13.280> very<00:04:13.370> easy<00:04:13.790> to

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
pose to the other and it's very easy to

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.240 
pose to the other and it's very easy to
not<00:04:14.420> think<00:04:14.750> about<00:04:14.930> what<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:15.560> looks<00:04:15.800> like<00:04:16.010> in

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
not think about what it looks like in

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.940 
not think about what it looks like in
the<00:04:16.370> graph<00:04:16.579> editor<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:17.299> not<00:04:17.570> think<00:04:17.870> about<00:04:18.019> what

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
the graph editor to not think about what

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.240 
the graph editor to not think about what
I<00:04:18.980> have<00:04:19.370> kid<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:20.030> what<00:04:20.720> else<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.139> if<00:04:21.859> I<00:04:22.010> wanna

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
I have kid and what else and if I wanna

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.350 
I have kid and what else and if I wanna
change<00:04:22.700> in<00:04:23.150> other<00:04:23.810> words<00:04:24.110> from<00:04:24.500> FK<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.700> K<00:04:25.880> in

change in other words from FK to I K in

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
the middle of the animation that's fine

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.370 
the middle of the animation that's fine
I<00:04:27.830> don't<00:04:28.040> have<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.490> worry<00:04:29.030> about<00:04:29.240> this<00:04:29.690> at<00:04:30.020> this

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
I don't have to worry about this at this

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.670 
I don't have to worry about this at this
stage<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.610> just<00:04:31.910> have<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.630> do<00:04:32.930> whatever<00:04:33.169> I<00:04:33.440> have

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
stage I just have to do whatever I have

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.460 
stage I just have to do whatever I have
to<00:04:33.830> do<00:04:33.980> to<00:04:34.550> make<00:04:34.760> my<00:04:35.389> drawings<00:04:35.870> look<00:04:36.139> really

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
to do to make my drawings look really

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.640 
to do to make my drawings look really
nice<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:36.889> define<00:04:37.730> design<00:04:38.480> my<00:04:39.020> scene<00:04:39.320> in<00:04:39.470> this

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
nice and define design my scene in this

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.879 
nice and define design my scene in this
way<00:04:39.860> so<00:04:40.760> what<00:04:41.600> you<00:04:41.750> can<00:04:41.930> see<00:04:42.169> here<00:04:42.410> that<00:04:42.590> even

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
way so what you can see here that even

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.640 
way so what you can see here that even
my<00:04:43.190> pose<00:04:43.490> poses<00:04:44.479> when<00:04:44.660> I<00:04:44.690> flip<00:04:45.080> them<00:04:45.229> like<00:04:45.440> that

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
my pose poses when I flip them like that

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.820 
my pose poses when I flip them like that
don't<00:04:45.950> look<00:04:46.280> so<00:04:46.520> good<00:04:46.729> because<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.300> this

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
don't look so good because of this

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.760 
don't look so good because of this
problem<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:51.020> other<00:04:51.200> thing<00:04:51.470> is<00:04:51.590> of<00:04:51.620> course

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
problem the other thing is of course

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.490 
problem the other thing is of course
that<00:04:52.100> it<00:04:52.250> doesn't<00:04:52.550> move<00:04:52.700> in<00:04:53.389> anything<00:04:53.810> similar

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
that it doesn't move in anything similar

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.520 
that it doesn't move in anything similar
to<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:55.280> timing<00:04:55.729> that<00:04:55.910> I<00:04:55.940> have<00:04:56.180> in<00:04:56.300> mind<00:04:56.540> so<00:04:57.169> to

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
to the timing that I have in mind so to

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.909 
to the timing that I have in mind so to
be<00:04:58.310> able<00:04:58.639> to<00:04:58.820> if<00:04:59.270> I<00:04:59.450> want<00:04:59.690> to<00:04:59.840> make<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.200> look

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
be able to if I want to make it look

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.230 
be able to if I want to make it look
like<00:05:01.100> something<00:05:01.700> that<00:05:03.729> is<00:05:04.729> going<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.060> be

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
like something that is going to be

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.810 
like something that is going to be
similar<00:05:05.479> to<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.840> end<00:05:06.050> result<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:07.340> I<00:05:07.430> have<00:05:07.580> to

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
similar to the end result and I have to

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.719 
similar to the end result and I have to
first<00:05:08.780> of<00:05:08.900> all<00:05:08.990> organize<00:05:09.500> what<00:05:10.310> I<00:05:10.340> did<00:05:10.580> before

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
first of all organize what I did before

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.480 
first of all organize what I did before
and<00:05:11.479> then<00:05:11.630> change<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:12.139> into<00:05:12.320> linear<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:13.190> then

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
and then change it into linear and then

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.510 
and then change it into linear and then
probably<00:05:14.479> do<00:05:14.870> something<00:05:15.169> like<00:05:15.530> this<00:05:17.080> drag<00:05:18.520> our

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
probably do something like this drag our

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:28.120 
probably do something like this drag our
making<00:05:19.940> keys<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.630> dragging<00:05:21.260> them<00:05:21.470> and<00:05:27.130> this

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
making keys and dragging them and this

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.950 
making keys and dragging them and this
is<00:05:28.190> going<00:05:28.520> to<00:05:28.789> look<00:05:28.940> like<00:05:28.970> this<00:05:29.330> now<00:05:29.510> so<00:05:29.780> this

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
is going to look like this now so this

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.990 
is going to look like this now so this
is<00:05:30.020> a<00:05:30.200> little<00:05:30.500> bit<00:05:30.770> more<00:05:30.979> similar<00:05:31.280> which<00:05:31.970> is

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
is a little bit more similar which is

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.540 
is a little bit more similar which is
something<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:32.600> can<00:05:32.780> also<00:05:32.930> already<00:05:33.680> sort<00:05:34.460> of

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
something I can also already sort of

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.440 
something I can also already sort of
work<00:05:34.940> with<00:05:35.180> but<00:05:35.870> here's<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.740> problem

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
work with but here's the problem

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.010 
work with but here's the problem
now<00:05:38.450> I<00:05:38.840> have<00:05:39.530> five<00:05:39.800> kids<00:05:40.750> explaining<00:05:41.750> exactly

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
now I have five kids explaining exactly

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.400 
now I have five kids explaining exactly
what<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:42.910> explained<00:05:43.910> before<00:05:44.000> with<00:05:44.870> just<00:05:44.900> three

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
what I explained before with just three

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.250 
what I explained before with just three
keys<00:05:45.650> and<00:05:46.280> what<00:05:46.460> it<00:05:46.580> means<00:05:46.729> is<00:05:47.030> two<00:05:47.330> problems

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
keys and what it means is two problems

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.610 
keys and what it means is two problems
for<00:05:48.500> me<00:05:48.620> one<00:05:49.340> is<00:05:49.580> that<00:05:50.030> I<00:05:50.270> can't<00:05:50.660> do<00:05:50.990> the

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
for me one is that I can't do the

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.960 
for me one is that I can't do the
flipping<00:05:51.919> thing<00:05:52.250> anymore<00:05:52.640> because<00:05:52.760> now<00:05:52.850> I

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
flipping thing anymore because now I

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.050 
flipping thing anymore because now I
have<00:05:53.210> too<00:05:53.450> many<00:05:54.010> he's<00:05:55.010> over<00:05:55.820> here

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
have too many he's over here

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.550 
have too many he's over here
too<00:05:56.270> many<00:05:56.390> drawings<00:05:56.660> I<00:05:56.870> have<00:05:56.990> five<00:05:57.260> drawings

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
too many drawings I have five drawings

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.940 
too many drawings I have five drawings
and<00:05:58.000> I<00:05:59.000> can't<00:05:59.570> really<00:05:59.750> see<00:06:00.140> my<00:06:00.380> scene<00:06:00.710> as

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
and I can't really see my scene as

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.159 
and I can't really see my scene as
clearly<00:06:01.550> as<00:06:01.760> I<00:06:01.940> saw<00:06:02.150> it<00:06:02.300> before<00:06:02.630> when<00:06:02.810> I<00:06:02.840> flip

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
clearly as I saw it before when I flip

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.340 
clearly as I saw it before when I flip
the<00:06:04.100> other<00:06:04.220> problem<00:06:04.760> is<00:06:04.910> that<00:06:04.970> when<00:06:05.330> I'm<00:06:05.510> gonna

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
the other problem is that when I'm gonna

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.950 
the other problem is that when I'm gonna
if<00:06:07.130> I<00:06:07.340> want<00:06:07.550> to<00:06:07.639> change<00:06:07.940> anything<00:06:08.300> let's<00:06:08.720> say<00:06:08.930> I

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
if I want to change anything let's say I

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.650 
if I want to change anything let's say I
want<00:06:09.260> this<00:06:09.440> guy<00:06:09.919> they<00:06:10.700> supposed<00:06:11.000> to<00:06:11.090> be<00:06:11.180> to<00:06:11.570> be

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
want this guy they supposed to be to be

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.570 
want this guy they supposed to be to be
like<00:06:11.690> that<00:06:11.990> I<00:06:12.020> want<00:06:12.260> to<00:06:12.350> try<00:06:12.530> that<00:06:12.710> but<00:06:13.370> now

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
like that I want to try that but now

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.219 
like that I want to try that but now
that's<00:06:13.850> not<00:06:14.180> gonna<00:06:14.360> work<00:06:14.570> with<00:06:14.840> everything

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
that's not gonna work with everything

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.779 
that's not gonna work with everything
else<00:06:15.560> that<00:06:15.770> I<00:06:15.830> did<00:06:16.070> here<00:06:16.280> it's<00:06:16.400> gonna<00:06:16.550> look

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
else that I did here it's gonna look

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:19.650 
else that I did here it's gonna look
strange<00:06:17.150> again<00:06:17.450> you<00:06:17.570> see

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
strange again you see

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.060 
strange again you see
something<00:06:20.660> very<00:06:20.900> very<00:06:21.140> strange<00:06:21.560> so<00:06:21.860> what<00:06:22.040> I

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
something very very strange so what I

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.270 
something very very strange so what I
have<00:06:22.250> to<00:06:22.430> do<00:06:22.610> to<00:06:23.060> fix<00:06:23.240> that<00:06:23.360> is<00:06:23.810> to<00:06:24.110> fix<00:06:24.920> it<00:06:25.130> in

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
have to do to fix that is to fix it in

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.820 
have to do to fix that is to fix it in
two<00:06:25.430> places<00:06:25.580> I<00:06:26.000> have<00:06:26.150> to<00:06:26.300> fix<00:06:26.480> it<00:06:26.660> in<00:06:27.230> this

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
two places I have to fix it in this

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.680 
two places I have to fix it in this
drawing<00:06:28.130> and<00:06:28.400> in<00:06:28.670> this<00:06:28.820> drawing<00:06:29.090> so<00:06:31.480> all<00:06:32.480> of<00:06:32.600> a

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
drawing and in this drawing so all of a

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.780 
drawing and in this drawing so all of a
sudden<00:06:33.050> something<00:06:33.440> that<00:06:33.590> was<00:06:33.740> very<00:06:33.950> very<00:06:34.340> easy

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:34.790 
sudden something that was very very easy

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.300 
sudden something that was very very easy
before<00:06:35.060> with<00:06:35.840> the<00:06:35.960> step<00:06:36.230> now<00:06:36.500> becomes<00:06:36.920> really

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
before with the step now becomes really

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.240 
before with the step now becomes really
complicated<00:06:37.970> and<00:06:38.750> I<00:06:39.020> have<00:06:39.170> to<00:06:39.350> think<00:06:39.650> about<00:06:39.860> a

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
complicated and I have to think about a

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.370 
complicated and I have to think about a
lot<00:06:40.640> of<00:06:40.700> things<00:06:41.090> when<00:06:41.330> I'm<00:06:41.480> working<00:06:41.870> that's

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
lot of things when I'm working that's

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.650 
lot of things when I'm working that's
exactly<00:06:42.920> what<00:06:43.100> I<00:06:43.130> don't<00:06:43.250> want<00:06:43.460> to<00:06:43.670> do<00:06:43.850> I<00:06:44.060> want

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.660 
exactly what I don't want to do I want

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.380 
exactly what I don't want to do I want
to<00:06:44.840> do<00:06:45.370> I'm<00:06:46.370> going<00:06:46.550> to<00:06:46.640> go<00:06:46.790> back<00:06:47.000> to<00:06:47.030> the

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
to do I'm going to go back to the

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:54.810 
to do I'm going to go back to the
stepped<00:06:48.220> situation<00:06:51.730> what<00:06:52.730> I<00:06:52.760> want<00:06:53.090> to<00:06:53.210> do<00:06:53.390> is

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
stepped situation what I want to do is

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.840 
stepped situation what I want to do is
to<00:06:55.820> be<00:06:55.970> able<00:06:56.150> to<00:06:56.420> work<00:06:58.150> on<00:06:59.150> just<00:06:59.810> these<00:07:00.350> three

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:00.850 
to be able to work on just these three

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.050 
to be able to work on just these three
key<00:07:01.850> moments<00:07:02.390> and<00:07:02.510> when<00:07:03.380> I<00:07:03.410> watch<00:07:03.680> it<00:07:03.890> it<00:07:04.820> just

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 
key moments and when I watch it it just

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.750 
key moments and when I watch it it just
works<00:07:05.470> and<00:07:06.470> I<00:07:06.560> can<00:07:06.740> show<00:07:06.920> it<00:07:06.950> to<00:07:07.070> my<00:07:07.250> director

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
works and I can show it to my director

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.780 
works and I can show it to my director
and<00:07:08.390> he<00:07:08.840> can<00:07:09.050> tell<00:07:09.710> me<00:07:09.770> what<00:07:10.370> he<00:07:10.460> thinks<00:07:10.610> about

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
and he can tell me what he thinks about

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.030 
and he can tell me what he thinks about
it<00:07:11.060> and<00:07:11.390> that's<00:07:12.050> all<00:07:12.260> very<00:07:12.470> very<00:07:12.770> easy<00:07:14.290> so<00:07:15.290> this

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040 
it and that's all very very easy so this

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.710 
it and that's all very very easy so this
concludes<00:07:16.280> the<00:07:16.760> first<00:07:16.970> part<00:07:17.300> of<00:07:17.450> the<00:07:17.600> tutorial

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 
concludes the first part of the tutorial

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.530 
concludes the first part of the tutorial
we<00:07:18.590> were<00:07:18.710> talking<00:07:19.040> about<00:07:19.130> the<00:07:19.850> advantages<00:07:20.480> of

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:20.540 
we were talking about the advantages of

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.490 
we were talking about the advantages of
using<00:07:20.690> step<00:07:21.400> mode<00:07:22.400> and<00:07:22.900> on<00:07:23.900> the<00:07:23.990> next<00:07:24.290> time

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500 
using step mode and on the next time

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.290 
using step mode and on the next time
we're<00:07:25.040> going<00:07:25.220> to<00:07:25.430> discuss<00:07:25.790> a<00:07:25.820> little<00:07:25.910> bit<00:07:26.210> of

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.300 
we're going to discuss a little bit of

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.560 
we're going to discuss a little bit of
the<00:07:26.390> problems<00:07:26.870> that<00:07:27.140> that<00:07:28.100> the<00:07:29.090> step<00:07:29.360> mode

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.570 
the problems that that the step mode

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.220 
the problems that that the step mode
gives<00:07:29.870> us<00:07:30.050> and<00:07:30.260> how<00:07:30.650> to<00:07:30.710> how<00:07:31.400> we<00:07:31.460> solve<00:07:31.820> them<00:07:32.230> so

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.230 
gives us and how to how we solve them so

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.650 
gives us and how to how we solve them so
I<00:07:33.260> hope<00:07:33.650> you<00:07:33.830> did<00:07:34.010> enjoy<00:07:34.040> this<00:07:34.520> this<00:07:35.390> first
