Juniper Ridge is also the site for the
city's<00:00:02.750> newest<00:00:03.080> roundabout<00:00:03.679> but<00:00:03.889> this<00:00:04.070> one<00:00:04.280> is

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
city's newest roundabout but this one is

city's newest roundabout but this one is
a<00:00:04.490> little<00:00:04.580> bit<00:00:04.880> different<00:00:05.300> it's<00:00:05.750> a<00:00:05.900> multi-lane

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
a little bit different it's a multi-lane

eighteenth Street and Cooley road well
we<00:00:10.610> we<00:00:10.880> found<00:00:11.150> out<00:00:11.330> the<00:00:11.360> multi-lane

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
we we found out the multi-lane

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.049 
we we found out the multi-lane
roundabout<00:00:12.830> here<00:00:13.220> at<00:00:13.400> the<00:00:13.550> center<00:00:13.849> section

roundabout here at the center section
eighteenth<00:00:14.599> and<00:00:14.809> Cooley<00:00:15.110> will<00:00:15.349> actually

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
eighteenth and Cooley will actually

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.279 
eighteenth and Cooley will actually
perform<00:00:16.309> better<00:00:16.820> than<00:00:17.150> a<00:00:17.179> traffic<00:00:17.749> signal<00:00:17.929> and

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
perform better than a traffic signal and

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.829 
perform better than a traffic signal and
what<00:00:18.829> we<00:00:18.949> mean<00:00:19.159> by<00:00:19.310> that<00:00:19.519> is<00:00:19.789> that<00:00:19.820> safety<00:00:20.599> it's

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:20.839 
what we mean by that is that safety it's

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.749 
what we mean by that is that safety it's
going<00:00:20.989> to<00:00:21.050> be<00:00:21.140> much<00:00:21.320> safer<00:00:21.529> intersection<00:00:22.279> it's

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
going to be much safer intersection it's

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.099 
going to be much safer intersection it's
also<00:00:22.880> going<00:00:23.089> to<00:00:23.179> carry<00:00:23.419> a<00:00:23.480> lot<00:00:23.659> more<00:00:23.689> traffic

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
also going to carry a lot more traffic

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.319 
also going to carry a lot more traffic
the<00:00:24.829> city<00:00:25.069> analyzed<00:00:25.550> both<00:00:25.789> the<00:00:25.970> traffic

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329 
the city analyzed both the traffic

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.179 
the city analyzed both the traffic
signal<00:00:26.509> and<00:00:26.810> around<00:00:27.109> about<00:00:27.349> for<00:00:27.980> this

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
signal and around about for this

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.620 
signal and around about for this
intersection<00:00:28.669> at<00:00:28.909> cooley<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:29.269> eighteenth

intersection at cooley and eighteenth

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.630 
intersection at cooley and eighteenth
Street<00:00:29.960> we<00:00:30.439> found<00:00:30.739> that<00:00:30.979> the<00:00:31.159> multi-lane

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
Street we found that the multi-lane

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.549 
Street we found that the multi-lane
roundabout<00:00:32.180> operated<00:00:32.809> more<00:00:32.930> efficiently

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
roundabout operated more efficiently

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.920 
roundabout operated more efficiently
than<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.920> traffic<00:00:34.489> signal<00:00:34.730> plus<00:00:35.420> it<00:00:35.600> provides

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
than the traffic signal plus it provides

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.689 
than the traffic signal plus it provides
a<00:00:36.050> really<00:00:36.289> nice<00:00:36.469> gateway<00:00:36.920> feature<00:00:37.219> for<00:00:37.670> the

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
a really nice gateway feature for the

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.939 
a really nice gateway feature for the
Juniper<00:00:38.210> Ridge<00:00:38.329> complex<00:00:38.870> well<00:00:39.530> we<00:00:39.649> think<00:00:39.890> that

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
Juniper Ridge complex well we think that

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.130 
Juniper Ridge complex well we think that
it<00:00:40.129> will<00:00:40.550> handle<00:00:40.879> a<00:00:41.090> lot<00:00:41.300> more<00:00:41.329> traffic<00:00:41.750> a<00:00:42.109> lot

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
it will handle a lot more traffic a lot

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.130 
it will handle a lot more traffic a lot
safer<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:43.760> know<00:00:43.850> generally<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:44.929> know<00:00:45.050> it

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
safer and you know generally you know it

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.229 
safer and you know generally you know it
can<00:00:45.230> probably<00:00:45.769> handle<00:00:45.980> up<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.309> at<00:00:46.699> least<00:00:46.850> you

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
anywhere from 15 18 miles an hour and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.520 
anywhere from 15 18 miles an hour and
with<00:01:41.660> roundabouts<00:01:42.380> that's<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.980> that's<00:01:43.520> the

with roundabouts that's the that's the
approach<00:01:45.530> speed<00:01:45.830> is<00:01:46.040> what<00:01:46.250> really<00:01:46.430> makes

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
approach speed is what really makes

assignments<00:01:49.220> will<00:01:49.700> vary<00:01:50.060> sometimes<00:01:50.510> it's<00:01:50.900> a
