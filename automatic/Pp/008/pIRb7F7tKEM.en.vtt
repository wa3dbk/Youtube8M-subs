and<00:00:48.480> their<00:00:48.870> negatives<00:00:49.550> you<00:00:50.550> need<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and their negatives you need the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.910 
and their negatives you need the
negatives<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.899> want<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.199> account<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.649> how

need or expect such as one less serving
of<00:00:58.050> food<00:00:58.320> than<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> number<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.070> people<00:00:59.359> four

integers<00:01:00.930> not<00:01:01.410> only<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.010> always<00:01:02.190> find<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
integers not only can you always find a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.149 
integers not only can you always find a
greater<00:01:03.000> one<00:01:03.300> than<00:01:03.329> any<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.930> choose<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.920> also

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
greater one than any you choose you also

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.399 
greater one than any you choose you also
can<00:01:05.489> always<00:01:05.880> find<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.240> lesser<00:01:06.570> one<00:01:06.720> just

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
can always find a lesser one just

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 
can always find a lesser one just
subtract<00:01:07.830> one<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.479> about<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.810> numbers

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
subtract one so what about the numbers

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.490 
subtract one so what about the numbers
in<00:01:10.290> between<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:11.280> fractions<00:01:11.670> or<00:01:12.090> decimals

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.130 
part milk to every eight parts powdered
sugar<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.790> write<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.240> as<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> rational

sugar you can write this as the rational

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.710 
sugar you can write this as the rational

a<00:01:45.830> rational<00:01:46.830> number<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.250> any<00:01:47.280> number<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.180> can

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
a rational number is any number that can

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.570 
a rational number is any number that can
be<00:01:48.390> expressed<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.200> ratio<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.740> integers<00:01:50.010> a

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
be expressed as a ratio of integers a

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.520 
be expressed as a ratio of integers a
fraction<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.480> which<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.810> numerator<00:01:52.260> and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
fraction in which the numerator and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.730 
fraction in which the numerator and
denominator<00:01:52.590> are<00:01:53.370> both<00:01:53.760> integers<00:01:54.740> for

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
denominator are both integers for

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.190 
denominator are both integers for
example<00:01:56.160> one<00:01:56.760> half<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> rational<00:01:57.750> number

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
example one half is a rational number

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.440 
example one half is a rational number
so<00:01:58.980> is<00:01:59.130> 2/3<00:01:59.700> 5/8<00:02:00.770> 7/16<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> denominator

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
so is 2/3 5/8 7/16 but the denominator

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.950 
so is 2/3 5/8 7/16 but the denominator
can<00:02:03.750> never<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.260> zero<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:06.180> could<00:02:06.390> also<00:02:06.540> say

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
can never be zero you could also say

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
can never be zero you could also say
that<00:02:06.990> any<00:02:07.380> integer<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.070> a<00:02:08.100> rational<00:02:08.729> number

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
that any integer is a rational number

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.700 
that any integer is a rational number
because<00:02:09.210> you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.840> think<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.290> as<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> ratio

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
because you can think of it as a ratio

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.380 
because you can think of it as a ratio
of<00:02:10.950> integers<00:02:11.600> itself<00:02:12.600> over<00:02:13.910> 1/4<00:02:14.910> can<00:02:15.270> be

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
of integers itself over 1/4 can be

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.920
