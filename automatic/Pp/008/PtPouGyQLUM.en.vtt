00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 like everyone for found this 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.640
 appointment as the what corner 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.130
 let's talk today something happened if but 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.320
 the sucker you want to know what 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.389
 very simple I bought playstation 4 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.809
 instead of the watch that I didn't get out of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.090
 set to buy iwatch if it were 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.740
 never released on June 2nd in the light 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.230
 beautiful but since it didn't come out 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.590
 obviously opt for playstation 4 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.580
 it's just that there was a little one 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.619
 drawback 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.630
 let me explain myself practically I go to the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.530
 mediaworld to this the playstation 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.890
 449 playstation 4 more watchdog game 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.500
 very famous that is now throwing everything 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.950
 the web pretty much after that it came to 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.960
 home I turn on the play and all the rest 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:52.140
 put the cd but the play or does not work 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.980
 it works better but the cd is not read 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.000
 also 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.020
 carry the playstation to the mediaworld that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.390
 by the way I got there 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.760
 practically decided because it is the port 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:08.430
 from 9pm to 3pm, then from 8 to 45 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.320
 closed the door media world at 9pm 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.090
 of Catania and trying together 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.670
 we have the mediaworld employee 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.770
 discovered a sensational thing but also 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.140
 very bad you want to know what it is 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.490
 the playstation had been 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.320
 badly assembled 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.810
 after this piece that you will see now 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.490
 you will see after the unboxing video shot 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.030
 of the first playstation 4 but that one 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.030
 before replacing it with this one 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.270
 practically what had happened to me in the century 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.310
 go get it playstation there but 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.470
 I'll show you through the box 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.690
 I do n't know if you notice here we have the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.040
 playstation led above left side 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.459
 right side 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.840
 the cd inserts here buttons and 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.180
 whatever else I'm up here 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.270
 what had this different playstation 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.490
 practically the right side was small 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.070
 to the left and the big left valpe 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.110
 I was on the right side I know not there 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.300
 you are understanding nothing but trusting 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.600
 it was so I take an even more example 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.600
 plausible 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.060
 you are about to see high graphics guys 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.760
 do not be scandalized 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.650
 this was the ps4 fake or the first 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.569
 which I took had the right side 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.980
 inverted with south with left side e 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.019
 while the small part was on the side 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.540
 opposite from the part where I had 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.760
 practically inserted the cd but it was 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.079
 virtually assembled on the contrary, 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.079
 right hand instead we have the 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.379
 real playstation was practically 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.170
 the opposite 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.579
 so much so that in the first playstation he had 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.980
 attached the power supply to the side 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.870
 left of the back of the playstation e 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.180
 the new one instead attacked on the right 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.709
 and I was suspected because 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.630
 anyway we talked about it with 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.370
 the mediaworld employee 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.590
 but the thing is even more absurd and boys 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.320
 and that this playstation 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.780
 practically it didn't work inserted the 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.539
 cd and you could hear the noise of the series but 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.400
 is 1 that is practically I was not sure 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.490
 a student inside the playstation 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.240
 4 I don't know what's inside of that 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.770
 playstation 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.630
 however it was however assembled at the 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.759
 down ie not had noticed the 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.840
 assembly line and are really gods 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:50.250
 geniuses said this is almost two days e 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.199
 a day and a half that I feel this 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.130
 playstation 4 with coach dogs ho 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.990
 purchased also for 49 99 fifa 14 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.659
 inside the playstation store and I have to 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.909
 say that graphics are wonderful 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.669
 playability of both fifa and watchdog 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.560
 are really endless walls dogs and for 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.810
 me is one of the best games that will come out 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.159
 and that came out inside the 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.460
 playstation 4 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:16.139
 I think it's like beauty on the same level 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.330
 of gta 5 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.849
 I would not dare to say that it will be 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.919
 perhaps even better, that is, a game 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.380
 I really am spectacular horners 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.400
 in love immediately said this I greet you 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.409

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.759
