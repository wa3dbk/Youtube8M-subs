00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.890
 everything is fine 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.420
 hello to all and that I have kaeser and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.390
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.399
 new video tutorial on flexible 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.070
 waiting today I'm going to you 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.379
 learn how to play in multiplayer 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.640
 on flight simulator 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.050
 as you can see right away 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 in the multiplayer menu has known him 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.260
 the option that existed before who 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.409
 was called gamespy allowed to play 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.269
 with other people in multiplayer 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.550
 unfortunately no longer exists the contract 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.949
 was terminated between gamespy microsoft 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.390
 so unfortunately we can not anymore 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.330
 play multiplayer in quotation marks 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.590
 just ambitious there is precisely I 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.799
 present to you today there are two 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.790
 possibilities to play in multiplayer 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.790
 on effect 6 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.650
 pollution is called ivan I do not know if 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.229
 you know so it's a network that 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.430
 allows you to fly simply 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.710
 finally it's just a big word 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.369
 play multiplayer with a lot 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.670
 other pilots 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.350
 so I warn you right now it's 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.050
 made for pilots 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.170
 we'll say warned is confirmed this is at 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.390
 to say the goal is to be able to fly in 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.130
 having control ie being 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.100
 controlled by controllers who are going 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.259
 give us the indications so well 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.979
 obviously they did not do it like that 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.780
 like one wants 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.130
 so we must respect everything that is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.700
 procedure and all this 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.009
 so that's so I know done for the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.890
 knowledgeable pilots they know so 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.420
 I already did a tutorial on how 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.790
 install worth so I will also do 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.700
 to regulate a video soon how 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.190
 piloting jury so go so 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.459
 now we will go to the second 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.459
 solution 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.030
 the second solution is what we 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.170
 call to machine so these two 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.450
 solutions of divides it into two parts 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.170
 what we can use is machine 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.170
 be and wolf 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.810
 so in fact hamachi it's going to create you 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.380
 a local connection it will allow you 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.820
 to play with another player remotely 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.320
 which the player will have to 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.670
 face and hamachi also that's so I 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.040
 you would link the discussion all 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.050
 you simply download for 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.750
 show you how to walk more or 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:15.200
 less the software I launch hamachi login 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.880
 so that's it under this 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.520
 form 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.560
 so that's very simple how we 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.790
 can play with another player what 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.810
 you do it is that you created a 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:32.660
 network you put what you want 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:35.150
 that's when I miss you tick and 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.220
 here you create your network here it is 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.290
 is created then give you the 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.980
 coordinates to the player who wants to play 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.170
 with crazy so once he has your 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.690
 coordinates it comes in rags of in 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.370
 join a network with the idea of the word 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.270
 pass then after you will see it 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.870
 normally displayed in the bottom I 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.650
 activated the hop network so here is once 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:05.440
 it will be displayed in the bar so that 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.970
 it's good so that's done and that's it 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.770
 that once it's done you go 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.180
 go into the facts 6 instead of 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.520
 select internal and spa caches you 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.920
 have selected local lan lan if 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.380
 you make connection up 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.380
 I remove the small errors aparis 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.740
 Here you arrive on this page which 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.300
 you have two solutions to do 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.390
 direct connection be hosted a 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.270
 session know that there is a host 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.500
 on a machine and even connects 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.870
 thing on flight simulator 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.660
 this is one that houses the other who is doing the 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.700
 connection preferably to do on the 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.770
 the person hosting also hosts 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.660
 on a6 is simpler but it does not have 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.550
 Impact makes you host a session 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.590
 here you put what you want there 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.030
 for now there is nothing was not 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.350
 of password it is useless 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.840
 not public your vote session serves to 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.580
 nothing here next you choose as 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.520
 usually weather location devices 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.430
 next ope you select the 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.450
 advanced options options up done next 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.450
 and there your network is created next 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.050
 how can your teammate help you 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.300
 rejoin 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.860
 so my age to show you I'm closing 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.080
 the session he will just have to do 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.750
 direct connection and there he will go 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.300
 an ip this eeepc the one we will find 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.960
 in the machine the ip is she will be 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.890
 displayed 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.080
 when your partner is strong your your 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.210
 friend will be connected and ben you will have 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.270
 just to copy the address that will be so 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.920
 this is an example the ip address he 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.930
 will have to come back you have to find 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.700
 session that will fetch then normally 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.130
 he's going to find you just have to 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.250
 do collages then after all is 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.250
 good 

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:58.639
 so here I am so summarized 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:02.749
 globally the two methods that 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:05.289
 allow for the two methods that 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:05.289
 allow to connect 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.419
 to know that there is another software that 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.280
 is called evolve that works on 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.500
 exactly the same principle as machine 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.910
 you're not presenting it because it's the 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.780
 same thing you have it's the same under 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.780
 the same principle 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:32.550
 if you want me to start it up 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.020
 so oslo is called game the 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.539
 uninstall more months because I 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.370
 so do not need these same principles 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.870
 you enter the ip and as I have you 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.970
 shown is normally you are well 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:46.440
 connected to your with the other player 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.789
 so here it was a little tutorial 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.259
 so to show you that there is 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:51.990
 still multiplayer solutions 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:54.889
 and I remind him once again I 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.060
 will never say enough that ivaos and not for 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.620
 laughing doing anything 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.419
 it's really if you want to 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.610
 bring closer to the real then if you want 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.130
 do cons finally at the water where I'm going 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:08.130
 do what you want to do 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:10.680
 to twist a 747 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.240
 I do not know how to take a concord and 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.570
 then go as fast as possible 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.180
 do it on do it on a market a 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.630
 warehouse nolin okay 2 it's a good 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.780
 delirium 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:24.840
 on the other hand does not do it on ivo because 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:27.030
 that frankly it's a little rotten 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.250
 will say so here it was a little 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.270
 pretty common simple tutorial 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.759
 not if you have any questions 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.440
 do not hesitate to offer me 

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.880
 tutorials if you want I 'll do them 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.919
 as far as possible 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.030
 and do not hesitate to put the green thumb 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.030
 to subscribe you liked
