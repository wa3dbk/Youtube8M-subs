00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
nothing too crazy but the main reason I

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.980 
nothing too crazy but the main reason I
actually<00:00:08.700> wanted<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.090> do<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.420> review<00:00:09.780> is

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
actually wanted to do this review is

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.049 
actually wanted to do this review is
because<00:00:10.380> lately<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> molten<00:00:11.340> lava<00:00:11.490> cake<00:00:11.820> seems

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
because lately a molten lava cake seems

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.299 
because lately a molten lava cake seems
to<00:00:12.150> be<00:00:12.240> pretty<00:00:12.420> popular<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:13.860> very<00:00:14.070> first

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
to be pretty popular the very first

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.799 
to be pretty popular the very first
place<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.730> remember<00:00:15.210> actually<00:00:15.330> having<00:00:15.780> it

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
place that I remember actually having it

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.970 
place that I remember actually having it
would<00:00:15.960> be<00:00:16.020> like<00:00:16.170> Chili's<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.680> remember<00:00:16.890> they

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
would be like Chili's I remember they

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.470 
would be like Chili's I remember they
always<00:00:17.100> had<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> molten<00:00:17.699> lava<00:00:17.730> cake<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.420> that

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
always had the molten lava cake and that

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.210 
always had the molten lava cake and that
was<00:00:18.630> their<00:00:18.779> big<00:00:18.930> deal<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.410> then<00:00:19.980> there<00:00:20.130> was

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
was their big deal and then there was

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.769 
was their big deal and then there was
Domino's<00:00:20.699> which<00:00:20.880> also<00:00:21.060> has<00:00:21.359> their<00:00:21.539> molten

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
Domino's which also has their molten

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.390 
Domino's which also has their molten
lava<00:00:21.960> cakes<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.529> I'm<00:00:22.619> pretty<00:00:22.859> sure<00:00:23.100> there's<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
lava cakes and I'm pretty sure there's a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.890 
lava cakes and I'm pretty sure there's a
few<00:00:23.580> other<00:00:23.730> places<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.449> some<00:00:24.660> kind<00:00:24.869> of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
few other places that have some kind of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
few other places that have some kind of
a<00:00:24.990> lava<00:00:25.199> crunch<00:00:25.590> cake<00:00:25.890> or<00:00:26.130> anything<00:00:26.160> like<00:00:26.580> that

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
a lava crunch cake or anything like that

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
this but this comes pretty simple it

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.979 
this but this comes pretty simple it
comes<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.820> these<00:00:32.910> little<00:00:33.059> containers<00:00:33.210> frozen

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
reminding me of and then as a third

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.899 
reminding me of and then as a third
chocolate<00:01:25.380> taste<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.310> little<00:01:26.640> bit

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
chocolate taste you get is a little bit

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.030 
chocolate taste you get is a little bit
of<00:01:27.030> almost<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> fudge<00:01:28.020> cake<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.860> see

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
of almost like a fudge cake you can see

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.890 
of almost like a fudge cake you can see
right<00:01:29.220> inside<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.329> know<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.750> not

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
right inside of there you know it's not

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.090 
right inside of there you know it's not
exactly<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> center<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> definitely

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
exactly in the center but it definitely

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.340 
exactly in the center but it definitely
kept<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> cake<00:01:32.790> moist<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.600> surprisingly<00:01:34.200> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
kept the cake moist and surprisingly it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.899 
kept the cake moist and surprisingly it
wasn't<00:01:34.560> dried<00:01:34.890> out<00:01:35.040> at<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.579> was<00:01:35.729> rather

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
wasn't dried out at all it was rather

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.210 
wasn't dried out at all it was rather
moist<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.900> texture<00:01:37.290> wasn't<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.740> bad<00:01:37.950> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
moist and the texture wasn't that bad it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.700 
moist and the texture wasn't that bad it
was<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> little<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> spongy<00:01:39.299> side<00:01:39.710> but

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
was a little on the spongy side but

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.710 
was a little on the spongy side but
definitely<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.310> mushy<00:01:41.640> fall<00:01:42.030> apart<00:01:42.390> and
