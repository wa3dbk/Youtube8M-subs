to the top and you get the THL got the
prototype<00:00:50.280> now<00:00:51.239> um<00:00:52.190> here<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.280> go<00:00:54.050> voila<00:00:56.600> let's

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
prototype now um here we go voila let's

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.930 
prototype now um here we go voila let's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
up by pushing space and you control by

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.670 
up by pushing space and you control by
pushing<00:01:02.149> w<00:01:03.860> asd<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.189> there's<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.240> keys<00:01:06.680> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
pushing w asd and there's like keys to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.170 
pushing w asd and there's like keys to
get<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.070> which<00:01:08.610> I'll<00:01:08.760> show<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.060> a
