there's gonna take another two these are
very<00:02:51.170> uneven<00:02:52.030> but<00:02:53.030> everything<00:02:53.959> will<00:02:54.140> all<00:02:55.959> fall

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
very uneven but everything will all fall

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:13.460 
very uneven but everything will all fall
together<00:02:57.260> nicely<00:02:58.209> well<00:02:59.209> that's<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.510> plan

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
much here in between there to get

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:43.350 
much here in between there to get
through<00:03:31.500> everything
