 comparatives and today we are here 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.309

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.300
 On this side I have samsung is six 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.000

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.640
 samsung is 6 it was released already at the beginning 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.710

 covering everything up close I'll be there 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.000
 representing the team back 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.940
 conveying everything through twitter 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.520
 so it no longer follows a net routine 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.920
 we will have full coverage on the site and 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.530
 a review will go out on the same day in 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.000
 Thursday at 9pm then in that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.800
 same day will enter our review that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.719
 in full video that everything you 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.270
 need to know about this top release 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.579
 Asus online as you can see 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.399
 here the learner is a little bit 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.760
 bigger is also a little heavier 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.120
 It has 170 grams against 130 grams. 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.930
 from about six o'clock until his 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.439
 of 5.5 inches and almost fablad while 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.110
 the s6 and lethal in 5.1 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.110
 the screen resolution samsung is better 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.840
 he has two cars against a full hd of 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.330
 teaching two phone talking 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.460
 processors now the asus thinker 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.130
 lephone two it is very interesting for 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.990
 one were following motive is the first 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.079
 smartphone in the world to combine 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.000
 64-bit processor and a smartphone 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.220
 with 4 GB of RAM 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.380
 this 64-bit processor it is a 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.259
 2.3 ghz quad core and me supply all 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.000
 the needs of the six without 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.750
 data transmission at speed and everything 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.540
 more 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.030
 since samsung is 6 it is another judgment 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.750
 and this oxy is divided into two 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.270
 quad-core processors one of them 2.1 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.270
 the other 1.5 ghz 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.400
 within them we also have as already 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.100
 I spoke on the phone 41 gdm ram 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.290
 and within samsung just a little less than 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.380
 People have 3 GB of RAM 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.810
 the two rely on the lollipop 5 version 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.120
 latest android is no if 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.580
 excels at the other account so 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.600
 Samsung cameras go out a little better 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.400
 at the rear 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.300
 speaking in megapixels not in quality 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.180
 photo has 16 megapixels versus 13 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.090
 asus front camera 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.100
 the two are the same 5 megapixels want to see 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.459
 a back camera show says headset 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.459
 Look, you just want to see it's six. 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.930
 good to keep all these photos there 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.709
 You'll make the full HD movies. 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.970
 hd 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.100
 we have an internal storage in the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.340
 samsung goes in three versions we go 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.470
 have 16 32 and 64 gb 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.790
 we here high school are to 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.620
 of 32 gb ram o s6 it comes only in the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.480
 32gb version 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.570
 if you think there is too little space 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.370
 miss this from here our blues him 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.060

 the asus he has the protection gorilla glass 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:28.560
 three in front of the screen and samsung is 6 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.610
 has a differential that it has besides 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.060
 have g1 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.750
 the Gorilla 4 a higher version it has 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.000
 also in this video pleasure then you can give 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.550
 return or a shot can not because 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.540
 success battery but faces gaining it 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:49.920
 has three thousand and one hour empires against 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:52.440
 2.550 of the legal samsung that both 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.000
 phones they come with fast charger 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:00.570
 charge that in practice you can be there in the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.730
 battery grip puts on flea plug 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.950
 and about 20 minutes already have at least 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.260
 30% charge takes another 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.400
 a few hours of survival your 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.640
 appliance 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.700
