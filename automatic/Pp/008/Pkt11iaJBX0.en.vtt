 is a blouse to cut the sleeves on 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:46.280
 neck cut in strips look what I did 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.280
 Well now it's several people 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.129
 when the coves are made things like that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.960
 they stretch and stay like that then it 's because 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.309
 that the neck that was what I did with 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.870
 the sleeves clear the neck is the cut 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.449
 so that I would be looser and so the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.449
 to put one side or both 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:10.280
 It is the typical knot of ela 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.010

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.800
 lifetime 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.330
 but I'm not sure how you did it like that 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.850
 Not so then not what we did 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.250

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.800
 then so that it can be done to 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.080
 that you can see the effect in 3-d are going 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.450
 making your straight lines out of 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.910
 where is the design of the hand and inside 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.650

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.110

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.720
 effect grabs a man who 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.130
 Imagine you can be a mattress

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.200
 staying and while we are going to listen 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.920
 how is the prettiest your bar write down 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.540
 voice and place the piece of cardboard 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.940
 in the middle of the shirt to not 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.280
 stain the back place your hand 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.470
 with the palm towards the shirt with the 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.330
 fingers slightly apart and mark with the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.210
 Add the entire contour of your hand to 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.160
 the doll takes a black down and performs 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.900
 a horizontal line of about 10 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.850
 centimeters on the left of the wrist 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.860
 when you get to the part of the hand 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.290
 creates a small curve up 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.930
 follow this step and when you reach the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.820
 fingers in each creates curves starts to 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.070
 color it by painting each one of the 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.209
 Colorful lines you'll see that 3d effect 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.209
 will not return 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.510

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.470

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.040
