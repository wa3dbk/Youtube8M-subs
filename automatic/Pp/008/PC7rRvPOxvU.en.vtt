00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.460 
so once you save it you want to open up
Dreamweaver<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.210> open<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.869> create<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.259> new

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
Dreamweaver and open up and create a new

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.719 
Dreamweaver and open up and create a new
HTML<00:01:49.649> file<00:01:51.530> you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.680> either<00:01:52.890> go<00:01:53.189> split<00:01:53.579> or

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
HTML file you can either go split or

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.990 
HTML file you can either go split or
design<00:01:54.030> doesn't<00:01:54.390> really<00:01:54.630> matter<00:01:55.700> split<00:01:56.700> just

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
design doesn't really matter split just

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.510 
design doesn't really matter split just
so<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.420> could<00:01:57.600> see<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> code<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.520> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
so then you could see the code and the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.880 
so then you could see the code and the
design<00:01:59.670> code<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.259> only<00:02:01.380> see<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> code

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
design code is you can only see the code

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.950 
design code is you can only see the code
design<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.090> only<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> design

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
design is you can only see the design

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.310 
design is you can only see the design
doesn't<00:02:04.380> really<00:02:04.500> matter<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.759> yeah<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.990> now

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
doesn't really matter but yeah so now

here I grab a load right before the
white<00:02:57.969> and<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.540> image<00:02:59.019> itself<00:02:59.349> so<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.430> get

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
white and the image itself so you get

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.190 
white and the image itself so you get
this<00:03:00.700> blinking<00:03:01.120> cursor<00:03:01.359> you<00:03:01.840> can't<00:03:02.049> really

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
this blinking cursor you can't really

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.020 
this blinking cursor you can't really
see<00:03:02.469> it<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.769> might<00:03:02.919> be<00:03:03.069> able<00:03:03.159> to<00:03:03.310> see<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:03.609> yeah

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
see it you might be able to see it yeah

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.000 
see it you might be able to see it yeah
and<00:03:04.870> once<00:03:05.079> you<00:03:05.169> have<00:03:05.349> that<00:03:05.530> you're<00:03:05.829> going<00:03:05.919> to

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
and once you have that you're going to

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.009 
and once you have that you're going to
want<00:03:06.159> to<00:03:06.280> align<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.419> center<00:03:07.689> and<00:03:07.810> make<00:03:07.900> sure

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
it's on CSS not HTML because then you

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.020 
it's on CSS not HTML because then you
won't<00:03:10.269> see<00:03:10.389> it<00:03:10.659> so<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.680> go<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:11.859> CSS<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.760> then

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
won't see it so you go to CSS and then

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.300 
won't see it so you go to CSS and then
align<00:03:13.329> to<00:03:13.510> Center<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.319> I'm<00:03:14.919> just<00:03:15.069> going<00:03:15.190> to
