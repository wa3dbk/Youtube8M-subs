moment well I will get into that very

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.050 
moment well I will get into that very
quickly<00:00:28.169> first<00:00:29.169> of<00:00:29.349> all<00:00:29.470> it<00:00:29.890> uses<00:00:30.220> almost<00:00:30.909> all

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
quickly first of all it uses almost all

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.670 
quickly first of all it uses almost all
the<00:00:31.210> stock<00:00:31.419> hardware<00:00:31.689> you<00:00:32.169> do<00:00:32.320> have<00:00:32.439> to<00:00:32.560> buy

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
the stock hardware you do have to buy

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.820 
the stock hardware you do have to buy
some<00:00:32.890> extra<00:00:33.160> hardware<00:00:33.520> but<00:00:33.670> is<00:00:34.680> there<00:00:35.680> very

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
some extra hardware but is there very

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.800 
some extra hardware but is there very
common<00:00:36.370> hardware<00:00:36.580> so<00:00:37.240> you<00:00:37.330> can<00:00:37.450> get<00:00:37.570> it<00:00:37.690> at

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
common hardware so you can get it at

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.450 
common hardware so you can get it at
basically<00:00:38.320> any<00:00:38.470> hardware<00:00:38.770> store<00:00:39.130> and<00:00:39.310> it's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
basically any hardware store and it's

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.540 
basically any hardware store and it's
only<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.730> few<00:00:40.000> small<00:00:40.180> things<00:00:40.600> it<00:00:41.380> requires<00:00:41.530> 1<00:00:42.280> m3

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
only a few small things it requires 1 m3

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.540 
only a few small things it requires 1 m3
by<00:00:43.000> 20<00:00:43.390> millimeter<00:00:43.810> bolt<00:00:44.520> 1<00:00:45.520> m3<00:00:45.760> nut<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:47.250> 2<00:00:48.250> m3

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
by 20 millimeter bolt 1 m3 nut and 2 m3

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.500 
by 20 millimeter bolt 1 m3 nut and 2 m3
by<00:00:48.970> ten<00:00:49.210> millimeter<00:00:49.600> bolts<00:00:49.870> one<00:00:50.770> is<00:00:51.510> right

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
by ten millimeter bolts one is right

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.450 
by ten millimeter bolts one is right
there<00:00:52.810> you<00:00:53.110> can<00:00:53.290> see<00:00:53.320> it<00:00:53.650> it<00:00:53.770> holds<00:00:53.920> this<00:00:54.250> side

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
there you can see it it holds this side

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.190 
there you can see it it holds this side
together<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:55.060> the<00:00:55.420> other<00:00:55.540> goes<00:00:55.810> through<00:00:56.080> the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
together and the other goes through the

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.470 
together and the other goes through the
lever<00:00:56.410> inside

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
lever inside

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.970 
lever inside
that's<00:00:58.480> all<00:00:58.600> it<00:00:58.690> requires<00:00:58.960> it's<00:00:59.200> like<00:00:59.350> less

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
that's all it requires it's like less

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.770 
that's all it requires it's like less
than<00:01:00.190> 50<00:01:00.520> cents<00:01:00.790> worth<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:01.030> hardware<00:01:01.329> so<00:01:01.570> not<00:01:01.750> a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
than 50 cents worth of hardware so not a

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.170 
than 50 cents worth of hardware so not a
big<00:01:01.960> deal<00:01:02.020> at<00:01:02.260> all<00:01:02.290> it<00:01:03.190> uses<00:01:03.340> the<00:01:03.579> same<00:01:03.730> spring

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
big deal at all it uses the same spring

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.950 
big deal at all it uses the same spring
the<00:01:04.570> same<00:01:04.900> idler<00:01:05.860> bearing<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.550> same

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the same idler bearing and the same

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.780 
the same idler bearing and the same
pulley<00:01:07.960> same<00:01:08.530> stepper<00:01:08.890> of<00:01:08.980> course<00:01:09.190> it<00:01:09.640> also

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
pulley same stepper of course it also

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.090 
pulley same stepper of course it also
reuses<00:01:10.210> these<00:01:10.360> wood<00:01:10.600> pieces<00:01:10.630> as<00:01:11.080> spacers<00:01:11.530> now

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
reuses these wood pieces as spacers now

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.430 
reuses these wood pieces as spacers now
onto<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.610> features<00:01:12.970> it<00:01:13.240> is<00:01:13.510> symmetric<00:01:14.200> so<00:01:14.230> you

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
onto the features it is symmetric so you

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.340 
onto the features it is symmetric so you
can<00:01:14.590> reverse<00:01:14.860> it<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.159> have<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:16.240> little<00:01:17.050> bump

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
can reverse it and have the little bump

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.790 
can reverse it and have the little bump
out<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:18.510> extruder<00:01:19.510> to<00:01:19.900> be<00:01:20.110> shifted<00:01:20.710> to

on<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.640> bottom<00:01:57.760> guiding<00:01:58.360> into<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.690> hot<00:01:58.810> end

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
on the bottom guiding into the hot end

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.840 
on the bottom guiding into the hot end
what<00:01:59.650> that<00:01:59.830> does<00:02:00.010> is<00:02:00.159> it<00:02:00.280> makes<00:02:00.369> it<00:02:00.580> much

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
what that does is it makes it much

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.430 
what that does is it makes it much
easier<00:02:00.909> to<00:02:01.390> load<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.690> filament<00:02:02.080> in

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
easier to load the filament in

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.630 
easier to load the filament in
conjunction<00:02:03.310> with<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:04.060> lever<00:02:04.479> right

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
conjunction with a lever right

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.440 
conjunction with a lever right
underneath<00:02:06.640> here<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.270> can<00:02:07.420> just

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
underneath here that you can just

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.109 
underneath here that you can just
squeeze<00:02:07.900> quite<00:02:08.319> easily<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:09.610> nice<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.060> out

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
squeeze quite easily it's nice and out

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.360 
squeeze quite easily it's nice and out
of<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.270> way<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.690> doesn't<00:02:10.750> look<00:02:11.020> ugly

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
of the way so it doesn't look ugly

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.710 
of the way so it doesn't look ugly
although<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.610> mean<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.120> tree<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.420> kind<00:02:13.630> of

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
although I mean this tree is kind of

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.050 
although I mean this tree is kind of
technically<00:02:14.230> ugly<00:02:14.590> but<00:02:14.739> whatever<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.970> you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
technically ugly but whatever but you

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.850 
technically ugly but whatever but you
can<00:02:16.209> kind<00:02:16.600> of<00:02:16.660> just<00:02:16.840> like<00:02:16.959> pinch<00:02:17.440> this<00:02:17.650> whole

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
can kind of just like pinch this whole

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.930 
can kind of just like pinch this whole
side<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.610> will<00:02:18.790> release<00:02:19.450> pretty<00:02:19.989> easily

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
side and it will release pretty easily

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.400 
side and it will release pretty easily
it's<00:02:21.940> also<00:02:22.090> got<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.450> clamp<00:02:22.720> style<00:02:23.020> hot<00:02:23.200> end

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
it's also got a clamp style hot end

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.430 
it's also got a clamp style hot end
mount<00:02:23.590> which<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.520> much<00:02:25.120> more<00:02:25.330> secure<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.230> new

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
mount which is much more secure the new

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.140 
mount which is much more secure the new
version<00:02:26.830> has<00:02:26.860> about<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.310> five<00:02:27.519> millimeter<00:02:27.730> bump

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
version has about a five millimeter bump

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.740 
version has about a five millimeter bump
down<00:02:28.650> as<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:30.640> can<00:02:30.760> see<00:02:30.940> there<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:33.630> gives<00:02:34.630> it

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
down as you can see there and gives it

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.780 
down as you can see there and gives it
some<00:02:34.930> extra<00:02:35.140> space<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.680> clamp<00:02:36.160> on<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.640> hot

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
some extra space to clamp on to the hot

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.290 
some extra space to clamp on to the hot
end<00:02:36.970> which<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.269> nice<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.950> what<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:39.850> would<00:02:40.090> say

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
end which is nice the what I would say

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.360 
end which is nice the what I would say
the<00:02:40.569> best<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.440> most<00:02:41.470> unique<00:02:41.950> feature<00:02:42.220> of

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
the best and the most unique feature of

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.180 
the best and the most unique feature of
this<00:02:42.700> extruder<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:44.410> fact<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.709> has<00:02:44.980> an

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
this extruder is the fact that has an

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.800 
this extruder is the fact that has an
adjustable<00:02:46.030> tension<00:02:47.040> via<00:02:48.040> via<00:02:48.610> screw<00:02:49.239> four

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
adjustable tension via via screw four

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.990 
adjustable tension via via screw four
would<00:02:49.959> be<00:02:50.080> lovable<00:02:50.470> how<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.430> works<00:02:51.700> is

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
would be lovable how that works is

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.520 
would be lovable how that works is
you've<00:02:52.120> got<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.420> lever<00:02:52.600> arm<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:53.080> sits<00:02:53.380> in

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
you've got the lever arm that sits in

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.800 
you've got the lever arm that sits in
here<00:02:53.739> with<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.069> bearing<00:02:54.370> on<00:02:54.519> it<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.880> in<00:02:55.690> this

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
here with the bearing on it and in this

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.319 
here with the bearing on it and in this
channel<00:02:56.110> there's<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.500> spring<00:02:57.090> put<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.180> nut

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
channel there's a spring put the nut

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.910 
channel there's a spring put the nut
there<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.810> then<00:02:58.959> obviously<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.530> screw<00:02:59.769> goes

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
there and then obviously the screw goes

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.100 
there and then obviously the screw goes
on<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.130> top<00:03:00.340> as<00:03:00.579> you<00:03:01.090> tighten<00:03:01.600> down<00:03:01.780> this

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
on the top as you tighten down this

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.860 
on the top as you tighten down this
screw<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.739> pushes<00:03:03.280> on<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.489> spring<00:03:04.030> now

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
screw it pushes on the spring now

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.180 
screw it pushes on the spring now
there's<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.110> little<00:03:05.320> spacer<00:03:05.680> in<00:03:05.739> between<00:03:05.799> the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
there's a little spacer in between the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.910 
there's a little spacer in between the
two<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.579> that<00:03:07.239> pushes<00:03:07.570> down<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.620> arm

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
two and that pushes down on this arm

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.870 
two and that pushes down on this arm
which<00:03:09.370> then<00:03:09.610> forces<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.180> pivot<00:03:10.600> like<00:03:10.840> this

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
which then forces it to pivot like this

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.100 
which then forces it to pivot like this
which<00:03:12.880> ends<00:03:13.360> up<00:03:13.420> pushing<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.750> bearing<00:03:14.079> that

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
which ends up pushing the bearing that

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.560 
which ends up pushing the bearing that
way<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.680> then<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.430> can<00:03:15.610> obviously<00:03:15.970> push<00:03:16.390> the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
way and then you can obviously push the

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.670 
way and then you can obviously push the
lever<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:17.079> release<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:18.239> but<00:03:19.239> as<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:20.410> can<00:03:20.530> see

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
lever to release it but as you can see

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.620 
lever to release it but as you can see
you<00:03:20.860> can<00:03:21.010> tension<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.459> with<00:03:21.610> this<00:03:21.820> make<00:03:22.510> it

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
you can tension it with this make it

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.710 
you can tension it with this make it
tighter<00:03:22.870> or<00:03:22.959> looser<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:24.549> doesn't<00:03:25.540> change

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
tighter or looser and it doesn't change

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.599 
tighter or looser and it doesn't change
a<00:03:25.900> thing<00:03:25.930> other<00:03:26.290> than<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.680> maximum<00:03:27.310> amount<00:03:27.459> of

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
a thing other than the maximum amount of

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.310 
a thing other than the maximum amount of
tension<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:27.970> goes<00:03:28.120> on<00:03:28.600> this<00:03:28.810> lever<00:03:29.079> arm

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
tension that goes on this lever arm

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.060 
tension that goes on this lever arm
which<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.040> really<00:03:30.519> nice<00:03:30.750> because<00:03:31.829> well<00:03:32.829> first

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
which is really nice because well first

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.970 
which is really nice because well first
of<00:03:33.280> all<00:03:33.340> it's<00:03:33.549> a<00:03:33.609> lot<00:03:33.640> easier<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.299> adjust

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
of all it's a lot easier to adjust

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.830 
of all it's a lot easier to adjust
whereas<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.640> other<00:03:36.790> lever<00:03:37.060> design<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.660> did

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
whereas the other lever design it did

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.170 
whereas the other lever design it did
have<00:03:38.049> an<00:03:38.950> adjustable<00:03:39.459> tension<00:03:39.730> but<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.090> had

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
have an adjustable tension but you had

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.789 
have an adjustable tension but you had
to<00:03:40.269> take<00:03:40.390> it<00:03:40.450> apart<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:40.870> put<00:03:40.959> in<00:03:41.200> physical

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
to take it apart and put in physical

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.569 
to take it apart and put in physical
spacers<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:43.060> this<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:44.109> find<00:03:44.859> obviously<00:03:45.370> is<00:03:45.430> much

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
spacers so this I find obviously is much

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:46.890 
spacers so this I find obviously is much
easier<00:03:45.970> because<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.239> can<00:03:46.359> just<00:03:46.420> tighten<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
easier because you can just tighten the

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.509 
easier because you can just tighten the
screw<00:03:47.200> although<00:03:47.769> it<00:03:47.829> does<00:03:47.950> require<00:03:48.160> extra

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
screw although it does require extra

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.979 
screw although it does require extra
hardware<00:03:48.850> but<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.480> know<00:03:49.600> not<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.019> big<00:03:50.109> deal

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
hardware but you know not a big deal

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.170 
hardware but you know not a big deal
another<00:03:52.989> feature<00:03:53.260> is<00:03:53.799> that<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.400> will<00:03:54.670> have<00:03:54.910> a

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
another feature is that it will have a

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.710 
another feature is that it will have a
fan<00:03:55.390> mount<00:03:55.660> eventually<00:03:56.230> there<00:03:56.799> is<00:03:56.829> a

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
fan mount eventually there is a

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.750 
fan mount eventually there is a
you've<00:03:58.460> cut<00:03:59.460> out<00:03:59.580> of<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.760> side<00:04:00.000> here<00:04:04.760> there's

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
you've cut out of the side here there's

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
you've cut out of the side here there's
a<00:04:05.850> groove<00:04:06.300> cut<00:04:06.570> out<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.080> edge<00:04:07.460> right<00:04:08.460> there

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
a groove cut out of the edge right there

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.390 
a groove cut out of the edge right there
so<00:04:09.780> there<00:04:09.930> will<00:04:10.020> be<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.230> fan<00:04:10.950> mount<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.310> you

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
so there will be a fan mount that you

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.740 
so there will be a fan mount that you
can<00:04:11.550> just<00:04:11.700> kind<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:11.880> slide<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.330> it<00:04:12.540> will<00:04:12.720> go

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
can just kind of slide in it will go

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.420 
can just kind of slide in it will go
through<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.260> screw<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.480> pop<00:04:15.480> out<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.690> side

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
through the screw and pop out the side

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.400 
through the screw and pop out the side
to<00:04:17.430> mount<00:04:17.610> the<00:04:17.730> fan<00:04:17.910> on<00:04:18.209> right<00:04:18.570> here<00:04:18.900> sideways

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
to mount the fan on right here sideways

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.479 
to mount the fan on right here sideways
so<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.620> don't<00:04:19.739> feel<00:04:19.890> like<00:04:20.010> glue<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.370> the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
so you don't feel like glue to the

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.610 
so you don't feel like glue to the
stepper<00:04:20.880> with<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.600> bracket<00:04:22.200> thing<00:04:22.320> like<00:04:22.470> I

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
stepper with the bracket thing like I

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.830 
stepper with the bracket thing like I
did<00:04:23.810> I<00:04:25.610> guess<00:04:26.610> that's<00:04:26.850> really<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.360> as<00:04:27.510> far<00:04:27.750> as

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
did I guess that's really it as far as

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.070 
did I guess that's really it as far as
features<00:04:28.020> go<00:04:28.490> no<00:04:29.490> it's<00:04:30.210> really<00:04:30.390> just<00:04:30.630> simple

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
features go no it's really just simple

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.200 
features go no it's really just simple
it's<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:32.040> box<00:04:32.490> designed<00:04:32.970> with<00:04:33.830> chamfered<00:04:34.830> edges

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
it's a box designed with chamfered edges

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.110 
it's a box designed with chamfered edges
so<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.360> looks<00:04:36.540> pretty<00:04:36.840> basic<00:04:37.740> yet<00:04:38.400> somewhat

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
so it looks pretty basic yet somewhat

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.690 
so it looks pretty basic yet somewhat
elegant<00:04:39.570> I<00:04:39.690> guess<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.110> could<00:04:40.230> say<00:04:40.470> it's<00:04:41.400> I

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
elegant I guess you could say it's I

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.700 
elegant I guess you could say it's I
really<00:04:42.150> wasn't<00:04:42.330> going<00:04:42.720> for<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.050> aesthetic

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
really wasn't going for the aesthetic

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.480 
really wasn't going for the aesthetic
side<00:04:43.950> I<00:04:43.980> just<00:04:44.430> wanted<00:04:44.670> to<00:04:44.970> look<00:04:45.150> simple<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:46.490> it

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
side I just wanted to look simple and it

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.460 
side I just wanted to look simple and it
works<00:04:47.790> I<00:04:48.150> mean<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:48.660> haven't<00:04:49.080> had<00:04:49.170> a<00:04:49.200> problem

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
works I mean I haven't had a problem

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.570 
works I mean I haven't had a problem
with<00:04:49.620> it<00:04:49.740> yet<00:04:49.950> this<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.700> newest<00:04:50.940> version

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
with it yet this is the newest version

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.150 
with it yet this is the newest version
4.2<00:04:53.580> which<00:04:53.850> is<00:04:54.780> going<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.500> be<00:04:55.620> most<00:04:55.860> likely<00:04:55.890> the

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
4.2 which is going to be most likely the

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.100 
4.2 which is going to be most likely the
last<00:04:56.340> version<00:04:56.880> with<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.540> exception<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:57.990> the

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
last version with the exception of the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.480 
last version with the exception of the
fan<00:04:58.290> bracket<00:04:58.650> that<00:04:58.740> I'll<00:04:58.860> be<00:04:58.980> adding<00:04:59.070> but<00:04:59.400> that

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
fan bracket that I'll be adding but that

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.180 
fan bracket that I'll be adding but that
won't<00:04:59.640> change<00:04:59.730> the<00:05:00.060> version<00:05:01.340> and<00:05:03.800> yeah<00:05:04.800> so

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
won't change the version and yeah so

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.300 
won't change the version and yeah so
here<00:05:05.820> it<00:05:05.940> is<00:05:06.060> I<00:05:06.330> mean<00:05:06.510> that's<00:05:06.890> really<00:05:07.890> it<00:05:08.010> it's

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
here it is I mean that's really it it's

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.760 
here it is I mean that's really it it's
all<00:05:08.610> extruder<00:05:09.240> if<00:05:09.810> you<00:05:10.110> would<00:05:10.290> like<00:05:10.470> to<00:05:10.620> make

all extruder if you would like to make
it<00:05:10.919> like<00:05:11.070> I<00:05:11.220> said<00:05:11.490> Thingiverse<00:05:12.419> link<00:05:12.660> down

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
it like I said Thingiverse link down

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.650 
it like I said Thingiverse link down
there<00:05:13.140> you<00:05:13.350> can<00:05:13.500> go<00:05:13.620> check<00:05:13.650> it<00:05:14.070> out<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.660> be

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
there you can go check it out and be

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.060 
there you can go check it out and be
sure<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:15.870> give<00:05:16.080> this<00:05:16.169> video<00:05:16.350> a<00:05:16.500> thumbs<00:05:16.740> up<00:05:16.919> if

sure to give this video a thumbs up if
you<00:05:17.130> like<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.430> extruder<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:19.110> if<00:05:19.320> you<00:05:19.410> do<00:05:19.560> make

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
you like the extruder and if you do make

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.640 
you like the extruder and if you do make
it<00:05:19.980> I<00:05:20.190> would<00:05:20.820> greatly<00:05:21.630> appreciate<00:05:22.020> if<00:05:22.530> you

guys left feedback on the Thingiverse

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.960 
guys left feedback on the Thingiverse
page<00:05:24.720> or<00:05:24.960> hear<00:05:25.169> about<00:05:25.380> how<00:05:26.250> it<00:05:26.400> printed<00:05:26.790> for

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
page or hear about how it printed for

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.370 
page or hear about how it printed for
you<00:05:27.060> because<00:05:27.300> I<00:05:27.450> know<00:05:27.510> not<00:05:27.720> all<00:05:27.780> printers<00:05:28.230> are

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
you because I know not all printers are

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.900 
you because I know not all printers are
the<00:05:28.470> same<00:05:29.840> but<00:05:30.840> I<00:05:30.900> do<00:05:30.990> want<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.320> make<00:05:31.440> this<00:05:31.650> as

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
the same but I do want to make this as

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.460 
the same but I do want to make this as
like<00:05:32.910> uniform<00:05:33.390> as<00:05:33.510> possible<00:05:34.020> across<00:05:34.230> all

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
like uniform as possible across all

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.650 
like uniform as possible across all
printers<00:05:34.940> because<00:05:35.940> mine<00:05:36.419> might<00:05:36.630> be

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
printers because mine might be

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.180 
printers because mine might be
calibrated<00:05:37.320> differently<00:05:37.710> than<00:05:37.830> all<00:05:37.950> yours

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
calibrated differently than all yours

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.460 
calibrated differently than all yours
and<00:05:38.460> in<00:05:38.550> that<00:05:38.669> case<00:05:38.910> it's<00:05:39.180> gonna<00:05:39.360> mess<00:05:40.200> things

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
and in that case it's gonna mess things

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.250 
and in that case it's gonna mess things
up<00:05:40.740> and<00:05:41.010> whatnot<00:05:41.430> so<00:05:41.930> yeah<00:05:42.930> that's<00:05:43.140> pretty

up and whatnot so yeah that's pretty

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.350 
up and whatnot so yeah that's pretty
much<00:05:43.350> it<00:05:43.590> I'm<00:05:43.710> gonna<00:05:43.830> stop<00:05:44.070> rambling<00:05:44.580> now<00:05:44.730> so

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.580 
you like printing it oh one last thing I
should<00:05:49.590> mention<00:05:49.740> I<00:05:50.610> also<00:05:51.090> went<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.570> make<00:05:52.169> it<00:05:52.410> a

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
should mention I also went to make it a

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.940 
should mention I also went to make it a
very<00:05:53.130> material<00:05:54.000> efficient<00:05:54.840> I<00:05:55.050> guess<00:05:55.800> you

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
very material efficient I guess you

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.700 
very material efficient I guess you
could<00:05:56.100> say<00:05:56.310> so<00:05:57.120> printing<00:05:57.750> the<00:05:58.110> body<00:05:58.320> both

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
could say so printing the body both

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.670 
could say so printing the body both
pieces<00:05:59.040> and<00:05:59.490> both<00:05:59.910> pieces<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.419> lever<00:06:00.680> cost

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
pieces and both pieces the lever cost

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.850 
pieces and both pieces the lever cost
less<00:06:01.890> than<00:06:02.040> a<00:06:02.160> dollar<00:06:02.280> and<00:06:02.580> plastic<00:06:03.740> from<00:06:04.740> to

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
less than a dollar and plastic from to

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.659 
less than a dollar and plastic from to
that<00:06:04.980> 50%<00:06:05.280> infill<00:06:05.850> it<00:06:06.090> takes<00:06:06.360> about<00:06:07.160> 25<00:06:08.160> cubic

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
that 50% infill it takes about 25 cubic

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.520 
that 50% infill it takes about 25 cubic
centimeters<00:06:09.180> maybe<00:06:09.390> 30

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
centimeters maybe 30

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.450 
centimeters maybe 30
depending<00:06:10.980> on<00:06:11.040> where<00:06:11.190> you<00:06:11.280> bought<00:06:11.430> your

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
depending on where you bought your

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.030 
depending on where you bought your
plastic<00:06:12.000> that<00:06:12.150> could<00:06:12.390> be<00:06:12.620> barely<00:06:13.620> a<00:06:13.770> dollar

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
plastic that could be barely a dollar

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.610 
plastic that could be barely a dollar
which<00:06:14.910> is<00:06:14.940> pretty<00:06:15.510> awesome<00:06:15.720> for<00:06:16.110> a<00:06:16.170> nice<00:06:16.350> new

which is pretty awesome for a nice new

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.180 
which is pretty awesome for a nice new
