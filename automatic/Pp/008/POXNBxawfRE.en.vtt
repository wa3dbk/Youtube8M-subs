00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.869
 this is the job I would like 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.880
 a job that is the realization of 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.540
 our dreams and that has peers 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.890
 opportunity as a starting block 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.430
 I would like a job that does not suffocate the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.950
 curiosity and our thirst for knowledge 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.379
 where the theory finally marries with 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.800
 the experience because the work I would like 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.690
 it is not a utopia 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.470
 I wish the work during this time 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.090
 crisis help us turn the page 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.360
 talent enhancement must not 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.129
 be an exception but a rule 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.199
 I would like a job that puts dignity back 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.269
 at the center of our journey 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.159
 I would like a job that does not know the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.520
 exploitation word because the value 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.890
 of people 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.030
 it is more valuable than stock indices 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.490
 I would like a job of which each 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.890
 can be proud to feel 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.110
 active part of the company and not 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.460
 affect 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.650
 I would like a job where it is possible 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.530
 express their abilities e 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.299
 better 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.670
 now it is a work that does not deny the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.770
 aspirations the dreams everyone desires 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.220
 I would like a job where nobody has me 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.550
 puts me on the ropes without a job 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.430
 mortification in blackmail 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.900
 I would like a job for which I am compensated 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.910
 appropriate to its commitment 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.520
 I would like a job that is not alone 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.040
 question of survival I would like a 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.890
 work to devote to which does not mean 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.630
 cancel the rest of existence 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.060
 I would like a job of rights and more 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.490
 of duties I would like a job that I do 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.920
 guarantee the pension I would like to live on 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.930
 work and not die for it 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.480
 I would like a job where there is no need 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.320
 to protest because every worker has 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.450
 right to speak 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.960
 I would like this job but above all 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.560
 I would like a job do not forget about the 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.920
 word given 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.580
 work is a right for all of us not 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.580
 I never take it
