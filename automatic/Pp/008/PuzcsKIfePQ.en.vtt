00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
bit of filling because it's quite a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.540 
bit of filling because it's quite a
transaction<00:00:55.079> transition<00:00:55.829> between<00:00:56.160> that

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550

going to lengthen that back 1 i've

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.990 
going to lengthen that back 1 i've
already<00:01:16.560> eight<00:01:16.740> inches<00:01:17.070> which<00:01:17.549> will<00:01:17.729> bring<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
already eight inches which will bring it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.850 
already eight inches which will bring it
to<00:01:18.150> vote<00:01:18.360> boat<00:01:18.960> here<00:01:19.460> this<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:21.590> will<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.710> made

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
to vote boat here this one will be made

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.160 
to vote boat here this one will be made
longer<00:01:23.100> anyway<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> vote<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.299> then

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
longer anyway to vote here and then

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.140 
longer anyway to vote here and then
it'll<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> smaller<00:01:25.830> might<00:01:26.670> even<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it'll be a smaller might even do the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.580 
it'll be a smaller might even do the
back<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.570> one<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.290> we'll<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.530> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
back one in one so we'll have a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.130 
back one in one so we'll have a
perimeter<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.579> at<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> front<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:30.150> fixed<00:01:30.689> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
perimeter one at the front or fixed and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.640 
perimeter one at the front or fixed and
then<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.100> bigger<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.460> at<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.640> back<00:01:33.560> maybe<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
then a bigger one at the back maybe a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.340 
then a bigger one at the back maybe a
visor<00:01:34.890> up<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.369> start<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.030> tool<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.479> ship

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
visor up or start a tool just ship

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.580 
visor up or start a tool just ship
divisor<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:38.479> which<00:01:39.479> covers<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.990> transition

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
divisor up which covers that transition

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.859 
divisor up which covers that transition
of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> roof<00:01:40.979> from<00:01:41.220> round<00:01:41.670> two<00:01:42.000> pointy<00:01:42.689> which

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
of the roof from round two pointy which

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
of the roof from round two pointy which
would<00:01:43.290> look<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> Batmobile<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.119> you

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
would look like a Batmobile if you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.539 
would look like a Batmobile if you
didn't<00:01:45.689> put<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> visor<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.409> plus<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> visor

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
didn't put a visor on plus the visor

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.289 
didn't put a visor on plus the visor
makes<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.030> look<00:01:48.149> more<00:01:48.299> squat<00:01:48.750> as<00:01:49.460> in<00:01:50.460> squished

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
makes it look more squat as in squished

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.390 
makes it look more squat as in squished
as<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.840> lower<00:01:53.210> so

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.290 

tomorrow<00:01:57.400> I'll<00:01:57.550> probably<00:01:57.760> run<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.090> brake

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
tomorrow I'll probably run the brake

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.090 
tomorrow I'll probably run the brake
pipes<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.650> fuel<00:01:59.920> lines<00:02:01.920> steering's<00:02:02.920> all

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
pipes and the fuel lines steering's all

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.800 
pipes and the fuel lines steering's all
done<00:02:03.370> is<00:02:03.850> quite<00:02:04.120> intricate<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:06.460> jag<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:07.630> lots

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
done is quite intricate to jag to lots

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.859 
done is quite intricate to jag to lots
