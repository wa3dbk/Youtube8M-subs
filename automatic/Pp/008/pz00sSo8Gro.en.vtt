rear bearing from the the mine shaft

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:27.380 
rear bearing from the the mine shaft
which<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.870> one<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:21.859> came<00:00:22.859> out<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.369> way

the<00:00:28.260> pin<00:00:29.180> that<00:00:30.180> was<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.750> pin<00:00:30.930> not<00:00:31.110> know<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the pin that was the pin not know the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.979 
the pin that was the pin not know the
the<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:33.000> ring<00:00:33.150> that<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:33.570> holding<00:00:33.840> the

the the ring that was holding the
bearing<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:34.830> here<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.730> was

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
bearing is this one here it was

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.030 
bearing is this one here it was
somewhere<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.960> was<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> position<00:00:40.830> of

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
somewhere here this was the position of

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.950 
somewhere here this was the position of
the<00:00:42.559> position<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.650> very<00:00:43.949> the<00:00:44.400> walls<00:00:44.640> are

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
the position of the very the walls are

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.530 
the position of the very the walls are
towards<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.140> inside<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.769> the<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:48.150> the<00:00:48.300> shaft

towards the inside of the of the shaft

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:58.040 
towards the inside of the of the shaft
and<00:00:53.030> then<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:55.160> metal<00:00:56.160> piece<00:00:57.120> remained<00:00:57.840> in

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and then this metal piece remained in

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.140 
and then this metal piece remained in
the<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.500> place<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:59.519> don't<00:00:59.549> have<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.879> remove

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
the in place we don't have to remove

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.680 
the in place we don't have to remove
this<00:01:00.330> one<00:01:00.589> tore<00:01:01.589> that<00:01:01.769> that<00:01:02.309> direction<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
this one tore that that direction to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.920 
this one tore that that direction to
access<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.290> needle<00:01:05.250> needle<00:01:05.700> bearing<00:01:06.090> which

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
access this needle needle bearing which

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.190 
access this needle needle bearing which
is<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> next<00:01:07.409> step<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:08.210> small<00:01:09.210> problem<00:01:09.870> is

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
is the next step a small problem is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.200 
is the next step a small problem is
occurred<00:01:10.950> meanwhile<00:01:11.460> which<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:14.700> front<00:01:14.970> of

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
occurred meanwhile which is the front of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.680 
occurred meanwhile which is the front of
the<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.710> main<00:01:16.890> shaft<00:01:17.780> has<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.530> bearing<00:01:20.690> this

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
the of the main shaft has a bearing this

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.870 
the of the main shaft has a bearing this
one<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.020> part<00:01:22.260> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> bearing<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.700> are

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
one is part of the bearing and there are

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.190 
one is part of the bearing and there are
a<00:01:23.909> lot<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:25.010> small<00:01:26.010> pieces<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:27.020> they're<00:01:28.020> not

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
a lot of small pieces like they're not

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.850 
a lot of small pieces like they're not
balls<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> needle<00:01:30.420> bearing<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.560> you

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
balls this is a needle bearing so you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.100 
balls this is a needle bearing so you
had<00:01:32.010> to<00:01:32.160> be<00:01:32.250> careful<00:01:32.430> because<00:01:32.990> when<00:01:33.990> you

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
had to be careful because when you

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.740 
had to be careful because when you
remove<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.680> piece<00:01:35.580> from<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:35.910> front<00:01:36.210> all

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
remove the piece from the front all

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.270 
remove the piece from the front all
these<00:01:37.110> pieces<00:01:37.350> will<00:01:37.590> fall<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.160> floor

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
these pieces will fall to the floor

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.520 
these pieces will fall to the floor
which<00:01:38.610> happens<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.480> will<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.870> to<00:01:40.020> ask<00:01:40.170> in

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
which happens and I will have to ask in

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.220 
which happens and I will have to ask in
my<00:01:40.800> Toyota<00:01:41.790> dealership<00:01:44.480> how<00:01:45.480> many<00:01:45.720> pieces<00:01:45.990> are

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
my Toyota dealership how many pieces are

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.470 
my Toyota dealership how many pieces are
there<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.770> do<00:01:46.830> not<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.420> there<00:01:48.420> are
