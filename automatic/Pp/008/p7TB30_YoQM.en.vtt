so<00:02:04.650> it<00:02:04.770> will<00:02:04.920> hold<00:02:05.100> or<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:06.060> last<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.450> about

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
so it will hold or the last for about

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.430 
so it will hold or the last for about
four<00:02:06.900> hours
