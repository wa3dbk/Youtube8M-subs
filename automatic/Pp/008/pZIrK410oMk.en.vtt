00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.240
 week, I mean I hope I wait 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.269

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.369
 speaking now that you brought him here today 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.560
 will talk about what all the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.390
 days in my backpack for serving the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.640
 choose to use the china institute a pec 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.210
 so it is relatively large in size 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.860
 big because I bring some that do not 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.270
 bring a lot of things but here the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.789
 work tends to be 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:50.489
 heavy we have for the bags of stars the 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:54.239
 that the backpack material is quite 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.829
 strong role and was super super super 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.500
 cockroach 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.190
 speaking now in the outer pockets in 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:08.880
 two outer pockets god i bring 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:13.700
 my documents in the official documents 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:25.470
 let's say loyalty cards 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:28.049
 that the focus cards did not stay in this 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.880
 in this transports coins let's say so 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.890
 get water that the cards asked for 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.659
 that more frequently 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:41.450
 save the country and have my tricks 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:44.280
 again but it is also what brings 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:50.610
 now offering moment for purse 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:55.409
 neither is it logical to be better to have 11 goals 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.329
 in the interior also the little ones 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.820
 so let's start with 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.719
 as you can see here the zipper with 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:08.160
 goals in this good manners always bring 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:11.960
 one hostile blocks because I'm very 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.250
 ten marked and then as always 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.170
 there are many things going on at the same time 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.540
 Time I point to what it takes 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.050
 and then the market my schedule 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.980
 increase 1 thousand in my block notes that 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.380
 to use precisely within what is the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.250
 pocket smaller this is my block 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.410
 notes that makes up with this mine 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.260
 schedule is always clogged things 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.710
 as you can see and on the solar 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.960
 the kills in a while maybe not 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.940
 next video in the video the organization and 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.560
 the kids to classes because who 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.380
 knows you know I'm type 1 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.440
 capturing paranoid over the 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.070
 organization or fax but only this is how I 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.870
 I will say that what I have 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.710
 thoughts and everything else 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:04.250
 these two legends went out on a schedule and 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.920
 a nuclear so I know one near the end 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.470
 of the year with the daily newspaper that my 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.600
 parents buy then I created them bought 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.760
 in buying these streets I think it came from 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.600
 they had to pay one euro 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.180
 I also do not know for each one 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.430
 I use long enough 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.260
 Everything I do if I think of things and 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.150
 to get ideas so I'm pointing 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.070
 also the dates on which it is 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.470
 delighted to make videos that make a 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.050
 post on the block and it 's so much easier 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.970
 for me to ask so I always bring 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.940
 my cause 'that at the moment is 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.920
 it is empty but that it is a 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.680
 undoubtedly undoubtedly the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.870
 lively it is for the erp cost around 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.380
 Like it or not, we took the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.610
 person or about six euros of the gender 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.110
 the price varies by size has 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.420
 about half a liter 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.760
 for me it's good because it just came out great 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.100
 also in the big wholesale then fb block 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.110
 she wanted to conserve the water conserves 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.860
 the large fresh water that stays 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:13.220
 cool large enough time then 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.690
 Then I bring some sunglasses that never 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.220

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.609
 I really like 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.150
 Kannan goes home with both legs and has 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.990
 one size but this year is in us 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.970
 do not get used to with this 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.550
 so the best for so in this little bag 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.720

 Something I have here for pens. 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.990
 a belief in several color pens 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:03.710
 markers 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:06.830

 books that he no longer used then 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.759

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.389
 scenarios of how I'm going to start now 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:28.639
