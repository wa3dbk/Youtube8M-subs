fundamentals of diamond cutting and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.480 
fundamentals of diamond cutting and
proportions<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:27.560> let's<00:00:28.560> assume<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.250> moment

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
proportions so let's assume for a moment

the reason being that if you're looking

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.219 
the reason being that if you're looking
at<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.729> diamond<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.390> you're<00:01:09.869> looking<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
at a diamond and you're looking a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.500 
at a diamond and you're looking a
certain<00:01:10.260> clarity<00:01:10.890> grade<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.490> higher<00:01:11.670> si<00:01:12.180> -<00:01:12.240> or

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
certain clarity grade and higher si - or

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.810 
certain clarity grade and higher si - or
higher<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> certain<00:01:14.070> color<00:01:14.369> grading

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
higher and a certain color grading

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.600 
higher and a certain color grading
higher<00:01:15.060> let's<00:01:15.420> say<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.140> higher<00:01:16.610> virtually

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
higher let's say I and higher virtually

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.460 
higher let's say I and higher virtually
a<00:01:17.670> hundred<00:01:18.060> percent<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.930> see<00:01:19.200> with

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
a hundred percent of what you see with

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.899 
a hundred percent of what you see with
the<00:01:19.500> unaided<00:01:19.590> eye<00:01:19.950> without<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> microscope

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the unaided eye without a microscope

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.630 
the unaided eye without a microscope
without<00:01:21.390> magnification<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> function<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
without magnification is a function of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.899 
without magnification is a function of
the<00:01:23.909> cut<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.130> even<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> D

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the cut so you can even have a D

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.850 
the cut so you can even have a D
internally<00:01:27.600> flawless<00:01:27.810> which<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> top<00:01:28.650> color

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
internally flawless which is a top color

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.780 
internally flawless which is a top color
top<00:01:29.220> clarity<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.540> cut<00:01:31.159> poor<00:01:32.159> fair<00:01:32.579> or

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
top clarity but if it's cut poor fair or

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.270 
top clarity but if it's cut poor fair or
good<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.290> lifeless<00:01:35.009> stone

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
good it's going to be a lifeless stone

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.710 
good it's going to be a lifeless stone
so<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:37.220> concentrate<00:01:38.220> primarily<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:39.030> excellent

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
so I concentrate primarily on excellent

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.319 
so I concentrate primarily on excellent
and<00:01:39.900> very<00:01:40.560> good<00:01:40.860> there's<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> slight<00:01:42.060> premium

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and very good there's a slight premium

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.870 
and very good there's a slight premium
for<00:01:42.720> excellent<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.619> think<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.700> worthwhile

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
for excellent I think it's worthwhile

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.819 
for excellent I think it's worthwhile
and<00:01:45.420> probably<00:01:45.960> ninety<00:01:46.320> percent<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
and probably ninety percent of the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.530 
and probably ninety percent of the
diamonds<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.250> sell<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.759> an<00:01:47.880> excellent<00:01:48.210> grade

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
diamonds I sell have an excellent grade

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.950 
diamonds I sell have an excellent grade
four<00:01:48.869> cut<00:01:49.729> now<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.329> an<00:01:51.479> excellent<00:01:51.750> or

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
four cut now if this is an excellent or

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.830 
four cut now if this is an excellent or
an<00:01:52.020> ideal<00:01:52.320> cut<00:01:52.560> diamond<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.299> designed<00:01:54.689> in

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
an ideal cut diamond it is designed in

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.569 
an ideal cut diamond it is designed in
such<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.020> way<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.560> these<00:01:55.740> depth<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.460> these

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
such a way with these depth in these

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.980 
such a way with these depth in these
angles<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.270> reflects<00:01:57.570> most<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
angles that it reflects most of the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.380 
angles that it reflects most of the
light<00:01:58.140> back<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.640> light<00:01:59.909> coming

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
light back so if you have light coming

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.749 
light back so if you have light coming
in<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.990> bounced<00:02:01.409> back<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> side<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
in it's bounced back to the side and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.810 
in it's bounced back to the side and
back<00:02:02.969> up<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> eye<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> viewer<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:05.009> most

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
back up to the eye of the viewer so most

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.870 
back up to the eye of the viewer so most

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.180 
of the light is reflected back in acts
a<00:02:07.909> little<00:02:08.300> mirror<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:09.289> get<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.679> lot<00:02:10.069> of

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
a little mirror and you get a lot of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.949 
a little mirror and you get a lot of
fire<00:02:10.459> scintillation<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.360> brilliance<00:02:11.780> in<00:02:11.870> the

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
fire scintillation and brilliance in the

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.710 
fire scintillation and brilliance in the
stone<00:02:12.140> like<00:02:12.349> this<00:02:12.590> now<00:02:13.300> let's<00:02:14.300> look<00:02:14.480> at<00:02:14.599> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
stone like this now let's look at the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.479 
stone like this now let's look at the
other<00:02:14.930> two<00:02:15.290> options<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:18.530> first<00:02:18.560> one<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.250> if

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
other two options the first one is if

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.720 
other two options the first one is if
the<00:02:19.519> stone<00:02:19.880> is<00:02:20.090> cut<00:02:20.420> too<00:02:20.720> shallow<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:22.340> let's

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
the stone is cut too shallow so let's

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.850 
the stone is cut too shallow so let's
draw<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:22.970> shallow<00:02:23.330> diamond<00:02:24.140> here<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.410> profile

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
draw a shallow diamond here in profile

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.520 
draw a shallow diamond here in profile
now<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.700> shallow<00:02:26.180> diamond<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.810> light<00:02:26.959> comes<00:02:27.230> in

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
now a shallow diamond the light comes in

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.290 
now a shallow diamond the light comes in
because<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.099> can<00:02:28.280> see<00:02:28.400> this<00:02:28.550> angle<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.120> not

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
because you can see this angle it's not

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.220 
because you can see this angle it's not
steep<00:02:29.989> enough<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.920> light<00:02:31.720> seeps<00:02:32.720> up<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.080> back

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
steep enough the light seeps up the back

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.830 
steep enough the light seeps up the back
it<00:02:33.560> acts<00:02:33.800> almost<00:02:34.010> like<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.340> pane<00:02:34.819> of<00:02:35.000> glass<00:02:35.030> now

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
it acts almost like a pane of glass now

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.660 
it acts almost like a pane of glass now
it's<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.319> deceptive<00:02:36.800> stone<00:02:37.040> because<00:02:37.400> when<00:02:37.580> you

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
it's a deceptive stone because when you

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.759 
it's a deceptive stone because when you
go<00:02:38.090> into<00:02:38.239> a<00:02:38.360> store<00:02:38.660> if<00:02:39.110> you're<00:02:39.319> looking<00:02:39.650> at<00:02:39.709> a

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
go into a store if you're looking at a

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.400 
go into a store if you're looking at a
shallow<00:02:40.069> stone<00:02:40.489> or<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:41.180> deeper<00:02:42.049> stone<00:02:42.260> which

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
shallow stone or a deeper stone which

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.620 
shallow stone or a deeper stone which
you're<00:02:42.530> going<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.680> get<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:43.069> in<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.340> moment<00:02:43.630> if

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
you're going to get to in a moment if

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.720 
you're going to get to in a moment if
it's<00:02:44.900> loose<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.530> get<00:02:45.709> light<00:02:46.099> coming<00:02:46.580> in<00:02:46.700> from

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
it's loose you get light coming in from

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.729 
it's loose you get light coming in from
the<00:02:46.940> backside<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:47.690> why<00:02:48.110> they're<00:02:48.319> loose<00:02:48.530> they

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
the backside so why they're loose they

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:49.830 
the backside so why they're loose they
look<00:02:48.920> okay

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
look okay

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.380 
look okay
but<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.260> have<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.560> visualize<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.489> set<00:02:53.060> with

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
but you have to visualize this set with

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.910 
but you have to visualize this set with
prongs<00:02:54.019> and<00:02:54.380> they'll<00:02:55.310> be<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.760> gold<00:02:56.650> or<00:02:57.650> platinum

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
prongs and they'll be a gold or platinum

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.009 
prongs and they'll be a gold or platinum
bridge<00:02:58.519> underneath<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:59.299> get<00:02:59.420> another<00:02:59.690> claw

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
bridge underneath you get another claw

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.309 
bridge underneath you get another claw
here<00:03:00.470> so<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.489> all<00:03:01.640> gets<00:03:02.090> wrapped<00:03:02.480> in<00:03:02.750> metal<00:03:02.959> and

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
here so it all gets wrapped in metal and

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.990 
here so it all gets wrapped in metal and
you<00:03:03.680> don't<00:03:03.860> get<00:03:03.980> light<00:03:04.250> coming<00:03:04.610> in<00:03:04.700> there<00:03:04.819> any

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
you don't get light coming in there any

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000 
you don't get light coming in there any
longer<00:03:05.030> as<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.959> matter<00:03:06.140> of<00:03:06.200> fact<00:03:06.349> this<00:03:06.560> is<00:03:06.620> quite

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
longer as a matter of fact this is quite

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.539 
longer as a matter of fact this is quite
dark<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.549> here<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.569> stone<00:03:08.989> like<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:09.549> you're

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
dark in here so a stone like this you're

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.340 
dark in here so a stone like this you're
getting<00:03:10.730> light<00:03:11.209> seepage<00:03:11.750> not<00:03:11.930> only<00:03:12.200> out<00:03:12.319> of

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
getting light seepage not only out of

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.979 
getting light seepage not only out of
the<00:03:12.470> back<00:03:12.680> but<00:03:12.980> you're<00:03:13.130> also<00:03:13.250> getting<00:03:13.989> you'd

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
the back but you're also getting you'd

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.990 
the back but you're also getting you'd
be<00:03:15.260> able<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.590> see<00:03:15.859> underneath<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.519> stone<00:03:16.760> this

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
be able to see underneath the stone this

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.660 
be able to see underneath the stone this
dark<00:03:17.299> area<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.319> actually<00:03:18.680> goes<00:03:18.799> dark<00:03:19.400> and

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
dark area so it actually goes dark and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.940 
dark area so it actually goes dark and
lifeless<00:03:20.090> once<00:03:20.600> it's<00:03:20.810> set<00:03:21.049> so<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.799> little

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
lifeless once it's set so it's a little

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.470 
lifeless once it's set so it's a little
deceptive<00:03:22.250> because<00:03:22.489> like<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.850> say<00:03:22.970> in<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.209> store

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
deceptive because like I say in a store

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.390 
deceptive because like I say in a store
you<00:03:23.510> can<00:03:23.750> look<00:03:23.930> at<00:03:24.019> a<00:03:24.049> shallow<00:03:24.739> cut<00:03:25.010> or<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.250> deep

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
you can look at a shallow cut or a deep

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.250 
you can look at a shallow cut or a deep
cut<00:03:25.609> stone<00:03:25.850> they<00:03:26.120> should<00:03:26.299> look<00:03:26.540> really<00:03:26.930> good

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
cut stone they should look really good

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.660 
cut stone they should look really good
but<00:03:27.739> once<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.069> put<00:03:28.190> them<00:03:28.370> in<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.489> piece<00:03:28.639> of

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
but once you put them in a piece of

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.390 
but once you put them in a piece of
jewelry<00:03:28.819> that's<00:03:29.389> it<00:03:29.720> they<00:03:30.019> just<00:03:30.350> go<00:03:31.069> very

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
jewelry that's it they just go very

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.780 
jewelry that's it they just go very
laceless<00:03:32.000> now<00:03:33.940> yeah<00:03:34.940> we're<00:03:35.269> gonna<00:03:35.389> expose<00:03:36.790> the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
laceless now yeah we're gonna expose the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:45.470 
laceless now yeah we're gonna expose the
diamond<00:03:38.269> industries<00:03:38.780> dirty<00:03:39.709> little<00:03:40.010> secret

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.510 

and<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.750> is<00:03:47.050> a<00:03:47.410> deep<00:03:48.310> cut<00:03:48.550> stone<00:03:49.860> now<00:03:50.860> why<00:03:51.280> it's

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
and it is a deep cut stone now why it's

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.950 
and it is a deep cut stone now why it's
so<00:03:51.700> nasty<00:03:51.940> is<00:03:52.240> first<00:03:52.510> of<00:03:52.660> all<00:03:52.720> like<00:03:52.930> the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
so nasty is first of all like the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.280 
so nasty is first of all like the
shallow<00:03:53.320> stone<00:03:54.360> you<00:03:55.360> get<00:03:55.540> light<00:03:55.780> seeping<00:03:56.200> out

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
shallow stone you get light seeping out

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.440 
shallow stone you get light seeping out
the<00:03:56.440> back<00:03:56.620> so<00:03:56.980> it's<00:03:57.160> gonna<00:03:57.250> be<00:03:57.490> very<00:03:57.790> dark<00:03:58.240> and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
the back so it's gonna be very dark and

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.880 
the back so it's gonna be very dark and
lifeless<00:03:58.660> but<00:03:59.880> why<00:04:00.880> it's<00:04:01.150> so<00:04:01.780> nasty<00:04:02.050> is<00:04:02.500> let's

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
lifeless but why it's so nasty is let's

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.770 
lifeless but why it's so nasty is let's
assume<00:04:03.190> for<00:04:03.460> a<00:04:03.520> moment<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.450> diameter

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
assume for a moment that this diameter

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.780 
assume for a moment that this diameter
here<00:04:05.290> is<00:04:05.470> that<00:04:05.650> of<00:04:05.830> an<00:04:05.920> ideal<00:04:06.010> cut<00:04:06.550> or

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
here is that of an ideal cut or

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
here is that of an ideal cut or
