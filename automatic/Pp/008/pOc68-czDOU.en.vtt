the studio it was just write it with a
good<00:00:27.910> fit<00:00:28.090> I<00:00:28.360> think<00:00:28.869> when<00:00:28.960> you<00:00:29.079> when<00:00:29.259> you<00:00:29.290> meet

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
good fit I think when you when you meet

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.979

people<00:00:29.559> when<00:00:29.980> you<00:00:30.070> think<00:00:30.279> well<00:00:30.610> you're<00:00:31.599> just<00:00:31.840> a

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
people when you think well you're just a

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
friend for a certain amount of time it's

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.760 
friend for a certain amount of time it's
not<00:00:34.090> like<00:00:34.270> that<00:00:34.329> when<00:00:34.780> you<00:00:34.930> meet<00:00:35.469> people<00:00:35.590> in

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
not like that when you meet people in

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.229 
not like that when you meet people in
your<00:00:36.070> course<00:00:36.370> you<00:00:36.670> start<00:00:36.879> throwing<00:00:37.120> around

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
your course you start throwing around

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.000 
your course you start throwing around
crazy<00:00:37.600> ideas<00:00:38.110> about<00:00:38.350> like<00:00:38.590> starting

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
crazy ideas about like starting

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.220 
crazy ideas about like starting

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
businesses together I mean it's not just

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.690 
businesses together I mean it's not just
like<00:00:41.379> you've<00:00:41.530> just<00:00:41.559> got<00:00:41.800> made<00:00:42.010> you've<00:00:42.280> got<00:00:42.489> you

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
like you've just got made you've got you

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
I chose the MU for the studio itself

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.170 
I chose the MU for the studio itself
that<00:00:56.950> means<00:00:57.130> we've<00:00:57.280> got<00:00:57.399> our<00:00:57.489> own<00:00:57.579> place<00:00:57.790> our

find most useful on my course is the

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:21.539 
find most useful on my course is the
architecture<00:01:20.350> herb<00:01:20.499> which<00:01:20.740> is<00:01:20.920> an<00:01:21.039> archive<00:01:21.520> of

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
architecture herb which is an archive of

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.699 
architecture herb which is an archive of
journals<00:01:22.329> books<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.959> computers<00:01:23.469> which

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:23.709 
journals books and computers which

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.910 
journals books and computers which
really<00:01:24.069> helps<00:01:24.369> me<00:01:24.520> with<00:01:24.639> my<00:01:24.670> work<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:26.799> also

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
really helps me with my work we also

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.889 
really helps me with my work we also
have<00:01:27.009> a<00:01:27.399> photography<00:01:27.850> suite<00:01:28.060> which<00:01:28.509> enables

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
have a photography suite which enables

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.230 
have a photography suite which enables
us<00:01:28.959> to<00:01:29.020> hook<00:01:29.679> up<00:01:29.859> our<00:01:29.979> models<00:01:30.310> in<00:01:30.909> different

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
us to hook up our models in different

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.730 
us to hook up our models in different
light<00:01:31.569> settings<00:01:31.929> so<00:01:32.049> can<00:01:32.200> make<00:01:32.319> it<00:01:32.409> like<00:01:32.590> it's

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
light settings so can make it like it's

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.469 
light settings so can make it like it's
nighttime<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.100> daytime<00:01:33.249> we're<00:01:33.999> also<00:01:34.090> able<00:01:34.299> to

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
nighttime and daytime we're also able to

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.139 
nighttime and daytime we're also able to
the<00:01:35.229> model<00:01:35.649> scopes<00:01:35.889> written<00:01:36.189> into<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.789> models

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
the model scopes written into the models

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.269 
the model scopes written into the models
that<00:01:37.569> you<00:01:37.630> can<00:01:37.779> see<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.740> structure<00:01:39.039> within

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:39.279 
that you can see the structure within

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:41.370 
that you can see the structure within
the<00:01:39.520> model<00:01:39.759> which<00:01:40.659> is<00:01:40.689> like<00:01:40.929> this<00:01:41.079> part<00:01:41.289> and

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
the model which is like this part and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.389
