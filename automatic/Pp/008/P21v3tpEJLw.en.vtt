00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
customization options because these are

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.250 
customization options because these are
so<00:02:31.970> subtle<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.540> you'll<00:02:32.720> never<00:02:32.840> see<00:02:33.140> them

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
so subtle and you'll never see them

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.350 
so subtle and you'll never see them
unless<00:02:33.440> you're<00:02:33.709> using<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.700> cockpit<00:02:35.180> view

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
unless you're using the the cockpit view

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.120 
unless you're using the the cockpit view
on<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.569> car<00:02:35.750> but<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:35.989> can<00:02:36.170> change<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.920> color

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
on the car but you can change the color

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.650 
on the car but you can change the color
of<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.459> leather<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.850> stitching<00:02:41.239> on<00:02:41.420> the

of the leather and the stitching on the
leather<00:02:41.840> as<00:02:42.019> well<00:02:44.200> but<00:02:45.200> now<00:02:46.160> this<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:46.489> where<00:02:46.640> it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
leather as well but now this is where it

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.890 
leather as well but now this is where it
gets<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.880> little<00:02:46.910> bit<00:02:47.150> complicated<00:02:47.480> um<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.780> the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
gets a little bit complicated um so the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.380 
gets a little bit complicated um so the
front<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.070> car<00:02:52.250> right<00:02:52.430> now<00:02:52.549> is<00:02:52.820> a<00:02:52.850> street

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390

performance<00:02:53.900> package<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:55.310> can<00:02:55.459> see<00:02:55.700> the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
performance package and you can see the

uninteresting I mean they're they're

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.500 
uninteresting I mean they're they're
very<00:03:01.190> subtle<00:03:01.549> differences<00:03:01.940> between<00:03:02.000> all<00:03:02.390> the

really curious to see what some of the
weight<00:04:03.040> game<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.930> know<00:04:05.050> level<00:04:05.470> 50<00:04:05.950> upgrade

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.770 
options look like on some of the kind of
basic<00:04:09.220> cars<00:04:09.459> here<00:04:09.670> so<00:04:09.910> you<00:04:10.180> mean<00:04:10.300> these<00:04:10.480> look

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
basic cars here so you mean these look

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.720 
basic cars here so you mean these look
completely<00:04:11.230> different<00:04:11.370> with<00:04:12.370> any<00:04:12.550> of<00:04:12.640> these

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
completely different with any of these

seen<00:06:51.050> so<00:06:51.229> far<00:06:51.260> I<00:06:51.470> like<00:06:52.010> the<00:06:52.130> dirt<00:06:52.310> package<00:06:52.729> in

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
which which equipment package you have

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.300 
which which equipment package you have
chosen<00:06:56.690> affects<00:06:57.650> the<00:06:57.770> overall<00:06:57.830> performance

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310

of<00:06:58.520> the<00:06:58.580> car<00:06:58.759> and<00:06:58.849> especially<00:06:59.090> like<00:06:59.389> off-road

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
of the car and especially like off-road

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.779 
of the car and especially like off-road
handling<00:07:00.320> and<00:07:00.470> stuff<00:07:00.650> like<00:07:00.770> that<00:07:00.979> so<00:07:01.009> you<00:07:01.759> know

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:01.789

the<00:07:02.000> game<00:07:02.120> kind<00:07:02.389> of<00:07:02.419> progresses<00:07:02.960> from<00:07:03.199> street

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.070 
the game kind of progresses from street

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.310 
the game kind of progresses from street
starting<00:07:04.400> to<00:07:04.550> Detroit<00:07:04.880> to<00:07:05.150> dirt<00:07:05.539> -<00:07:06.110> I<00:07:06.139> think

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 
starting to Detroit to dirt - I think

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.469 
starting to Detroit to dirt - I think
Miami<00:07:07.190> next<00:07:07.720> for<00:07:08.720> the<00:07:08.780> performance<00:07:10.180> raid<00:07:11.180> I

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 
Miami next for the performance raid I

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.270 
Miami next for the performance raid I
think<00:07:11.720> is<00:07:11.810> Blas<00:07:12.139> feigus<00:07:12.590> and<00:07:12.800> then<00:07:12.889> finally

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 
think is Blas feigus and then finally

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.330 
think is Blas feigus and then finally
circuit<00:07:13.729> is<00:07:13.880> going<00:07:14.389> to<00:07:14.690> be<00:07:14.900> Los<00:07:15.199> Angeles<00:07:15.710> so

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340 
circuit is going to be Los Angeles so

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.500 
circuit is going to be Los Angeles so
those<00:07:16.580> are<00:07:16.699> the<00:07:16.760> kind<00:07:16.909> of<00:07:16.940> different<00:07:17.240> sections

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:17.510 
those are the kind of different sections

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.750 
those are the kind of different sections
