00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.670 
other human beings just my guess when I
see<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.119> we<00:01:48.329> won't<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.810> playing<00:01:49.020> against

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
see that we won't be playing against

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.039 
see that we won't be playing against
actual<00:01:50.189> people<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.880> sounds<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.689> we're<00:01:51.869> going

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
actual people it sounds like we're going

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.289 
actual people it sounds like we're going
to<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.200> playing<00:01:52.470> against<00:01:53.009> something<00:01:53.310> else<00:01:53.729> now

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
to be playing against something else now

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.120 
to be playing against something else now
obviously<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.079> huge<00:01:55.409> speculation

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
obviously this is just huge speculation

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.499 
obviously this is just huge speculation
we<00:01:56.250> could<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.579> playing<00:01:56.820> against<00:01:57.030> people<00:01:57.390> they

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
we could be playing against people they

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.330 
we could be playing against people they
could<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:58.079> putting<00:01:58.409> electric<00:01:58.950> fences

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
could just be putting electric fences

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.609 
could just be putting electric fences
and<00:01:59.549> fire<00:01:59.759> traps<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:00.630> us<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.869> do<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:01.469> to

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
and fire traps for us to do that but to

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.770 
and fire traps for us to do that but to
me<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.040> doesn't<00:02:02.310> sound<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.909> now<00:02:03.420> even

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
me it doesn't sound like it now even

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.030 
me it doesn't sound like it now even
more<00:02:03.990> hints<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.590> are<00:02:04.680> going<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.950> be

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
more hints that we are going to be

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.550 
more hints that we are going to be
playing<00:02:05.189> against<00:02:05.850> some<00:02:06.329> sort<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.600> creature<00:02:07.020> is

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
playing against some sort of creature is

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.100 
playing against some sort of creature is
some<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.250> achievement<00:02:09.060> icons<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:09.989> you

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
some of the achievement icons if you

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.390 
some of the achievement icons if you
take<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> look<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.709> have<00:02:10.860> some<00:02:11.039> sort<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.220> alien

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
take a look we have some sort of alien

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.190 
take a look we have some sort of alien
skull<00:02:12.270> or<00:02:12.569> alien

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
skull or alien

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.290 
skull or alien
aid<00:02:13.290> as<00:02:13.470> well<00:02:14.040> as<00:02:14.129> another<00:02:14.370> one<00:02:14.520> being<00:02:14.910> claw

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
aid as well as another one being claw

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.930 
aid as well as another one being claw
marks<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.959> again<00:02:16.890> maybe<00:02:17.099> either<00:02:17.340> just<00:02:17.730> done

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
marks and again maybe either just done

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.820 
marks and again maybe either just done
for<00:02:18.180> an<00:02:18.239> effect<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.989> achievement<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:19.680> to

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
for an effect of the achievement but to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.440 
for an effect of the achievement but to
me<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.220> definitely<00:02:20.519> looks<00:02:21.000> like<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.330> are

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
me it definitely looks like we are

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.680 
me it definitely looks like we are
running<00:02:21.660> away<00:02:22.050> from<00:02:22.830> some<00:02:23.190> sort<00:02:23.519> of<00:02:23.640> alien<00:02:23.910> now

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
running away from some sort of alien now

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.210 
running away from some sort of alien now
we've<00:02:24.840> had<00:02:25.019> rumors<00:02:25.379> in<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.680> past<00:02:25.950> especially

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
we've had rumors in the past especially

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.640 
we've had rumors in the past especially
with<00:02:26.610> mw3<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.870> would<00:02:28.019> there<00:02:28.200> was<00:02:28.379> going<00:02:28.530> to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
with mw3 that would there was going to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.979 
with mw3 that would there was going to
be<00:02:28.680> some<00:02:28.980> sort<00:02:29.129> of<00:02:29.250> alien<00:02:29.569> survival<00:02:30.569> game<00:02:30.750> mode

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
be some sort of alien survival game mode

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.930 
be some sort of alien survival game mode
but<00:02:31.560> by<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.709> looks<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.069> this<00:02:32.280> isn't<00:02:32.550> going

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
but by the looks of it this isn't going

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.460 
but by the looks of it this isn't going
to<00:02:33.030> be<00:02:33.150> round<00:02:33.390> based<00:02:33.660> like<00:02:33.840> zombies<00:02:34.230> because

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
to be round based like zombies because

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.229 
to be round based like zombies because
obviously<00:02:34.800> you're<00:02:35.220> escaping<00:02:35.580> there<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.120> an

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
obviously you're escaping there is an

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.330 
obviously you're escaping there is an
end<00:02:36.599> other<00:02:37.290> than<00:02:37.530> dying<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:38.040> know<00:02:38.099> obviously

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
end other than dying I know obviously

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.920 
end other than dying I know obviously
some<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.819> zombie<00:02:39.060> maps<00:02:39.239> do<00:02:39.420> have<00:02:39.599> ending

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
some of the zombie maps do have ending

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.690 
some of the zombie maps do have ending
to<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.140> story<00:02:40.200> but<00:02:40.410> generally<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.430> just

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
to the story but generally it's just

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.979 
to the story but generally it's just
round<00:02:41.880> based<00:02:42.090> survival<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.660> as<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:42.959> see

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
round based survival and as you can see

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.500 
round based survival and as you can see
it's<00:02:43.560> escape<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.549> we<00:02:44.670> are<00:02:44.879> actually<00:02:45.060> going<00:02:45.360> to

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
it's escape so we are actually going to

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.270 
it's escape so we are actually going to
be<00:02:45.540> able<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.840> win<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.290> game<00:02:46.500> mode<00:02:46.769> by

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
be able to win this game mode by

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.339 
be able to win this game mode by
escaping<00:02:47.730> on<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.180> chopper<00:02:48.720> which<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.049> going<00:02:49.200> to

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
escaping on a chopper which is going to

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.080 
escaping on a chopper which is going to
pick<00:02:49.500> us<00:02:49.620> up<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.190> as<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.430> can<00:02:50.549> see<00:02:50.580> by<00:02:50.849> some<00:02:51.030> of

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
pick us up and as you can see by some of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.699 
pick us up and as you can see by some of
the<00:02:51.180> other<00:02:51.299> achievements<00:02:51.420> as<00:02:51.870> well<00:02:52.200> we're

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
the other achievements as well we're

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.890 
the other achievements as well we're
going<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.980> be<00:02:53.040> coming<00:02:53.220> from<00:02:53.280> place<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.849> place

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
going to be coming from place to place

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.809 
going to be coming from place to place
get<00:02:54.900> into<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.319> city<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.860> get<00:02:56.069> into<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.340> cabin

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
get into the city and get into a cabin

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.940 
get into the city and get into a cabin
and<00:02:57.000> trying<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.660> get<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.019> exfil<00:02:58.530> chopper

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
and trying to get to this exfil chopper

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.089 
and trying to get to this exfil chopper
so<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.670> pretty<00:02:59.970> much<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.450> hundred<00:03:00.870> percent

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
so this pretty much a hundred percent

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.559 
so this pretty much a hundred percent
unofficially<00:03:02.099> confirms<00:03:02.549> extinction<00:03:03.209> mode<00:03:03.329> is

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
unofficially confirms extinction mode is

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.360 
unofficially confirms extinction mode is
going<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.140> be<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> new<00:03:04.440> game<00:03:04.680> mode<00:03:04.890> in<00:03:05.130> call<00:03:05.340> of

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
going to be a new game mode in call of

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.430 
going to be a new game mode in call of
duty<00:03:05.549> ghosts<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.239> new<00:03:06.599> side<00:03:06.870> mission<00:03:07.230> because

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
duty ghosts a new side mission because

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.839 
duty ghosts a new side mission because
obviously<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:08.069> achievement<00:03:08.519> list<00:03:08.640> was

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
obviously the achievement list was

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.640 
obviously the achievement list was
leaked<00:03:09.060> before<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.720> squad's<00:03:09.989> trailer<00:03:10.470> and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
leaked before the squad's trailer and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.620 
leaked before the squad's trailer and
now<00:03:11.010> they<00:03:11.160> both<00:03:11.400> matched<00:03:11.700> up<00:03:11.910> extinction<00:03:12.480> mode

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
now they both matched up extinction mode

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.390 
now they both matched up extinction mode
recently<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.440> wait<00:03:13.560> for<00:03:13.769> either<00:03:13.890> an<00:03:14.069> official

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
recently to wait for either an official

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.830 
recently to wait for either an official
announcement<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.209> don't<00:03:15.480> think<00:03:15.660> they'll

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
announcement but I don't think they'll

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.390 
announcement but I don't think they'll
be<00:03:15.930> announcing<00:03:16.290> anything<00:03:16.650> about<00:03:17.010> extinction
