two studios brand new channel which is

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.910 
two studios brand new channel which is
our<00:00:05.779> pains<00:00:06.779> montages<00:00:07.560> glitches<00:00:09.170> secrets<00:00:10.170> and

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
our pains montages glitches secrets and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.330 
our pains montages glitches secrets and
more<00:00:11.130> basically<00:00:11.759> um<00:00:12.019> so<00:00:13.019> I'm<00:00:13.200> yes<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.190> is

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
more basically um so I'm yes so this is

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.279 
more basically um so I'm yes so this is
the<00:00:14.460> glitch<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:14.969> an<00:00:15.120> elevator<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.139> can

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
the glitch it's an elevator and you can

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.519 
the glitch it's an elevator and you can
get<00:00:16.410> out<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> map<00:00:16.770> all<00:00:17.070> over<00:00:17.520> there<00:00:18.199> it's<00:00:19.199> kind

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
get out the map all over there it's kind

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.990 
get out the map all over there it's kind
of<00:00:19.650> tricky<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.189> once<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.609> get<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> hang<00:00:20.820> of

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
of tricky to do once you get the hang of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.859 
of tricky to do once you get the hang of
it<00:00:21.150> it'll<00:00:21.689> be<00:00:21.779> fine<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.920> basically<00:00:23.160> by<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
it it'll be fine so it's basically by a

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.650 
it it'll be fine so it's basically by a
so<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.080> Zen<00:00:25.560> domination<00:00:26.310> come<00:00:27.029> way<00:00:27.180> through<00:00:27.449> hit

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
so a Zen domination come way through hit

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.169 
so a Zen domination come way through hit
coming<00:00:27.990> all<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> way<00:00:28.230> through<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.789> over

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
coming all the way through here and over

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.350 
coming all the way through here and over
there<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> yeah<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.600> want<00:00:34.309> they'll<00:00:35.309> go<00:00:35.489> jump

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
tricky you have to jump from here until

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.290 
tricky you have to jump from here until
they're<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.550> you<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.730> jump<00:00:47.940> at<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.120> right

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
they're so you have to jump at the right

this wall now this part fight it looks

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.139 
this wall now this part fight it looks
confusing<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.160> not<00:00:59.340> really<00:00:59.520> go<00:00:59.879> right

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
confusing but it's not really go right

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.889 
confusing but it's not really go right
up<00:01:00.239> against<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.629> rule<00:01:00.899> will<00:01:01.289> go<00:01:02.250> into<00:01:02.430> um

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
up against this rule will go into um

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.370 
up against this rule will go into um
crouch<00:01:03.899> now<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.750> top<00:01:07.020> part<00:01:07.260> of

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
crouch now you see the top part of

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.280 
crouch now you see the top part of
opening<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> bottom<00:01:08.100> part<00:01:08.250> right<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.479> you

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
opening the bottom part right this you

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.770 
opening the bottom part right this you
have<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.619> make<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:11.010> aiming<00:01:11.430> site<00:01:11.970> parallel

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
have to make your aiming site parallel

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.109 
have to make your aiming site parallel
to<00:01:13.560> them<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> put

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
to them so like you have to put

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.330 
to them so like you have to put
basically<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> top<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.380> balcony<00:01:16.560> make

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
basically the top of the balcony make

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.920 
basically the top of the balcony make
sure<00:01:17.520> its<00:01:17.670> face<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.210> top<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.689> on

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
sure its face on top of this on

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.050 
sure its face on top of this on
basically<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.680> move<00:01:19.830> along<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.909> sin

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
basically so just move along and sin

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.499 
basically so just move along and sin
it's<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.350> should<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.740> now

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
it's like there that should do it now

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.289 
it's like there that should do it now
just<00:01:24.509> go<00:01:24.720> into<00:01:24.869> crouch<00:01:25.790> now<00:01:26.790> all<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.210> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
just go into crouch now all you have to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.810 
just go into crouch now all you have to
do<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.630> once<00:01:27.810> you're<00:01:27.930> under<00:01:27.990> prone<00:01:28.820> those

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
do is so once you're under prone those

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.700 
do is so once you're under prone those
options<00:01:30.450> stick<00:01:31.229> layout<00:01:31.619> legacy<00:01:32.460> south<00:01:32.729> for

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
options stick layout legacy south for

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.249 
options stick layout legacy south for
now<00:01:34.710> basically<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:36.259> just

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
now basically we have to do now is just

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.859 
now basically we have to do now is just

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
keep going to the left and so you can't

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.889 
keep going to the left and so you can't
crouch<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:40.590> look<00:01:40.829> pressing<00:01:41.340> circle<00:01:41.899> can't

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
crouch so now look pressing circle can't

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.920 
crouch so now look pressing circle can't
crouch<00:01:43.170> now<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.460> once<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.090> literally<00:01:45.720> can't

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
crouch now so once so literally can't

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.569 
crouch now so once so literally can't
production<00:01:46.320> stuff<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.649> phone<00:01:46.860> now<00:01:47.399> what<00:01:47.549> you

before and then you should just fly up
in<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.329> air<00:02:00.450> right<00:02:00.810> died<00:02:01.560> earlier<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.909> then

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
in the air right died earlier and then
