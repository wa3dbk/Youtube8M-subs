00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.070
 paul using gentlemen so alone is the 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.110
 heating is awesome you do not know 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.610

 more important attitude and 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.020
 coordination that develops 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.620

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.410

 paintings on the skin with henna and then 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.990

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.270
 love whatever the bollywood is a 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.940
 fusion of several rhythms not like that is a 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.220
 position between classic dances of the 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.860
 Indian that were originally sacred and 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.350
 they danced in the temples and dances 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.810
 modern hip hop jazz or Latin 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.000
 you doubt the class and the most important thing is 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.740
 that we understand culture as such and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.530
 with some respect, let's do 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.500
 exercise and dance well is light bulb 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.450
 then this one as if you grabbed a 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.350
 cherry tree 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.350
 ahead 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.590
 wow is too subtle as they use 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.390
 little fingers and the attitude is very basic and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.250
 that she interprets in fact she is based 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.740
 much also in the movement of the 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.390
 eyes 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.329
 you can also close the eye of 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.790
 suddenly has more technique just from 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.590
 silent is like more romantic we go with 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.130
 this classic phase of the dance of 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.130

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.880
 rain 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.579
 it is practiced barefoot because it is a 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.680
 symbol of respect because originally 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.799
 these classical dances were practiced 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.290
 inside the sanctuaries I let out 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.319

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.469

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.390

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.770

 lined with ribbons used in dances 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:14.440
