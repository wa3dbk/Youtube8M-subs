00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.680
 continuation of the experiment by definition 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:19.439
 maximum load which can 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.789
 to stand drywall for one running 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:29.970
 a profile meter for this was manufactured 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:34.680
 rim and twist 1 meter profile to it 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:38.720
 luck in it already made a hole to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.720
 it was possible to hang the platform with the load 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.790
 profile twist the screws with the usual 25 and 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:50.790
 herringbone method that is tilted 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.309
 right left and try not to get into 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.409
 metal jumper that is all 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.409
 will only hold on drywall 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:06.810
 skinny spun fit to the meter 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:10.680
 twenty one screws now need to do 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.549
 platform and attach and so that the load 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.549
 evenly distributed 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.320
 suspended the platform and loaded it 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:55.640
 bricks solid brick without voids 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:59.170
 first put 24 bricks and 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.620
 nothing happened all day 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.540
 added two more and under load at 26 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:13.430
 bricks we leave the whole structure on 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:18.140
 night passed 17 hours and nothing 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:21.880
 changed on electronic scales weighed 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.620
 one brick turned out three kilograms 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.380
 185 grams 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.010
 so now on platform 26 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.860
 bricks 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.460
 total weight 83 kilograms for 17 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.910
 o'clock 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.460
 drywall holds profile on itself 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.430
 which has a constant load 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.930
 83 kilograms 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.650
 1 meter long ude profile 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:53.540
 twisted only in drywall at 20 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.730
 self-tapping screws this exceeds the traction force 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.260
 stretch ceiling more than two s 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.470
 half the time for such a seemingly not 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.030
 durable material like drywall this 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:10.690
 outstanding result experiment goal 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.900
 not only to figure out the carrying capacity 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.739
 drywall 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.459
 but detached from it so profile 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.110
 we will carry out a crash test we will add four at once 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.220
 bricks and see how this whole 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.220
 the structure will fall apart 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.340
 destroyed the structure that can be said 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.820
 according to the results of drywall quite easily 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.920
 maintains a load of 60 kilograms per 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:05.810
 one meter running screwed in profile 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.860
 83 kilograms stand if not 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.990
 pull and ninety five kilograms 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:18.890
 there was almost immediately a break 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:24.340
 profile from drywall experiment 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.340
 Thank you all for your attention.
