 of cooking I hope you have well 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:26.039
 sweet tooth because today I bring a recipe for 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.689
 the sweetest thing and I'm going to prepare 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.910
 and not any cookies not going to that 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.920
 will take away I will prepare some cookies 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.350
 with chocolate chips of the type 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.839
 Ahoy chips that are not going to leave even the 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.180
 crumbs because the truth is idiots 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.440
 and for this recipe the ingredients that 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.769
 We are going to need your 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.659
 following 500 grams of flour in this 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.970
 case I am using a flour 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.860
 special for pastry but if you go to 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.900
 use a normal life you will have to 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.759
 add also a teaspoon of 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:01.509
 yeast a teaspoon of baking 

00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:05.259
 170 grams of butter 225 grams of 

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:09.460
 white sugar 250 grams of sugar 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:12.790
 brown 2 eggs a tablespoon of 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.490
 Vanilla extract and 300 grams of 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.090
 chocolate chips and already with all this 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.659
 we can start to prepare it 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.659
 cookies 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.430
 The first thing we are going to do before 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.020
 nothing is to put our preheated oven 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.060
 at 175 degrees Celsius once put 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.550
 the oven to preheat we are going to add 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.410
 the teaspoon of baking flour and 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.030
 in the case of not using flour 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.740
 special for baking 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.020
 we will also add the spoonful of 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.510
 yeast and now we're going to mix everything 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.520
 very well 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.560
 Next, we are going to process 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.210
 our urine so that it is fine 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.310
 once the flour is sieved 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.460
 we will add the sugar in a bowl 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.350
 brown and white sugar 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.660
 then we will take the butter 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.550
 we will break it into pieces as well 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.220
 it will be much easier to beat and you 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.230
 we will incorporate sugar 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.360
 then let's pick up a blender 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.709
 pastry and we're going to beat all this very 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.270
 well until all the ingredients 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.270
 be well incorporated 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.540
 when everything is well mixed 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.230
 let's incorporate the two eggs to the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.000
 mixture 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.800
 once you have incorporated the two 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.950
 eggs we will also incorporate the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.659
 vanilla extract once incorporated 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.250
 the egg and the vanilla extract we're going 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.090
 to continue beating until everything is 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.090
 well incorporated 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.520
 once we have everything right 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.140
 mixed let's incorporate the flour 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.580
 now that we have incorporated the flour 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.110
 we will continue doing during 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.110
 approximately 10 seconds 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.580
 a little market for 10 seconds we 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.600
 we will relax and now we will continue 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.310
 beating with your hands once finished 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.500
 of lowering a cookie dough what 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.990
 let's do is incorporate almost all 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.480
 the chips of chocolates leaving some 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.260
 few to allocate more vegetation 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.720
 or less and we will continue working 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.939
 then I picked up a cloth 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.860
 silicone to put it in the oven in the 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.810
 case of not having to use vegetal paper 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.180
 that are equally valuable to you and now what 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.970
 I'm going to do is take a little club 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.079
 I'm going to make a little ball with my hands 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.269
 and I'm going to crush him here in the bathroom 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.459
 up to give it what is the way of 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.739
 cookie and how there are not too many 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.930
 chocolate chips above that's why I've 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.970
 booked a few and now with 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.069
 joaquin and I'm going to 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.319
 remain clearly visible 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.120
 once cookies are prepared so 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.639
 minus the first round because it has 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.260
 left for a second baked what 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.780
 let's do is put it in the oven 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.639
 between 10 and 12 minutes until we see 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.819
 that start to toast on the part of 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.819
 down 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.099
 I just took my second batch of 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.629
 cookies from the oven and although in a 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.189
 principle had said that I was going to 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.469
 leave 12 minutes at the end I finished 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.720
 leaving the 20 and is that they are 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:19.130
 pretty big cookies the way 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.530
 transmit our in life is also 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.240
 that is that they contain a golden color 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.669
 above not important at the beginning 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.830
 They are a little soft because 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.050
 they get cold they get very crispy but 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.970
 yes it is important that we let them cool 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.889
 in the same silicone paper because if 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.560
 we try to take it off right now 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.690
 where would the cookie be a mind 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.530
 cooled our street is served in 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.139
 a plate and I want you to hear this the 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.539
 cookie is super it is crispy like 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.430
 you must be sure that after seeing this 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.259
 recipe and each one of you are 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.940
 thinking about preparing our own 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.430
 chocolate cookies and is that the truth 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.199
 It is so delicious and it said we appreciated 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.150
 before too well on the plate but the 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.910
 truth is that they are huge indeed 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.310
 I'm going to show one of them look what 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.139
 piece of cookie occupies half head and 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.980
 They are tremendous and have not come out 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.490
 just few do not you go 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.070
 I have a plate full of them and I've 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.430
 eaten three fixes if you have cookies 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.430
 you have 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.749
 ah 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.580
 I think this step of the cookies does not 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:27.770
 lasts a week and it is that the truth is 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.479
 tremendous delicious can not stop 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.460
 eat it and I think from the week 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.649
 next I 'll have to go raising 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.869
