I'm going to take the the end piece here

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.410 
I'm going to take the the end piece here
and<00:00:29.390> use<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:31.289> make<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:32.430> route<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.149> what

and use it to make the route and what

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.290 
and use it to make the route and what
it's<00:00:34.079> raw<00:00:34.410> fish<00:00:37.190> through<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.340> process<00:00:40.760> so<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
it's raw fish through the process so the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.630 
it's raw fish through the process so the
secret<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.020> put<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.770> cling<00:00:44.370> film

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
secret is to put it on this cling film

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.160 
secret is to put it on this cling film
and<00:00:45.110> then<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.200> take<00:00:46.410> some<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:47.840> Marus<00:00:48.840> war

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and then you take some of this Marus war

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.369 
and then you take some of this Marus war
or<00:00:50.780> katya<00:00:51.780> very<00:00:52.469> rough<00:00:52.739> sea<00:00:53.340> salt<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:55.170> put

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
or katya very rough sea salt and you put

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
a lot of that on it I suppose it's just

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:10.450 
a lot of that on it I suppose it's just
to<00:00:57.510> preserve<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> doesn't<00:01:00.920> go<00:01:01.920> bad

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.640

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
so you put a lot of sea salt on it like

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.910 
so you put a lot of sea salt on it like
that

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:27.440
