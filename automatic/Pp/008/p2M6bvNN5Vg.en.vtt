at<00:00:06.150> first<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.629> thought<00:00:06.779> about<00:00:07.020> making<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.470> video

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
about this then I went through the

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.290 
about this then I went through the
process<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.960> making<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.559> but<00:00:10.920> gave<00:00:11.309> up<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.820> now

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300

I'm<00:00:12.480> back<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.440> reason<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.830> because

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
I'm back and the reason is because
