now<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.210> chrome-lined<00:01:27.810> barrel<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.350> first<00:01:28.650> I'm

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
now the chrome-lined barrel is first I'm

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.530 
now the chrome-lined barrel is first I'm
going<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.100> increasing<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:30.000> damage

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
going to be increasing your damage

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.100 
going to be increasing your damage
output<00:01:30.869> by<00:01:31.799> 25%<00:01:32.520> now<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.329> means<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.900> you

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
output by 25% now this means that you

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.350 
output by 25% now this means that you
will<00:01:34.140> normally<00:01:34.350> get<00:01:34.740> something<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> 1.4<00:01:36.090> X

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
will normally get something like a 1.4 X

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.679 
will normally get something like a 1.4 X
multiplier<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.130> body<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.060> normally<00:01:39.570> your

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
multiplier to the body so normally your

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.170 
multiplier to the body so normally your
damage<00:01:40.049> would<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.259> 98%<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.850> then<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
damage would be 98% if you then get a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.730 
damage would be 98% if you then get a
body<00:01:42.390> shot<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.780> will<00:01:42.899> get<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> multiplier<00:01:43.619> of

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
body shot you will get a multiplier of

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.889 
body shot you will get a multiplier of
1.4<00:01:44.490> x<00:01:44.729> mean<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.540> you're<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.810> be

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
1.4 x mean that you're going to be

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.170 
1.4 x mean that you're going to be
getting<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.170> one-hit<00:01:46.590> kill<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.670> when<00:01:48.060> you're

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
getting a one-hit kill but when you're

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.270 
getting a one-hit kill but when you're
using<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.479> chrome<00:01:48.720> black<00:01:48.930> barrel<00:01:49.380> you'll<00:01:50.009> for

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
using the chrome black barrel you'll for

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.050 
using the chrome black barrel you'll for
instance<00:01:50.640> get<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.530> 1.65<00:01:52.729> multiplier<00:01:53.729> when<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
instance get a 1.65 multiplier when you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.310 
instance get a 1.65 multiplier when you
shoot<00:01:54.270> someone<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> chest

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
shoot someone to the chest

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.350 
shoot someone to the chest
so<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.950> basically<00:01:56.280> means<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.700> your<00:01:57.149> raw

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
so this basically means that your raw

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.810 
so this basically means that your raw
damage<00:01:57.689> output<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.530> literally<00:01:59.340> going<00:01:59.610> to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
damage output is literally going to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.940 
damage output is literally going to
receive<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> bit<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.719> buff<00:02:01.049> when<00:02:01.770> you're

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
receive a bit of a buff when you're

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.100 
receive a bit of a buff when you're
using<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.399> chrome-lined<00:02:02.850> barrel<00:02:02.930> but<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
using the chrome-lined barrel but the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.950 
using the chrome-lined barrel but the
downside<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> chrome-lined<00:02:05.430> barrel<00:02:05.460> is

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
downside to the chrome-lined barrel is

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.779 
downside to the chrome-lined barrel is
that<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.200> increases<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.799> kick<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.520> your

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
that it increases the kick of your

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.699 
that it increases the kick of your
weapon<00:02:09.179> by<00:02:09.750> quite<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> lot<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.440> going<00:02:10.590> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
weapon by quite a lot it's going to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.960 
weapon by quite a lot it's going to
increase<00:02:10.979> your<00:02:11.099> recoil<00:02:11.640> acquire<00:02:12.090> lots

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
increase your recoil acquire lots

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.610 
increase your recoil acquire lots
plus<00:02:13.270> it's<00:02:13.450> also<00:02:13.630> going<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.080> increase<00:02:14.260> your

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
plus it's also going to increase your

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.070 
plus it's also going to increase your
idle<00:02:15.100> sway<00:02:15.280> which<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.240> basically<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.810> amount

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
idle sway which is basically the amount

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.110 
idle sway which is basically the amount
you've<00:02:17.410> done<00:02:17.680> sways<00:02:18.070> when<00:02:18.670> you're<00:02:18.820> aiming

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
you've done sways when you're aiming

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.060 
you've done sways when you're aiming
down<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.300> sights<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:20.350> this<00:02:20.470> is<00:02:20.620> definitely

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
down the sights and this is definitely

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.430 
down the sights and this is definitely
something<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.760> have<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.000> keep<00:02:22.210> in<00:02:22.360> mind<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:23.260> if

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
something you have to keep in mind so if

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.710 
something you have to keep in mind so if
you<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.160> me<00:02:24.520> are<00:02:25.090> planning<00:02:25.480> on<00:02:25.570> using

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
you just like me are planning on using

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.750 
you just like me are planning on using
the<00:02:25.930> links<00:02:26.320> sniper<00:02:26.620> rifle<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.580> that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the links sniper rifle and that

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.760 
the links sniper rifle and that
basically<00:02:28.240> means<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.930> can't<00:02:29.260> use<00:02:29.590> this

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
basically means that you can't use this

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.830 
basically means that you can't use this
gun<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.400> spray<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.820> pray<00:02:30.970> because

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
gun to just spray and pray because

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.570 
gun to just spray and pray because
you're<00:02:32.380> literally<00:02:32.710> is<00:02:32.800> going<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.070> be<00:02:33.190> sweating

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
off of targets and that is really not

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.980 
off of targets and that is really not
going<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.730> be<00:02:36.850> working<00:02:37.090> out<00:02:37.300> very<00:02:37.600> well<00:02:37.660> for

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.280 
main reason where the p226 is as
powerful<00:03:30.190> as<00:03:30.340> it<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.850> because<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:31.750> pistol

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
powerful as it is is because this pistol

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.520 
powerful as it is is because this pistol
can<00:03:32.530> fire<00:03:32.800> up<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.220> 800<00:03:34.060> rounds<00:03:34.900> per<00:03:35.050> minute<00:03:35.200> if

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
can fire up to 800 rounds per minute if

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.890 
can fire up to 800 rounds per minute if
you<00:03:35.590> are<00:03:35.860> capable<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.670> firing<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.390> gun<00:03:37.570> really

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
you are capable of firing the gun really

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.810 
you are capable of firing the gun really
quickly<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.070> is<00:03:39.310> mainly<00:03:39.520> why<00:03:39.790> I

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
quickly so that is mainly why I

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.690 
quickly so that is mainly why I
personally<00:03:40.180> usually<00:03:40.690> go<00:03:40.810> for<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.080> p226<00:03:41.700> but

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
personally usually go for the p226 but

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.250 
personally usually go for the p226 but
the<00:03:42.850> other<00:03:42.940> pistols<00:03:43.390> in<00:03:43.450> this<00:03:43.570> game<00:03:43.840> are<00:03:43.870> also

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
the other pistols in this game are also

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.590 
the other pistols in this game are also
really<00:03:44.590> good<00:03:44.739> apart<00:03:45.340> from<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.880> first<00:03:46.239> pistol

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
really good apart from the first pistol

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.170 
really good apart from the first pistol
we<00:03:47.560> don't<00:03:47.769> like<00:03:47.920> that<00:03:48.100> one<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.340> can't<00:03:48.850> come<00:03:49.150> up

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
we don't like that one I can't come up

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.000 
we don't like that one I can't come up
with<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.450> name<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.870> moments<00:03:50.200> but<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:50.830> use

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
with the name of the moments but I use

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.800 
with the name of the moments but I use
that<00:03:51.040> thing<00:03:51.430> once<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:51.970> really<00:03:52.330> didn't<00:03:52.660> like

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
that thing once and really didn't like

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.320 
that thing once and really didn't like
it<00:03:53.019> then<00:03:53.830> I<00:03:54.040> first<00:03:54.220> I<00:03:54.400> went<00:03:54.640> from<00:03:54.880> ready<00:03:55.120> up

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
it then I first I went from ready up

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.660 
it then I first I went from ready up
just<00:03:55.600> because<00:03:55.720> ready<00:03:56.170> up<00:03:56.290> allows<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.890> to

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
just because ready up allows you to

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.060 
just because ready up allows you to
ready<00:03:57.940> up<00:03:58.060> your<00:03:58.180> gun<00:03:58.269> faster<00:03:58.720> after<00:03:58.780> sprinting

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
ready up your gun faster after sprinting

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.890 
ready up your gun faster after sprinting
but<00:04:00.070> in<00:04:00.220> terms<00:04:00.459> of<00:04:00.640> perks<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.180> two<00:04:01.390> perks<00:04:01.720> that

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
but in terms of perks the two perks that

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.740 
but in terms of perks the two perks that
are<00:04:02.140> really<00:04:02.470> just<00:04:02.910> necessary<00:04:03.910> are<00:04:04.180> quick-draw

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
are really just necessary are quick-draw

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.020 
are really just necessary are quick-draw
and<00:04:04.780> focus<00:04:05.470> quick-draw<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.459> going<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.820> allow

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
and focus quick-draw is going to allow

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.210 
and focus quick-draw is going to allow
you<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.180> zoom<00:04:07.420> in<00:04:07.600> faster<00:04:08.140> which<00:04:08.739> makes<00:04:09.070> the

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
you to zoom in faster which makes the

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.430 
you to zoom in faster which makes the
Lynx<00:04:09.550> pretty<00:04:09.850> deadly<00:04:10.150> at<00:04:10.570> mid-range<00:04:10.840> as<00:04:11.230> well

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
Lynx pretty deadly at mid-range as well

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.460 
Lynx pretty deadly at mid-range as well
and<00:04:11.739> focus<00:04:12.370> is<00:04:12.880> essentially<00:04:13.660> toughness<00:04:14.260> from

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
and focus is essentially toughness from

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.039 
and focus is essentially toughness from
black<00:04:14.680> ops<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:15.090> focus<00:04:16.090> basically<00:04:16.540> make<00:04:16.720> sure

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
black ops to focus basically make sure

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.349 
black ops to focus basically make sure
that<00:04:17.320> when<00:04:17.560> an<00:04:17.650> enemy<00:04:17.769> hits<00:04:18.100> you<00:04:18.310> you<00:04:18.940> do<00:04:19.180> not

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
that when an enemy hits you you do not

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.029 
that when an enemy hits you you do not
flinch<00:04:19.810> off<00:04:20.109> of<00:04:20.320> targets<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:20.859> it's

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
flinch off of targets and it's

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.469 
flinch off of targets and it's
definitely<00:04:21.460> going<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.669> help<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:22.030> out<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.150> ton

definitely going to help you out a ton

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.690 
definitely going to help you out a ton
in<00:04:22.750> terms<00:04:23.380> of<00:04:23.530> getting<00:04:23.740> multiple<00:04:24.220> kills<00:04:24.430> in<00:04:24.610> a

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
in terms of getting multiple kills in a

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.730 
in terms of getting multiple kills in a
row<00:04:24.729> with<00:04:25.660> any<00:04:25.900> sniper<00:04:26.200> rifle

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
row with any sniper rifle

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.890 
row with any sniper rifle
in<00:04:26.919> code<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.190> girls<00:04:27.520> then<00:04:28.389> also<00:04:28.600> went<00:04:28.870> for

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
in code the girls then also went for

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.330 
in code the girls then also went for
lightweight<00:04:29.410> just<00:04:29.590> because<00:04:29.889> with<00:04:30.009> a<00:04:30.039> sniper

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
lightweight just because with a sniper

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.909 
lightweight just because with a sniper
rifle<00:04:30.850> you<00:04:31.030> only<00:04:31.690> move<00:04:31.900> at<00:04:32.110> 80<00:04:32.410> percent<00:04:32.800> of<00:04:32.830> the

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
rifle you only move at 80 percent of the

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.249 
rifle you only move at 80 percent of the
base<00:04:33.100> speed<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.819> with<00:04:34.509> light<00:04:34.780> weights<00:04:35.080> you

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
base speed and with light weights you

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.350 
base speed and with light weights you
move<00:04:35.440> about<00:04:35.680> seven<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.310> eight<00:04:36.490> percent<00:04:36.520> faster

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
move about seven to eight percent faster

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.089 
move about seven to eight percent faster
so<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:37.930> is<00:04:38.139> when<00:04:38.289> I<00:04:38.319> usually<00:04:38.500> go<00:04:38.710> for<00:04:39.039> the

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
so that is when I usually go for the

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.100 
so that is when I usually go for the
light<00:04:39.250> weights<00:04:39.550> and<00:04:39.819> then<00:04:40.270> slide<00:04:40.539> up<00:04:40.569> and<00:04:40.870> just

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
light weights and then slide up and just

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.140 
light weights and then slide up and just
to<00:04:41.259> reload<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.710> little<00:04:41.949> bit<00:04:42.039> faster<00:04:42.490> within

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
to reload a little bit faster within

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.520 
to reload a little bit faster within
cold<00:04:43.509> that<00:04:43.630> he<00:04:43.690> goes<00:04:43.840> we're<00:04:44.110> loading<00:04:44.319> your

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
cold that he goes we're loading your

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.320 
cold that he goes we're loading your
sniper<00:04:44.830> rifle<00:04:44.979> does<00:04:45.520> take<00:04:45.759> a<00:04:45.789> pretty<00:04:46.180> long

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
sniper rifle does take a pretty long

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.240 
sniper rifle does take a pretty long
time<00:04:46.569> ultimately<00:04:47.349> you're<00:04:47.710> very<00:04:47.919> vulnerable

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
time ultimately you're very vulnerable

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.460 
time ultimately you're very vulnerable
once<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.030> are<00:04:49.150> reloading<00:04:49.389> your<00:04:49.630> weapon<00:04:49.960> so

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
once you are reloading your weapon so

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.020 
once you are reloading your weapon so
that<00:04:50.620> is<00:04:50.710> why<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:50.889> usually<00:04:51.160> go<00:04:51.520> for<00:04:51.759> sleight<00:04:52.000> of

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
that is why I usually go for sleight of

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.480 
that is why I usually go for sleight of
hand<00:04:52.300> as<00:04:52.419> well<00:04:52.630> but<00:04:53.410> like<00:04:53.740> I<00:04:53.889> said<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.310> two

hand as well but like I said the two
perks<00:04:54.819> are<00:04:55.000> really<00:04:55.270> is<00:04:55.360> necessary<00:04:55.599> a<00:04:56.229> quick

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
draw and focus you can switch up the
