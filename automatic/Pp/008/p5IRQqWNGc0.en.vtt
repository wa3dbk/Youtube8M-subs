00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.160
 good morning everyone morning we have 30 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.770
 May 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.780
 friday and and 10 am just 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.690
 returned with the post decided to share with 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.059
 you your obnovochki it means that I 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.929
 acquired acquired a flashlight from the company 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.500
 ultrafire 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.230
 he gives it according to the manufacturer 1600 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.080
 lumen is possible of course and all 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.840
 not true because it releases 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:34.050
 China but I think that if here 400 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.440
 lumen here it is quite possible there are 1600 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.840
 lumen 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.050
 because the difference is colossal 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.530
 glow we so let's have a little bit 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:47.250
 talk about his capabilities means 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.410
 first he has 7 modes second he 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:56.280
 works on batteries 18600 50 years old 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.559
 we have a t6 bride 95 grams without 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.820
 batteries 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.800
 let's now these lanterns perhaps 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.320
 immediately because before these lanterns from 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.990
 I have not seen sales, but as soon as I saw 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.780
 without thinking immediately and pin bow and by the way 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.330
 I'll tell you right away and the price is 8 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.729
 dollars 49 cents + free 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.560
 forwarding 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.869
 how to see the only difference arena 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.939
 the only one of the body differences is the button 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.159
 here she is bright green hell and porridge 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.960
 acid mask at first thought that she 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.140
 glows in the dark there is nothing like 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.360
 just a very bright plastic and while we're with 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.119
 you're talking about the buttons, I immediately notice 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.119
 that there is a bump here 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.750
 mound here is a button soft pressing 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.320
 this button is much softer than here though 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.430
 here the button is already designed as 2 and h 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.000
 I have already told you that there is so 6 years 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.930
 here 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.270
 u 5 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.610
 But in general, the two main differences between a 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.530
 plus another major difference is that 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.450
 This flashlight works on the finger 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.620
 batteries and also runs on batteries 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.820
 18650 and that's basically all the main 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.610
 differences corr let's check how is he 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.130
 shines on he sits guys very bright we 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.020
 We think that the camera will transfer this participant 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.730
 because the room is light enough 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.670
 we will carry out tests either in the stairwell 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.680
 either at night on the street will show just but 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.680
 let 's see, let 's look at 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.570
 first look at the thread 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.320
 battery 18 thousand 650 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.050
 so I see now I hope that 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.510
 camera people too rubber 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.270
 sealing ring is it in ide about 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.590
 that the torch can not be 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.570
 permeable let's see what's inside 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.370
 I personally see that everything is fine there 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.200
 no dirt is processed here 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.280
 I see here that very often 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.299
 and deep carving this is good farther u 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.549
 we are here to unscrew the lens in which 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.150
 with which is well divorced 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.730
 fire further here I also see pay 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.799
 flax and a ring so as not to be lost 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:25.430
 got water in there and let's try 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:30.730
 now one of his regime is none 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.730
 his ability is beam focusing 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:40.040
 well yes yes not bad at all not even bad 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.740
 here still all guys lubrication ride all 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.330
 very difficult to see hard it is me 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.560
 glad that there will be nothing to hang out 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.570
 although my previous flashlight on expiration 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.880
 the whole term that I used it yet 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.550
 Nothing 10 did not let loose while walking already 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.550
 a little bit freer than new 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.710
 flashlights 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:08.890
 well and let's look at the thread here and 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:08.890
 there as you can see the difference is obvious on 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.990
 Sudan certainly not suitable 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:22.960
 honestly i love very much 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.939
 this flashlight for being unpretentious and 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.400
 really good guys took it 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:30.370
 his dollar for 4 maximum for 5 and for this 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.139
 the price he worked was just amazing 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.509
 I know there are many brand lights 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.659
 which won't work so that's it for me 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.729
 phoenix and were these felix just flew away 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:42.639
 through the mountains just constant 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.830
 use in general guys such 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.879
 a small obnovochka will now be thousands 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.560
 wait for tests think next weekend then 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:53.469
 eat tomorrow i will try to spend 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.370
 some tests but for now tell me 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:59.080
 more you have nothing like everything said 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:04.469
 have to wait for tests on it will be with 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.469
 you say goodbye to new meetings all bye
