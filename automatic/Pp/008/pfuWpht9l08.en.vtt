you can see quite a bit of engine work
has<00:00:11.400> been<00:00:11.670> done<00:00:11.969> here<00:00:12.799> and<00:00:14.509> there<00:00:15.509> originally

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
has been done here and there originally

has been done here and there originally
was<00:00:16.800> an<00:00:16.949> AMC<00:00:17.420> 360<00:00:18.420> engine<00:00:18.810> and

this<00:00:32.860> is<00:00:33.930> quite<00:00:34.930> quite<00:00:35.920> modified<00:00:36.460> compared<00:00:37.329> to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
this is quite quite modified compared to

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.920 
this is quite quite modified compared to
the<00:00:37.630> original<00:00:38.579> equipment

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.930 

fiberglass<00:00:46.760> construction

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.960 

and<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.660> probably<00:00:51.170> notice<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.940> bumpers<00:00:52.940> that

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
and you probably notice the bumpers that

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:01.080 
and you probably notice the bumpers that
extended<00:00:53.870> out<00:00:54.050> as<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.650> safety<00:00:55.070> feature

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.420 

very<00:01:01.660> nice<00:01:01.899> interior<00:01:02.460> he's<00:01:03.460> got<00:01:03.640> a<00:01:03.670> roll<00:01:03.969> cage

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.640 

and<00:01:06.670> automatics<00:01:07.660> were<00:01:07.840> offered<00:01:08.320> in<00:01:08.530> the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
and automatics were offered in the

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.670 
and automatics were offered in the
beginning<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.340> in<00:01:10.060> last<00:01:10.750> year<00:01:11.020> production<00:01:11.620> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
beginning and in last year production a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:24.499 
beginning and in last year production a
manual<00:01:14.680> was<00:01:14.830> also<00:01:15.220> offered

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.460 

reportedly<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.770> cost<00:01:27.740> three<00:01:28.740> times

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
reportedly it cost three times

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.250 
reportedly it cost three times
as<00:01:30.920> much<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.610> manufacture<00:01:32.360> of<00:01:32.390> this<00:01:32.660> car<00:01:32.990> as

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
as much to manufacture of this car as

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.499 
as much to manufacture of this car as
what<00:01:33.530> they<00:01:33.740> could<00:01:34.370> sell<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.730> for

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.080 

the<00:01:39.990> amount<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.710> cost<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.640> dealer<00:01:41.880> was

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the amount that it cost the dealer was

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.969 
the amount that it cost the dealer was
around<00:01:42.390> five<00:01:42.689> thousand<00:01:43.289> but<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.469> cost<00:01:43.770> about

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
around five thousand but it cost about

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.929 
around five thousand but it cost about
sixteen<00:01:44.700> thousand<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.329> make<00:01:45.539> each<00:01:45.719> one<00:01:45.750> so

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
sixteen thousand to make each one so

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.340 
sixteen thousand to make each one so
obviously<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.240> only<00:01:48.539> do<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:49.289> so

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
obviously you can only do that for so

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.279 
obviously you can only do that for so
long<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.979> was<00:01:50.009> produced<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.270> New<00:01:51.750> Brunswick

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
long it was produced in New Brunswick

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.719 
long it was produced in New Brunswick
Canada<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:54.649> evidently<00:01:55.649> as<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> way<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.280> bring

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
Canada and evidently as a way to bring

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.020 
Canada and evidently as a way to bring
industry<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> area<00:01:58.610> but<00:01:59.610> wasn't

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
industry to the area but wasn't

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.590 
industry to the area but wasn't
sustainable<00:02:00.899> because<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:02.600> because

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
sustainable because of the because

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.300 
sustainable because of the because
essentially<00:02:04.229> they<00:02:04.409> were<00:02:04.439> losing<00:02:04.860> money<00:02:05.159> on

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
essentially they were losing money on

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.559 
essentially they were losing money on
every<00:02:05.460> car<00:02:05.819> they<00:02:06.030> produced<00:02:07.849> this<00:02:08.849> car<00:02:09.209> has

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
every car they produced this car has

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.170 
every car they produced this car has
electrically<00:02:10.289> operated<00:02:10.400> going<00:02:11.400> doors<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
electrically operated going doors the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.640 
electrically operated going doors the
only<00:02:12.239> wanted<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:12.959> that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.649 

and<00:02:16.739> you'll<00:02:17.159> see<00:02:17.459> how<00:02:17.610> they<00:02:17.790> work<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.390> minute

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
and you'll see how they work in a minute

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.030 
and you'll see how they work in a minute
or<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:20.840> there's<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.930> button<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.739> side<00:02:23.010> of

or so there's a button on the side of

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:33.750 
or so there's a button on the side of
the<00:02:23.280> car<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:25.530> actuates<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.580> door

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760
