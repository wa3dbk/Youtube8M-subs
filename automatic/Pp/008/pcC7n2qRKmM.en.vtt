00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:01.625
 So, recently, many of you have been asking 

00:00:01.625 --> 00:00:03.875
 how I correct the color and color of my videos, 

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:07.125
 So, I thought about making a two-part series about working with color. 

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.666
 Hi, my name is Simon Cade and this is DSLR Guide. 

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:24.375
 The first thing I want to do is give you an example of all the shots that I'll correct 

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:25.208
 in this episode, 

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:27.000
 but while I'm doing it, I just want to remind you 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.250
 that this is the first part of a two part series, 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.791
 all about how I manipulate color for my movies, 

00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:35.041
 So, the other part is color correction, which is absolutely vital, 

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:38.125
 but I will enter fully into that in the episode next week. 

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.083
 Or, if you will be seeing this in the future, 

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:43.708
 Then you can find a link in the description where you will find part 2. 

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:44.291
 Okay, 

00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:47.625
 So, the first shot is just a very simple shot of me playing the guitar, 

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.291
 and I would also like to say, in fact, 

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.583
 that all the shots that I make in this video, 

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:55.291
 including this right here, they were filmed in the Canon T3i 

00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:57.208
 using a Cinestyle profile. 

00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:59.791
 So, let's open the color settings in Final Cut, 

00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:01.958
 but everything I show in this video can be done 

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.625
 in any of the standard editors, 

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:07.875
 as long as your program has some kind of bass, mid and high settings. 

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:10.291
 So, the first thing to do is add some definition 

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.583
 I use these editions too. 

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:14.166
 Mostly we are going to add a circular mask and reduce it, 

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.333
 but I will turn it off, because it will be very useful later on. 

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:20.416
 I'll select the clip and click Command-C to copy, 

00:01:20.416 --> 00:01:24.333
 and then I'll select the other clips and click Option-Command-V, 

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.375
 that hits all the effects. 

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:29.000
 So, the first thing I do is lower the shadows a bit, but then 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.791
 I select halftones to handle most of the contrast. 

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:34.625
 But if we see the waveform monitor on the left, we can see that, 

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:38.375
 everything is below 50, which is quite dark, so let's increase the high lights. 

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:41.000
 Then we will add some greens to the media and some blues to the high lights, 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.875
 and some reds to the shadows, 

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:45.083
 and finally I will reduce the saturation a bit. 

00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:48.916
 Before enabling the circular mask that we did before, if we change to the vectorscope, 

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:52.333
 then we can see that the skin tones are aligned with the skin indicator, 

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.375
 that is, the material is not colored. 

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:58.500
 Now, if you can not see this line go to settings and you can check that it is enabled. 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.708
 This is how I usually correct a shot like that, 

00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:03.291
 but recently I have acquired Film Convert, 

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.208
 and although I use that to correct now, 

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:09.833
 I wanted to illustrate that they can get close enough, using the standard color wheels. 

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:13.083
 So, with Film Convert I choose the camera and profile with which I was filming, 

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:16.750
 and then I set the exposure and the color temperature, using the viewfinders, 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.250
 So, the following is the film material. I usually use this, 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.750
 because it has a certain orange look on it. 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.833
 And then I adjust the film color and the curve so that it is not too contrasted, 

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:28.333
 and then I'll just lower the grain a little bit, 

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:30.875
 and then I'll raise the saturation too. 

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:33.333
 The last thing to do is add some orange to the halftones 

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:34.708
 and some green at high lights, 

00:02:34.708 --> 00:02:38.625
 thus when we check our vectorscope, skin tones are again neutral. 

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.166
 Let's compare the two shots, 

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:45.791
 we can see that the Film Covert LUT tends to interpret shadows and high lights better, 

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:50.375
 note that the Film Convert has a nice variation and contrast on the face 

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.750
 without losing detail in the shadows or high lights. 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.625
 and of course, the grain is nice but it is not to everyone's taste. 

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.625
 The following is a shot of a wedding I shot some time ago, 

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:01.291
 and you can see that the image is a bit under-exposed already, 

00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:02.625
 So, to compensate, 

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:07.708
 I, in fact, will raise the shadows and I will not lower the midtones so much. 

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:10.083
 Again, I will increase the high beams, and, 

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:12.333
 seeing this image I am quite happy with the warm tones, 

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:16.000
 but I will add a little green to the shadows and blue to the media, 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.125
 which highlights the suit jacket, 

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:22.541
 and I will also compensate that with some orange in the high lights. 

00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:25.750
 And if we bring the circular mask and check the skin tones, 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.000
 we can see that again we are neutral, 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.958
 again, that orange in the high lights was the important factor, 

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.041
 to make sure our skin tones were neutral. 

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:36.166
 Again, let's see how I correct this if I work with Film Convert, 

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:40.166
 and in this case I, as always, establish the exposure and color temperature, 

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:41.791
 and I usually do this by eye, 

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:46.291
 with the idea that it is OK not to use the viewers in the initial stages, 

00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:49.750
 while you check everything later, in the subsequent processes, 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.458
 and you can always go back and touch up things. 

00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:54.208
 Since it is a wedding, I do not want to have it too contrasted, 

00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:56.416
 I will also lower the grain enough. 

00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:59.166
 Looking at our viewers, we can see that we have all the information of shadows 

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:02.375
 and the high lights are around 75, which I agree with. 

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.208
 Again, we will add some saturation 

00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:06.791
 and finally I'll just add a little green to the shadows, 

00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:08.500
 to make your jacket stand out a little, 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.791
 and you can see what it looks like before and after. 

00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:13.000
 Now, if we check our image with the circular mask, 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.125
 We can see that our skin tones are fine, a little towards yellow, but, 

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:18.375
 the warm tones were the original idea, so that's fine. 

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:22.458
 So, again, let's compare the standard color correction, with that of Film Convert, 

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:25.083
 and you can see that there really is a lot of difference between the two. 

00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:28.375
 I tried to tie them as much as possible but I did find, 

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:29.750
 that, no matter what he did, 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.000
 the high lights were always going to burn a bit in the standard color correction, 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.208
 although there was less contrast in the midtones. 

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:41.875
 And if I tried to have that same contrast by lowering the shadows, 

00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:43.125
 then we lost detail, 

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:46.416
 and if I tried to download it by adding halftones, then, 

00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:49.750
 the woman darkens, then I have to increase the high lights, and they burn. 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.166
 So, it seems to me that, 

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:54.416
 Film Convert has a very good way of handling the contrast. 

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:56.541
 So, let's see this shot of the skier, 

00:04:56.541 --> 00:05:00.250
 we will lower the shadows a little, the media a lot, and then we will increase the discharges, 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.125
 again, let's check the waveform monitor to not lose detail, 

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:05.125
 then we will add some greens to the shadows 

00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:08.166
 and we will take the circular mask to see that our snow is not colored, 

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:11.125
 and, again, I have to get into the high lights a bit, until 

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:14.125
 the vectorscope shows that it is a neutral color. 

00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:17.875
 Finally I will increase the saturation a bit, and disable the circular mask 

00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:19.708
 to be able to take a look at the final image. 

00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:23.250
 And for the Film Convert version we will adjust the exposure, temperature and film material 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.625
 quite similar to the previous, 

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:28.875
 and then I will lower the intensity of the curve a bit, and increase the saturation. 

00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:32.375
 Finally I will use the regular color corrector to add more green to the shadows 

00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:34.041
 as to accentuate that look, 

00:05:34.041 --> 00:05:36.916
 and then I'll also use the circular mask to fix our snow, 

00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:38.625
 that in this case I needed more purple. 

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:42.208
 So, for a general shot like this where we're not focused on skin tones, 

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:45.916
 I think you can have a pretty similar look whether you use Film Convert or not, 

00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:48.458
 but I do like that organic style of that film grain. 

00:05:48.458 --> 00:05:50.833
 Now that you have seen how I correct most of my shots, 

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.416
 I would also like to mention the fact that the color correction is 

00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:55.916
 Of course, another one of our narrative devices, 

00:05:55.916 --> 00:05:58.791
 So, the next example is a shot of a runner, 

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:03.125
 to represent the strenuous atmosphere of someone who is demanding a run, 

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:06.208
 you can see that I have obtained a very impressive contrast 

00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:08.083
 and I also lowered the saturation. 

00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:10.208
 So, let me show you how I made that look. 

00:06:10.208 --> 00:06:14.041
 By adding some contrast to this image you will see that I put my wrong white balance 

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.250
 and was sub-exposed. 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.750
 So, first I increased my high lights to compensate for the sub-exposure, 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.125
 and then also remove some blue from those high lights and halftones, 

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:23.791
 in order to have a neutral image, 

00:06:23.791 --> 00:06:26.083
 and then if under 50% saturation, 

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:27.958
 then we get a kind of stylized look 

00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.250
 which, I think at least fits into the take of a corridor. 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.375
 as a standard thing, that if you disturb the image, 

00:06:33.375 --> 00:06:36.000
 then, obviously you will have a faded look, 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.916
 although you can say the "big cliché", 

00:06:37.916 --> 00:06:40.208
 but, I like this look for the shot. 

00:06:40.208 --> 00:06:43.750
 So, in Film Convert we will fix the blue tint with our temperature control, 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.916
 and then everything else is quite the same as always 

00:06:45.916 --> 00:06:49.041
 except that we will have more grain and less saturation. 

00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:52.708
 As an appetizer of next week's video, where I will do color correction, 

00:06:52.708 --> 00:06:56.166
 I will only tie this shot quickly with another shot that I shot, 

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.833
 in a completely different location with different settings. 

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:01.000
 So, what I do is put the clip on top, 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.541
 and then I cut it to the left so I can see both images at the same time, 

00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:08.541
 and then, in the same way I'll adjust exposure color temperature and curves, 

00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:10.500
 until we have something that matches. 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.416
 But I'll show you how to match shots with different lighting conditions, 

00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:14.375
 and different cameras, 

00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:17.166
 and I'll have to fix color problems in next week's video, 

00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:18.666
 so stay tuned for that, 

00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:19.916
 What if, 

00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:21.291
 Before I forget, in fact, 

00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:24.583
 I would also like to say that I will be putting in the blog post, 

00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:28.000
 a lot of embedded videos that I find really useful, 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.041
 particularly there are things about Larry Jordan 

00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:33.416
 who is brilliant in color correction, and has taught me a lot 

00:07:33.416 --> 00:07:35.875
 and that's where many of the ideas in this video have come from. 

00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:37.666
 So, check those videos in the blog post, 

00:07:37.666 --> 00:07:39.500
 again, the link in the description, 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.166
 thanks for looking, see you next.
