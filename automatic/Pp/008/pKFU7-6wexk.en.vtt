00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
striking back I think the greatest

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.270 
striking back I think the greatest
compliment<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:35.989> give<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.650> music<00:02:37.130> that

was<00:02:37.430> written<00:02:37.730> for<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.600> film<00:02:39.019> is<00:02:39.440> doesn't<00:02:40.220> stand

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
was written for a film is doesn't stand

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.340 
was written for a film is doesn't stand
on<00:02:40.640> its<00:02:40.790> own<00:02:40.910> there's<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.510> few<00:02:41.630> some<00:02:41.780> music<00:02:42.170> I

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
on its own there's a few some music I

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.340 
on its own there's a few some music I
think<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.769> mark<00:02:43.310> score<00:02:43.700> for<00:02:44.209> 42<00:02:44.720> absolutely

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
think that mark score for 42 absolutely

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.830 
think that mark score for 42 absolutely
stands<00:02:45.769> on<00:02:45.890> its<00:02:46.040> own<00:02:46.160> as<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.670> whole<00:02:46.970> as<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.570> piece

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
stands on its own as a whole as a piece

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.800 
stands on its own as a whole as a piece
of<00:02:47.959> music<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.709> plays<00:02:49.459> as<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.820> symphony<00:02:50.600> if<00:02:50.720> you

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
of music that plays as a symphony if you

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.860 
of music that plays as a symphony if you
will

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.509 

it's<00:02:56.379> a<00:02:56.440> very<00:02:56.650> structured<00:02:57.040> score<00:02:57.280> very

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
it's a very structured score very

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.979 
it's a very structured score very
traditionally<00:02:58.120> structured<00:02:58.420> score<00:02:58.810> in<00:02:58.870> that

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
traditionally structured score in that

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.740 
traditionally structured score in that
sense<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.650> themes<00:02:59.890> follow

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
sense that the themes follow

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.430 
sense that the themes follow
structurally<00:03:01.750> all<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.019> way<00:03:02.110> through<00:03:02.349> the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
structurally all the way through the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.720 
structurally all the way through the
storytelling<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:03.220> think<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.610> most

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
storytelling I think the most

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.309 
storytelling I think the most
challenging<00:03:03.819> scene<00:03:04.450> in<00:03:04.629> this<00:03:04.720> film<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:05.200> the

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
challenging scene in this film is the

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.080 
challenging scene in this film is the
ending<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.739> it's<00:03:06.069> a<00:03:06.099> long<00:03:06.340> piece<00:03:06.640> of<00:03:06.670> music

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
ending is it's a long piece of music

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.390 
ending is it's a long piece of music
that<00:03:07.120> starts<00:03:07.769> seven<00:03:08.769> minutes<00:03:09.040> from<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.280> end

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
that starts seven minutes from the end

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.339 
that starts seven minutes from the end
it<00:03:09.489> goes<00:03:09.610> all<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.910> way<00:03:10.050> non-stop

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
it goes all the way non-stop

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.800 
it goes all the way non-stop
it's<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.769> long<00:03:12.010> montage<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.849> wraps<00:03:13.360> up<00:03:13.599> not

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
it's a long montage that wraps up not

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.960 
it's a long montage that wraps up not
only<00:03:13.840> Jackie's<00:03:14.379> ability<00:03:14.769> in<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:14.950> field<00:03:15.190> this
