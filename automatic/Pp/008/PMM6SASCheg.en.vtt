00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
like to go and purchase that app so my

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.349 
like to go and purchase that app so my
process<00:02:59.680> for<00:03:00.099> lightning<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.519> photo<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:01.030> pretty

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
process for lightning a photo is pretty

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.229 
process for lightning a photo is pretty
simple<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.959> pull<00:03:02.680> up<00:03:02.859> the<00:03:03.099> photo<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.640> after

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
simple I pull up the photo in after

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.259 
simple I pull up the photo in after
light<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.690> then<00:03:05.290> i<00:03:05.530> use<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.489> brightness<00:03:07.060> and

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
light and then i use the brightness and

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.050 
light and then i use the brightness and
contrast<00:03:07.569> toggle<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:09.160> work<00:03:09.640> with<00:03:09.910> the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
contrast toggle to work with the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.940 
contrast toggle to work with the
lighting<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.660> basically<00:03:11.140> remove<00:03:11.709> the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
lighting and basically remove the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.910 
lighting and basically remove the
shadows<00:03:12.400> brighten<00:03:13.299> up<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.569> overall<00:03:14.019> image<00:03:14.319> so

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
shadows brighten up the overall image so

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.619 
shadows brighten up the overall image so
that<00:03:14.950> it's<00:03:15.280> out<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.519> place<00:03:15.879> where<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.209> think

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
that it's out of place where I think

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:32.660 
that it's out of place where I think
it's<00:03:16.870> clearly<00:03:17.470> legible<00:03:17.859> visibly

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:55.230 

you

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.690 

so<00:03:55.690> once<00:03:55.990> I've<00:03:56.200> done<00:03:56.350> that<00:03:56.410> step<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.130> go<00:03:57.400> ahead

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
so once I've done that step I go ahead

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.090 
so once I've done that step I go ahead
and<00:03:57.910> save<00:03:58.210> the<00:03:58.450> image<00:03:58.810> because<00:03:59.290> right<00:03:59.890> now<00:03:59.920> the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
and save the image because right now the

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.980 
and save the image because right now the
image<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:00.700> lighter<00:04:01.090> but<00:04:01.480> it<00:04:01.600> isn't

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
image is lighter but it isn't

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.860 
image is lighter but it isn't
necessarily<00:04:02.850> exactly<00:04:03.850> where<00:04:04.240> I'd<00:04:04.360> like<00:04:04.570> it<00:04:04.720> to

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
necessarily exactly where I'd like it to

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.330 
necessarily exactly where I'd like it to
be<00:04:04.990> so<00:04:05.380> because<00:04:05.680> there's<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:05.920> couple<00:04:06.130> of

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
be so because there's a couple of

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.970 
be so because there's a couple of
different<00:04:06.640> items<00:04:06.790> in<00:04:07.210> this<00:04:07.500> picture<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.710> I

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
different items in this picture and I

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.070 
different items in this picture and I
want<00:04:09.520> to<00:04:09.610> highlight<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.420> washi<00:04:10.690> tape

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
want to highlight the washi tape

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.370 
want to highlight the washi tape
specifically<00:04:11.800> I<00:04:12.010> use<00:04:12.880> another<00:04:13.510> app<00:04:13.810> called

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
specifically I use another app called

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.430 
specifically I use another app called
big<00:04:14.770> lens<00:04:15.070> that<00:04:15.790> helps<00:04:16.239> me<00:04:16.300> to<00:04:16.570> create<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:17.110> blur

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
big lens that helps me to create a blur

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.100 
big lens that helps me to create a blur
effect<00:04:17.920> in<00:04:18.300> specific<00:04:19.300> areas<00:04:19.510> of<00:04:19.750> the

area<00:04:40.480> and<00:04:41.040> then<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.070> can<00:04:42.340> move<00:04:42.520> on<00:04:42.790> I<00:04:43.120> can<00:04:43.690> edit

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
area and then I can move on I can edit

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.530 
area and then I can move on I can edit
things<00:04:44.230> like<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:45.040> aperture<00:04:45.610> filter<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.360> the

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
things like the aperture filter and the

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.690 
things like the aperture filter and the
lens<00:04:46.900> now<00:04:47.560> I'm<00:04:47.770> going<00:04:47.920> to<00:04:47.980> ignore<00:04:48.130> filter

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
lens now I'm going to ignore filter

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.060 
lens now I'm going to ignore filter
because<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:49.270> basically<00:04:49.690> gives<00:04:49.930> me<00:04:50.230> a<00:04:50.440> choice

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
because that basically gives me a choice

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.210 
because that basically gives me a choice
of<00:04:51.540> Instagram<00:04:52.540> like<00:04:52.960> filters<00:04:53.620> that<00:04:53.800> I<00:04:53.860> can<00:04:54.040> put

interested in doing that but what I am
interested<00:04:58.300> in<00:04:58.780> doing<00:04:59.140> is<00:04:59.290> adjusting<00:04:59.920> the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
interested in doing is adjusting the

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.600 
interested in doing is adjusting the
aperture<00:05:01.060> so<00:05:01.570> I<00:05:01.600> can<00:05:01.930> actually<00:05:02.110> adjust<00:05:02.610> how

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
aperture so I can actually adjust how

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.230

blurry<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:05.410> background<00:05:05.920> of<00:05:06.130> this<00:05:06.640> photo<00:05:06.910> is

in<00:05:07.570> order<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.320> place<00:05:08.650> a<00:05:08.980> appropriate<00:05:09.970> amount

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
in order to place a appropriate amount

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.180 
in order to place a appropriate amount
of<00:05:10.420> significance<00:05:10.990> on<00:05:11.140> the<00:05:11.350> washi<00:05:11.560> tape<00:05:11.950> that's

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
of significance on the washi tape that's

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.160 
of significance on the washi tape that's
in<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.550> foreground<00:05:12.910> another<00:05:13.690> thing<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:14.020> like

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
in the foreground another thing I like

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.710 
in the foreground another thing I like
to<00:05:14.230> use<00:05:14.590> is<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.070> lens<00:05:15.370> option<00:05:15.940> that<00:05:16.180> actually

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
to use is the lens option that actually

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.930 
to use is the lens option that actually
allows<00:05:17.020> me<00:05:17.320> to<00:05:17.500> change<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:18.460> shape<00:05:18.670> of<00:05:18.910> the

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
allows me to change the shape of the

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.510 
allows me to change the shape of the
lens<00:05:19.210> and<00:05:19.510> that<00:05:20.140> kind<00:05:20.440> of<00:05:20.590> adjusts<00:05:21.280> the

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
lens and that kind of adjusts the

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.450 
lens and that kind of adjusts the
highlights<00:05:22.480> in<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:23.320> picture<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:24.100> any

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
highlights in the picture to any

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.940 
highlights in the picture to any
specific<00:05:24.880> shape<00:05:25.540> and<00:05:25.810> as<00:05:26.230> I<00:05:26.260> mess<00:05:26.590> around<00:05:26.710> with

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
specific shape and as I mess around with

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.250 
specific shape and as I mess around with
these<00:05:27.040> shapes<00:05:27.310> you<00:05:27.550> can<00:05:27.700> see<00:05:28.060> that<00:05:28.330> as<00:05:29.200> I

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
these shapes you can see that as I

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.160 
these shapes you can see that as I
change<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.580> choices<00:05:30.880> you<00:05:31.690> get<00:05:31.900> different

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
change the choices you get different

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.920 
change the choices you get different
