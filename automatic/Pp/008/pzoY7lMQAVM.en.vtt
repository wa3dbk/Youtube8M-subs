00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
is the kind of density and the kind of

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.490 
is the kind of density and the kind of
cultivation<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.600> we<00:02:31.810> consider<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.320> the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
cultivation that we consider is the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.600 
cultivation that we consider is the
better<00:02:32.709> for<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.190> kind<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.520> existing<00:02:35.610> low

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
better for this kind of existing low

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.360 
better for this kind of existing low
density<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.990> natural<00:02:38.470> light<00:02:38.950> are

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
density and the natural light are

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.340 
density and the natural light are
probably<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.150> two<00:02:40.390> main<00:02:40.630> differences

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
probably the two main differences

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.949 
probably the two main differences
between<00:02:41.709> this<00:02:42.190> farm<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:43.120> conventional

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
between this farm and the conventional

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.550 
between this farm and the conventional
fish<00:02:44.650> farming<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.870> three<00:02:47.110> things<00:02:47.380> is

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
fish farming one of three things is

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.530 
fish farming one of three things is
gonna<00:02:47.709> happen<00:02:47.920> here<00:02:48.310> one<00:02:48.850> is<00:02:49.060> I'm<00:02:49.270> gonna<00:02:49.450> have

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
gonna happen here one is I'm gonna have

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.890 
gonna happen here one is I'm gonna have
a<00:02:49.600> perfect<00:02:50.050> cast<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:52.120> second<00:02:52.480> one<00:02:52.570> is<00:02:52.720> I'm

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
a perfect cast the second one is I'm

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.540 
a perfect cast the second one is I'm
gonna<00:02:53.020> completely<00:02:53.440> mess<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:53.890> up<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
gonna completely mess it up and the

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.949 
gonna completely mess it up and the
third<00:02:54.730> one<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:54.940> I'm<00:02:55.150> actually<00:02:55.270> gonna<00:02:55.510> fall<00:02:55.780> in

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
third one is I'm actually gonna fall in

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:20.140 
third one is I'm actually gonna fall in

very important and the main difference
of<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.240> drop<00:03:51.390> our<00:03:51.540> pants<00:03:51.780> look<00:03:52.740> at<00:03:52.860> there<00:03:53.100> that's

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
of a drop our pants look at there that's

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.080 
of a drop our pants look at there that's
white<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.180> pinkish<00:03:55.370> it's<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.460> very<00:03:56.610> big<00:03:56.760> flock

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
white and pinkish it's a very big flock

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.440 
white and pinkish it's a very big flock
of<00:03:57.270> flamingos<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:59.160> is<00:03:59.370> amazing<00:03:59.850> really

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
of flamingos it is amazing really

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.730 
of flamingos it is amazing really
there's<00:04:00.600> millions<00:04:00.900> worth<00:04:02.660> more<00:04:03.660> than<00:04:03.900> 40,000

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
there's millions worth more than 40,000

only<00:04:05.550> in<00:04:05.610> this<00:04:05.850> pond<00:04:06.150> anyone<00:04:06.900> consider<00:04:07.260> that

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
only in this pond anyone consider that

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.020 
only in this pond anyone consider that
the<00:04:07.650> birds<00:04:08.010> for<00:04:08.310> example<00:04:08.370> are<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
the birds for example are the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.180 
the birds for example are the
traditional<00:04:09.690> enemy<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.560> fish<00:04:10.770> farmer

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
traditional enemy of the fish farmer

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.000 
traditional enemy of the fish farmer
because<00:04:11.370> many<00:04:11.820> birds<00:04:12.090> eat<00:04:12.690> some<00:04:13.050> fish<00:04:13.440> but<00:04:13.650> for

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
because many birds eat some fish but for

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.280 
because many birds eat some fish but for
us<00:04:14.100> for<00:04:14.310> example<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.850> flamingos<00:04:15.360> they<00:04:15.990> are

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
us for example the flamingos they are

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.020 
us for example the flamingos they are
moving<00:04:16.980> nutriment

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
moving nutriment

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.510 
moving nutriment
moving<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.989> energy<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:20.100> they<00:04:20.310> are

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
moving the energy so they are

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.380 
moving the energy so they are
contributing<00:04:21.110> to<00:04:22.110> the<00:04:22.230> quality<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.860> water

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
contributing to the quality of the water

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.540 
contributing to the quality of the water
they<00:04:24.390> take<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.290> pink<00:04:25.590> color<00:04:25.830> from<00:04:26.250> the

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
they take the pink color from the

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.820 
they take the pink color from the
carotenoid<00:04:27.270> pigments<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.140> are<00:04:28.320> in<00:04:28.650> their

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
carotenoid pigments that are in their

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.310 
carotenoid pigments that are in their
dreams<00:04:29.190> larvae<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.360> some<00:04:30.630> other<00:04:30.840> organism

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
dreams larvae and some other organism

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.260 
dreams larvae and some other organism
from<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.740> drop<00:04:31.890> on<00:04:32.040> top<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:32.610> with<00:04:32.820> them<00:04:33.030> being

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
from the drop on top so with them being

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.700 
from the drop on top so with them being
here<00:04:33.540> you<00:04:33.780> know<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:34.200> that<00:04:34.380> kind<00:04:34.650> of

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
here you know that that kind of

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.430 
here you know that that kind of
microalgae<00:04:35.220> that<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:36.330> microphone<00:04:37.050> is

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
microalgae that that microphone is

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.070 
microalgae that that microphone is
present<00:04:38.310> it's<00:04:38.550> good<00:04:38.940> for<00:04:39.180> them<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.600> good<00:04:39.780> for

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
present it's good for them and good for

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.020 
present it's good for them and good for
the<00:04:40.140> fish<00:04:40.320> exactly<00:04:40.860> this<00:04:40.980> is<00:04:41.190> a<00:04:41.220> very<00:04:41.610> big

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
the fish exactly this is a very big

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.790 
the fish exactly this is a very big
indicator<00:04:42.540> that<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.020> health<00:04:43.290> of<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.620> water

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
indicator that the health of the water

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.429 
indicator that the health of the water
is<00:04:44.040> very<00:04:44.100> good<00:04:44.340> for<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.730> business

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439 
is very good for the business

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.999 
is very good for the business
so<00:04:46.979> you<00:04:47.159> really<00:04:47.429> were<00:04:47.550> kind<00:04:47.669> of<00:04:47.759> working<00:04:47.999> with

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
so you really were kind of working with

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:50.929 
so you really were kind of working with
relationships<00:04:50.009> here<00:04:50.249> you're<00:04:50.459> almost<00:04:50.610> you

even say that I am more expert on

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.799 
even say that I am more expert on
ecological<00:04:56.339> relationships<00:04:56.999> than<00:04:57.569> on

00:04:57.799 --> 00:04:57.809 
ecological relationships than on
