00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 they made friends of youtube that they 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.549
 I bring a new video where I'm going to 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.460
 teach how to sell a luxury car like 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.469
 what they see here the bugatti veyron the most 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.730
 expensive one that costs a million and then what 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.870
 The only thing they have to do is enter the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.700
 gta online menu and they go to 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.470
 in options they are going to change their place of 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.630
 appearance instead of property they will 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.910
 put in last location is pretty 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.740
 easy now what I recommend is that 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.509
 put like from your car outside the 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.009
 car workshop the closest that 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.970
 have any work so do not 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.030
 there is a problem 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.090
 then they settle in the easiest way 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.440
 that can here I take a little and 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.480
 when just when they have done it 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.250
 they go and now he's going to be going to put 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.090
 start will go to gta online and go to 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.370
 Leave 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.829
 online gta this is to be saved in 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.539
 your place of appearance so that you no longer 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.030
 appear on the property if they already have it 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.300
 so there will be no problem but 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.190
 here we are going to put you in people in game 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.350
 they are going to create a new game too 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.780
 it works if they change profiles and enter a 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.610
 new profile so that there is no more 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.830
 problems if you do not want to lose some 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.560
 process of your departure only in this step 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.360
 just the profile in new profile and if 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.860
 do not do this again but 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.710
 support your departure so that you do not 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.020
 they will be able to lose 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.520
 so that they can not not go to waste 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.280
 by accident or something 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.710
 ok here right when they appear 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.720
 what they are going to do is going to be good 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.370
 a little bit more here they're going to start 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.680
 they will give you online gta 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.710
 we are going to play online but now 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.560
 let's put session by invitation ok 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.040
 they will give in 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.020
 in accepting and we wait for 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.840
 I hope it sounds good I'm not 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.310
 calling with the yeti microphone that 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.590
 recorded no video with him since he 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.329
 I bought 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.710
 is that I did not like the area but 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.329
 I think it 's pretty good 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.729
 after the car has already appeared 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.640
 car outside the shop they are going to 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.859
 will enter inside try not 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.270
 scratch it but before this I forgot 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.229
 say what they have to go for a car 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.179
 whatever they have in front and what 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.129
 try to scratch a little so that they 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.780
 ask to repair it here it is not noticeable but if 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:17.120
 is lightning and then this is so that it does not stop 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.330
 Ask them to repair it and they can sell it 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.480
 faster ok if we do not go it does not matter 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.250
 You see here as I will say later 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.140
 that I have to repair it, I have to 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.700
 sell do not sell repair please what 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.340
 what they have to do is give it to sell 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.709
 they're going to give it to you once there do not sell it 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.379
 are going to give start will go to tiendo to xbox 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.390
 game and they will give you to accept then 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.549
 when there is already loaded you will give in 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.200
 go and go back the safest thing is that 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.329
 we are going to look like here they come back to 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.910
 repeat the steps of going to xbox to the 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.620
 Xbox store and come back here what happens in 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.360
 fast camera so there is no problem 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.690
 and as you can see it is not just sent to your 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.100
 auto or bugatti veyron took him out of the workshop 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.829
 of cars and the only thing they have to 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.470
 to do is to enter the car inside 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.450
 remember that to get more money is 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.790
 better to have it to the maximum that you can here 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.739
 they give me 207 thousand four hundred ninety and 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.599
 so many that I could not read and sell it 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.060
 fast they give him in search to change 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.340
 character in options 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.200
 as well as they see on screen and they give in the 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.030
 character in which they are 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.930
 they wait they wait they wait they wait 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.230
 wait and as I water will not appear 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.310
 the car outside and they're going to have their 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.160
 money, money, in my opinion 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.670
 these load screens that last a 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.670
 eternity 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.250
 ok after you have taken them out of 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.600
 that has taken them out the only thing they have 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.520
 what to do if they want to sell it again to 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.420
 get out of your car they are going to look for one another 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.440
 that are not obviously trailer 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.440
 let's find one 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.209
 and here we are going to leave it we are going to leave 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.709
 We will look for a car that is and 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.000
 remember that they do not matter well 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:03.440
 example this one 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.010
 we are going to enter the car workshop 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.010
 okay 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.990
 let's remember also because I think that 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.570
 is what we have to tear too 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.400
 but it's not a problem, it's not the only thing 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.970
 they're going to have to do that again 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.799
 give him to sell 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.840
 remember that you will also ask for what 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.210
 do not repair it we give to sell once not 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.850
 sell it go understand of xbox live or 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.430
 I do not know what it's called when you load it 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.430
 come back and I think this time just for him 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:36.300
 I already appears in my bugatti car in here 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.390
 he brings me back to my car he counted a gun 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.330
 too much here is fast now fast 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.639
 fast we go to 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.620
 to the car shop again and we're going to 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.710
 say that we can sell it again and 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.080
 we give you in is online card and search 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.460
 new session like that is the trick I say 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.349
 in character flesh I hope that you 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.639
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.639
 go friends
