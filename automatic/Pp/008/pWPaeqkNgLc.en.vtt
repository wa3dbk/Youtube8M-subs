00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:09.460
 hello how are we here in another 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.530
 video more today we will see how 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.960
 to brighten this cake I have 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.100
 asked how I do it in my cakes 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.960
 so that the color is more vivid this 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.000
 color for example either with what 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.060
 you are going to use on your cake but 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.900
 especially the brightness that it gives to your 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.090
 fondant 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.210
 after you finish it and all the 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.540
 of how you can give it shine and 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.440
 gives another more precious texture or color 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.530
 more alive they have asked me and then here 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.870
 I have the answer I have this tutorial 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.239
 I hope you like it, let's start what 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.210
 only one that we are going to occupy first 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.239
 well a finished cake designed to your 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.210
 how do you have to do it? 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.160
 so I have this one that I actually used my 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.790
 tutorial on how to assemble the fondant 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:06.049
 above the cake is this cake so 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.720
 decorate this theme this horse and 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.610
 horseshoes and those things true then 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.090
 it occurred to me I do it this way 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.530
 truth I teach them more or less the part 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.270
 above is that it is mounted here in 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.720
 is on this base and that is how it is left for 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.720
 this person 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.469
 Now let's see how notice 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.530
 well the color you have right now is very 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:34.770
 pretty and everything but a little dry 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.939
 let's achieve another kind of shine in 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.409
 this cake that looks prettier is going 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:49.560
 to like more or how good the first thing 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:52.140
 you need is a cake and an iron one 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.030
 iron ok you are going to have your 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.159
 iron is all they occupy to give it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.630
 shine to this cake they will see how it is going to 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:03.000
 stay put where it is pure steam already 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.159
 that it has pure water vapor but for 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.160
 you have to win it first before putting it 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.890
 in the cake and not to put it so stuck 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.349
 because you wet it and also like 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.090
 could help the fondant more and it 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.000
 you can make balls you have to be careful 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.940
 also ok then it's an iron how 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.820
 it will be just look at the steam that makes 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.800
 when he does that, he 's perfect and he's going to 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.660
 your cake look very pretty ok 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.900
 Then let's do put our 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.900
 cake again here 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.480
 here you can appreciate it there ok then 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.829
 let's grab our iron we're going to 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.250
 grab our iron and we're going 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.250
 Helping 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:49.060
 ok at a distance 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:51.360
 a precious and reach to leave a 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.880
 pressure at a distance 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.480
 the griddle are not glued 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.550
 cake because as I tell you the only thing 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.920
 base is going to make balls and is going to 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.100
 wetting more the cancer ok and we're going 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.980
 Checking 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.220
 that the brightness that we want we can achieve 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.380
 ok and the color is more alive 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.080
 If we still have a bit left, we have to 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.660
 give it ok because if not if you notice the 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.720
 difference of where is the cake that 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.470
 the little piece that has already 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.470
 stayed dry 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.910
 we are giving it with great care as they 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.510
 I comment not to do so much the iron to 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.489
 your cake because then if you can 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.379
 more wet and they can go to 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.379
 pretty because well sweaty 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.610
 they are fixing the difference 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.099
 I do not know if you can see it here 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.150
 difference of how he was and how he is 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.580
 staying l 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.900
 we give in the top 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:04.710
 ok for the cake so that they reach 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.580
 appreciate how the shine they are going 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:12.200
 you fix that shine you achieve it through 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.480
 of your steam iron ok with pure steam 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.060
 you get done so beautiful is the 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.500
 truth is that it does look very good 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.650
 thing for example here in video and other 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.320
 thing here live looks beautiful precious 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.210
 the truth and still if for example as 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.910
 This one is for men but if it's for 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.860
 woman or for girl you see that you put 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.840
 the bright ones also up here 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.000
 of the cake it looks more beautiful 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.830
 still although there is another all that 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.480
 we do is check if we did not stay 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.480
 no bit like that half dry 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.139
 we are going to give you the little 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.969
 remember that it is not going to make the 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.299
 so much your plate because the only thing that goes 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:55.189
 to go you will cover your fondant I know 

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:59.119
 that they have to be very careful and 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:01.099
 this is this is the finished work ok 

00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:03.319
 here I already have my cake completely 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:06.829
 finished from the decoration from the 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:08.899
 filling the bread all fondant decoration 

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:12.409
 everything is already everything here and my point 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:14.809
 final the brightness ok here it is then look 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.939
 it's a tutorial more I've been asked 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:19.099
 several times how do I do it to achieve 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:21.079
 this shine well here is my secret ok 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.869
 The iron 

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:25.819
 I do not think that in your house they can have 

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:28.059
 an iron of the type that is no longer with 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:31.819
 to draw steam with your water 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:33.949
 perfectly and with that it's ok ok 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:36.469
 then they have it done they have the 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:39.949
 tool the perfect tool for 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:42.139
 Detail your cake in the end ok give it that 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.329
 touch of pretty brightness I do not know if 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.920
 they reach to appreciate here in the way that 

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:51.160
 it was ok and dried completely 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.360
 like in 30 minutes or 30 minutes 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.060
 approaches is already completely 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.710
 dry because it's pure steam or pure 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.630
 love is not we're not wetting it 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.720
 completely it is pure vapor what it 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.540
 we are giving the cake and it will grab 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.480
 a more beautiful color more alive and going to 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.940
 look like that ok, well, I hope you have them 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.460

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.590

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.100
 easy and anyone can have it in their 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.110
