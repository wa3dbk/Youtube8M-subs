Naturals conditional love conditioner

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.819 
Naturals conditional love conditioner
but<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.469> I'm<00:01:58.590> gonna<00:01:58.740> be

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
but I think this is what I'm gonna be

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.399 
but I think this is what I'm gonna be
using<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> deep<00:01:59.640> conditioner<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.840> now<00:02:01.049> it

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
using as a deep conditioner for now it

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.440 
using as a deep conditioner for now it
seems<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.860> little<00:02:02.100> stronger<00:02:02.460> than<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
seems a little stronger than the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.560 
seems a little stronger than the
Giovanni's<00:02:04.110> smooth

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
Giovanni's smooth

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.500 
Giovanni's smooth
sold<00:02:04.720> conditioner<00:02:05.320> so<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.280> think<00:02:06.970> this<00:02:07.210> is<00:02:07.270> like

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
sold conditioner so I think this is like

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.760 
sold conditioner so I think this is like
do<00:02:07.690> you<00:02:07.750> want<00:02:07.930> for<00:02:08.080> me<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.170> be<00:02:08.350> using<00:02:08.619> right

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
do you want for me to be using right

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.070 
do you want for me to be using right
about<00:02:08.979> now<00:02:09.190> deep<00:02:10.090> conditioning<00:02:10.630> works<00:02:10.840> more

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
about now deep conditioning works more

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.350 
about now deep conditioning works more
effectively<00:02:11.380> if<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.490> use<00:02:12.700> some<00:02:12.910> heat<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:13.330> I

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
effectively if you use some heat so I

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.780 
effectively if you use some heat so I
usually<00:02:13.690> put<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:14.050> shower<00:02:14.410> cap<00:02:14.650> on<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.400> blow

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
usually put a shower cap on and I blow

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.390 
usually put a shower cap on and I blow
dry<00:02:16.240> on<00:02:16.600> top<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.140> shower<00:02:17.320> cap<00:02:17.680> for<00:02:18.190> about

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
dry on top of the shower cap for about

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.470 
dry on top of the shower cap for about
five<00:02:18.700> minutes<00:02:18.940> or<00:02:19.390> less<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.840> then<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.380> put<00:02:20.650> a

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
five minutes or less and then I put a

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.570 
five minutes or less and then I put a
headscarf<00:02:22.480> over<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.350> shower<00:02:23.530> cap<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.220> trap

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
headscarf over the shower cap to trap

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.580 
headscarf over the shower cap to trap
that<00:02:24.850> heat<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.690> just<00:02:25.900> helps<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.380> hair

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
that heat and that just helps the hair

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.949 
that heat and that just helps the hair
soak<00:02:26.890> in<00:02:27.070> all<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.670> good<00:02:27.880> stuff<00:02:28.150> from<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.750> deep

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
soak in all the good stuff from the deep

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.590 
soak in all the good stuff from the deep
conditioner<00:02:29.850> moisturizing<00:02:30.850> conditioners<00:02:31.420> as

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
conditioner moisturizing conditioners as

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.530 
conditioner moisturizing conditioners as
the<00:02:32.080> name<00:02:32.230> suggests<00:02:32.640> boost<00:02:33.640> moisture<00:02:34.270> and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
the name suggests boost moisture and

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.750 
the name suggests boost moisture and
then<00:02:35.110> finally<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.950> have<00:02:36.010> protein

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
then finally you have protein

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.690 
then finally you have protein
conditioners<00:02:37.360> or<00:02:37.680> protein<00:02:38.700> reconstructors

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
conditioners or protein reconstructors

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.900 
conditioners or protein reconstructors
which<00:02:40.270> basically<00:02:40.780> help<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.350> build<00:02:41.920> up<00:02:42.280> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
which basically help to build up the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.240 
which basically help to build up the
hair<00:02:43.150> cuticle<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:44.080> if<00:02:44.110> your<00:02:44.590> hair<00:02:44.800> has<00:02:44.830> any

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
hair cuticle so if your hair has any

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.300 
hair cuticle so if your hair has any
sort<00:02:45.489> of<00:02:45.610> damage<00:02:45.970> they<00:02:46.720> will<00:02:46.959> strengthen<00:02:47.950> the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
sort of damage they will strengthen the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.790 
sort of damage they will strengthen the
weak<00:02:48.489> spots<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.239> their<00:02:49.720> best<00:02:50.020> for<00:02:50.350> weak<00:02:50.560> or

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
weak spots and their best for weak or

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.979 
weak spots and their best for weak or
damaged<00:02:51.160> hair<00:02:51.430> if<00:02:51.700> your<00:02:52.060> hair<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.420> healthy<00:02:52.840> I

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
damaged hair if your hair is healthy I

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.260 
damaged hair if your hair is healthy I
wouldn't<00:02:53.620> use<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:54.130> protein<00:02:54.520> conditioner<00:02:54.730> or<00:02:55.209> a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
wouldn't use a protein conditioner or a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.840 
wouldn't use a protein conditioner or a
protein<00:02:55.660> Reconstructor<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:56.769> weekly<00:02:57.430> basis

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
protein Reconstructor on a weekly basis

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.989
