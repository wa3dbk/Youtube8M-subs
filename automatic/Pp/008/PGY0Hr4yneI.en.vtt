so<00:00:04.500> here<00:00:04.850> we<00:00:05.850> will<00:00:05.970> have<00:00:07.370> two<00:00:08.370> bent<00:00:09.120> beams<00:00:09.480> see

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
so here we will have two bent beams see

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.060 
so here we will have two bent beams see
here<00:00:10.469> there<00:00:10.590> are<00:00:10.620> two<00:00:10.710> angles<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:13.070> we're

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
here there are two angles and we're

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.089 
here there are two angles and we're
going<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.340> also<00:00:14.700> have<00:00:17.270> two<00:00:18.270> oh<00:00:18.570> four<00:00:19.170> short

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
going to also have two oh four short

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.150 
going to also have two oh four short
black<00:00:20.579> connector<00:00:20.849> rods<00:00:21.649> now<00:00:22.649> as<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.860> can<00:00:23.009> see

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
black connector rods now as you can see

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.710 
black connector rods now as you can see
here<00:00:23.310> these<00:00:23.430> connect<00:00:23.790> rods<00:00:23.970> are<00:00:24.090> very<00:00:24.329> similar

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
here these connect rods are very similar

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.109 
here these connect rods are very similar
to<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.050> other<00:00:25.200> blue<00:00:25.950> connect<00:00:26.279> rods<00:00:26.520> but

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
to the other blue connect rods but

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.600 
to the other blue connect rods but
instead<00:00:27.509> of<00:00:27.570> having<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:28.140> reached<00:00:28.829> two-thirds

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
instead of having a reached two-thirds

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.810 
instead of having a reached two-thirds
of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.180> way<00:00:30.300> across<00:00:31.009> this<00:00:32.009> one<00:00:32.220> has<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> ridge

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
of the way across this one has a ridge

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.290 
of the way across this one has a ridge
in<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.120> middle<00:00:34.850> now<00:00:35.850> what<00:00:35.970> I'm<00:00:36.030> going<00:00:36.150> to<00:00:36.210> do

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
in the middle now what I'm going to do

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.400 
in the middle now what I'm going to do
is<00:00:36.420> we're<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.720> take<00:00:36.900> one<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
is we're going to take one of the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.970 
is we're going to take one of the
connector<00:00:37.800> odds<00:00:38.210> let's<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.980> these

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
connector odds let's get one of these

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.070 
connector odds let's get one of these
beings<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.000> see<00:00:42.150> this<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.720> end

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
beings and you can see this in this end

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.920 
beings and you can see this in this end
where<00:00:43.290> there<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.500> three<00:00:43.940> holes<00:00:44.940> one<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.720> them

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
where there are three holes one of them

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.790 
where there are three holes one of them
crossed<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> put<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.180> these

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
crossed I'm going to put one of these

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.310 
crossed I'm going to put one of these
connect<00:00:49.800> me<00:00:50.240> into<00:00:51.240> the<00:00:51.660> second<00:00:52.200> hole<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:54.320> should

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
connect me into the second hole I should

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.430 
connect me into the second hole I should
click<00:00:55.560> once<00:00:55.770> again<00:00:55.950> through<00:00:56.900> then<00:00:57.900> we<00:00:58.290> will

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
click once again through then we will

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.360 
click once again through then we will
have<00:00:59.900> second<00:01:00.900> connector<00:01:01.230> rows<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.130> place

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
have second connector rows and we place

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.310 
have second connector rows and we place
it<00:01:02.550> into<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.970> angle<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:06.990> him<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.020> now

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it into the angle you can see him so now

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.790 
it into the angle you can see him so now
we're<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.830> take<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:12.500> what<00:01:13.500> we've<00:01:13.650> done

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
we're going to take the what we've done

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.130 
we're going to take the what we've done
so<00:01:14.010> far<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.370> the<00:01:14.520> ev3<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.540> we're<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
so far with the ev3 and we're going to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.110 
so far with the ev3 and we're going to
put<00:01:16.500> these<00:01:17.430> connector<00:01:17.909> rods<00:01:18.090> into<00:01:19.790> these<00:01:20.790> end

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
put these connector rods into these end

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.750 
put these connector rods into these end
holes<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:23.070> three<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> top<00:01:23.549> will

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
holes here so the three on the top will

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.360 
holes here so the three on the top will
still<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.290> empty<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.799> they're<00:01:26.010> gonna<00:01:26.130> put

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
still be empty and they're gonna put

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:35.489 
still be empty and they're gonna put
them<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:30.620> they<00:01:31.620> should<00:01:31.799> fit<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.010> so

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:37.450 

now<00:01:36.499> we're<00:01:36.619> going<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.799> do<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.039> same<00:01:37.249> on<00:01:37.369> the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
now we're going to do the same on the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.880 
now we're going to do the same on the
other<00:01:37.520> side<00:01:39.640> going<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.789> take<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:41.810> rod<00:01:42.409> except

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
other side going to take this rod except

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.279 
other side going to take this rod except
that<00:01:43.039> instead<00:01:43.219> of<00:01:43.609> having<00:01:44.359> all<00:01:44.689> the

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
that instead of having all the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:46.929 
that instead of having all the
connections<00:01:46.009> on<00:01:46.159> this<00:01:46.340> side<00:01:46.579> we're<00:01:46.759> going<00:01:46.880> to

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
connections on this side we're going to

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.109 
connections on this side we're going to
put<00:01:47.119> them<00:01:47.240> on<00:01:47.359> this<00:01:47.659> side<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:49.100> we<00:01:49.280> take<00:01:49.579> one<00:01:49.999> of

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
put them on this side so we take one of

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.330 
put them on this side so we take one of
the<00:01:50.209> connector<00:01:50.569> odds<00:01:51.100> replace<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.250> in<00:01:52.310> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
the connector odds replace it in the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.580 
the connector odds replace it in the
second<00:01:52.700> hole<00:01:52.819> again<00:01:56.259> we're<00:01:57.259> going<00:01:57.349> to<00:01:57.409> do<00:01:57.500> the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
second hole again we're going to do the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.630 
second hole again we're going to do the
same<00:01:57.859> with<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.280> second<00:01:58.869> one<00:02:00.399> I'm<00:02:01.399> going<00:02:01.579> to

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
same with the second one I'm going to

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.959 
same with the second one I'm going to
place<00:02:01.849> it<00:02:02.060> in<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.329> angle<00:02:03.490> sometimes<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.789> can

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
place it in the angle sometimes it can

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.839 
place it in the angle sometimes it can
be<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.390> bit<00:02:06.049> fiddly<00:02:06.289> to<00:02:06.409> put<00:02:06.679> in<00:02:06.770> but<00:02:07.219> again<00:02:07.459> it

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
be a bit fiddly to put in but again it

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.990 
be a bit fiddly to put in but again it
should<00:02:08.060> click<00:02:08.899> as<00:02:09.440> soon<00:02:09.709> as<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:10.009> gets<00:02:10.250> through

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.910 

so<00:02:14.000> now<00:02:14.329> we're<00:02:14.599> going<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.900> put<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.650> on<00:02:15.799> the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
so now we're going to put it on the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.520 
so now we're going to put it on the
other<00:02:16.040> side<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:17.000> should<00:02:17.299> end<00:02:17.569> up<00:02:17.720> like<00:02:20.200> this

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
other side so it should end up like this

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.780 
other side so it should end up like this
then<00:02:22.250> put<00:02:22.519> it<00:02:22.579> in<00:02:24.220> push<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.430> in<00:02:27.579> and<00:02:28.579> should

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
then put it in push it in and should

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.670 
then put it in push it in and should
click<00:02:29.000> once<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.299> gets<00:02:29.420> through<00:02:29.590> let's<00:02:30.590> say

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
click once it gets through let's say

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:39.460 
click once it gets through let's say
this<00:02:30.859> is<00:02:32.799> what<00:02:33.799> it<00:02:33.950> should<00:02:34.220> look<00:02:34.250> like<00:02:38.470> so

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
this is what it should look like so

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.340 
this is what it should look like so
you've<00:02:39.590> completed<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.130> section
