finish up in the book and that's talking
about<00:00:04.190> religion<00:00:05.190> how<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.400> design<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:06.029> the

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
about religion how the design of the

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.570 
about religion how the design of the
brain<00:00:06.330> might<00:00:06.660> lead<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.069> religious

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
brain might lead to the religious

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.940 
brain might lead to the religious
impulse<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.269> say<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:09.750> our<00:00:09.900> brains<00:00:10.230> evolved

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
impulse you say that our brains evolved

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.539 
impulse you say that our brains evolved
to<00:00:11.250> make<00:00:11.400> us<00:00:11.550> all<00:00:11.790> believers<00:00:12.590> yeah<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.920> think

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
to make us all believers yeah I think

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.800 
to make us all believers yeah I think
that<00:00:14.940> that's<00:00:15.120> true<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:16.199> think<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.910> one<00:00:18.570> thing

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
that that's true I think that one thing

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.109 
that that's true I think that one thing
that<00:00:18.960> has<00:00:19.080> become<00:00:19.500> clear<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.400> recent<00:00:20.640> years

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
that has become clear in recent years

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.689 
that has become clear in recent years
and<00:00:21.330> analysis<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.140> brain<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:23.400> our

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
and analysis of the brain is that our

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.150 
and analysis of the brain is that our
brains<00:00:24.180> are<00:00:24.570> built<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.609> us<00:00:26.970> create

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
brains are built to have us create

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.679 
brains are built to have us create
narratives<00:00:29.160> create<00:00:29.580> stories<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.480> make

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
narratives create stories that make

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.160 
narratives create stories that make
sense<00:00:31.080> out<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:32.360> disparate<00:00:33.360> sensory

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
sense out of disparate sensory

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.910 
sense out of disparate sensory
experiences<00:00:35.070> or<00:00:35.309> facts<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.719> try<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> take

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
experiences or facts we try to take

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.610 
experiences or facts we try to take
fragments<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.820> information<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.750> weave<00:00:40.320> them

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
fragments of information and weave them

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.190 
fragments of information and weave them
together<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.250> into<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> story<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.989> this

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
together to into a story and we do this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.819 
together to into a story and we do this
both<00:00:43.770> consciously<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.940> subconsciously<00:00:45.829> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
both consciously and subconsciously and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.420 
both consciously and subconsciously and
what<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> hold<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:49.710> cognitive

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
what I hold is that this cognitive

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.540 
what I hold is that this cognitive
process<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.449> narrative<00:00:51.960> creation<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
process this narrative creation is the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.260 
process this narrative creation is the
basis<00:00:54.390> not<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.620> religious<00:00:56.610> faith<00:00:56.820> which

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
basis not just of religious faith which

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.209 
basis not just of religious faith which
is<00:00:57.300> something<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.020> find<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.680> every

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
is something that you find in every

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.240 
is something that you find in every
culture<00:00:59.579> across<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> world<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.620> also<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
culture across the world but is also the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.450 
culture across the world but is also the
basis<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.699> scientific<00:01:03.210> thought<00:01:03.719> hmm<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.979> for

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
basis of scientific thought hmm so for

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.530 
basis of scientific thought hmm so for
example<00:01:06.150> when<00:01:07.020> Jon<00:01:07.590> Brockman<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.640> edged<00:01:08.880> org

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
example when Jon Brockman at edged org

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.000 
example when Jon Brockman at edged org
which<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.990> something<00:01:10.170> I'm<00:01:10.409> sure<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> number<00:01:10.710> of

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
which is something I'm sure a number of

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.789 
which is something I'm sure a number of
your<00:01:11.250> listeners<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> web<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
terrific resource posed a question to a

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.859 
terrific resource posed a question to a
lot<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.340> prominent<00:01:17.759> scientists<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.540> he<00:01:18.630> said

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
lot of prominent scientists and he said

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.499 
lot of prominent scientists and he said
what<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.770> believe<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.180> cannot

I'm<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.299> hard-headed<00:01:24.900> rational<00:01:25.560> atheist<00:01:25.979> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I'm a hard-headed rational atheist and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.010 
I'm a hard-headed rational atheist and
there's<00:01:26.250> nothing<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.909> believe<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.750> cannot

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
there's nothing I believe that I cannot

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
prove everybody had something right

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.870 
prove everybody had something right
right<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> us<00:01:32.159> believe<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.640> science

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
right so some of us believe in science

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.450 
right so some of us believe in science
and<00:01:33.390> some<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.780> us<00:01:33.900> believe<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.650> religion<00:01:35.220> some

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and some of us believe in religion some

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.340 
and some of us believe in religion some
in<00:01:35.610> both<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.329> not<00:01:36.509> always<00:01:36.750> based<00:01:37.140> on

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
in both but it's not always based on

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
in both but it's not always based on
evidence<00:01:37.799> yourself<00:01:37.920> well<00:01:38.729> what<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.180> saying

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
evidence yourself well what I'm saying

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.710 
evidence yourself well what I'm saying
is<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.439> first<00:01:40.829> act<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.700> files<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
is that the first act of files and the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.530 
is that the first act of files and the
first<00:01:43.049> act<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.799> religion<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.549> same<00:01:44.909> Act

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
first act of religion are the same Act

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.719 
first act of religion are the same Act
in<00:01:45.720> both<00:01:46.290> cases<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.920> are<00:01:47.070> making<00:01:47.520> a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
in both cases you are making a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.359 
in both cases you are making a
hypothesis<00:01:48.630> he<00:01:48.930> was<00:01:49.079> saying<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:50.220> an

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
hypothesis he was saying I have an

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.940 
hypothesis he was saying I have an
incomplete<00:01:50.970> set<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.360> information<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.380> based

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
incomplete set of information and based

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.560 
incomplete set of information and based
on<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.640> complete<00:01:54.030> set<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.390> information

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
on that and complete set of information

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.310 
on that and complete set of information
I<00:01:55.409> believe<00:01:55.799> X<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.640> true<00:01:56.909> now<00:01:57.659> if<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.079> is

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
I believe X to be true now if this is

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.399 
I believe X to be true now if this is
the<00:01:58.590> scientific<00:01:59.250> faith<00:01:59.490> you<00:02:00.479> are<00:02:00.509> then<00:02:01.049> saying

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the scientific faith you are then saying

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.789 
the scientific faith you are then saying
all<00:02:01.740> right<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.850> could<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.409> falsified<00:02:04.409> by

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
all right and this could be falsified by

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.889 
all right and this could be falsified by
such-and-such<00:02:05.719> experiment<00:02:06.719> or

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
such-and-such experiment or

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.469 
such-and-such experiment or
such-and-such<00:02:07.399> observation<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.300> is

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
you're saying you know it all comes from

you're saying you know it all comes from

about what we experience but the

about what we experience but the

but<00:03:18.359> wouldn't<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.690> say<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.200> scientist

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
but wouldn't you say that the scientist

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.220 
but wouldn't you say that the scientist
who<00:03:20.100> does<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:21.000> second<00:03:21.450> step<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.660> mentioned

who does that second step you mentioned

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.310 
who does that second step you mentioned
where<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.560> falsify<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.910> initial

where you falsify that that initial

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
things on the whole that are true as

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
opposed to being mostly just based on

opposed to being mostly just based on
faith<00:03:32.150> well<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.660> know<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:34.019> would<00:03:34.290> say<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.920> I

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
faith well you know I would say that I

faith well you know I would say that I

agree with that because obviously I'm

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.860 
agree with that because obviously I'm

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
spending my life being a scientist but

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.699 
spending my life being a scientist but
that<00:03:40.970> doesn't<00:03:41.970> invalidate<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.930> notion<00:03:43.350> about

right<00:03:46.709> what<00:03:47.459> you're<00:03:47.609> teaching<00:03:47.760> about<00:03:48.150> the

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
right what you're teaching about the

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.990 
right what you're teaching about the
brain<00:03:48.480> isn't<00:03:48.750> just<00:03:49.200> stories<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:50.430> your<00:03:50.609> brain

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
brain isn't just stories that your brain

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.090 
brain isn't just stories that your brain
evolved<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.930> tell<00:03:52.109> you<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.410> believe<00:03:52.560> they're

evolved to tell you to believe they're
the<00:03:53.220> best<00:03:53.400> idea<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:53.790> how<00:03:53.970> we<00:03:54.170> think<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.380> brain

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
the best idea of how we think the brain

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.410 
the best idea of how we think the brain
works<00:03:55.799> based<00:03:56.130> on<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.370> evidence<00:03:56.910> that<00:03:57.000> seems

works based on the evidence that seems

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.530 
works based on the evidence that seems
to<00:03:57.660> be<00:03:57.980> maybe<00:03:58.980> I'm<00:03:59.370> revealing<00:03:59.730> my<00:03:59.940> bias<00:04:00.269> here

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
to be maybe I'm revealing my bias here

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
but different than the way people try to

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.309 
but different than the way people try to

at it from a religious point of view uh

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.330 
at it from a religious point of view uh
yeah<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:06.989> lot<00:04:07.319> of<00:04:07.350> times<00:04:07.650> those<00:04:07.890> things<00:04:08.160> are

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
yeah a lot of times those things are

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.300 
yeah a lot of times those things are
different<00:04:08.579> but<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.150> think<00:04:09.739> there's<00:04:10.739> been<00:04:10.829> a<00:04:11.040> lot

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
different but I think there's been a lot

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.340 
different but I think there's been a lot
of<00:04:11.340> arrogance<00:04:11.940> on<00:04:12.150> both<00:04:12.420> sides<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:13.200> know

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
of arrogance on both sides you know

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.110 
of arrogance on both sides you know
science<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:13.980> religion<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.519> been<00:04:14.730> at<00:04:14.850> war

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
science and religion have been at war

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.840 
science and religion have been at war
for<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:16.109> long<00:04:16.380> time<00:04:16.739> particularly<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.760> the

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
for a long time particularly in the

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.460 
for a long time particularly in the
United<00:04:18.209> States<00:04:18.510> more<00:04:18.780> than<00:04:19.079> other<00:04:19.229> countries

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
United States more than other countries

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.319 
United States more than other countries
and<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.519> think<00:04:20.700> there's<00:04:20.880> been<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.090> lot<00:04:21.299> of

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
and I think there's been a lot of

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.120 
and I think there's been a lot of
arrogance<00:04:21.870> on<00:04:22.049> both<00:04:22.260> sides<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.800> think<00:04:22.830> there

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
arrogance on both sides I think there

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.220 
arrogance on both sides I think there
are<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.280> lot<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.580> people<00:04:23.849> of<00:04:24.120> faith

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
are a lot of people of faith

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.610 
are a lot of people of faith
say<00:04:25.440> well<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:26.280> know<00:04:26.480> without<00:04:27.480> these<00:04:28.050> moral

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
say well you know without these moral

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.460 
say well you know without these moral
rules<00:04:29.040> from<00:04:29.460> God<00:04:29.700> or<00:04:30.150> or<00:04:30.390> or<00:04:30.600> whatever<00:04:30.840> you

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
rules from God or or or whatever you

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.950 
rules from God or or or whatever you
can't<00:04:31.800> live<00:04:32.070> a<00:04:32.100> moral<00:04:32.460> life<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.660> think<00:04:33.720> that

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
can't live a moral life and I think that

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.590 
can't live a moral life and I think that
nonsense<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.340> there<00:04:36.210> are<00:04:36.360> a<00:04:36.390> lot<00:04:36.450> of

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
nonsense and there are a lot of

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.840 
nonsense and there are a lot of
scientists<00:04:37.410> who<00:04:37.590> say<00:04:37.860> well<00:04:38.220> if<00:04:38.490> I<00:04:38.640> can

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
scientists who say well if I can

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.800 
scientists who say well if I can
disprove<00:04:39.470> some<00:04:40.470> particular<00:04:40.890> fact<00:04:41.550> in<00:04:42.300> your

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
disprove some particular fact in your

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.780 
disprove some particular fact in your
religious<00:04:43.380> texts<00:04:43.830> say<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.310> Genesis<00:04:44.760> creation

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
religious texts say the Genesis creation

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.660 
religious texts say the Genesis creation
story<00:04:45.630> from<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.530> judeo-christian<00:04:47.460> tradition

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
story from the judeo-christian tradition

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.210 
story from the judeo-christian tradition
I<00:04:48.300> can<00:04:48.600> prove<00:04:48.840> that<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.830> know<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:50.070> earth

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
I can prove that the you know the earth

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.020 
I can prove that the you know the earth
isn't<00:04:50.610> really<00:04:50.850> 6,000<00:04:51.510> years<00:04:51.720> old<00:04:51.920> them

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
isn't really 6,000 years old them

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.370 
isn't really 6,000 years old them
therefore<00:04:54.030> I<00:04:54.060> am<00:04:54.420> going<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.690> throw<00:04:54.870> out<00:04:55.140> all

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
therefore I am going to throw out all

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.200 
therefore I am going to throw out all
aspects<00:04:55.980> of<00:04:56.040> your<00:04:56.100> faith<00:04:56.490> including<00:04:56.970> those

aspects of your faith including those
things<00:04:57.570> that<00:04:58.350> I<00:04:58.380> don't<00:04:58.710> have<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.070> ability<00:04:59.160> to

we<00:06:05.040> like<00:06:05.280> to<00:06:05.460> think<00:06:05.820> we<00:06:06.090> are<00:06:06.120> but<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.920> brain<00:06:08.160> is

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
we like to think we are but the brain is

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.060 
we like to think we are but the brain is
wired<00:06:08.580> such<00:06:09.210> that<00:06:09.480> sensation<00:06:10.350> and<00:06:10.470> emotion

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
wired such that sensation and emotion

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.430 
wired such that sensation and emotion
are<00:06:11.400> intertwined<00:06:12.270> at<00:06:12.660> the<00:06:12.750> very<00:06:12.900> earliest

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
are intertwined at the very earliest

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.070 
are intertwined at the very earliest
steps<00:06:14.070> of<00:06:14.930> perception<00:06:15.930> and<00:06:17.330> we're<00:06:18.330> incredibly

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
steps of perception and we're incredibly

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.230 
steps of perception and we're incredibly
bad<00:06:19.410> at<00:06:19.890> a<00:06:19.920> lot<00:06:20.160> of<00:06:20.190> things<00:06:20.550> our<00:06:20.760> brains<00:06:21.060> are

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
bad at a lot of things our brains are

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.060 
bad at a lot of things our brains are
really<00:06:21.390> awful<00:06:21.990> at<00:06:22.110> things<00:06:22.350> like<00:06:22.500> being<00:06:22.950> an

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
really awful at things like being an

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.750 
really awful at things like being an
eyewitness<00:06:23.250> for<00:06:23.970> example<00:06:24.570> and<00:06:25.760> picking

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
eyewitness for example and picking

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.610 
eyewitness for example and picking
things<00:06:27.000> out<00:06:27.330> of<00:06:27.390> our<00:06:27.630> distant<00:06:28.080> memory<00:06:28.470> and

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
things out of our distant memory and

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.680 
things out of our distant memory and
recalling<00:06:28.980> them<00:06:29.280> accurately<00:06:29.880> we're<00:06:30.540> really

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
recalling them accurately we're really

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.320 
recalling them accurately we're really
lousy<00:06:31.020> of<00:06:31.410> those<00:06:31.560> things<00:06:31.890> so<00:06:32.220> even<00:06:33.090> when<00:06:33.210> we

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
lousy of those things so even when we

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.300 
lousy of those things so even when we
try<00:06:33.600> to<00:06:33.690> be<00:06:34.260> as

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
try to be as

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.420 
try to be as
rational<00:06:36.020> scientific<00:06:37.020> is<00:06:37.260> possible<00:06:37.950> a<00:06:37.980> lot<00:06:38.310> of

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
rational scientific is possible a lot of

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.300 
rational scientific is possible a lot of
times<00:06:38.640> we're<00:06:39.180> rather<00:06:39.330> bad<00:06:39.690> at<00:06:39.930> it<00:06:40.080> hmm<00:06:40.440> thank

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
times we're rather bad at it hmm thank

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.050 
times we're rather bad at it hmm thank
you<00:06:41.460> very<00:06:41.700> much<00:06:41.970> for<00:06:42.210> joining<00:06:42.600> me<00:06:42.690> on<00:06:42.720> point
