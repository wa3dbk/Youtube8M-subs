how<00:01:09.820> that<00:01:10.060> turns<00:01:10.090> out<00:01:10.540> but<00:01:10.780> I<00:01:10.840> know<00:01:10.899> it<00:01:11.170> should

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
how that turns out but I know it should

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.200 
how that turns out but I know it should
be<00:01:11.500> good<00:01:11.710> because<00:01:11.890> garlic<00:01:12.490> is<00:01:12.640> just<00:01:12.910> a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
be good because garlic is just a

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.050 
be good because garlic is just a
strengthener<00:01:13.810> period<00:01:14.290> so<00:01:14.590> I<00:01:14.890> know<00:01:15.520> that<00:01:15.850> that

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
strengthener period so I know that that

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.590 
strengthener period so I know that that
should<00:01:16.210> be<00:01:16.360> ok

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600
