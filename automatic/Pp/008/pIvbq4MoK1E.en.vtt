00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.599
 a little when we talk about the color of fashion 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.130
 textures of new coatings 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.500
 we are talking above all else of the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.720
 materialize our desires for the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.369
 industry is the behavior that stimulates 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.580
 the search for trends and 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.109
 releases are a reflection of this complex 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.000
 system 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.060
 I invited the product designer and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.279
 researcher ruth finger food to speak 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.100
 about the news launched at the fairs 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.980
 national and international organizations and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.440
 be seen in the interiors of the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.480
 decoration shows 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.090
 with so many coating options in the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 market the weak francine architect gives 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.070
 tips for not making mistakes in composition 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.190
 It also shows the homage that made the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.260
 and I still took 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.780
 making a gallery the space will have the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.210
 My name newspapers Leaving Leyria will be 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.309
 basically my work and the refrigerator 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.390
 that people before the age of 30 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.430
 gasoline 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.500
 we have shown more guests 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.210
 Now that Julio Fante more room 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.860
 our work 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.990
 The history of this project is very 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.689
 interestingly, the owner promoted a 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.150
 change in her life and not the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.060
 to lose after separation 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.189
 pillars of the structure and few walls and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.110
 this project won honorable mention in the 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.860
 architecture 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.980
 now check the program 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.980
 i 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.259
 The big dream was to have a closet where 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.600
 It was impossible but we managed to 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:55.590
 create a role for architecture 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.130
 to respond to this dream of a 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.679
 customer and neither do you see that I think 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.189
 that it will almost enter as a 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.890
 valuation of self - esteem 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.259
 actually when it took the environment to change 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.090
 brings a new composition brings new airs 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.970
 and I think it reflects the moment of 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.950
 person's life because they are other tastes 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.100
 the architecture itself lives another 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.440
 moment to update itself I think it is 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.530
 super important to enter the house and 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.519
 have an environment where everything feels good 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.120
 in that moment in which it is 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.120
 living right? 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.849
 a good game in the office wanting to do 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.200
 a small change in the apartment a 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.069
 change because I really wanted to take 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.840
 face of the old apartment and gave us 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.349
 freedom to do what I wanted 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.930
 we wanted her to open a wall of the 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.780
 kitchen to the living room and we started 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.340
 work and saw that he had several 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.180
 one of them was really 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.180
 opens the whole apartment 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.709
 we suggested the opening of all 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.360
 walls the only one we managed to 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.940
 that we left could not get 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.250
 the structure of the same apartment building 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.700
 were two major pillars and the rest 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.480
 We opened all within the possible 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.220
 left over from the bathroom wall only the 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.780
 social bathroom leftover wall 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.780
 rest and the two great pillars 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.360
 the pillars made us take away 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.650
 this party and assumed this structure 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.900
 in the proposal 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.170
 and then we use the apparent concrete to 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.450
 really highlight them since it would be there 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.940
 and the rest of the proposal brought 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.760
 almost pro-scenographic elements 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.040
 velvet curtain patch a large 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.070
 shelf that gathers objects in one 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.650
 wall in one place really to give 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.560
 this one lot face a whole environment 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.540
 integrated insert and incorporate the 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.990
 Elements I already had in the apartment 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.990
 huh 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.680
 we used materials as well 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.430
 monochrome we used a lot of gray 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.900
 and I gave a more cheerful touch to the 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.510
 environment we picked up some 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.820
 color strokes for example 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.100
 an agent appliances pads 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.300
 detail on the floor in the hydraulic tile 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.270
 below the guilt of the light kitchen 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.940
 is the red curtain that is a tyrant 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:55.130
 apartment also the rest of us 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.130
 tried to make him well and sober 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.530
 the living space would be integrated into the 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.530
 TV room with kitchen and laundry area 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.930
 actually stayed in a closet next to the 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.789
 kitchen and a big dream of her was a 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.550
 closet the people we did was to create 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.319
 a closet at the entrance of the bedroom which is a 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.360
 that the most enclosed part of the 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.069
 apartment even enters the room 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.530
 which is also covered with a 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.870
 glass bathroom to give more 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.220
 more comfort and up to this 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.220
 amplitude of space 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.750
 the carpentry was actually ours. 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.240
 great ally in this apartment 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.960
 because we created her closet in the 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.750
 entrance from her room that he shares the 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.970
 bedroom with the guest bedroom is a 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.970
 scene she allows she gives this freedom 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.669
 for us she allows many is very 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.289
 many designs many uses and I think 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.819
 That's where she comes. 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.830
 apartment to contribute 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.569
 one of the walls that she wall larger than 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.130
 it was a less privileged wall 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.960
 say so because it was one more wall 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.030
 difficult to work because she soon 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.039
 you walk into the apartment she shows 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.610
 a very long perspective she won 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:12.340
 several niches and served to achieve 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.650
 Saving Multiple Object Objects 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.800
 that the owner had then fills a 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.800
 need 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.820
 such 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.000
 this project he won honorable mention 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.430
 in Santa Catarina architecture prize to 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.330
 second edition of the award was that this 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:55.490
 participation and will win this award 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.680
 It was a surprise to us because 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.000
 We have included some work in some 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.440
 categories 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.110
 easy office design 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.270
 architecture and makes previous projects 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.150
 people had an expectation for 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.130
 some work and when we won 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.990
 the mention of interiors was for us 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.790
 super cool it was amazing of course 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.800
 is a project that we already bet 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:19.790
 because it is a project different from the ones 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.600
 conventional projects and it was important to 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.010
 because I think the prize of 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.500
 Santa Catarina architecture reflects the 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:29.120
 architecture is living right 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:30.800
 this year and with a stop for the 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.270
 other architecture offices and I 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.010
 I think for us is a great honor 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.760
 earn honorable mention in this category 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.760
 interior 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.750
 well the project was really 

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:53.430
 very nice 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:55.889
 thank you thank you thank you and today 

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:59.760
 hexagonal also a very strong element 

00:07:55.889 --> 00:08:02.610
 and that it was well focused in terms of 

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.060
 launches at both national fairs 

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.060
 how many international
