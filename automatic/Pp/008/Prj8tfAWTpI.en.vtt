00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
where you tobacco and a South African

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.739 
where you tobacco and a South African
technical<00:00:34.110> things<00:00:34.410> when<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.749> inside

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:36.749 
technical things when you are inside

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:40.700 
technical things when you are inside
it's<00:00:37.379> more<00:00:38.089> for<00:00:39.089> the<00:00:39.329> physical<00:00:39.839> aspects<00:00:40.379> we

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
it's more for the physical aspects we

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.770 
it's more for the physical aspects we
can<00:00:40.920> work<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:41.760> bit<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.239> technical

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
can work a little bit with technical

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.959 
can work a little bit with technical
aspect<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.769> the<00:00:43.979> real<00:00:44.159> thing<00:00:44.429> is<00:00:44.609> when<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.879> go

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
aspect but the real thing is when you go

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.660 
aspect but the real thing is when you go
outside<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.589> even<00:00:46.589> you<00:00:46.710> cannot<00:00:46.949> we<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.429> some

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
outside and even you cannot we have some

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.689 
outside and even you cannot we have some
good<00:00:48.059> students<00:00:48.690> inside<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:50.010> when<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.429> on<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
good students inside but when you on the

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.759 
good students inside but when you on the
concrete<00:00:51.030> click<00:00:51.479> psychologically<00:00:52.379> it's

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
concrete click psychologically it's

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.430 
concrete click psychologically it's
completely<00:00:53.249> different<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.569> two

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
completely different so it's two

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.369 
completely different so it's two
different<00:00:55.679> approach<00:00:56.299> but<00:00:57.299> as<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.600> think<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
different approach but as I think it

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.379 
different approach but as I think it
will<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> good<00:00:59.039> good<00:00:59.219> compliments<00:00:59.850> we're

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:00.389 
will be a good good compliments we're

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:03.049 
will be a good good compliments we're
going<00:01:00.569> to<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:00.839> a<00:01:01.440> low-level<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.549> the<00:01:02.760> rom

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
going to do just a low-level in the rom

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.390 
going to do just a low-level in the rom
and<00:01:03.389> but<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.860> could<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.220> different

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and but but it could be different

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.109 
and but but it could be different
because<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.090> outside<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.530> have

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
because it's outside and so it just have

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.130 
because it's outside and so it just have
concrete<00:01:09.530> everything<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.860> death<00:01:11.579> I<00:01:12.140> think

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
concrete everything so death I think

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.230 
concrete everything so death I think
