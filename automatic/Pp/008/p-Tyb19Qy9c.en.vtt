00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.299
 Hi everyone , how are you? I 'm here. 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.400
 make another neighbor for you know 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.859
 that a law that is half-deceased but is 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.320
 Fair reason and I'll comment more 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.789
 about this reason in another video but 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.070
 I came here today to show you 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.840
 as if storing my papers 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.760
 because before he was 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.470
 filming the shelves are getting 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.420
 kinda complicated 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.329
 What role do I have which is why I 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.670
 I have, I 've been going down the street and 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.920
 end up buying more than it should and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.660
 when she already had this thing already had 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.680
 this role and everything else ends 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.090
 complicating 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.070
 I thought if I stayed like this 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.590
 visually, it would look better for me 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.750
 organize and then when I made the video of 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.270
 mtur here by the atelier some people me 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.059
 asked him how he hung up 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.190
 that's not the colored papers 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.350
 so I'll show you 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.680
 It was very easy to wear dog leash 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.170
 and clips was very easy I'll show you 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.580
 how simple are you to organize 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.710
 In your house too. 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.110

 so comes the photo paper 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.949
 so they still get it bag is not 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.280
 indicated you leave your paper out of the 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:50.229
 because the humidity and the time of the 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.510
 environment can hurt so much in the 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.520
 the cut at the time of printing 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.770
 then you always gets stored only 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.960
 taken away when you're done 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.520

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.070
