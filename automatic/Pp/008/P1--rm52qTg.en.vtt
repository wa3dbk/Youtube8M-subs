00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.440
 vehicle that is a great vehicle what 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.030
 first we're going to put a shield 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.159
 which is the best one hundred percent 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.750
 a hundred this we do not think the brakes will 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.860
 we put the racing brakes too 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.929
 the bodywork of the body is this one 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.700
 fender with stickers what 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.799
 we are creating is called mobile farc 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.509
 vargas mobile if you want your fargas 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.789
 mobile because I have in my mobile fargas 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.530
 I'm going to create my farga a mobile for 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.600
 you are worth to those who want to have 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.860
 this vehicle that can have it as 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.780
 the mobile farkas not 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.149
 well fender with stickers and 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.250
 it is bumper eye eye bumpers 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.010
 very important you have to put the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.650
 bumper sticker I think so 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.840
 cardinale bumper sticker 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.360
 front with stickers there we have what 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.489
 preciousness what preciousness is that is 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.010
 one thing is an amazing thing well the 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.049
 motor upgrade to level 4 if you have it 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.849
 for those who have it the escape is very 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.129
 important to put this that it seems that 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.430
 has a water I do not know what a sting is 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.810
 a bee sting or not but if 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.760
 you have to put this bee stinger 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.409
 because bees are scary to me already 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.420
 me when I'm scared something is that it's that 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.890
 well no so let's see there's that 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.959
 put this this bee sting 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.459
 besides this imposes this imposes if to you 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.079
 they see you with this car with him with this 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.940
 Exhaust pipe up say care 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.799
 that he knows that he understands 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.870
 of cars well let's put the 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.519
 escape pulled out is not deplete it is called 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.470
 they are worth explosives we do not put 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.239
 explosives the calender we have to 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.920
 put him here because because we 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.480
 let's crash into each other we're not going 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.920
 to run over people and how are we going to 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.290
 run over people we need to protect 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.090
 our front of the vehicle what 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.430
 He ran over people I do not know if it's run over 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.750
 people of you do not talk about the game 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.489
 from real life in real life I'll have 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.829
 hit two as much good we're going 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.150
 to put a horn and the case I do not know 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.150
 let's put him for example 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.069
 the cockroach the cockroach can no longer 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.110
 walk because in addition this car seems 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.819
 a cockroach looks like a cockroach to me 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.410
 I leave the saints why 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.830

 want but we put him again in the 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.550
 jumps no problem is worth as 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.840

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.140
 let's put a license plate that is going to be 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.939

 let's see the important wheels some 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.330
 sports wheels is worth it because we are 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.070
 very vain then you have to put 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.930
 some wheels of sports car and I wheels 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.400

 let's put a rose that goes play with 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.409
 our car color with fargas 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.419
 mobile and then then we're going 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.629
 in some accessories for the wheels that 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.279
 we're going to put some tires 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.959
 Personalized bulletproof so that 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:13.879
 bastards do not break the wheels we do not 

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:16.580

 I play with the car with the color of the 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.729
 Well, let's see what else 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:24.860
 we have windows black pure black 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:27.559
 pure because because this car is a magnet 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.969
 for the girls it 's a magnet, it's the same as 

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:30.499

 I think about all this I think about everything 

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:44.269
 the car the mobile fraga thinks about everything 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:46.069
