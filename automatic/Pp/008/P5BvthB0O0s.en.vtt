00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.420 

the<00:00:04.810> next<00:00:05.170> lick<00:00:05.440> that<00:00:05.680> we're<00:00:05.830> gonna<00:00:05.950> look<00:00:06.220> at

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.430 
the next lick that we're gonna look at

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.670 
the next lick that we're gonna look at
is<00:00:06.640> one<00:00:06.880> that<00:00:07.060> I<00:00:07.180> call<00:00:07.479> the<00:00:07.810> shortened<00:00:08.469> vamp

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.680 
is one that I call the shortened vamp

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.549 
is one that I call the shortened vamp
diddly<00:00:09.070> since<00:00:09.850> there's<00:00:10.090> no<00:00:10.330> names<00:00:10.930> for<00:00:11.350> any<00:00:11.500> of

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:11.559 
diddly since there's no names for any of

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.230 
diddly since there's no names for any of
these<00:00:11.619> licks<00:00:11.949> I<00:00:12.160> just<00:00:12.369> made<00:00:12.549> something<00:00:12.789> up<00:00:13.059> so

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
these licks I just made something up so

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.930 
these licks I just made something up so
that<00:00:13.360> I<00:00:13.389> can<00:00:13.600> talk<00:00:13.750> about<00:00:13.809> it<00:00:14.170> and<00:00:14.379> I<00:00:15.340> call<00:00:15.850> it

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
that I can talk about it and I call it

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.730 
that I can talk about it and I call it
the<00:00:15.969> short<00:00:16.270> bandit<00:00:16.660> Lee<00:00:16.750> and<00:00:16.930> this<00:00:17.170> is<00:00:17.440> what

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
the short bandit Lee and this is what

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:30.340 
the short bandit Lee and this is what
it's<00:00:17.949> gonna<00:00:18.039> sound<00:00:18.310> like

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.800 

all<00:00:31.350> right<00:00:31.740> once<00:00:32.190> again<00:00:32.400> this<00:00:33.060> lick<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.450> based

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
all right once again this lick is based

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.470 
all right once again this lick is based
on<00:00:34.140> moving<00:00:34.530> between<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.190> F<00:00:35.400> and<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:36.270> D

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
on moving between the F and the D

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.170 
on moving between the F and the D
positions<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.950> are<00:00:38.070> once<00:00:38.370> again<00:00:38.520> learning<00:00:38.970> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
positions we are once again learning it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.830 
positions we are once again learning it
in<00:00:39.360> G<00:00:39.990> so<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.100> pattern<00:00:41.400> starts<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.330> our<00:00:42.570> F

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
in G so this pattern starts in our F

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.520 
in G so this pattern starts in our F
position<00:00:43.620> G<00:00:44.070> chord<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:45.450> we're<00:00:45.960> gonna<00:00:46.140> do

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
position G chord here we're gonna do

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.049 
position G chord here we're gonna do
this<00:00:49.040> we're<00:00:50.040> actually<00:00:50.190> starting<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:51.030> a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
this we're actually starting with a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.850 
this we're actually starting with a
fourth<00:00:51.450> string<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.880> one<00:00:54.270> event<00:00:54.860> which

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
fourth string and then one event which

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.610 
fourth string and then one event which
is<00:00:56.040> pinching<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.730> two<00:00:56.970> and<00:00:57.120> three<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:58.410> that's

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
is pinching one two and three so that's

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.530 
is pinching one two and three so that's
all<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.040> have<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.280> our<00:00:59.580> F<00:00:59.730> position<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> fourth

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
all we have in our F position the fourth

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.700 
all we have in our F position the fourth
string<00:01:00.780> plus<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> van

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.930 

then<00:01:04.549> we<00:01:04.940> move<00:01:05.239> up<00:01:05.510> to<00:01:05.630> our<00:01:06.200> D<00:01:06.920> position<00:01:07.549> G

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
then we move up to our D position G

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:16.590 
then we move up to our D position G
chord<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:08.950> we're<00:01:09.950> gonna<00:01:10.220> play<00:01:11.080> three<00:01:12.080> for<00:01:12.770> one

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.670 

so<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.930> third<00:01:18.440> and<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.890> fourth<00:01:19.869> come<00:01:20.869> when

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
so the third and the fourth come when

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.180 
so the third and the fourth come when
you're<00:01:21.830> solidly<00:01:22.550> in<00:01:22.729> your<00:01:23.149> chord<00:01:23.450> position

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
you're solidly in your chord position

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.810 
you're solidly in your chord position
but<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.430> first<00:01:26.000> string<00:01:26.630> comes<00:01:27.250> while<00:01:28.250> you're

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
but the first string comes while you're

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.130 
but the first string comes while you're
moving<00:01:29.570> your<00:01:29.840> left<00:01:30.229> hand<00:01:30.850> backwards<00:01:32.140> toward

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
moving your left hand backwards toward

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.590 
moving your left hand backwards toward
your<00:01:33.500> F<00:01:33.680> position<00:01:34.399> so<00:01:35.330> it's<00:01:35.750> gonna<00:01:36.170> come<00:01:37.600> it's

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
your F position so it's gonna come it's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.600 
your F position so it's gonna come it's
gonna<00:01:38.690> come<00:01:38.960> out<00:01:39.050> more<00:01:39.320> of<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.590> click<00:01:40.009> probably

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
gonna come out more of a click probably

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.889 
gonna come out more of a click probably
because<00:01:40.940> you're<00:01:41.119> moving<00:01:41.270> from<00:01:41.780> here

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
because you're moving from here

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.440 
because you're moving from here
backwards<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:45.140> your<00:01:45.289> F<00:01:45.440> position<00:01:46.300> when<00:01:47.300> you

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
backwards to your F position when you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.120 
backwards to your F position when you
get<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.780> your<00:01:47.840> f<00:01:48.020> position<00:01:48.500> you're<00:01:48.710> gonna<00:01:48.800> play

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
get to your f position you're gonna play

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.969 
get to your f position you're gonna play
the<00:01:49.280> fourth<00:01:49.580> string<00:01:49.970> again<00:01:50.300> so<00:01:51.259> it's<00:01:51.649> still

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
the fourth string again so it's still

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.370 
the fourth string again so it's still
three<00:01:52.369> notes<00:01:52.670> but<00:01:53.000> it's<00:01:54.610> click<00:01:56.050> fourth<00:01:57.050> when

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
three notes but it's click fourth when

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.919 
three notes but it's click fourth when
you<00:01:57.530> land<00:01:57.800> back<00:01:58.159> in<00:01:58.190> your<00:01:58.490> F<00:01:58.670> position<00:01:59.210> and

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
you land back in your F position and

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:08.830 
you land back in your F position and
that's<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.619> whole<00:02:00.850> cycle<00:02:01.850> of<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.179> lick

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.199 

and<00:02:08.959> this<00:02:09.590> lick<00:02:09.890> is<00:02:10.069> such<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.700> can<00:02:10.910> do<00:02:11.060> it

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
and this lick is such that you can do it

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.449 
and this lick is such that you can do it
over<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.750> over<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.140> over<00:02:12.290> again<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:12.800> the

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
over and over and over again so the

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.840 
over and over and over again so the
fourth<00:02:13.819> string<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.270> we<00:02:14.390> ended<00:02:14.990> on<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.860> really

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
fourth string that we ended on is really

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.780 
fourth string that we ended on is really
the<00:02:17.090> first<00:02:17.420> note<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.080> next<00:02:18.680> cycle<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.610> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
the first note of the next cycle of the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.910 
the first note of the next cycle of the
lick<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.750> can<00:02:21.050> just<00:02:21.260> string<00:02:21.890> them

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
lick so you can just string them

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:34.240 
lick so you can just string them
together<00:02:22.250> over<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.120> over

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.500 

now<00:02:34.820> timing-wise<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:37.490> fourth<00:02:38.000> string<00:02:38.360> that

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
now timing-wise the fourth string that

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.980 
now timing-wise the fourth string that
we<00:02:38.630> start<00:02:39.050> with<00:02:39.290> comes<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:41.450> first<00:02:41.690> beat<00:02:41.960> of

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
we start with comes on the first beat of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:03:00.120 
we start with comes on the first beat of
a<00:02:42.230> measure<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:58.670> will<00:02:59.390> take<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.810> while

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
a measure so it this will take a while

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.150 
a measure so it this will take a while
to<00:03:01.130> get<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.490> timing<00:03:01.820> down<00:03:02.270> so<00:03:02.990> be<00:03:03.290> patient<00:03:03.680> as

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
to get the timing down so be patient as

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.030 
to get the timing down so be patient as
you're<00:03:04.640> practicing<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.540> you'll<00:03:06.110> have<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.620> you

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
you're practicing it you'll have to you

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:19.030 
you're practicing it you'll have to you
know<00:03:07.190> start<00:03:07.730> out<00:03:07.850> really<00:03:08.209> really<00:03:08.360> slow

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.789 

but<00:03:19.879> make<00:03:20.180> sure<00:03:20.209> you<00:03:20.569> get<00:03:20.840> all<00:03:21.110> of<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.560> notes

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
but make sure you get all of the notes
