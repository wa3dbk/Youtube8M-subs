usually I bring etrac there's a lot of

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.950 
usually I bring etrac there's a lot of

good stuff in here

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.330 
good stuff in here
but<00:00:15.960> today<00:00:16.200> I<00:00:16.230> tried<00:00:16.530> to<00:00:16.650> decide<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.190> do

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
but today I tried to decide to do

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.970 
but today I tried to decide to do
something<00:00:17.550> different<00:00:17.670> I'm<00:00:18.150> hunting<00:00:18.860> with<00:00:19.860> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
something different I'm hunting with the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.300 
something different I'm hunting with the
Tesoro<00:00:20.369> compadre

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
Tesoro compadre

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.800 
Tesoro compadre
an<00:00:23.310> idea<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> little<00:00:24.150> bit<00:00:24.330> more<00:00:24.540> brute

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
an idea is it's a little bit more brute

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.960 
an idea is it's a little bit more brute
force<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:25.230> I'm<00:00:25.590> gonna<00:00:25.770> dig<00:00:26.520> just<00:00:26.670> about

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
force but I'm gonna dig just about

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.420 
force but I'm gonna dig just about
everything<00:00:27.360> that's<00:00:27.540> not<00:00:27.810> iron<00:00:28.620> although

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
everything that's not iron although

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.760 
everything that's not iron although
that's<00:00:29.610> as<00:00:29.820> Laura<00:00:30.030> does<00:00:30.270> like<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:31.140> iron<00:00:31.350> so

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
that's as Laura does like it's iron so

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.860 
that's as Laura does like it's iron so
she'll<00:00:32.640> be<00:00:32.669> digging<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.150> but<00:00:33.480> hopefully

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
she'll be digging a little but hopefully

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.189 
she'll be digging a little but hopefully
I'll<00:00:34.020> find<00:00:34.050> some<00:00:34.650> mid-tone<00:00:35.960> things<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.140> I

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
I'll find some mid-tone things that I

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:38.360 
I'll find some mid-tone things that I
wouldn't<00:00:37.470> have<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.890> skipped<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
wouldn't have it skipped with the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.560 
wouldn't have it skipped with the
e-track<00:00:38.699> and<00:00:39.030> hopefully<00:00:39.420> I'll<00:00:39.540> find

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
e-track and hopefully I'll find

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.340 
e-track and hopefully I'll find
something<00:00:39.960> good

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
something good

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.930

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
discrimination set just above iron which

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.039 
discrimination set just above iron which
I've<00:01:05.790> read<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> forums<00:01:07.040> enhances<00:01:08.040> the

ability to find nails and so forth all

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.090 
ability to find nails and so forth all
right<00:01:17.219> I've<00:01:17.369> seen<00:01:17.399> some<00:01:17.850> people<00:01:18.740> question<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
right I've seen some people question the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.469 
right I've seen some people question the
use<00:01:20.219> of<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> compadre<00:01:20.909> because<00:01:21.149> it<00:01:21.270> doesn't

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
use of the compadre because it doesn't

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.389 
use of the compadre because it doesn't
have<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> pin<00:01:21.869> pointer<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.039> think<00:01:23.250> that's

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
have a pin pointer but I think that's

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.100 
have a pin pointer but I think that's
just<00:01:23.460> silly<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.360> does<00:01:24.539> have<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.780> five

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
just silly because it does have a five

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.560 
just silly because it does have a five
and<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> half<00:01:25.530> inch<00:01:25.920> coil<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:27.119> five<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and a half inch coil so or five and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.450 
and a half inch coil so or five and
three-quarter<00:01:28.020> inches<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.560> even<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.430> just

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
three-quarter inches so even if you just

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.139 
three-quarter inches so even if you just
cut<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.060> area<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.750> coil<00:01:31.579> it's<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.789> small

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
cut the area of the coil it's a small

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.480 
cut the area of the coil it's a small
small<00:01:33.810> hole<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.469> it<00:01:34.710> should<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.009> easy<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.219> find

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
small hole and it should be easy to find

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.450 
small hole and it should be easy to find
but<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.240> thing<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.719> do<00:01:36.899> is<00:01:37.109> think<00:01:37.770> here's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
but one thing you can do is think here's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.249 
but one thing you can do is think here's
a<00:01:38.549> target<00:01:38.969> here<00:01:39.530> alright<00:01:41.479> just<00:01:42.479> cross<00:01:42.780> over<00:01:43.020> it

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
a target here alright just cross over it

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.249 
a target here alright just cross over it
and<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.560> find<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.979> right<00:01:48.170> where<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
and you can find it right where the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.469 
and you can find it right where the
cross<00:01:49.530> occurs<00:01:50.039> another<00:01:51.030> thing<00:01:51.210> your<00:01:51.329> knees

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
cross occurs another thing your knees

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.719 
cross occurs another thing your knees
raise<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.990> coil<00:01:52.310> now<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.429> will<00:01:53.520> give<00:01:53.640> you

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
raise the coil now that will give you

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.389 
raise the coil now that will give you
idea<00:01:53.969> about<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> depth<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.749> item<00:01:55.399> right

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
idea about the depth to the item right

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.499 
idea about the depth to the item right
