00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 playstation 2 is my console which 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.420
 I have never been but do not hurry 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.929
 turn off the channel I'm now going to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.969
 green queer years and narga prefixes 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.470
 about a few gamepads to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.119
 it was possible to conveniently and newspaper this land 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.010
 prefix 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.510
 although imagine how it was not so 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.630
 no, what's the matter now tell a 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.939
 it all started around 2004 exactly 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.960
 then I found out that in one of my 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.270
 favorite games 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.500
 back on a la diva blast n out 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.379
 sequel can can bus gates it was 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.719
 the guest is great there was dirt 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.680
 what a great gameplay well and 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.070
 opportunities 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.039
 judging by the videos and reviews but higher she 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.500
 only console playstation and I 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.960
 then from the gaming devices let's say 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.670
 there will be only a gaming computer that is not 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.230
 very powerful it was a shame neither 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.680
 which of my friends by the way the console is not 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.510
 found that honestly modestly with us 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.049
 of course there was a small town about 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.790
 60 thousand inhabitants but damn 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.560
 the store sold this console 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.479
 there to her pirate mostly of course 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.369
 subject to me 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.369
 gamepads memory cards and among 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.979
 familiar with anyone and heaven 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.369
 Well, to no and no trial passed a few 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.229
 years I moved no block combined there 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.090
 and work and study but I think so many 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.759
 did in their spoken and in some 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.079
 moment found that damn it exists 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.829
 sony playstation 2 emulator 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:45.180
 perfectly said to myself downloaded the emulator here 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.770
 started well and again my disappointment 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.770
 the computer was not powerful enough to 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.829
 this console and widow frames 25 30 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.259
 second you will tell by your friends 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.540
 about which so too him train whether tires go 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.270
 this moment I still have none of 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.340
 familiar no more awesome well and 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.649
 computers even those who were significantly 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.369
 more powerful unfortunately this prefix is ​​not 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:12.260
 pulled out of 30 frames they retired 5 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.540
 from the set 50 60 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.190
 up to 2 collision how many prefix 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.710
 More precisely with emulation I was so 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.620
 unsuccessful as 1 passed a few more 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.140
 years and about last year 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.270
 Institute I got the opportunity 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.930
 finally your old laptop rhythm 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.880
 replace with more powerful gaming 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.620
 naturally did it and tried 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.560
 some toys which are not really 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.390
 impressed again remembering which station 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.070
 2 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.820
 Naturally this downloaded emulators images 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:48.030
 and then everything worked fine accumulation 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.100
 gone floor speed unfortunately thats 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.840
 the very fight is devoid of gates me not particularly 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.770
 impressed and it is actually pretty 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.960
 disappointing Karina say when 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.330
 after about 68 years, finally 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.570
 get the opportunity to be tea to play 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.830
 that very depth is very much hope for a long time 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.080
 by the players and she turns out to be so so but 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.490
 but there were a few games that 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.050
 decimal impressed firstly soul 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.990
 calibur 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.630
 I'm cleaning the game impressed me even 1 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.410
 cavities PWM I rarely played in beat 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.040
 and here such a great opportunity mascara 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.290
 her girlfriend is close with her buddies 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.560
 amazing fighting is very common 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.420
 that weapons are usually used in it 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.310
 Fighting pass in mode will be 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:44.459
 without kovaleva cold and gunshot 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:47.940
 already here she is this very cool in 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.790
 second so 5 well, they do it not 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.790
 I think almost everyone knows 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.530
 magnificent fighting fast handsome 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.380
 wonderful the first three parts came out on 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.750
 the first playstation these 45 above 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.400
 respectively 2 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.460
 Well, about the third nothing to say still 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.830
 can and 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:11.280
 paper row 3 well i really hope that he 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.730
 so pronounce this fighting game where every 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.210
 character 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.050
 enrich I do not know yet such a neck 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.560
 which can 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:23.360
 werewolf rabbit by knocking out teeth 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.550
 werewolves u would say u bat and shoes 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.940
 it is very original very beautiful and 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.090
 very quickly of such a fighting game just 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.300
 I do not know other games in principle 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.890
 went out on 2 playstation this which 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.120
 I was interested of course they came out 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.110
 on other platforms 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.360
 for example sergiu 2 there axis sand principle 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.010
 time on other platforms they 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.680
 look prettier but at least on 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:53.880
 computers could not much better anymore 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.460
 permissions more polygons well how much I 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.830
 still playstation in such faithful topics 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.340
 emulation is certainly not complete 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.280
 Exit not skated games for example , the year 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.890
 2 emulates with some 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.520
 graphic gods in those in flying 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.500
 levels to observe some of these facts in 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.260
 ordinary it does not have to connect 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.020
 this effect which was seems 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.930
 called general blur pictures he 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.760
 daddy tory mow in the same soul 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.040
 calibur has to set permissions 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.290
 multiple original because if 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.410
 make it not multiple the pictures will go 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.040
 lanes in the general street i'm not really 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.970
 so that not an exit but not an ideal exit 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.440
 so I think sometime and 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.080
 finally fall apart to purchase 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.080
 TV to him 8 is this very 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.520
 console playstation 2 0 and the simplest 3 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.300
 if it is normal enamel you 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.240
 2 playstation but somehow listened 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.980
 my story is the history of my console 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.830
 consoles that i never had 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.620
 thank you so much for listening 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.840
 thank you but what is worth it 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.690
 I really hope an interesting program 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.800
 she will live me one issue with higher 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:10.220
