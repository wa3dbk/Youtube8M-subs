00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.050
 And then, it's okay that the speaker is the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.300
 edu wolf and today launches a new video 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.639
 talking about profession in October until 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.310
 I put a piece of cake is not 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.060
 what a joke that is a joke 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.519
 I can not think straight, it 's dumb I 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 put up a gull Luana also I 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.990
 I think nobody understands but I found 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.970
 Sorry, but then I 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.040
 I noticed a controversy created in the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.100
 Face Video comments saying that the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.950
 youtube is a hobo job said 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.450
 the club works little easy zinho 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.300
 do what you like to make money with 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.280
 This is absurd, my god, I wanted to. 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.660
 my mind that you next any 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.800
 person working in the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.230
 entertainment and also earn money 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.260
 It's fine, it 's not my affair, I win. 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.520
 well but we playing rich, I have 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.949
 that I strive to pay the bills but 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.219
 Do not even get on very well at all. 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.430
 porn film actor 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.799
 the famous hollywood movie actor o 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.080
 balloon novel actor won very well 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.150
 Why does entertainment mess with the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.490
 masses like the crowd 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.509
 if you take entertainment to these 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.270
 people 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.729
 you're just messing me for example 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.740
 almost 200 thousand subscribers 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.369
 clear does not have eight devils per video but 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 I have 40 50 times 100 thousand units of 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.200
 people who also in my videos are not 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.180
 just that I should be remunerated in a way 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.680
 proportional to the entertainment 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.380
 leads to so many people 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.020
 I think it's fair there, some argue 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.140
 hamas has so many more professions 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.630
 nobles that yours that earns little is there 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.329
 the problem is the problem people 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.460
 earning little they should earn more 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.159
 I 'm not the one who should win less 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.670
 the opportunities are open to all 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.280
 also 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.680
 anyone can be in October there 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.540
 personal argument is that neither player of 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.369
 football and a lot of people who want to 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.149
 being but few can almost 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.430
 can 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.849
 we are no more talented opportunity 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.170
 open all you need is what you get 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.940
 to strive but the effort alone 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.530
 nowhere everyone strives has 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.760
 to strive beyond that you have 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.980
 that being productive 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.720
 You have to work your skills. 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.209
 your knowledge you are good you have 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.069
 that being respectful can not be 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.630
 arrogant can not think that by the fact 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.940
 of you doing something better than the other 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.830
 You 're better than the other is different. 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.600
 one thing I, for example, probably 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.350
 I communicate better than most 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.850
 people 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.280
 I'm better than other people by 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.540
 cause of this no i am not i have 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.250
 abiliity 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.440
 perhaps better than most 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.260
 people this does not make me any person 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.660
 above or below any other 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.890
 way then you have to open a 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.410
 little head 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.819
 had a guy not all but the ones that are 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.290
 with the head closed because one day I 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.120
 I went like this, you have to open your head. 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.549
 trying to help you 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.840
 had a guy then talking ah how come 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.850
 if he said it's better you have a 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.260
 October life than here a guy who 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.989
 I studied engineering in usp and unicamp 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.950
 I was studying civil engineering in the usp 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.910
 Napoli 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.319
 I tested the course and the 600-way pole 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.959
 engineers more or less per year 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.390
 while youtube is out there live 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.530
 this in brazil 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.209
 I count on the fingers and toes 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.470
 probably have more than ten have less 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.829
 I would say 20 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.959
 is not enough and this is not for a year not already 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.150
 some time that has that restricted number 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.820
 of people is not an opportunity it is not 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.859
 a niche doing what you like 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.570
 it is much more valuable to have the 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.420
 knowledge of how to communicate with 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.709
 people and live on a social network of 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.870
 that you 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.480
 I do not know, your engineer. I do not lean. 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.109
 company big bad step of your 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.970
 engineer 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.280
 the plan is a market opportunity 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.220
 that I have for myself that the engineer 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.230
 standard does not have is not demerit of the face 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.380
 neither merit of mine and some that this 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.000
 get me the guy does what he wants 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.250
 But you have to understand these things. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.290
 the guy argued you do not have a job 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.209
 formal you do not have fgts do not have 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.750
 wallet and your future 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.190
 other super super limited thinking 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.620
 you do not need to work for 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.510
 others to have a good standard of living and 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.609
 to save money from your 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.169
 future and when working with 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.479
 what others are doing is generating a 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.000
 a lot of money for the company and earns 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.950
 a living wage for you is a guy who 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.390
 talk but the director earns 40 per month 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.690
 while not helping the company 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.130
 Do not wait one day for me to generate 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.349
 a lot of money through what I 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.050
 I like because today I came to me, it's not going to 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.580
 stand still retained much of the 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.810
 company for the job 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.430
 now you think I do not have to 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.919
 work with a clear company that I 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.169
 I also think from the experience 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.419
 financially for the fun because I do 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.610
 What I like and not what I would do 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.460
 I like what I'm saying there's a 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.130
 world of opportunities beyond 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.900
 you'd be thinking that 99.9 percent 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.260
 of the population in a large company 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.510
 work here no horse like a horse 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.229
 crazy for 20 years was winning a car 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.700
 High is what you do not even think about why 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.560
 Are not you in a company? 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.849
 going up a lot risk is a lot of 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.590
 factors you have to take into account not 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.510
 I can explain a video myself 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.430
 I have no knowledge to stay. 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.169
 explaining both in the video only but I 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.400
 I recommend reading a book that calls the father 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:29.620
 rich poor father and then select book 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.260
 here you take the books of evil with 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.870
 gladwell and give a read is a 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.390
 recommendations are easy readings and 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.280
 fun and so before was my video 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.479
 personal hope you enjoyed 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.190
 do not forget to evaluate the request 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.370
 because we're getting to know each other better now 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.060
 I already called myself the facial expression and 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.520
 everything else 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.870
 I'm getting better It 's improving you 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.180
 If you liked it, do not 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.070
 forget to send me a favorite one 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.500
 Also comment that you found what I said 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.599
 You do not agree with rope and everything. 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.599
 This is it, folks!
