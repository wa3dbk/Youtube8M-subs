00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 well found on my personal trainer tv 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.990
 in this video I will show you the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.690
 main anatomical features 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.700
 of parathyroids and their function le 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.670
 parathyroid glands are very small 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.430
 round masses located in the neck 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.800
 just behind the thyroid with more 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.980
 precision it is four small 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.789
 glands partially embedded in the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.390
 posterior face of the thyroid lobes of 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.059
 we therefore usually have 4 parathyroid glands 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.520
 higher and lower two 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.629
 hence the distinction in parathyroid 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.430
 upper and lower parathyroid 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.710
 normally the parathyroids are large 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.770
 more or less as much as a grain of rice e 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.730
 in the adult each weighs roughly 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.160
 between 20 and 50 mg we are therefore 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.620
 speaking of a very small average weight 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.489
 between one fiftieth and one 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.549
 twentieth of g anyway there is one 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.619
 certain individual variability both 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.200
 regarding the number is about the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.110
 position regarding both dimensions 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.420
 of parathyroids before switching to 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.580
 next is positive I want 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.000
 emphasize that the thyroid and le 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.000
 parathyroid glands are not connected though 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.100
 are placed in close contact do 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.369
 both part of the endocrine system e 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.439
 present very similar names the thyroid and 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.079
 parathyroids are structures 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.079
 independent and with different functions 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.280
 regarding the functions of the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.649
 parathyroid the main task of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.470
 these glands is to regulate the 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.960
 level of calcium in the blood 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.970
 in fact the parathyroids produce a 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.450
 protein hormone called hormone 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.659
 parathyroid or parathormone known 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.640
 even as bdh this hormone is a lot 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.430
 important because it participates in the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.790
 calcium metabolism together 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.250
 secret calcitonin from the thyroid and to the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.229
 therefore the vitamin D parathormone regulates 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.750
 concentrates it 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.290
 Plasmatic action of calcium which is known 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.019
 also as a calcemia in practice the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.290
 parathormone is task to maintain 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:23.989
 constant levels of calcium in the blood 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.930
 the football in fact even before entering 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.090
 in bone structure it is essential 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.430
 for nerve conduction for the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.489
 muscle contraction and for many 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.910
 enzymatic activity for theirs 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.450
 importance in calcium metabolism 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.190
 paratormone calcitonin and vitamin d 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.310
 constitute the so-called calcium hormones 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.709
 too many and remain constant 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.680
 concentration of calcium in the blood 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.400
 acting mainly on the intestine level 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.560
 bone and kidney the secretion of these 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.109
 too many calcium hormones is extremely 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.840
 sensitive even to the smallest 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:06.500
 variations of calcemia ie i 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.879
 blood calcium levels before 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.620
 go beyond 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.140
 I want to spend a word also on 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.780
 football and explain why the adjustment 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.530
 its plasma levels are like this 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.810
 critical for many physiological processes 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.400
 first of all besides being the greatest 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.500
 component of the bones 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.120
 football is very important for the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.609
 correct functioning of the system 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.060
 nervous and muscular system 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.680
 calcium also allows normal 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.840
 transmission of electrical impulses 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.849
 along the nerves 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.079
 precisely for these important functions 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.359
 of football 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.519
 the most common symptoms in disorders 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.459
 parathyroid glands are related to the villain 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:50.359
 functioning of the nervous system and 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.609
 include depression and fatigue beyond 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.959
 the nerves also the muscles use i 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.000
 changes in calcium levels 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.819
 inside the muscle fibers for 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.889
 contract and this helps us to explain 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.440
 like never when the levels of soccer 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.510
 people fall below the norm 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.720
 experiments in a sensation of 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.359
 weakness or muscle cramps 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.639
 the last important function of football 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.820
 it is also the best known and is 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.950
 referring to the skeletal system 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.010
 the bones in a sense also act 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.610
 from soccer tank and this allows to 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.009
 to have 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.069
 always a good supply of calcium for 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:30.050
 keep the lime stable I know it 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:32.750
 just like in our banks 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.389
 continuously withdrawals and deposits of 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.639
 money also the level of football in the 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.099
 blood is the result of a balance between 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.900
 the withdrawal and the deposit of football a 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.360
 bone level 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.849
 if the calcemia goes down, the 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.520
 mobilization of calcium from the tissue 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.680
 bone and the amount absorbed is increased 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.620
 from the digestive tract 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.419
 on the contrary when calcium levels 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.180
 plasmatic are elevated then the 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.610
 mineral is deposited in the bones for 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.159
 reduce serum calcium for this purpose 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.439
 calcium regulation mechanism a 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:10.699
 First- rate role is played precisely 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:12.860
 from our parathyroids despite the 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.349
 very small parathyroid sizes 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.759
 they are particularly rich in vases 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.379
 blood 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.259
 thanks to this abundant 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:23.779
 vascularization the parathyroids are 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.870
 suitable for monitoring the calcemia in 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:28.580
 any time of day 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.770
 in fact when the blood circulates them 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.199
 internal parathyroid cocks la 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.440
 blood concentration of calcium and 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:39.860
 they react by producing more or less hormone 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.690
 parathyroid depending on the needs 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.839
 let's see in detail how it happens 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.520
 this hormonal control the parathyroid hormone 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:48.680
 it is secreted in response to 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.139
 decrease in concentration of 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.339
 plasma calcium than in medical terms 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:57.650
 it is called hypocalcemia not by chance il 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:59.930
 parathormone acts by stimulating the 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.060
 release of calcium from the bones e 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.979
 decreasing the excretion of calcium 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.379
 through the kidneys 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.229
 this effect is exactly opposite to 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:12.050
 that of calcitonin which is the hormone 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.789
 produced by para follicular cells 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.349
 of the thyroid 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.560
 in addition to reducing urinary excretion 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:20.719
 of football and to increase its release 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.330
 from the bones to renal level the 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:26.259
 parathormone converts vitamin D into 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.750
 its active form called calcitriol 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:31.940
 once activated vitamin d is in 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.500
 able to stimulate the absorption of 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.470
 soccer food level 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.320
 intestinal ultimately all of these 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.330
 biological actions performed by the parathormone 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.680
 determine an increase in 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.270
 plasma calcium concentration such as 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.300
 we saw the parlatory hormone 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:53.060
 parathyroid acts on the kidneys on the bones 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.780
 and on the intestine with the common purpose of 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.910
 increase calcemia when necessary 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.700
 the calcemia must in fact be understood 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:06.620
 in a very narrow range included 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:09.380
 between 8.5 and 10 5 mg of calcium per 100 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.300
 We have also seen milliliters of serum 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.100
 that parathyroid activity is 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.190
 regulated directly by the changes 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.320
 of calcemia an increase in levels of 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.870
 calcium in the blood of the first indeed the 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.120
 parathyroid secretion while one 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:27.140
 decrease in plasma calcium makes it 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.120
 increase as we deepen in 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.250
 next video a dysfunction of the 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.500
 parathyroid can bring about both the excessive 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.950
 that the insufficient secretion of 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:40.090
 parathyroid with serious consequences for 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.090
 consequences for the patient's health
