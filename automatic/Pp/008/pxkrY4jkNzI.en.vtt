00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
location right here it's way on top of

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.300 
location right here it's way on top of
the<00:00:22.509> map<00:00:22.660> i<00:00:22.869> suggest<00:00:23.650> you<00:00:23.739> actually<00:00:23.950> get<00:00:24.279> a

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
was a pretty cool eastery the guys over

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.010 
was a pretty cool eastery the guys over
at<00:01:24.039> rockstar<00:01:24.460> games<00:01:24.639> doing<00:01:24.909> i'm<00:01:24.999> 99.9%<00:01:25.719> sure

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
at rockstar games doing i'm 99.9% sure

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.109 
at rockstar games doing i'm 99.9% sure
it<00:01:26.289> is<00:01:26.409> a<00:01:26.439> fallout<00:01:26.889> new<00:01:27.039> vegas<00:01:27.219> reference<00:01:27.909> I

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
it is a fallout new vegas reference I

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.520 
it is a fallout new vegas reference I
mean<00:01:28.509> the<00:01:28.600> rocket<00:01:28.899> ship<00:01:28.929> itself<00:01:29.289> looks

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
mean the rocket ship itself looks

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.739 
mean the rocket ship itself looks
identical<00:01:30.009> then<00:01:30.340> seeing<00:01:30.700> how<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.909> atom<00:01:31.569> is

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
identical then seeing how the atom is

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:33.419 
identical then seeing how the atom is
not<00:01:31.990> only<00:01:32.350> on<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.679> rocket<00:01:32.979> ship<00:01:33.009> but<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.369> the

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
not only on the rocket ship but to the

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.429 
not only on the rocket ship but to the
left<00:01:33.670> of<00:01:33.909> it<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.240> think<00:01:34.659> it's<00:01:34.929> all<00:01:35.049> just<00:01:35.319> too

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
left of it I think it's all just too

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.989 
left of it I think it's all just too
much<00:01:35.469> of<00:01:35.649> a<00:01:35.709> coincidence<00:01:35.799> though<00:01:36.609> there's<00:01:36.850> not

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
much of a coincidence though there's not

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:38.669 
much of a coincidence though there's not
any<00:01:37.179> windows<00:01:37.509> I<00:01:37.630> think<00:01:37.840> we<00:01:37.929> can<00:01:38.049> you<00:01:38.259> know<00:01:38.409> I

any windows I think we can you know I
think<00:01:39.310> we<00:01:39.490> can<00:01:39.579> say<00:01:39.789> that<00:01:39.969> is<00:01:40.119> a<00:01:40.149> fallout

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569
