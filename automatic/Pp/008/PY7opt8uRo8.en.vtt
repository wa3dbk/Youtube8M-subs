00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 the keynote was concluded a few minutes ago 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.990
 of apple for the launch of the iphone 5 s 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.670
 the iPhone 5 c is the news is that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.650
 there is practically no news in the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.379
 meaning that what was presented 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.430
 tonight is pretty much what we are 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.740
 we already knew with the only addition maybe 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.590
 the formalization of the sensor 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.180
 fingerprints which constitutes one 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.279
 news regarding this 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.900
 iphone model are 35 if obviously 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.380
 it will be called touch 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.390
 heidi and will serve in practice for 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.160
 replace passwords for the rest 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.610
 everything we already knew 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.120
 the 7 processor that definitely brings 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.399
 an extra speed for the iphone 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.960
 the m7 processor instead for the sensor 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.149
 of movements with the possibility of 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.239
 integrate the data collected by the sensor 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.059
 also in the other applications one 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.670
 camera with apple design with 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.170
 520 superimposed with some 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.359
 features is definitely 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.129
 improvements over the past 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.570
 in particular with regard to the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.970
 image stabilization this 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.030
 new flash called pluton that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.939
 it will serve to not burn the colors of the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.310
 photographs and then also the possibility of 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.860
 shoot slow motion video up to 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.479
 120 frames per second with the possibility 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.790
 to choose which parts of a video clip 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.200
 see at normal speed which a 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.900
 slow speed 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.320
 then for the rest the bands yes 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.630
 expand increase of course thanks to the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.369
 renewed processor and per million 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.229
 management of improved optimization of 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.799
 consume the standby time that comes 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.649
 even indicated in 250 hours are 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.710
 ten days in standby are curious about 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.540
 check this detail above all 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.420
 because it would be a leap forward 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.850
 really remarkable 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.140
 for the rest and with banks or a detail 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.450
 instead that many expected the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.520
 128gb version which will not be available 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.570
 and will stop at 64gb 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.890
 the memory cut of iphone 5 is then 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.930
 state 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.340
 also introduced the 5 c that everything 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.140
 summed up in short presents the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.660
 features that were already known 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.180
 thanks to the leaked leaked news 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.800
 in the past few weeks we have nothing left 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.440
 other than waiting for iphone 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.510
 debuts on September 20th there is not 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.880
 Italy among the first countries we wait 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.550
 in the next few minutes to know 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.170
 what will be the official release date 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.420
 minutes hours are in any case within 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.940
 little to know the official date of 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.040
 exit also in our country 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.350
 what do you think we comment together 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.810
 in the next few days of course where it is 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.680
 youtube or on mister gadget puntonet ma 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.120
 also on twitter 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.330
 unless he has a long ter he risks 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.330
 Hello
