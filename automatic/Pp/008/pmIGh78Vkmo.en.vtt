 of a box with recycled material 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.699
 quite simple 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.699
 I'll use my killer theory here. 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:37.290
 killer because you may be looking 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:38.640
 The video there is a good phase here. 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.000
 product 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:54.750
 feels he has a great quality is 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:01.410
 good comes well well is pretty enveloped 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:08.549
 Finta compared the comparison is this 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:16.080
 which is a cc is very thin if the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:19.320
 nokia nokia 720 comes with lens there some 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.400
 places say it's 6.7 megapixels 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.770
 others say it is 16 midpoint pixels 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:37.220
 and it comes with the causal lens in flash 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:40.680
 led here is good here comes little key 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:47.430
 on these little bits here that see the manual 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:53.270
 is almost no one reads not care 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:59.630
 the recharger here is not usb style 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:06.649
 earphone tafona normal input p2 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.649
 input here over a usb cable 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:17.930
 only it is good to win here 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:25.950
 I'll take this plastic over 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:30.540
 very pretty good and how can you see the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:35.340
 battery is not can not be removed from 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:40.980
 button on the side of the camera to 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.980
 connect the device here in the center, I'll go 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.849
 Talk to you, it's the first time. 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.650
 that I am using a system of 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:55.019
 microsoft windows phone 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:01.379
 this system it comes with windows phone a 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:03.989
 version 8.0 and was already in some 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.139
 updates there from nokia 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.620
 some more legal functions for 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.620
 camera 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:25.440
 remembering that comes with a processor 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:32.639
 dual core 1 ghz there is until it comes 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:39.949
 with gorilla glass 2 it's good to have one 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:47.269
 quite clear screen mainly there 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:47.269
 these shortcuts here are pretty big 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:08.130
 hence some settings is a screen 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:13.280
 enough and detecting responds very well 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.280
 to touch a very sensitive screen 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.830
 This is it, people, I hope you have 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.430

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.430
