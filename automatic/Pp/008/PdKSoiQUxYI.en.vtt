certainly it's a little bit insulting

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.810 
certainly it's a little bit insulting
but<00:04:23.229> if<00:04:23.380> we<00:04:23.530> inject<00:04:23.800> some<00:04:24.070> seriousness<00:04:24.520> into

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
but if we inject some seriousness into

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.300 
but if we inject some seriousness into
this<00:04:24.940> case<00:04:25.120> because<00:04:25.390> there<00:04:25.540> is<00:04:25.660> a<00:04:25.690> woman

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
this case because there is a woman

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.830 
this case because there is a woman
whose<00:04:26.430> life<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.880> on<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.030> line<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.540> she's
