00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello there are ideas for you again 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.290
 the editorial 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.859
 I wish you much fun 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.859
 look at 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:18.750
 I'll show you the half chopsticks today 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.439
 The reason is that you start with two 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.330
 Air mass works an envelope and 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.330
 stabs like the plot 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.930
 So you work after the attack 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.440
 a row in the basic pattern, there are 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.450
 videos in my channel 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.420
 but you just take it out is very easy 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.760
 you take one from each air mass 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.990
 thread it up and put it on as a stitch 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.460
 the nail and then start off 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.460
 These hold chopsticks 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:32.710
 The color change works with the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.710
 make air and then crochet back 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.420
 and repeats this series 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.970
 ever one from when he starts with 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.100
 make two air 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:05.510
 an envelope as in a house 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.510
 sting and work half the stick 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.410
 like the Tunisian crochet like it 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.230
 like to visit our facebook group 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.260
 that means crocheting unethical or 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:39.360
 there are lots of piling there 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:44.280
 other patterns that can be here 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:48.810
 process from hitler this westend 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:54.000
 summer can just from the hit series of 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.780
 Trojan with an additional 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.680
 Turn the air mass or change the color 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.560
 do not turn 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:07.010
 When Tunisian crochet one turns yes 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.010
 the work did not and then returned 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.959
 and so see the half - bars in the 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.769
 Strictly stitch out I wish you much 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.769
 have fun with it
