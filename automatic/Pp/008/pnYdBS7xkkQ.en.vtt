00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.330
 It 's the fast playing now . 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:15.559
 I do not have to let my left hand die . 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:20.180
 Only biting his brains haejuji colored throw what I had to earn net 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:24.110
 Until then, I only had the symptoms when I was on the drum. 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:29.090
 At some point, when I hit a guitar, 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:33.559
 Other sheep like a lotto catch like an egg so grab this what play 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:41.120
 But if you catch me like this, you can never play on stage. 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:46.579
 So, from that moment on , this symptom started to spread a little in my daily life. 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:51.020
 Then I missed the typing now and even when I locked the button a bit 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.820
 Now the authorities later I doeseo little ritual yirwoya is this What is this 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.270
 Everything that comes to you when 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.079
 There's a phenomenon that keeps going on. 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:05.030
 I saw her at the doctor's office. 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:09.409
 Especially in the performance I've been writing a lot inde occasional symptoms of hand 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.950
 People are normal at the presidency , but the causes of the cure and boom are known 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.950
 Not 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:22.899

 You would not like us to be serious, I make I make deusyeot sad this distressed 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:36.950
 It was so many times , and oddly enough, this symptom was bad for me 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:42.799
 I never got to bring it. 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:46.820
 Because the drum beat children walk yeonjuin not stand watching the songwriter 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.470
 I went to the 1st Army, went to the Japanese Army, 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.229
 For example: 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.490
 But you can not beat the guitar. 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.929
 Well, while the stage all the way to free your local Axis Agency thou spare from Bach 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.770
 What can I do? 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:04.189
 You have to do a lot of action, so the lady will know everything. 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.189
 Oh 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.300

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.230
 I think it's a good way to go. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.480
 As a result , 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:33.620
 I think also that this is because you think it makes sense If I had eyes hands 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.310
 The next time it's horrible, it's the handle that came when I was singing the squid. 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:43.190
 Since there was also presented to and record what today 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.319
 I have to keep feeling that way , but it's okay to forget that. 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.520
 Give me a bath when I'm immersed in something . 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:53.090
 Well, it's okay to meet or concentrate on a pretty pupil. 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.840

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.830
 Accounting prices rise because the music now and you want deutdo 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.500
 It's just that you're just going to do it later, but if you buy my music 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.010
 There can be an era wherever you are. 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.660

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:17.330

 I'm drowning. I'm drowning . Yeah. Yeah. Go. 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:39.860
