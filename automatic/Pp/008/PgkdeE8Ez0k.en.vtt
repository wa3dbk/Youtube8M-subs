training this is this is actually my one
of<00:02:28.580> my<00:02:28.670> pro-life<00:02:29.180> about<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.780> one<00:02:29.990> for<00:02:30.170> nearly

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
of my pro-life about this one for nearly

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.510 
of my pro-life about this one for nearly
three<00:02:30.590> years<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:33.190> apart<00:02:34.190> from<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.490> obvious

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
three years and apart from the obvious

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.170 
three years and apart from the obvious
sort<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.570> fading<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:37.370> looks<00:02:37.520> pretty<00:02:37.820> good<00:02:37.940> it's

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
sort of fading it looks pretty good it's

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.280 
sort of fading it looks pretty good it's
got<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.390> bit<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.570> wear<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.780> tear<00:02:39.080> on<00:02:39.260> the

other<00:02:43.400> than<00:02:43.520> ice<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:44.060> as<00:02:44.270> good<00:02:44.390> as<00:02:44.510> about

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
other than ice is as good as about

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.000 
other than ice is as good as about
bought<00:02:44.990> it<00:02:45.170> also<00:02:45.380> I've<00:02:45.590> continued<00:02:45.980> to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
bought it also I've continued to

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.430 
bought it also I've continued to
training<00:02:46.490> this<00:02:46.610> I've<00:02:46.790> trained<00:02:47.330> in<00:02:47.480> this<00:02:47.660> more

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
training this I've trained in this more

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
than any my other gates I said three

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.000 
than any my other gates I said three
solid<00:02:50.330> years<00:02:50.360> worth<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.810> training<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.500> it's

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
solid years worth of training and it's

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.740 
solid years worth of training and it's
still<00:02:52.700> as<00:02:52.820> good<00:02:52.850> as<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.209> dartboard
