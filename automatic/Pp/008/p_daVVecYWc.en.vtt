00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.889 

here's<00:00:06.580> a<00:00:06.640> variation<00:00:07.359> of<00:00:07.450> the<00:00:07.569> bullseye<00:00:07.870> I

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:07.899 
here's a variation of the bullseye I

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:09.810 
here's a variation of the bullseye I
kind<00:00:08.200> of<00:00:08.230> like<00:00:08.440> this<00:00:08.680> one<00:00:08.920> because<00:00:09.400> it<00:00:09.730> gives

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
kind of like this one because it gives

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.730 
kind of like this one because it gives
you<00:00:09.969> even<00:00:10.000> a<00:00:10.330> more<00:00:10.570> dramatic<00:00:10.719> spiral<00:00:11.469> effect

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
you even a more dramatic spiral effect

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.670 
you even a more dramatic spiral effect
so<00:00:11.830> we'll<00:00:11.949> take<00:00:12.100> our<00:00:12.280> four<00:00:12.490> pieces<00:00:12.670> of<00:00:13.000> dough

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
so we'll take our four pieces of dough

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.720 
so we'll take our four pieces of dough
flatten<00:00:14.680> them<00:00:14.889> out<00:00:15.180> and<00:00:16.950> we<00:00:17.950> can<00:00:18.100> even<00:00:18.280> flatten

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
flatten them out and we can even flatten

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.780 
flatten them out and we can even flatten
them<00:00:18.850> with<00:00:18.880> a<00:00:19.330> rolling<00:00:19.600> pin<00:00:19.750> again<00:00:20.230> gently<00:00:20.790> no

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
them with a rolling pin again gently no

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.779 
them with a rolling pin again gently no
thinner<00:00:22.210> than<00:00:22.450> a<00:00:22.570> quarter<00:00:22.930> of<00:00:23.050> an<00:00:23.170> inch<00:00:23.640> if<00:00:24.640> you

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
thinner than a quarter of an inch if you

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.100 
thinner than a quarter of an inch if you
go<00:00:24.910> any<00:00:25.060> thinner<00:00:25.330> than<00:00:25.539> a<00:00:25.600> quarter<00:00:25.870> of<00:00:25.900> an<00:00:26.020> inch

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
go any thinner than a quarter of an inch

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.260 
go any thinner than a quarter of an inch
you<00:00:26.320> end<00:00:26.470> up<00:00:26.620> with<00:00:26.800> tough<00:00:27.100> dough<00:00:27.430> you<00:00:28.000> want<00:00:28.180> to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
you end up with tough dough you want to

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.640 
you end up with tough dough you want to
give<00:00:28.390> enough<00:00:28.720> dough<00:00:28.900> for<00:00:29.140> it<00:00:29.200> to<00:00:29.320> be<00:00:29.410> able<00:00:29.500> to

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
give enough dough for it to be able to

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.470 
give enough dough for it to be able to
puff<00:00:29.860> it<00:00:29.980> will<00:00:30.130> double<00:00:30.460> in<00:00:30.610> size<00:00:30.820> eventually

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
puff it will double in size eventually

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.209 
puff it will double in size eventually
so<00:00:31.840> a<00:00:31.869> quarter<00:00:32.199> of<00:00:32.289> an<00:00:32.349> inch<00:00:32.439> becomes<00:00:32.800> half<00:00:33.039> an

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
so a quarter of an inch becomes half an

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:35.190 
so a quarter of an inch becomes half an
inch<00:00:33.370> in<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.790> finished<00:00:34.210> loaf<00:00:34.420> but<00:00:34.930> an<00:00:35.050> eighth

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
inch in the finished loaf but an eighth

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.750 
inch in the finished loaf but an eighth
of<00:00:35.350> an<00:00:35.470> inch<00:00:35.560> only<00:00:35.829> becomes<00:00:36.130> a<00:00:36.280> quarter<00:00:36.579> of<00:00:36.670> an

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
of an inch only becomes a quarter of an

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.750 
of an inch only becomes a quarter of an
inch<00:00:36.850> so<00:00:37.060> that's<00:00:37.239> a<00:00:37.480> little<00:00:37.870> bit<00:00:38.050> too<00:00:38.260> tough

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
inch so that's a little bit too tough

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.560 
inch so that's a little bit too tough
but<00:00:39.760> we're<00:00:39.850> gonna<00:00:39.970> get<00:00:40.149> these<00:00:40.300> pieces

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
but we're gonna get these pieces

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.880 
but we're gonna get these pieces
together<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:43.540> them<00:00:43.690> approximately<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.680> same

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
together get them approximately the same

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:56.160 
together get them approximately the same
size<00:00:45.220> as<00:00:45.489> disks<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:55.090> this<00:00:55.329> happens<00:00:55.690> very<00:00:56.020> very

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
size as disks and this happens very very

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.819 
size as disks and this happens very very
quickly<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:57.070> as<00:00:57.790> I<00:00:58.210> said<00:00:58.270> earlier<00:00:58.719> I<00:00:59.320> want<00:00:59.620> the

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
quickly and as I said earlier I want the

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.310 
quickly and as I said earlier I want the
lightest<00:01:00.430> piece<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.910> be<00:01:01.059> on<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.360> outside<00:01:01.899> wrap

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
lightest piece to be on the outside wrap

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.219 
lightest piece to be on the outside wrap
so<00:01:02.980> I'm<00:01:03.250> gonna<00:01:03.370> take<00:01:03.610> a<00:01:03.820> light<00:01:04.059> piece<00:01:04.329> a<00:01:04.570> dark

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
so I'm gonna take a light piece a dark

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:12.510 
so I'm gonna take a light piece a dark
piece<00:01:05.499> a<00:01:07.530> light<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.810> dark<00:01:11.219> so<00:01:12.219> now<00:01:12.340> we've

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
piece a light and a dark so now we've

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.669 
piece a light and a dark so now we've
got<00:01:12.700> instead<00:01:13.060> of<00:01:13.179> two<00:01:13.539> pieces<00:01:13.929> of<00:01:14.139> light<00:01:14.409> and

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
got instead of two pieces of light and

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:16.980 
got instead of two pieces of light and
dark<00:01:14.859> we've<00:01:15.009> got<00:01:15.159> four<00:01:15.579> I'm<00:01:16.450> gonna<00:01:16.630> flatten

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
dark we've got four I'm gonna flatten

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.269 
dark we've got four I'm gonna flatten
that<00:01:17.200> out<00:01:17.259> you<00:01:17.560> can<00:01:17.679> even<00:01:17.770> use<00:01:17.979> your<00:01:18.130> rolling

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:18.279 
that out you can even use your rolling

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:19.679 
that out you can even use your rolling
pin<00:01:18.369> a<00:01:18.549> little<00:01:18.880> bit<00:01:18.999> to<00:01:19.119> kind<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.329> pinch<00:01:19.539> them

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
pin a little bit to kind of pinch them

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.660 
pin a little bit to kind of pinch them
together<00:01:19.950> another<00:01:20.950> reason<00:01:21.279> why<00:01:21.369> I<00:01:21.399> don't<00:01:21.490> like

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
together another reason why I don't like

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.190 
together another reason why I don't like
to<00:01:21.789> use<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:21.909> lot<00:01:22.060> of<00:01:22.090> dusting<00:01:22.569> flour<00:01:22.689> here<00:01:23.109> is

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
to use a lot of dusting flour here is

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.039 
to use a lot of dusting flour here is
that<00:01:23.319> it<00:01:23.499> will<00:01:23.619> tend<00:01:23.859> to<00:01:23.950> make<00:01:24.130> it<00:01:24.310> less

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that it will tend to make it less

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.709 
that it will tend to make it less
adherent<00:01:26.369> flatten<00:01:27.369> it<00:01:27.459> out<00:01:27.579> square<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.569> off

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
adherent flatten it out square it off

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:35.309 
adherent flatten it out square it off
and<00:01:29.130> roll<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.340> up<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.719> as<00:01:34.719> you<00:01:34.840> get<00:01:34.959> to<00:01:35.079> the<00:01:35.170> end

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
and roll it up and as you get to the end

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.709 
and roll it up and as you get to the end
kind<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.889> pull<00:01:36.189> that<00:01:36.219> last<00:01:36.729> piece<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.090> square

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
kind of pull that last piece to square

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.019 
kind of pull that last piece to square
it<00:01:37.899> so<00:01:38.049> that<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.319> get<00:01:38.529> a<00:01:38.679> nice<00:01:39.279> spiral<00:01:39.639> effect

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:40.029 
it so that you get a nice spiral effect

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:41.129 
it so that you get a nice spiral effect
all<00:01:40.209> the<00:01:40.240> way<00:01:40.359> through<00:01:40.569> you<00:01:40.659> can<00:01:40.779> see<00:01:40.959> already

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:41.139 
all the way through you can see already

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:43.800 
all the way through you can see already
some<00:01:41.859> of<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.069> from<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.880> darker<00:01:43.209> side<00:01:43.389> coming

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
some of it from the darker side coming

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.539 
some of it from the darker side coming
out<00:01:44.049> and<00:01:44.499> that's<00:01:44.619> alright<00:01:45.009> that<00:01:45.189> just<00:01:45.369> gives

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
out and that's alright that just gives

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.659 
out and that's alright that just gives
it<00:01:45.639> a<00:01:45.759> nice<00:01:46.389> interesting<00:01:47.249> personality<00:01:48.249> and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:48.669 
it a nice interesting personality and

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:50.699 
it a nice interesting personality and
we've<00:01:48.909> got<00:01:49.060> ourselves<00:01:49.179> a<00:01:49.569> loaf<00:01:49.810> that<00:01:50.409> could

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
we've got ourselves a loaf that could

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:54.629 
we've got ourselves a loaf that could
either<00:01:51.279> be<00:01:51.549> baked<00:01:52.209> in<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:52.630> pan<00:01:52.869> or<00:01:53.169> in<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.340> sheet

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639 
either be baked in a pan or in a sheet

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:59.129 
either be baked in a pan or in a sheet
pan<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.939> so<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.149> can<00:01:58.359> see<00:01:58.659> again<00:01:58.959> the

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.139 
pan just so you can see again the

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:05.420 
pan just so you can see again the
contrast<00:01:59.619> I'm<00:01:59.950> going<00:02:00.099> to<00:02:00.159> cut<00:02:00.939> this

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.950 

once<00:02:06.430> again<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.730> really<00:02:07.150> interesting<00:02:07.810> pattern

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
once again a really interesting pattern

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.640 
once again a really interesting pattern
it's<00:02:08.350> kind<00:02:08.590> of<00:02:08.650> the<00:02:08.800> pinwheel<00:02:09.280> or<00:02:10.650> spiral

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
it's kind of the pinwheel or spiral

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.340 
it's kind of the pinwheel or spiral
effect<00:02:14.880> now<00:02:15.880> we<00:02:15.940> could<00:02:16.300> make<00:02:16.330> two<00:02:16.810> loaves<00:02:17.080> out

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
effect now we could make two loaves out

effect now we could make two loaves out
of<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:17.950> cut<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.310> in<00:02:18.490> half<00:02:18.670> or<00:02:18.850> we<00:02:18.970> can

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
of this I just cut it in half or we can

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.970 
of this I just cut it in half or we can
put<00:02:19.210> it<00:02:19.240> back<00:02:19.420> together<00:02:19.660> again<00:02:19.900> we<00:02:20.440> could<00:02:20.740> even

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
put it back together again we could even

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.950 
put it back together again we could even
cut<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.430> into<00:02:21.670> four<00:02:21.850> pieces<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.210> braid<00:02:22.690> them

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
cut this into four pieces and braid them

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.960 
cut this into four pieces and braid them
and<00:02:23.140> get<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.740> sort<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.010> spiral<00:02:24.520> braid<00:02:24.730> there's

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and get the sort of spiral braid there's

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.300 
and get the sort of spiral braid there's

the one that went in the loaf pan and

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.200 
the one that went in the loaf pan and
show<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.360> even<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:50.460> petard<00:02:51.460> shaped<00:02:51.970> loaf

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
show you that even a petard shaped loaf

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.200 
show you that even a petard shaped loaf
can<00:02:52.870> be<00:02:53.020> big<00:02:53.230> freestanding<00:02:54.160> like<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:55.000> you

can be big freestanding like that you

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.250 
can be big freestanding like that you
can<00:02:55.330> see<00:02:55.450> how<00:02:55.570> it<00:02:55.660> kind<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.870> healed<00:02:56.080> together

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
go to bake it we could put cuts in there

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.640
