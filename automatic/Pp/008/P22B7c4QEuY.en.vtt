00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.310

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.109
 no has just fallen 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.480
 so I could have chosen better 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.960

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.970
 Chauny randomly buddies since not a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.619
 for me so here is some harm it is 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.649
 perfect since I count the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.309
 renamed this one go we want to kill all 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:46.460
 to a parent we will start with the one 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:46.460
 which is all right one less 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:02.100
 luckily I turned off the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:05.820
 animations following then that my homeland 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.030
 very long I made 20 minutes 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.130
 out even not 15 20 minutes I 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.330
 thought again I was doing them very 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.729
 slowly since I was watching 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.340
 videos next so that's ahead and not very 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.439
 quickly for me he fell quickly enough 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.210
 here is a small summary I will look 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.710
 still in the navy of Aix how many 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.950
 time I met I am neither post 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.640
 total but I do not think I saw them 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.550
 hundred times we'll see just now to 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:39.600
 go we take care of the last paris-nice 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:42.330
 hop there and it remains only the chenit 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.920
 puccini it's great we raped like that 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.490

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.259
 douch me hang waespi coast or sahel and 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.789
 little cats and little pokemon 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.280
 that can be found at the beginning of the game but 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.509
 I am a big fan frankly its 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.259
 classes there are not a lot of pokemon 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.489
 who are raped and they call me asleep 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.259
 nothing at all since anyway we 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:03.679
 can not it seems to me it's a 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.509
 pokemon that we can not fall asleep 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:10.849
 directly boli the levels 3 1 can 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.849
 not to abuse either if you do not return 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:23.910
 and presto I did not capture that it's cool 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.540

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.100

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.880
 omega finally frozen from upside down but 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.550
 it is not very serious 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.840
 you understood and I will call it 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.380
 my friend 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.020

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.410

 surely chenille peeps and besides I 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.950
 do not know if I'm going to evolve it 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.470
 or sigean would chase another I'm going 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:59.220

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:01.230

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.470

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.510
 massage screen powder cancel the effects 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.270
 cumulative of an enemy attack it has less 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:20.100
 speed is more apt axp so he is 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:21.390
 discreet clementi voice this is very 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.080

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:56.040
 against one that falls well against a boyfriend 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.690
 normal hip hop that I like at least 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.710

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:10.120
