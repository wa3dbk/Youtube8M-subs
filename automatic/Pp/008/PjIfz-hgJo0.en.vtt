this turtle will live probably 50 60
years<00:00:22.110> yeah<00:00:23.140> and<00:00:24.330> these<00:00:25.330> turtles<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:26.020> larger

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440

years yeah and these turtles the larger
ones<00:00:26.680> are<00:00:27.090> probably<00:00:28.140> all<00:00:29.140> probably<00:00:29.530> six<00:00:29.740> or

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
ones are probably all probably six or

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.310 
ones are probably all probably six or
seven<00:00:30.190> years<00:00:30.400> old<00:00:30.580> and<00:00:31.030> they<00:00:31.240> like<00:00:31.510> tea<00:00:31.780> plants

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
seven years old and they like tea plants

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.799 
seven years old and they like tea plants
they<00:00:33.070> do<00:00:33.129> and<00:00:33.640> their<00:00:33.820> that<00:00:34.059> thus<00:00:34.420> I<00:00:34.629> have

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
they do and their that thus I have

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.880 
they do and their that thus I have
created<00:00:35.019> a<00:00:35.350> habitat<00:00:35.859> for<00:00:35.920> them<00:00:36.399> and<00:00:37.469> 90%<00:00:38.469> of

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
created a habitat for them and 90% of

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.279 
created a habitat for them and 90% of
their<00:00:39.069> diet<00:00:39.309> should<00:00:39.730> come<00:00:39.969> from<00:00:40.300> natural

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
their diet should come from natural

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.430 
their diet should come from natural
grasses<00:00:42.100> from<00:00:42.670> they<00:00:43.329> like<00:00:43.539> dandelions

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
grasses from they like dandelions

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.590 
grasses from they like dandelions
they'll<00:00:44.739> eat<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.100> Molen<00:00:45.579> I've<00:00:45.850> planted

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
they'll eat the Molen I've planted

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.360 
they'll eat the Molen I've planted
alfalfa<00:00:47.350> which<00:00:47.530> is<00:00:47.679> a<00:00:47.710> little<00:00:48.010> bit<00:00:48.129> high<00:00:48.339> in

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
alfalfa which is a little bit high in

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.430 
alfalfa which is a little bit high in
protein<00:00:48.940> for<00:00:49.210> them<00:00:49.329> but<00:00:49.839> a<00:00:49.870> little<00:00:50.140> bit<00:00:50.229> won't

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
protein for them but a little bit won't

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.559 
protein for them but a little bit won't
hurt<00:00:50.649> them<00:00:50.800> and<00:00:50.949> then<00:00:51.219> I<00:00:51.489> have<00:00:52.089> they're<00:00:52.300> just

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
hurt them and then I have they're just

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.049 
hurt them and then I have they're just
now<00:00:52.809> coming<00:00:53.199> up<00:00:53.440> I<00:00:53.620> planted<00:00:54.039> natural<00:00:54.489> grasses

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
now coming up I planted natural grasses

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.349 
now coming up I planted natural grasses
in<00:00:55.300> this<00:00:55.929> back<00:00:56.170> area<00:00:56.440> so<00:00:56.620> they'll<00:00:56.920> have<00:00:57.359> plenty

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
in this back area so they'll have plenty

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.379 
in this back area so they'll have plenty
to<00:00:58.449> eat<00:00:58.600> without<00:00:59.350> having<00:00:59.769> to<00:01:00.069> subsidize<00:01:00.639> I<00:01:00.999> do

tortoises that were were large probably
some<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.220> largest<00:02:03.490> in<00:02:03.730> captivity<00:02:04.120> and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
some of the largest in captivity and

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.600 
some of the largest in captivity and
these<00:02:05.050> are<00:02:05.230> offspring<00:02:05.770> those<00:02:06.010> turtles<00:02:06.400> since

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
these are offspring those turtles since

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.969 
these are offspring those turtles since
then<00:02:06.820> have<00:02:07.030> have<00:02:07.390> passed<00:02:07.690> on<00:02:07.900> but<00:02:08.229> these<00:02:08.740> are

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
then have have passed on but these are

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.640 
then have have passed on but these are
offspring<00:02:09.520> which<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:09.850> very<00:02:10.260> unusual<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.410> have

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
offspring which is very unusual to have

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.400 
offspring which is very unusual to have
and<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.390> clutch<00:02:13.690> hatching

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
and and have a clutch hatching

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.990 
and and have a clutch hatching
because<00:02:15.070> this<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.400> not<00:02:15.580> their<00:02:15.850> natural

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
because this is not their natural

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.860 
because this is not their natural
habitat<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.880> soil<00:02:19.120> conditions<00:02:19.600> have<00:02:19.750> to

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
habitat and the soil conditions have to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.460 
habitat and the soil conditions have to
be<00:02:19.900> just<00:02:19.990> right<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:22.330> it's<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:22.960> it's<00:02:23.350> a

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
be just right and it it's just it's a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.260 
be just right and it it's just it's a
nature<00:02:23.980> thing<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.670> this<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:24.910> not<00:02:25.090> their

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
nature thing and this is not their

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.120 
nature thing and this is not their
habitat<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:25.900> it's<00:02:26.020> unusual<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.800> around<00:02:27.040> the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
habitat so it's unusual and around the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.740 
habitat so it's unusual and around the
corner<00:02:27.400> here<00:02:27.550> you've<00:02:27.760> got<00:02:27.940> an<00:02:28.030> example<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.540> how

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
corner here you've got an example of how

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.020 
corner here you've got an example of how
to<00:02:28.810> build<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.380> habitat<00:02:29.800> for<00:02:30.040> them<00:02:30.280> yes

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
to build that habitat for them yes

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.230 
to build that habitat for them yes
and<00:02:31.120> it's<00:02:31.540> really<00:02:32.320> quite<00:02:32.770> simple

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.490 

these<00:02:37.240> are<00:02:37.630> PVC<00:02:38.350> pipes<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.810> I've<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:41.050> sliced

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
these are PVC pipes and I've just sliced

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.790 
these are PVC pipes and I've just sliced
them<00:02:41.890> in<00:02:42.040> half<00:02:42.750> buried<00:02:43.750> them<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.320> then<00:02:44.560> made<00:02:44.770> a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
them in half buried them and then made a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.920 
them in half buried them and then made a
burrow<00:02:45.100> on<00:02:45.250> top<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.240> they<00:02:46.360> love<00:02:46.630> to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
burrow on top of it and they love to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.550 
burrow on top of it and they love to
climb<00:02:47.710> on<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.370> they<00:02:48.820> will<00:02:49.000> they'll<00:02:49.560> burrow

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
climb on and they will they'll burrow

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.560 
climb on and they will they'll burrow
down<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.580> have<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.790> little<00:02:52.030> clutch<00:02:52.390> of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
down in this and have a little clutch of

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.080 
down in this and have a little clutch of
eggs<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.830> know<00:02:53.890> just<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.310> whole<00:02:54.520> natural

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
eggs and you know just the whole natural

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.480 
eggs and you know just the whole natural
process<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:55.930> never<00:02:56.410> use<00:02:56.740> any<00:02:57.010> type<00:02:57.340> of

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
process I never use any type of

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.210 
process I never use any type of
pesticide<00:02:57.880> back<00:02:58.330> here<00:02:58.570> it's<00:02:58.690> totally<00:02:59.620> organic

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
pesticide back here it's totally organic

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.730 
pesticide back here it's totally organic
back<00:03:01.120> here<00:03:01.480> because<00:03:02.110> we<00:03:02.260> don't<00:03:02.380> want<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.560> harm

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
back here because we don't want to harm

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.470 
back here because we don't want to harm
them<00:03:02.800> in<00:03:03.070> any<00:03:03.220> way<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.760> there<00:03:04.000> anything<00:03:04.210> you

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
them in any way is there anything you

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.020 
them in any way is there anything you
should<00:03:04.720> not<00:03:04.870> feed<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.470> turtles<00:03:05.850> well<00:03:06.850> the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
should not feed the turtles well the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.120 
should not feed the turtles well the
best<00:03:07.270> thing<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.720> let<00:03:07.870> them<00:03:08.140> eat<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.650> things

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
best thing to let them eat is things

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.710 
best thing to let them eat is things
that<00:03:09.250> they<00:03:09.370> would<00:03:09.550> have<00:03:09.580> in<00:03:10.090> nature<00:03:10.330> they're

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
that they would have in nature they're

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.020 
that they would have in nature they're
natural<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:12.100> that's<00:03:12.280> why<00:03:12.460> we<00:03:12.580> created<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
natural and that's why we created the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.450 
natural and that's why we created the
habitat<00:03:13.480> but<00:03:13.930> such<00:03:14.200> things<00:03:14.230> as<00:03:14.680> apple<00:03:15.160> seeds

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
habitat but such things as apple seeds

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.720 
habitat but such things as apple seeds
are<00:03:15.880> very<00:03:16.270> poisonous<00:03:17.190> broccoli<00:03:18.190> will<00:03:18.490> cause<00:03:18.700> a

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
are very poisonous broccoli will cause a

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.210 
are very poisonous broccoli will cause a
chemical<00:03:19.360> reaction<00:03:19.660> there<00:03:20.590> there's<00:03:20.920> several

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
chemical reaction there there's several

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.690 
chemical reaction there there's several
things

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
things

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.570 
things
iris<00:03:22.090> rhizomes<00:03:22.780> are<00:03:23.560> not<00:03:23.740> good<00:03:23.950> for<00:03:24.100> them<00:03:24.250> so

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
iris rhizomes are not good for them so

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.060 
iris rhizomes are not good for them so
really<00:03:25.420> when<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.870> when<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.260> plant<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.590> habitat

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
really when you when you plant a habitat

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.830 
really when you when you plant a habitat
like<00:03:27.220> this<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.790> best<00:03:28.030> thing<00:03:28.270> is<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:28.510> plant<00:03:28.750> the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
like this the best thing is to plant the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.340 
like this the best thing is to plant the
things<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.230> they<00:03:29.350> would<00:03:29.500> find<00:03:29.710> in<00:03:29.920> nature
