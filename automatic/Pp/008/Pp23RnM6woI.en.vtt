00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
itself first of all this is the tip of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.780 
itself first of all this is the tip of
the<00:00:30.779> cross-country<00:00:31.199> ski<00:00:32.000> as<00:00:33.680> we<00:00:34.680> go<00:00:34.860> back<00:00:35.100> this

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the cross-country ski as we go back this

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.819 
the cross-country ski as we go back this
is<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.149> binding<00:00:36.450> where<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> boot<00:00:37.290> attaches

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
is the binding where the boot attaches

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.780 
is the binding where the boot attaches
to<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> ski<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.800> then<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.950> go<00:00:41.129> here<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
kick or grip zone and these fish gills

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.310 
kick or grip zone and these fish gills
are<00:00:53.850> very<00:00:54.030> important<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.140> where

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
are very important because this is where
