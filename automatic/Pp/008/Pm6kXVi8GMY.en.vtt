00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
so and I on this side and negative space

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.120 
so and I on this side and negative space
there<00:03:01.750> against<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.200> face<00:03:02.440> there<00:03:02.740> like<00:03:02.950> that

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
gets the body and possibly down at it

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.480 
gets the body and possibly down at it
here<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.720> share<00:03:08.590> still<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.070> on<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.460> pitch

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
here and share still it on that pitch

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.450 
here and share still it on that pitch
there<00:03:10.170> there's<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.260> basic<00:03:11.530> drawing<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.280> might

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
there there's a basic drawing I might

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.880 
there there's a basic drawing I might
just<00:03:12.670> prove<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.060> negative<00:03:13.510> light<00:03:13.890> excited

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
just prove it a negative light excited

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.710 
just prove it a negative light excited
like<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.370> just<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:15.970> make<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.240> stand<00:03:16.540> edge

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
like that just to make it stand edge

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.150 
like that just to make it stand edge
just<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.440> fragment<00:03:19.440> also<00:03:20.440> look<00:03:20.800> at<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:20.980> right

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
just a fragment also look at the right

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.270 
just a fragment also look at the right
crap<00:03:21.490> in<00:03:21.700> here<00:03:21.940> just<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:23.620> make<00:03:23.740> a<00:03:23.770> finishing

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
crap in here just to make a finishing

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:34.320 
crap in here just to make a finishing
that<00:03:24.460> night<00:03:25.090> in<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.360> hair<00:03:29.130> yeah<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:33.180> when<00:03:34.180> this

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
that night in the hair yeah so when this

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.420 
that night in the hair yeah so when this
is<00:03:34.510> just<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.840> very<00:03:34.870> quick<00:03:35.200> demonstration<00:03:35.650> just

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
is just a very quick demonstration just

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.850 
is just a very quick demonstration just
keeping<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:36.850> idea<00:03:37.240> of<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.720> dynamics<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.710> the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
keeping the idea of the dynamics of the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.320 
keeping the idea of the dynamics of the
drawing<00:03:39.370> of<00:03:39.460> a<00:03:39.520> figure<00:03:39.850> in<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:40.030> is<00:03:40.180> the

done to come there will be a third stage
this<00:05:00.590> drawing<00:05:00.890> that'll<00:05:01.280> be<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.430> touching<00:05:01.940> up

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
this drawing that'll be the touching up

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.420 
this drawing that'll be the touching up
but<00:05:02.300> I<00:05:02.330> might<00:05:02.510> use<00:05:02.810> that<00:05:03.050> as<00:05:03.290> well<00:05:03.500> just<00:05:04.190> give

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
but I might use that as well just give

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.090 
but I might use that as well just give
you<00:05:04.580> 90<00:05:04.940> /<00:05:05.150> taking<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.810> figure<00:05:06.170> all<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.680> way<00:05:06.830> now

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
you 90 / taking a figure all the way now

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.420 
you 90 / taking a figure all the way now
that<00:05:07.130> effective<00:05:07.820> this<00:05:08.000> simple<00:05:08.930> method<00:05:09.140> is<00:05:09.500> and

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
that effective this simple method is and

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.360 
that effective this simple method is and
the<00:05:10.640> arm<00:05:11.200> and<00:05:12.200> a<00:05:12.320> bit<00:05:12.470> of<00:05:12.500> thing<00:05:12.860> hand<00:05:13.190> a<00:05:13.310> little

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
the arm and a bit of thing hand a little

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:30.020 
the arm and a bit of thing hand a little
