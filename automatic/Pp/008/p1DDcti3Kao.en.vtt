when<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.710> got<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.190> Senior<00:01:44.550> Tour<00:01:44.580> of<00:01:46.130> course

the<00:01:47.280> balls<00:01:47.490> were<00:01:47.730> strong<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.030> two<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.630> had<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the balls were strong for two I had a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.570 
the balls were strong for two I had a
fairly<00:01:49.200> weak<00:01:49.440> of<00:01:49.560> release<00:01:49.830> and<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.340> balls

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
fairly weak of release and so the balls

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.580 
fairly weak of release and so the balls
became<00:01:51.030> stronger<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.140> learned<00:01:52.380> how<00:01:52.560> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
became stronger and I learned how to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.350 
became stronger and I learned how to
create<00:01:52.950> different<00:01:55.700> access<00:01:56.700> points<00:01:56.730> on<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
create different access points on the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.230 
create different access points on the
ball<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.200> create<00:01:58.700> different<00:01:59.700> skid

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
ball so I can create different skid

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.750 
ball so I can create different skid
places<00:02:00.750> that's<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.620> ball<00:02:01.800> far<00:02:02.100> enough<00:02:02.130> down<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
places that's a ball far enough down the
