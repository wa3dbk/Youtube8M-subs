00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.589
 good to see that today we are going to try two 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.950
 video capture software that one is 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.380
 the frap and the other is the one of x history that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.230
 to see first captured with that of Christi 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.510
 then capture with the fraps and at the end 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.510
 I suppose that in the comments I will put you 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.980
 with the tailcoat you can get a kind 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.449
 of framerate gameplay statistics 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.420
 then I put those statistics in 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.680
 the comments of the video and there you can 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.560
 see the difference between one and another 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.960
 because ultimately it gives us to see swaps 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.520
 mixed the machine and the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.760
 this story seems to be better 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.620
 then take a spin with him 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.200
 capturing with the tx dx capture the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.960
 statistics too and then give it a 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.810
 back with him capturing with the flaps and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.400
 capture the statistics and already see 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.110
 see what is the difference 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.880
 well you know let's go around with the 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.570
 reader and the capture button 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.570
 stats 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.640
 to see you already know or that this car 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.640
 complicated 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.550
 lotus of the year 78 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.689
 I put you one 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.570
 I'm not leaving 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.120
 to see ya for as I said the other time 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.729
 that he 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.620
 the theme of frames 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.540
 that you are going to see 30 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.400
 and then the video quality is not 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.010
 the same one that you see the one 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.650
 I see because after rendering here 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.160
 it is also lost you can reuse the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.990
 video quality is lost 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.480
 as if you have the files of 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.320
 saleh but the files that come out are usually 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.780
 be many gigs per minute and if the 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.040
 I had to upload to YouTube without losing 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.900
 of quality would be late 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.900
 Well, the first round ends 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.530
 It's worth to catch 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.020
 of statistics and now we come back with 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.390
 the franz come up now 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.110
 good to see that I'm recording the audio 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.540
 on top of the one that grabs with the flash 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.350
 because one thing that I have not commented is 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.110
 that the one of x lite the one of skamania the one of 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.210
 fifth and has a fucking mother thing 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.730
 what is the audio track of the game and 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.870
 the audio track of the microphone records them 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.230
 separately 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.480
 little flags because it's going very well because if 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.940
 you see that you have recorded the audio under you can 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.250
 download the game and upload the micro 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.320
 this is very well the frax change theme 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.540
 no flaps capture all the audio in the 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.030
 same track the micro and the game 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.120
 I'm talking to you now what 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.510
 you are watching is the capture of the flash 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.209
 but now 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.450
 I've seen the results before 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.670
 because I told you that the part of the 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:02.579
 audio de france I'm recording it to 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.579
 posteriori and they are quite 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:12.070
 differences with the history the minimum 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:17.220
 defense has been 51 and 59 and with the fraps 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.220
 the minimum has been 29 and the maximum 31 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.250
 so soy 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.250
 the machine leaves you 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.590
 not the capture fronts but the 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.300
 fronts as you show screens 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.190
 after he shoots the half directly that 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.950
 from history to the first with this game 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.440
 for the tests I'm doing 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.210
 then the file sizes here 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.180
 There are also quite unlike 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.750
 history 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:51.820
 I signed 3 minutes cup 30 gb 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:54.380
 full hd and the frap to occupy 7 with 18 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.760
 to see the beginning 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.830
 when it comes to capture is not important 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.260
 the size at least for me because I have 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.560
 leftover disk and then when rendering 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.510
 then the size and when downloading 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.010
 I guess the tail pulls the most 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.409
 page because you must do some kind of 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.600
 compression 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:13.400
 is capturing and that's what 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.860
 In addition to social vial ai 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.300
 qing as well as in the history yes that 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.200
 you have the option to deactivate 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.200
 video compression 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.820
 turn off video compression on and 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.440
 change with declined sanz the catch 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.220
 resolution that you put the brakes on 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.050
 what do you put and point we do not have options 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.030
 the one of history yes that has enough 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.300
 options 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.810
 in the comments I will leave the links 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.760
 to the 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.169
 to the different programs around the corner 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:47.590
 from france to the history website 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:49.990
 Well you can see them are programs already 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.669
 I say simple though flaps is a lot 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.270
 simpler than the one of history temple 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.460
 Christi have quite a configuration 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.190
 nothing more 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.470
 here we leave it I will review the 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.060
 videos and you can also see the 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.090
 quality differences between one and another 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.789
 because the rendering setting is going to 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.289
 be the same for the two tracks and the dx 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.289
 tone come up so far
