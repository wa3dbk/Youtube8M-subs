00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.870 
kind of inspired by at least one I can
hear<00:02:32.660> especially<00:02:32.780> make<00:02:33.230> my<00:02:33.410> new<00:02:34.160> jazz<00:02:34.490> it

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.950 
hear especially make my new jazz it
almost<00:02:35.060> sounded<00:02:35.300> like<00:02:35.360> something<00:02:35.570> I'd<00:02:35.750> have<00:02:35.840> a

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
almost sounded like something I'd have a

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.770 
almost sounded like something I'd have a
Thundercat<00:02:36.500> record<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.940> also<00:02:38.600> some

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
Thundercat record and also some

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.600 
Thundercat record and also some
classical<00:02:39.290> in<00:02:39.410> there<00:02:39.560> too<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.010> then<00:02:40.460> there's

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
classical in there too and then there's

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.190 
classical in there too and then there's
the<00:02:40.790> other<00:02:40.820> side<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.510> beats<00:02:41.690> which<00:02:41.960> are

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
the other side of the beats which are

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.800 
the other side of the beats which are
seem<00:02:43.040> like<00:02:43.250> they're<00:02:43.430> going<00:02:44.030> from<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.570> same

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
seem like they're going from the same

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.440 
seem like they're going from the same
area<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:45.320> they<00:02:45.650> were<00:02:45.710> going<00:02:46.370> with<00:02:46.610> during

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450

and with the roots you're always going

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.900 
and with the roots you're always going
to<00:02:59.030> get<00:02:59.150> these<00:02:59.300> really<00:02:59.770> well-constructed

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
to get these really well-constructed

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.830 
to get these really well-constructed
organic<00:03:01.910> beings<00:03:02.240> especially<00:03:02.420> since

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
organic beings especially since

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.770 
organic beings especially since
everything<00:03:03.350> is<00:03:03.410> played<00:03:03.709> live<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:05.180> really

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
everything is played live and I really

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.520 
everything is played live and I really
like<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.740> about<00:03:06.980> them<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.250> like<00:03:07.459> how<00:03:07.670> they

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
like that about them I like how they

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.110 
like that about them I like how they
really<00:03:09.530> start<00:03:09.950> everything<00:03:10.520> from<00:03:10.910> scratch

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
really start everything from scratch

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.150 
really start everything from scratch
they<00:03:11.630> don't<00:03:11.840> use<00:03:11.990> samples<00:03:12.440> which<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:12.709> pretty

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
they don't use samples which is pretty

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.890 
they don't use samples which is pretty
interesting<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:13.940> mean<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.300> think<00:03:14.570> they<00:03:14.750> might

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
interesting I mean I think they might

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.509 
interesting I mean I think they might
every<00:03:15.110> once<00:03:15.320> in<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.500> while<00:03:15.709> but<00:03:16.010> when<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.190> have

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
every once in a while but when you have

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.210 
every once in a while but when you have
a<00:03:16.820> band<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.300> almost<00:03:18.050> uses<00:03:18.709> no<00:03:18.890> sampling

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
a band that almost uses no sampling

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.590 
a band that almost uses no sampling
especially<00:03:19.610> in<00:03:19.700> today's<00:03:19.790> hip-hop<00:03:20.360> that's

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
especially in today's hip-hop that's

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.690 
especially in today's hip-hop that's
pretty<00:03:21.410> remarkable<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.310> top<00:03:22.519> of<00:03:22.550> the

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
pretty remarkable and on top of the

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.130 
pretty remarkable and on top of the
really<00:03:22.910> well-constructed<00:03:23.300> beats<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.870> seldom

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
really well-constructed beats the seldom

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.759 
really well-constructed beats the seldom

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
especially when you have a hip-hop album

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.260 
especially when you have a hip-hop album
with<00:05:16.650> so<00:05:16.919> many<00:05:17.039> guest<00:05:17.370> spots<00:05:17.580> this<00:05:17.970> album

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
beautiful beats with a great picture of

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.600 
beautiful beats with a great picture of
what<00:05:22.319> it's<00:05:22.470> like<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.710> grow<00:05:23.039> up<00:05:23.130> in<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:23.460> ghetto

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
what it's like to grow up in the ghetto

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.960 
what it's like to grow up in the ghetto
and<00:05:24.169> really<00:05:25.169> just<00:05:25.380> kind<00:05:26.190> of<00:05:26.220> let<00:05:26.460> it<00:05:26.580> overwhelm

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
and really just kind of let it overwhelm

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.760 
and really just kind of let it overwhelm
you<00:05:27.330> and<00:05:27.389> I<00:05:27.780> mean<00:05:28.050> being<00:05:28.259> someone<00:05:28.650> who

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
you and I mean being someone who

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.589 
you and I mean being someone who
literally<00:05:29.190> has<00:05:29.430> no<00:05:29.639> experience<00:05:29.970> with<00:05:30.270> that<00:05:30.479> it

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
literally has no experience with that it

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.060 
literally has no experience with that it
was<00:05:30.720> really<00:05:30.990> interesting<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.590> kind<00:05:31.740> of<00:05:31.830> delve

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
was really interesting to kind of delve

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.740 
was really interesting to kind of delve
into<00:05:32.220> that<00:05:32.310> lifestyle<00:05:32.909> the<00:05:33.210> only<00:05:33.389> problem

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
into that lifestyle the only problem

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.360 
into that lifestyle the only problem
with<00:05:33.810> this<00:05:33.990> album<00:05:34.289> is<00:05:34.409> that<00:05:34.440> I<00:05:34.530> really<00:05:35.190> wasn't

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
with this album is that I really wasn't

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.670 
with this album is that I really wasn't
a<00:05:35.520> fan<00:05:35.699> of<00:05:35.729> the<00:05:35.849> hooks<00:05:36.150> on<00:05:36.479> a<00:05:36.509> one<00:05:37.080> time<00:05:37.380> or<00:05:37.650> a

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
a fan of the hooks on a one time or a

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.140 
a fan of the hooks on a one time or a
lighthouse<00:05:38.130> on<00:05:38.400> one<00:05:38.580> time<00:05:38.699> I<00:05:38.759> feel<00:05:38.940> like<00:05:39.030> that

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
lighthouse on one time I feel like that

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.510 
lighthouse on one time I feel like that
guy<00:05:39.300> who's<00:05:39.449> totally<00:05:39.810> off-key<00:05:40.259> and<00:05:41.099> on

guy who's totally off-key and on
lighthouse<00:05:41.909> it's<00:05:42.150> just<00:05:42.330> really<00:05:42.509> obnoxious<00:05:43.110> I

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
lighthouse it's just really obnoxious I

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.779 
lighthouse it's just really obnoxious I
wasn't<00:05:43.500> a<00:05:43.530> fan<00:05:43.680> of<00:05:43.740> those<00:05:43.919> hooks<00:05:44.130> at<00:05:44.340> all<00:05:44.490> but

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
wasn't a fan of those hooks at all but

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.159 
wasn't a fan of those hooks at all but
still<00:05:45.030> without<00:05:45.210> those<00:05:45.539> hooks<00:05:45.810> and<00:05:45.960> even

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
still without those hooks and even

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.959 
still without those hooks and even
though<00:05:46.259> I<00:05:46.289> would<00:05:46.530> like<00:05:46.740> a<00:05:46.770> little<00:05:47.130> bit<00:05:47.280> more<00:05:47.759> of

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
though I would like a little bit more of
