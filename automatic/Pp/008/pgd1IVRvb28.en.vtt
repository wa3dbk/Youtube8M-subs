00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
been kind of doing this stuff but now

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.290 
been kind of doing this stuff but now
you<00:02:11.200> have<00:02:11.440> an<00:02:11.560> idea<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.830> what<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.430> it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
you have an idea of what it is and it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.490 
you have an idea of what it is and it
gives<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.570> stronger<00:02:13.930> foundation<00:02:14.110> to

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
gives you a stronger foundation to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.190 
gives you a stronger foundation to
actually<00:02:14.770> go<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.250> kind<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:15.660> expand<00:02:16.660> on<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.959> on

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
actually go and kind of expand on it on

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.810 
actually go and kind of expand on it on
the<00:02:17.380> flip<00:02:17.560> side<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.770> will<00:02:17.920> say<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.459> music

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
the flip side I will say that music

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.699 
the flip side I will say that music
school<00:02:19.000> has<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.450> cater<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.750> all<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.290> students

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
school has to cater to all the students

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.680 
school has to cater to all the students
like<00:02:20.920> attending<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.640> there's<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.360> bit<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.600> a

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
like attending so there's a bit of a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.479 
like attending so there's a bit of a
generalization<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:23.440> goes<00:02:23.680> into<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.130> I

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
generalization that goes into it so I

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.880 
generalization that goes into it so I
know<00:02:24.820> for<00:02:25.060> myself<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.510> had<00:02:25.690> some<00:02:25.989> issues<00:02:26.290> like

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
know for myself I had some issues like

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.580 
know for myself I had some issues like
fitting<00:02:27.310> into<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.790> actual<00:02:28.470> some<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.530> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
fitting into the actual some of the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.630 
fitting into the actual some of the
parts<00:02:29.799> of<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.920> curriculum<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.340> stuff<00:02:30.519> like

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
parts of the curriculum and stuff like

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.000 
parts of the curriculum and stuff like
that<00:02:30.850> but<00:02:31.420> if<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:32.200> are<00:02:32.230> having<00:02:32.590> issues<00:02:32.739> like
