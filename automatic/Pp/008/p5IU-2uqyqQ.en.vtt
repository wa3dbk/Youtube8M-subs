00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.670
 to the opel they continue with the names of 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.870
 families and this time it touches karl 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.550
 son of the adam he founded 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.480
 the company is given the name to most 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.490
 trendy of the opel 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.960
 this time, however, no snobbery because 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.020
 carlÃ  is a pragmatic car e 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.600
 rational practicality 5 doors 5 seats a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.070
 not huge but adequate trunk 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.510
 all accompanied by a pleasantness 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.099
 driving that has very little in common 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.750
 with the two generations of a gila that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.939
 they preceded it by carla si drint 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.560
 easy gives confidence in a moment e 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.000
 just a minimum of traffic to discover 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.350
 that agility that his ancestor is that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.820
 java already in the name 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.559
 thanks also to the new three-cylinder a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.969
 1000 made entirely of aluminum 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.010
 that renounces that supercharging 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.570
 that today is so fashionable with opel 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.280
 they serenely admit to having wanted 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.050
 focus more on simplicity 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.239
 constructive but this does not remove that 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.950
 however, there are 75 inside the bonnet 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.510
 horses well supported by a change 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.010
 with precise and well-defined grafts 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.809
 they are the right amount to be 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.640
 ripped off in traffic to deal with 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.289
 serenely traveling outside the city 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.879
 although the exchange has only five 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.949
 marches the engine's voice is never done 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.300
 to feel vehemently and in this first 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.739
 contact is also set 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.270
 seemed soft enough for 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.369
 absorb the typical disconnections of the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.560
 our cities inside considered the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.030
 type of car you immediately notice the effort 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.950
 to offer a pleasant ensemble from the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.720
 design point of view is realized 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.400
 with appreciable care 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.020
 no intrusion into luxury of course 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.880
 in this sense, therefore, they must not 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.340
 shock the slightly shiny plastics 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.229
 and rigid used for the bridge 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.580
 on the other hand the seats are well made there 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.890
 instrumentation is clear and clearly legible 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.509
 and more generally you never know the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.430
 feeling that the OPEL they went to 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.270
 saving without considering a small one 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.070
 theater hit 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.810
 in the center of the dashboard on the console 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.909
 a multimedia system stands out 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.900
 excellent level obviously reserved for 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.790
 more expensive versions 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.170
 it is an intel the last link 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.030
 generation that also includes the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.979
 presence of car play and android systems 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.420
 auto how to say perfect integration 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.420
 with the world of smartphones
