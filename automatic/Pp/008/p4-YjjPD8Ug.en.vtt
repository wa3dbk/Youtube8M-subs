that<00:02:15.719> very<00:02:16.019> very<00:02:16.230> few<00:02:16.349> fires<00:02:16.769> get<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.069> chance<00:02:17.310> to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
that very very few fires get a chance to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.270 
that very very few fires get a chance to
do<00:02:17.579> it's<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.209> fire<00:02:18.450> open<00:02:18.780> air
