the world cup and the group that awaits
the<00:00:25.140> u.s.<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.189> diamond<00:00:26.400> formation<00:00:26.939> the

the u.s. is the diamond formation the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.630 
the u.s. is the diamond formation the
way<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.539> go<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.560> me<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:28.890> not<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.400> it's

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
way to go for me it's not and it's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.370 
way to go for me it's not and it's
mostly<00:00:29.910> because<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.390> think<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.869> need<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.109> start

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
mostly because I think we need to start

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.959 
mostly because I think we need to start
with<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> more<00:00:31.800> defensive<00:00:32.340> posture<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.850> our

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
with a more defensive posture in our

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.639 
with a more defensive posture in our
midfield<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.540> for<00:00:34.020> me<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.140> would<00:00:34.440> require

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
midfield and for me that would require

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.889 
midfield and for me that would require
two<00:00:35.340> defensive<00:00:35.910> midfielders<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.719> being

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
two defensive midfielders and that being

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.780 
two defensive midfielders and that being
Michael<00:00:37.380> Bradley<00:00:37.590> tilting<00:00:38.219> him<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> little<00:00:38.670> bit

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
Michael Bradley tilting him a little bit

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.580 
Michael Bradley tilting him a little bit
deeper<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.870> whether<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.230> jermaine

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
deeper and then whether it's jermaine

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.830 
deeper and then whether it's jermaine
jones<00:00:40.829> or<00:00:41.040> Kyle<00:00:41.250> Beckerman<00:00:41.640> weather<00:00:42.480> than<00:00:42.719> you

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
jones or Kyle Beckerman weather than you

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.770 
jones or Kyle Beckerman weather than you
play<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> 4<00:00:43.379> 420<00:00:43.829> or<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:43.980> 231<00:00:44.730> our<00:00:45.120> semantics

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
play a 4 420 or for 231 our semantics

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.990 
play a 4 420 or for 231 our semantics
for<00:00:45.840> me<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.680> i<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:47.010> when<00:00:47.219> Michael<00:00:47.550> starts<00:00:47.910> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
for me but i like when Michael starts a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.520 
for me but i like when Michael starts a
little<00:00:48.210> bit<00:00:48.329> deeper<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.690> creates<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.289> better

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
little bit deeper and creates a better

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.350 
little bit deeper and creates a better
foundation<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.370> midfield<00:00:50.610> defensively

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
foundation in the midfield defensively

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
foundation in the midfield defensively
and<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:52.170> knowing<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.710> he<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.070> join<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
and then knowing that he can join in the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.279 
and then knowing that he can join in the
attack<00:00:53.670> when<00:00:54.090> he<00:00:54.239> sees<00:00:54.480> fit<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.930> uses

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
attack when he sees fit and uses

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.840 
attack when he sees fit and uses
mobility<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.980> that's<00:00:56.280> because<00:00:56.460> these

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
mobility and that's because these

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.479 
mobility and that's because these
opponents<00:00:57.180> are<00:00:57.620> tough<00:00:58.620> ones<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.070> not<00:00:59.160> you

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
opponents are tough ones and not you

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.889 
opponents are tough ones and not you
figure<00:00:59.940> they'll<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> possession<00:01:00.809> in

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
figure they'll have the possession in

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.660 
figure they'll have the possession in
these<00:01:00.989> games<00:01:01.140> yes<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.160> again<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:02.640> we

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
these games yes and I think again if we

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
these games yes and I think again if we
can<00:01:03.000> kind<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.300> sit<00:01:03.600> back<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.140> absorb<00:01:04.530> some<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
can kind of sit back and absorb some of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.830 
can kind of sit back and absorb some of
the<00:01:04.979> pressure<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:06.119> deal<00:01:06.360> well<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the pressure really deal well in the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.179 
the pressure really deal well in the
midfield<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.290> some<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> their<00:01:07.740> talented

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
midfield with some of their talented

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.550 
midfield with some of their talented
players<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.580> lot<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.970> these<00:01:09.030> teams<00:01:09.330> play<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> 433

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
players a lot of these teams play a 433

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560 
players a lot of these teams play a 433
and<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.610> center<00:01:12.060> attacking

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
and that that center attacking

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.969 
and that that center attacking
midfielder<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.170> all<00:01:13.320> these<00:01:13.470> teams<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
midfielder for all these teams in the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.800 
midfielder for all these teams in the
group<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.340> very<00:01:14.640> good<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.119> very<00:01:15.150> important

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
group is very good and very important

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.600 
group is very good and very important
and<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.500> need<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> make<00:01:16.890> sure<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.250> with

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
and so we need to make sure that with

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.310 
and so we need to make sure that with
with<00:01:17.939> Jermaine<00:01:18.330> Jones<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:18.810> Kyle<00:01:18.960> Beckerman

job of clogging the middle up closing
things<00:01:23.820> down<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.720> when<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:24.990> win<00:01:25.200> balls

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500

to be getting forward more and it

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.400 
to be getting forward more and it
oftentimes<00:02:24.820> will<00:02:25.210> require<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.690> midfielder

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
oftentimes will require the midfielder

to<00:02:30.280> go<00:02:30.460> and<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.300> then<00:02:31.630> that's<00:02:32.020> where<00:02:32.380> you

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
to go and and then that's where you

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.840 
to go and and then that's where you
really<00:02:32.770> get<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.040> attack<00:02:33.340> from<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.670> wing

really get the attack from the wing
which<00:02:34.150> may<00:02:34.390> actually<00:02:34.570> require<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.260> outside

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
which may actually require the outside

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.200 
which may actually require the outside
midfielder<00:02:35.710> to<00:02:36.070> have<00:02:36.220> more<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:37.030> defensive

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
role in the shape and then the last

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.790 
role in the shape and then the last
thing<00:02:39.820> is<00:02:39.970> Jermaine<00:02:40.840> Jones<00:02:41.080> or<00:02:41.500> Kyle

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
thing is Jermaine Jones or Kyle
