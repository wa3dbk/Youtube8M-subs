use that later moving to the top of the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.139 
use that later moving to the top of the
machine<00:00:36.739> you'll<00:00:37.739> see<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.340> calcium<00:00:38.850> port

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
machine you'll see the calcium port

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.840 
machine you'll see the calcium port
where<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.260> add<00:00:40.440> extra<00:00:41.040> calcium<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.700> you

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
where you can add extra calcium if you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.110 
where you can add extra calcium if you
desire<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.739> another<00:00:43.739> port<00:00:44.129> where<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.910> will

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
desire and another port where we will

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.750 
desire and another port where we will
attach<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.899> flexible<00:00:46.710> drinking<00:00:47.160> water<00:00:47.340> spout

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
attach the flexible drinking water spout

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.810 
attach the flexible drinking water spout
let's<00:00:48.390> take<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.660> minute<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:52.820> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
let's take a minute and do that now the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.119 
let's take a minute and do that now the
spout<00:00:54.120> will<00:00:54.329> come<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.690> plastic<00:00:54.899> bag<00:00:55.410> let's

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
spout will come in a plastic bag let's

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.189 
spout will come in a plastic bag let's
take<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> minute<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.910> remove<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> from<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> bag

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
take a minute and remove it from the bag

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.900 
take a minute and remove it from the bag
you'll<00:01:01.199> notice<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.949> end<00:01:02.160> has<00:01:02.489> threads

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
you'll notice that one end has threads

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.200 
you'll notice that one end has threads
on<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.650> we<00:01:04.650> simply<00:01:05.070> thread<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.610> into<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
on it and we simply thread that into the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.690 
on it and we simply thread that into the
port<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.200> top<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.740> Machine<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:10.700> then

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
port at the top of the Machine and then

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.240 
port at the top of the Machine and then
tighten<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.780> don't<00:01:12.990> over<00:01:13.260> tighten<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.710> just

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
tighten but don't over tighten it just

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.010 
tighten but don't over tighten it just
hand<00:01:14.520> tight<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.909> good<00:01:15.090> enough<00:01:19.939> on<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.840> back

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
hand tight it's good enough on the back

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.560 
hand tight it's good enough on the back
of<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.320> machine<00:01:22.680> at<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.850> top<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.420> a
