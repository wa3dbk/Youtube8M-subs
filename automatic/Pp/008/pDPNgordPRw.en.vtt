00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
right on the wagon wheels let's see how

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.980 
right on the wagon wheels let's see how
we<00:00:25.140> go<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.500> rundown<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:28.230> Norco<00:00:28.619> range

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
we go to a rundown so the Norco range

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.470 
we go to a rundown so the Norco range
just<00:00:30.990> got<00:00:31.140> back<00:00:31.320> from<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.590> ride

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
just got back from a ride

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.130 
just got back from a ride
got<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> pinchy<00:00:34.070> second<00:00:35.070> lap<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.719> was<00:00:36.870> pretty

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
got a pinchy second lap and I was pretty

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.680 
got a pinchy second lap and I was pretty
disappointed<00:00:37.260> that's<00:00:38.329> that's<00:00:39.329> why<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> don't

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
disappointed that's that's why I don't

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.740 
disappointed that's that's why I don't
put<00:00:39.809> tubes<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.230> these<00:00:40.410> things<00:00:41.930> although<00:00:42.930> map

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
put tubes in these things although map

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.310 
put tubes in these things although map
what<00:00:45.750> I'm<00:00:45.870> used<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.620> running<00:00:48.320> suspension

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
what I'm used to is running suspension

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.650 
what I'm used to is running suspension
fairly<00:00:49.770> firm<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.520> stays<00:00:50.910> efficient<00:00:51.449> but

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
fairly firm so it stays efficient but

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.090 
fairly firm so it stays efficient but
it's<00:00:52.469> new<00:00:52.649> stuff<00:00:53.270> you<00:00:54.270> gotta<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> run<00:00:54.930> up

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
it's new stuff you gotta kind of run up

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.979 
it's new stuff you gotta kind of run up
with<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> little<00:00:56.340> bit<00:00:56.430> more<00:00:56.579> sag<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.210> run<00:00:57.719> about

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
with a little bit more sag and run about

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.569 
with a little bit more sag and run about
35%<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> rear<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.859> felt<00:01:01.859> really

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
35% in the rear and that felt really

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.399 
35% in the rear and that felt really
good<00:01:02.789> could<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.329> maybe<00:01:03.600> even<00:01:03.719> gone<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> little

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
good could have maybe even gone a little

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.730 
good could have maybe even gone a little
bit<00:01:04.739> softer<00:01:05.540> it<00:01:06.540> was<00:01:06.659> pretty<00:01:06.869> precise<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
bit softer it was pretty precise and the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.910 
bit softer it was pretty precise and the
front<00:01:09.229> I've<00:01:10.229> got<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.470> 75<00:01:11.400> psi<00:01:12.270> 70<00:01:13.140> psi<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.560> think

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
front I've got at 75 psi 70 psi I think

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.399 
front I've got at 75 psi 70 psi I think
and<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.549> probably<00:01:14.700> hear<00:01:14.939> 70<00:01:15.299> psi<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.960> could

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and can probably hear 70 psi I could

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.749 
and can probably hear 70 psi I could
probably<00:01:16.560> drop<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.950> down<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.840> 66<00:01:18.840> 67<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.830> get

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
probably drop that down to 66 67 and get

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.330 
probably drop that down to 66 67 and get
a<00:01:20.790> bit<00:01:20.939> more<00:01:21.350> bit<00:01:22.350> more<00:01:22.500> plushness<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> bit

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
a bit more bit more plushness and a bit

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.670 
a bit more bit more plushness and a bit
more<00:01:23.520> performance<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:26.299> overall

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
more performance out of it overall

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.490 
more performance out of it overall
yeah<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.579> far<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.650> weapon<00:01:31.799> Hey

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
yeah just far out it's a weapon Hey

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.980 
yeah just far out it's a weapon Hey
she<00:01:34.500> goes<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:34.920> us<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.310> um<00:01:35.720> takes<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> bit<00:01:36.900> to

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
she goes for us it's um takes a bit to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.010 
she goes for us it's um takes a bit to
get<00:01:37.079> used<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> bigger<00:01:37.650> wheels<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:39.020> once

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
get used to the bigger wheels but once

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.100 
get used to the bigger wheels but once
you've<00:01:40.170> done<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.860> lap<00:01:41.040> or<00:01:41.250> two<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.110> you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you've done a lap or two on on you you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.630 
you've done a lap or two on on you you
definitely<00:01:43.470> realize<00:01:43.740> how<00:01:43.890> fast<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.369> go

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
definitely realize how fast they can go

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.460 
definitely realize how fast they can go
and<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.420> pump<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.930> everything<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and they just pump out of everything and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.440 
and they just pump out of everything and
carry<00:01:47.159> speed<00:01:47.430> everywhere<00:01:47.880> once<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.180> start

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
carry speed everywhere once you start

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.280 
carry speed everywhere once you start
moving<00:01:48.840> these<00:01:49.439> things<00:01:49.500> fly<00:01:51.049> here<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> back

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
moving these things fly here the back

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.249 
moving these things fly here the back
end<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.740> these<00:01:52.970> these<00:01:53.970> things<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.329> buttery<00:01:54.689> and

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
end of these these things is buttery and

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.649 
end of these these things is buttery and
I<00:01:55.290> once<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.590> got<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.119> suspension<00:01:57.119> doing<00:01:57.479> what<00:01:57.630> I

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
I once I got the suspension doing what I

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.770 
I once I got the suspension doing what I
wanted<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.259> us<00:01:59.180> which<00:02:00.180> was<00:02:00.360> more<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:00.659> less<00:02:00.689> just

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
wanted to us which was more or less just

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.789 
wanted to us which was more or less just
pressure<00:02:01.759> yeah<00:02:02.759> really<00:02:03.090> really<00:02:03.649> absorb<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
pressure yeah really really absorb the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.520 
pressure yeah really really absorb the
bumps<00:02:05.689> much<00:02:06.689> better<00:02:06.960> than<00:02:07.140> anything<00:02:07.290> I've

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
bumps much better than anything I've

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.790 
bumps much better than anything I've
ridden<00:02:07.710> before<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.520> was<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> -<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.810> the
