00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
refiguring job on this 12 inch f5 mirror

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.759 
refiguring job on this 12 inch f5 mirror
and<00:00:11.389> before<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.420> start<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.870> need<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.290> strip<00:00:13.620> off

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
the coating it's already been aluminized

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.660 
the coating it's already been aluminized
and<00:00:15.750> everything<00:00:16.080> but<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:17.160> figure<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.580> this

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
and everything but the figure on this

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.250 
and everything but the figure on this
mirror<00:00:17.880> isn't<00:00:18.060> any<00:00:18.210> good<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> owner<00:00:18.930> wants

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
mirror isn't any good so the owner wants

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.830 
mirror isn't any good so the owner wants
it<00:00:19.350> rebuilt<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.880> we're<00:00:21.390> going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.570> strip<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
it rebuilt so we're going to strip the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.900 
it rebuilt so we're going to strip the
coating<00:00:22.109> today<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:23.130> has<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> little<00:00:23.519> centered

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
coating today this has a little centered

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.870 
coating today this has a little centered
spotting<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.140> there<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.560> little<00:00:26.340> ring<00:00:26.609> so

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
spotting on it there a little ring so

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.839 
spotting on it there a little ring so
I'm<00:00:26.970> going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.119> peel<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.539> guy<00:00:27.660> off<00:00:27.900> first<00:00:28.849> so

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
I'm going to peel that guy off first so

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.220 
I'm going to peel that guy off first so
the<00:00:29.970> ring<00:00:30.119> comes<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.750> always<00:00:30.900> leaves

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the ring comes up it always leaves

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.120 
the ring comes up it always leaves
behind<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.710> residue<00:00:33.410> so<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.649> use<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> little

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
behind a residue so I just use a little

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.270 
behind a residue so I just use a little
dab<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.750> acetone<00:00:39.649> pull<00:00:40.649> up<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.920> little<00:00:41.070> bit

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
dab of acetone pull up that little bit

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.630 
dab of acetone pull up that little bit
of<00:00:41.309> residue<00:00:43.250> it's<00:00:44.250> all<00:00:44.430> good

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.460 

okay<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.360> chemical<00:00:51.780> I'm<00:00:51.840> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.080> use<00:00:52.230> for

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
okay the chemical I'm going to use for

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.430 
okay the chemical I'm going to use for
this<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:53.040> do<00:00:53.130> the<00:00:53.250> chemical<00:00:53.520> stripping<00:00:54.000> is

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
this to do the chemical stripping is

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.380 
this to do the chemical stripping is
ferric<00:00:55.440> chloride<00:00:55.470> and<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.760> comes<00:00:56.970> in<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.150> form

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
ferric chloride and it comes in the form

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.530 
ferric chloride and it comes in the form
of<00:00:57.570> what's<00:00:57.780> called<00:00:57.960> Etzel<00:00:58.770> ushion<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.540> this

use it over and over so when I'm done

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
use it over and over so when I'm done
stripping<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.680> mirror<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.100> reclaim<00:01:14.910> it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
stripping this mirror I just reclaim it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.000 
stripping this mirror I just reclaim it
put<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.300> right<00:01:15.330> back<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> bottle<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.290> it's

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
put it right back in the bottle and it's

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.030 
put it right back in the bottle and it's
ready<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.490> another<00:01:17.700> mirror<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.680> tiniest

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
ready to do another mirror the tiniest

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.719 
ready to do another mirror the tiniest
way<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.330> use<00:01:21.600> tape<00:01:22.729> run

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
way to do this is to just use tape run

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.070 
way to do this is to just use tape run
it<00:01:23.850> around<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.150> outside<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.780> mirror<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it around the outside of the mirror and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:42.730 
it around the outside of the mirror and
make<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> damn

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.650 

just<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:43.980> easy<00:01:44.160> as<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.370> going<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.300> with<00:01:45.540> my

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
just as easy as that going on with my

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.920 
just as easy as that going on with my
hands<00:01:45.840> make<00:01:46.200> sure<00:01:46.230> we<00:01:46.500> don't<00:01:46.620> have<00:01:46.830> any<00:01:47.930> holes

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
hands make sure we don't have any holes

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.490 
hands make sure we don't have any holes
in<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.380> side<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:54.420> that's<00:01:54.810> pretty<00:01:55.050> much<00:01:55.260> ready

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
in the side and that's pretty much ready

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.870 
in the side and that's pretty much ready
to<00:01:55.590> go<00:01:56.690> now<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.890> one<00:01:58.890> deal<00:01:59.160> with<00:01:59.370> this<00:01:59.490> exit

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
to go now the one deal with this exit

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.500 
to go now the one deal with this exit
solution<00:02:00.300> it<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.620> is<00:02:02.010> a<00:02:02.070> bright<00:02:02.850> orange<00:02:03.450> color

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
solution it it is a bright orange color

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.870 
solution it it is a bright orange color
and<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.350> will<00:02:04.440> stain<00:02:04.800> anything<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.700> gets

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and it will stain anything that it gets

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.810 
and it will stain anything that it gets
on<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.380> put<00:02:07.680> down<00:02:07.800> lots<00:02:08.040> of<00:02:08.190> newspapers

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
on so I put down lots of newspapers

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.210 
on so I put down lots of newspapers
always<00:02:09.360> when<00:02:09.810> I'm<00:02:09.929> doing<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> job<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.190> this

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
always when I'm doing a job like this

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.680 
always when I'm doing a job like this
and<00:02:12.560> try<00:02:13.560> not<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.830> get<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.490> any<00:02:15.390> place<00:02:15.660> that

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and try not to get it to any place that

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.310 
and try not to get it to any place that
shouldn't<00:02:16.200> be<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:18.000> basically<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.810> pour<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
shouldn't be so basically you pour the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.580 
shouldn't be so basically you pour the
etchant<00:02:19.709> solution<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.850> mirror<00:02:24.500> takes<00:02:25.500> an

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
etchant solution on the mirror takes an

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.830 
etchant solution on the mirror takes an
amazing<00:02:26.340> amount<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.670> solution<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.390> fill<00:02:27.600> up<00:02:27.720> a

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
amazing amount of solution to fill up a

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.240 
amazing amount of solution to fill up a
mirror<00:02:28.850> always<00:02:29.850> surprises<00:02:30.540> me<00:02:30.570> how<00:02:30.720> much<00:02:31.250> this

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
mirror always surprises me how much this

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.580 
mirror always surprises me how much this
is<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.459> 16<00:02:33.209> ounce<00:02:33.360> bottle<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:33.959> it's<00:02:34.320> going<00:02:34.530> to

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
is a 16 ounce bottle and it's going to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.690 
is a 16 ounce bottle and it's going to
take<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.890> whole<00:02:35.040> thing

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.949 

save<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.940> container<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.360> course<00:02:39.570> we're<00:02:39.840> going

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
save the container of course we're going

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.949 
save the container of course we're going
to<00:02:40.019> pour<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.290> back<00:02:40.320> in<00:02:40.560> there<00:02:40.680> later<00:02:41.630> now<00:02:42.630> it

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
to pour it back in there later now it

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.070 
to pour it back in there later now it
depends<00:02:43.620> on<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.370> quality<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.300> thickness<00:02:45.959> of

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
depends on the quality and thickness of

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.080 
depends on the quality and thickness of
the<00:02:46.140> coating<00:02:46.350> how<00:02:47.070> long<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.459> will<00:02:47.580> take<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
the coating how long it will take the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.460 
the coating how long it will take the
solution<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.900> eat<00:02:49.080> away<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.650> aluminum<00:02:50.280> and

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
solution to eat away the aluminum and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.259 
solution to eat away the aluminum and
with<00:02:52.470> some<00:02:52.920> coatings<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:53.790> nearly

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
with some coatings it's nearly

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.630 
with some coatings it's nearly
instantaneous<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.680> with<00:02:55.920> some<00:02:56.130> coatings<00:02:56.489> it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
instantaneous and with some coatings it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.820 
instantaneous and with some coatings it
takes<00:02:56.850> overnight<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:58.049> you<00:02:58.110> never<00:02:58.530> know<00:02:58.709> what

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
takes overnight so you never know what

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.370 
takes overnight so you never know what
you're<00:02:58.950> going<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.100> get<00:02:59.280> until<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.420> try<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.720> so

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
you're going to get until you try it so

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.190 
you're going to get until you try it so
I'm<00:03:01.530> going<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:01.830> just<00:03:02.010> leave<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.310> here<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:03.200> it's

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
I'm going to just leave it here and it's

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.660 
I'm going to just leave it here and it's
late<00:03:04.530> at<00:03:04.560> night<00:03:04.739> right<00:03:05.070> now<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:05.400> I'm<00:03:05.489> probably

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
late at night right now so I'm probably

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.800 
late at night right now so I'm probably
just<00:03:05.790> going<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.090> leave<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.299> overnight<00:03:06.510> come

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
just going to leave it overnight come

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.420 
just going to leave it overnight come
back<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.170> morning<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.590> see<00:03:08.220> what's

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
back in the morning and see what's

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.259 
back in the morning and see what's
happened<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.750> stuff<00:03:09.989> isn't<00:03:10.280> evil<00:03:11.310> in

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
happened the stuff isn't evil in

so<00:03:44.430> that's<00:03:44.519> all<00:03:44.760> set<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.030> go<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.389> we'll<00:03:45.540> leave

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
so that's all set to go and we'll leave

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.650 
so that's all set to go and we'll leave
it<00:03:45.780> overnight<00:03:45.989> we'll<00:03:46.290> take

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
it overnight we'll take

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.340 
it overnight we'll take
get<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.930> in<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:47.080> morning<00:03:51.810> well<00:03:52.810> I<00:03:52.840> checked<00:03:53.140> the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
get it in the morning well I checked the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.590 
get it in the morning well I checked the
mirror<00:03:53.650> after<00:03:53.830> two<00:03:54.490> hours<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:55.060> in<00:03:55.420> two<00:03:55.540> hours

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
mirror after two hours and in two hours

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
mirror after two hours and in two hours
it<00:03:55.990> was<00:03:56.080> clear<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:57.790> pretty<00:03:58.600> quick<00:03:58.810> take<00:03:59.410> very

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
it was clear so pretty quick take very

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.650 
it was clear so pretty quick take very
long<00:03:59.770> now<00:04:00.460> it's<00:04:00.610> time<00:04:00.820> to<00:04:00.850> clean<00:04:01.390> up<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.540> mess

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
long now it's time to clean up the mess

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.410 
long now it's time to clean up the mess
now<00:04:02.560> again<00:04:02.800> we<00:04:02.920> want<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.220> salvage<00:04:03.640> well<00:04:04.180> and

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
now again we want to salvage well and

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.160 
now again we want to salvage well and
recover<00:04:04.780> all<00:04:05.020> of<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.440> liquid<00:04:05.800> so<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:06.730> have<00:04:07.120> a

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
recover all of the liquid so I have a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.750 
recover all of the liquid so I have a
black<00:04:08.170> plastic<00:04:08.650> container<00:04:09.010> here<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.520> I'm

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
black plastic container here that I'm

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.400 
black plastic container here that I'm
going<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.150> just<00:04:10.330> pick<00:04:10.570> this<00:04:10.720> up<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.110> pour<00:04:11.350> it

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
going to just pick this up and pour it

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.370 
going to just pick this up and pour it
right<00:04:11.530> in<00:04:11.710> there<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:13.510> only<00:04:13.630> trick<00:04:13.960> is<00:04:13.990> you

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
right in there and the only trick is you

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:29.400 
right in there and the only trick is you
have<00:04:14.410> to<00:04:14.800> not<00:04:15.310> spill<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.320> not<00:04:17.320> make<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:17.590> mess

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.090 

hard<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.280> get<00:04:30.430> it<00:04:30.520> up<00:04:30.640> it's<00:04:30.910> kind<00:04:31.120> of<00:04:31.240> heavy

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
hard to get it up it's kind of heavy

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:42.980 
hard to get it up it's kind of heavy
okay<00:04:35.460> here<00:04:36.460> we<00:04:36.670> go

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.770 

okay<00:04:43.990> now<00:04:44.200> that<00:04:44.380> will<00:04:44.530> just<00:04:44.710> go<00:04:45.540> right<00:04:46.540> back

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
okay now that will just go right back

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.120 
okay now that will just go right back
into<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:48.990> container<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.710> use<00:04:50.890> it<00:04:51.010> on<00:04:51.070> another

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
into the container and use it on another

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.510 
into the container and use it on another
mirror<00:04:51.610> now<00:04:52.420> resist<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.380> temptation<00:04:53.890> to<00:04:54.070> just

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
mirror now resist the temptation to just

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.510 
mirror now resist the temptation to just
rinse<00:04:54.880> this<00:04:55.120> off<00:04:55.330> with<00:04:56.260> water<00:04:56.500> and<00:04:56.770> run<00:04:57.370> it

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
rinse this off with water and run it

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.050 
rinse this off with water and run it
down<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.670> drain<00:04:57.970> because<00:04:58.920> even<00:04:59.920> diluted<00:05:00.820> this

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
down the drain because even diluted this

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.670 
down the drain because even diluted this
can<00:05:01.300> ruin<00:05:02.080> a<00:05:02.850> lot<00:05:03.850> of<00:05:04.000> things<00:05:04.420> so<00:05:05.110> what<00:05:05.380> you<00:05:05.500> use

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
can ruin a lot of things so what you use

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.380 
can ruin a lot of things so what you use
is<00:05:06.270> bicarb<00:05:07.320> or<00:05:08.320> baking<00:05:09.070> soda<00:05:09.100> which<00:05:10.090> is<00:05:10.240> of

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
is bicarb or baking soda which is of

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.300 
is bicarb or baking soda which is of
course<00:05:10.540> a<00:05:10.660> base<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.290> we're<00:05:11.830> going<00:05:11.980> to<00:05:12.040> use<00:05:12.160> it

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
course a base and we're going to use it

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.870 
course a base and we're going to use it
to<00:05:12.840> neutralize<00:05:13.840> our<00:05:14.050> acid<00:05:14.500> so<00:05:15.490> I've<00:05:15.580> just<00:05:15.610> got

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
to neutralize our acid so I've just got

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.780 
to neutralize our acid so I've just got
some<00:05:16.150> water<00:05:16.330> here<00:05:17.220> eat<00:05:18.220> about<00:05:19.950> 16<00:05:20.950> 20<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:21.400> 24
