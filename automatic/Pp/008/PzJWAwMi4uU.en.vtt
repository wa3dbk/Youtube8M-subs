00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.189
 Friday 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.359
 good so why back to basics so good in reality this call 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.759
 for six fields on all albums is that there are solo albums 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.880
 but on what happened something interesting to say when I 

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:30.659
 finished the previous album 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.359
 but I did not necessarily have the idea of ​​what I was going to do thereafter 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.440
 hurt the pieces that I composed 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.999
 who gave me verses in this direction it's a very vigilant album 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:45.400
 as I have a lot of pikine compositions I thought 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.120
 somewhere I told myself it reminded me of my very first cdd I did 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.999
 ten years ago 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:51.650
 who was called pikine in fact 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.820
 and I finally wanted to do a little bit the same 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.120
 the removal of this album 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.660
 but ten years later 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.320
 e release a solo album 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.520
 as with pieces very quickly because that's the truth 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.880
 alas but with ten years that passed between the two 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.170
 and finally an album which seems to me more coherent compared to the others 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.370
 I sometimes tend to be explained by three pieces of jazz musette 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.969
 art is still in a direction to her fans that she also contributes 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.359
 why this album now while I released his guitar a year ago 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.140
 what always made me dig a pool in the garden and 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.960
 when I needed a few times where I thought 'why would you 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.040
 not an album 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.040
 it would still raise funds 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.080
 this is the reality for me it's an intermediate album yesterday it's 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.910
 the album that allowed me to return 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.490
 I am later single 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.979
 dissatisfied conceded that we look at it we realize that there is an upgrade 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.110
 care 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.220
 there are there renault trucks that pronounce the old pumps for that 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.690
 I will record 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.220
 in this sector actually in seven times the language has chosen a little margin 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.210
 we want to tend 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.490
 and suddenly it forced me to save some pieces of the margin 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 it may be a year before with left bank 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.830
 jimmy like this new to train 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.110
 for me it was not really after album in the sense that 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:14.139
 I consider after it was against abortion the original compo 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.230
 and to those recorded but these pieces me it's not something that 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:18.959
 me 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.719
 which fascinates me particularly well that I saw the surround effect this 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.229
 album with our tree on the white road 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:26.779
 you master a little bit 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.389
 the reworked compared to the original version 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:34.519
 and so she did not really want to redo it's an album with coupons% it's 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.849
 something that is much more interesting 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.479
 contactless payment service offered their services for that 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.610
 twenty-nine other seniors 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.189
 I was not satisfied 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.010
 so I'm not in this optics here working on the washing of 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.379
 pieces that came one after the other and that was when 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.529
 even very picking 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:53.949
 finally 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.969
 short it is not that on the one hand I would have to do a little bit of that 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.799
 and I realized to serve them to eat even worse than before 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.819
 so I thought maybe it was a way of saying that 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.569
 in this register there I still have things to say that still have things 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.679
 to say 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:10.660
 and 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.660
 the member bonette I made myself happy because good 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.989
 I'm not in the situation where I sell millions of albums with 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.739
 marketing plans so 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.899
 it allows to do a little bit what I want 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.859
 in this album here it is said patrick king 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.619
 really kind of a homecoming 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:30.769
 I decided to apply the pool so what happened is it's 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:31.649
 past 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.869
 privately so he lived 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.389
 and that it is pretty much the technique 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.359
 in various style 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.400
 but will also be imperative provocative side the pool ebita margin all 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:47.399
 simply because I'm still able to see that 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:50.959
 for many people saying 'here I am doing the gym mat a 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.959
 naive side is not serious about his picking guitar 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.389
 on this side a little 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.259
 not sure when I say not serious but 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:02.579
 haiti it's a bit a little outdated 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.689
 the mag team that leads to stay quite often besides elsewhere 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.559
 it's crises like manchester 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.509
 banks in europe on guitar picking socially 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.719
 a provocative part saying well here yes I do guitar picking m 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.299
 speaking alger ie a shakhtar 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.599
 but at the same time 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.999
 for me it's a false problem, that is, it's just a way 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:28.169
 to play 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.559
 and after we can in the music we can put ourselves what we want 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:33.590
 but the person who will listen to that 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.510
 if the song he likes bass and guitar picking it's a bit like me 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.909
 all the tests they are like that its so-called version of golf qg blues 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.830
 the blues is still to follow 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.999
 the cam quite vast 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:48.180
 certainly between robert johnson and 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.220
 he is considered to watch us die anyway 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.720
 all that and that's still very painful 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.490
 but finally it was the same for the ranking 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.720
 here and then the guide of tardis time finally it's also a way 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.949
 two somewhere 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.300
 but it's an explosimeter to say that's it 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.560
 myself I know what I'm doing I present to you today we'll let go of 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.680
 picking guitar 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.430
 so obviously people they tend to believe cataloged by saying 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.469
 here 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.650
 but this team in Buckingham is as if but it's like that 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.750
 but in reality it's a fake problem because people who 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.979
 come to my post but kept his well on the contrary 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.069
 ban I did a lot of things different rooms of the museum brent 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.139
 glass going through the classic 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.270
 but after 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.050
 I find that it is of course years had presented itself as its one a 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.520
 true themes 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.620
 it's a bit of everything I did 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.900
 its first cd dvd and cd at 7% the bridge between the two 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.370
 the future will tell us what will come next perhaps an album of 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.839
 medieval taxpayers 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:49.629
 the name of the merge zone 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:50.280
 to be continued
