00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 I made a bad habit of underestimating you. 

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:11.001
 Every obstacle you face ... 

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:14.902
 ... now I know that you can overcome it. 

00:00:18.903 --> 00:00:19.903
 He does not expect you to see him so ... 

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:21.704
 you. 

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:24.105
 My time as a human is over ... 

00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:26.506
 ... but I never felt so alive. 

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:30.007
 I thought we were going to be safe forever ... 

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:33.108
 ... but forever is not as long as I expected. 

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:35.309
 I must report a crime ... 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.610
 ... The cullen have done something ... 

00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:39.611
 frightening. 

00:00:39.612 --> 00:00:41.612
 The Vulturi think that Renesmee is an immortal girl. 

00:00:41.613 --> 00:00:44.013
 She was born, she was not bitten, she grows more every day. 

00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:49.014
 Creating an immortal child is forbidden by law ... 

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:51.615
 and is sanctioned with the hardest punishments ... 

00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:53.816
 ...death. 

00:00:55.617 --> 00:00:56.717
 What's up, Alice? 

00:00:56.718 --> 00:00:58.118
 The Vulturi ... 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:59.119
 ... they come for us. 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.576
 If enough people know the truth ... 

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:04.321
 ... maybe we can get Los Vulturi to listen to us. 

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:07.922
 Our search for vampires must start in the most remote places in the world. 

00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:10.623
 My family is in danger, I need your help. 

00:01:11.824 --> 00:01:13.824
 Each with their own gifts. 

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:19.825
 You are... 

00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:21.026
 an amazing woman 

00:01:23.427 --> 00:01:25.027
 We will be with you. 

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:27.928
 It's time to fight. 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.329
 We have never feared vampires. 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.030
 Every moment ... 

00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:44.631
 ... has taken us here 

00:01:44.632 --> 00:01:46.932
 I will never let them hurt you. 

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:48.133
 THIS YEAR 

00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:52.034
 THE FINAL EPIC 

00:01:55.935 --> 00:01:56.735
 WHAT WILL LIVE FOREVER 

00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:05.736
 The Twilight Saga Dawn Part 2 

00:02:06.337 --> 00:02:10.037
