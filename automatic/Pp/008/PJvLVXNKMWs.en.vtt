those in the bottom like so not really

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.690 
those in the bottom like so not really
eating<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.450> couldn't<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:27.750> easier<00:01:28.490> now<00:01:29.490> just

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
eating so it couldn't be easier now just

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.140 
eating so it couldn't be easier now just
cover<00:01:30.000> those<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.450> about<00:01:30.600> another<00:01:32.030> three<00:01:33.030> or

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.020 

then<00:01:37.729> ease<00:01:37.909> it<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.509> I'll<00:01:38.630> leave<00:01:38.750> loss<00:01:40.030> that's

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
then ease it and I'll leave loss that's

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.469 
then ease it and I'll leave loss that's
what<00:01:41.360> I've<00:01:41.450> got<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:43.789> make<00:01:43.939> them<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.119> bit<00:01:44.270> warm

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
what I've got to make them a bit warm

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.819 
what I've got to make them a bit warm
because<00:01:44.719> it's<00:01:44.840> still<00:01:44.990> cold<00:01:45.200> this<00:01:45.409> time<00:01:45.649> here

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
because it's still cold this time here

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.429 
because it's still cold this time here
obviously<00:01:46.189> I'm<00:01:46.549> going<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:46.700> add<00:01:46.820> some<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.270> bit<00:01:48.259> of

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
obviously I'm going to add some a bit of

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.319 
obviously I'm going to add some a bit of
bubble<00:01:48.860> wrap<00:01:48.890> over<00:01:49.219> the<00:01:49.310> top<00:01:49.399> because<00:01:50.240> I've

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
bubble wrap over the top because I've

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.819 
bubble wrap over the top because I've
got<00:01:50.450> black<00:01:50.659> pops<00:01:50.990> they'll<00:01:51.200> absorb<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.649> heat

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
got black pops they'll absorb the heat

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.249 
got black pops they'll absorb the heat
more<00:01:52.329> so<00:01:53.329> it<00:01:53.420> should<00:01:53.600> warm<00:01:53.810> up<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:54.200> should

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
more so it should warm up and it should

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.109 
more so it should warm up and it should
get<00:01:54.439> them<00:01:54.560> going<00:01:54.710> quicker<00:01:55.039> but<00:01:55.250> obviously

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
get them going quicker but obviously

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.240 
get them going quicker but obviously
putting<00:01:56.299> a<00:01:56.390> bit<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.829> bubble<00:01:57.829> wrap<00:01:57.860> over<00:01:58.130> the

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
putting a bit of bubble wrap over the

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.190 
putting a bit of bubble wrap over the
top<00:01:58.340> also<00:01:58.729> keeps<00:01:59.090> heating<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.569> nice<00:01:59.719> you<00:02:00.110> know

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
top also keeps heating it nice you know

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.830 
top also keeps heating it nice you know
a<00:02:00.229> little<00:02:00.439> bit<00:02:00.619> more<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.100> just<00:02:01.689> keeping<00:02:02.689> a<00:02:02.719> bit

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
a little bit more so just keeping a bit

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.529 
a little bit more so just keeping a bit
warmer<00:02:03.259> and<00:02:03.469> hopefully<00:02:04.119> in<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.210> couple<00:02:05.240> of

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
warmer and hopefully in a couple of

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.179 
warmer and hopefully in a couple of
weeks<00:02:05.689> it<00:02:05.810> should<00:02:05.840> start<00:02:06.229> sprouting<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.069> then

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
weeks it should start sprouting and then

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.589 
weeks it should start sprouting and then
what<00:02:07.310> I'll<00:02:07.399> do<00:02:07.579> is<00:02:07.640> what's<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.090> shoot<00:02:08.330> start

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
what I'll do is what's the shoot start

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.910 
what I'll do is what's the shoot start
to<00:02:08.720> grow<00:02:08.899> when<00:02:09.110> they<00:02:09.200> get<00:02:09.349> to<00:02:09.440> about<00:02:09.530> four

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
to grow when they get to about four

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.070 
to grow when they get to about four
inches<00:02:10.220> above<00:02:10.369> I'll<00:02:11.180> just<00:02:11.360> keep<00:02:11.540> topping<00:02:11.959> up

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
inches above I'll just keep topping up

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.300 
inches above I'll just keep topping up
so<00:02:12.290> just<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.560> tops<00:02:12.799> of<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.980> leaves<00:02:13.190> are

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
so just the tops of the leaves are

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.460 
so just the tops of the leaves are
sticking<00:02:13.610> out<00:02:13.750> just<00:02:14.750> keep<00:02:14.930> doing<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.319> as

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
sticking out just keep doing that as

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.900 
sticking out just keep doing that as
they<00:02:15.560> grow<00:02:15.769> up<00:02:15.799> just<00:02:16.130> keep<00:02:16.220> topping<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.670> pot

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
they grow up just keep topping the pot

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.270 
they grow up just keep topping the pot
with<00:02:17.090> more<00:02:17.209> comp<00:02:17.480> us<00:02:17.690> until<00:02:18.170> we<00:02:18.650> compost<00:02:19.040> gets

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
with more comp us until we compost gets

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.660 
with more comp us until we compost gets
the<00:02:19.400> top<00:02:19.579> of<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.760> pot<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.329> hopefully<00:02:21.459> rock<00:02:22.459> it

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
the top of the pot and hopefully rock it

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.069 
the top of the pot and hopefully rock it
you<00:02:22.700> can<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.299> can<00:02:23.480> do<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:23.930> can

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
you can you you can do it and you can

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.640 
you can you you can do it and you can
get<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.260> spot<00:02:24.530> out<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.799> rocket<00:02:25.190> in<00:02:25.340> about

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
get a spot out of a rocket in about

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.440 
get a spot out of a rocket in about
anything<00:02:27.650> for<00:02:27.890> about<00:02:28.010> 70<00:02:28.579> days<00:02:28.790> sort<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.209> ten

weeks ten to twelve weeks if you lucky
so<00:02:31.970> with<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.299> being<00:02:32.329> in<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.569> politie<00:02:32.930> will<00:02:33.110> get

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
so with it being in the politie will get

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.449 
so with it being in the politie will get
some<00:02:33.319> warm<00:02:33.530> weather<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.920> should<00:02:34.069> speed<00:02:34.340> them

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
some warm weather it should speed them

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.120 
some warm weather it should speed them
on<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.260> we'll<00:02:36.260> be<00:02:36.349> looking<00:02:36.470> at<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.829> middle<00:02:36.950> of

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
on so we'll be looking at the middle of

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.589 
on so we'll be looking at the middle of
May<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.579> the<00:02:37.640> end<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:37.910> May<00:02:38.060> which<00:02:38.360> you

hopefully get a few potatoes and I'll

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.650 
hopefully get a few potatoes and I'll
know<00:02:40.819> when<00:02:41.000> they're<00:02:41.120> just<00:02:41.209> about<00:02:41.329> ready

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
because we'll just start to flower soon

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.370 
because we'll just start to flower soon
as<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.060> flowers<00:02:44.450> start<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.870> board's<00:02:45.109> up<00:02:45.170> and

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
as the flowers start the board's up and

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.599 
as the flowers start the board's up and
on<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.530> flowers<00:02:45.889> you<00:02:46.190> can<00:02:46.340> have<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.459> little

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
on the flowers you can have a little

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.250 
on the flowers you can have a little
fertile<00:02:47.209> about<00:02:47.389> and<00:02:47.569> seeds<00:02:47.780> any<00:02:47.900> potato

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
fertile about and seeds any potato

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.420 
fertile about and seeds any potato
that's<00:02:48.590> usually<00:02:48.889> a<00:02:48.920> sign<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.160> there<00:02:49.400> are

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430
