00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.679
 no need to have special tools 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.480
 to make a good compost 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.969
 to have a digging fork for the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.039
 realize but for that we need to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.320
 green waste the sizes of the arts bus 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.720
 straw for example wood 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.210
 fragmented cartons why not 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.939
 all your peelings the herbs 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.880
 unwanted mounted salads or 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.660
 radish rise and of course the clippings 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.180
 turf 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.710
 now the goal is to achieve 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.960
 wisely a complexion to speed up 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.850
 decomposition with our green waste 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.829
 if you do not have composters 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.420
 you can also carry out your pile of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.950
 that we can on earth then for that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.140
 you will use your fork 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.140
 Digging to go first compact, 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.960
 the ground surface then you take your 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.539
 branches and you're going to make one 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.379
 first layer then the ideal is to 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.770
 mix the dry with the will then for 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.500
 its share above we will put our mowing 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.530
 grass 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:11.310
 a first layer we go well the stalls 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.159
 and with the digging fork and we're going 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.990
 tax more back dry items 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.880
 like straw over the straw 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.520
 hand over all the household garbage you 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.560
 peels the unwanted herbs the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.049
 cartons is worth going over we're gonna 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.810
 well compacted, we are even well watered 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.670
 as and the sex of the freight usec the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.229
 fresh and watered as and when 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.720
 so after two months you go 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.590
 reuse your digging fork and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.590
 you 're going to air it so that microbes 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.290
 can do their job well 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.009
 so we look and we move with the 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.930
 digging fork 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.180
 we go back again and the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.320
 decomposition thanks accelerated to a 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:59.250
 condition to water well and water 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.560
 the compost pile as much as possible 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.140
 now we ensure that our pile of 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.600
 compost will break down well it is not 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.489
 not at all with your fork to 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.260
 beaker and in particular with the handle in 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.909
 fiberglass that is very strong 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.220
 and since it's fiberglass it's 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:18.040
 rotten six months later 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.049
 what we get a compost with 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.390
 many glasses of earth inside 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.750
 we will still stir it with the fork to 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.610
 dig 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.019
 and once our compost pile 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.209
 will be well dry 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.459
 we will be able to use it in the garden 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.220
 our compost is now ready to be 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.829
 employees we will use it in maintenance 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.319
 at the foot of vegetables vegetables 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.970
 greedy and saddlery of leeks 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.879
 tomatoes for example you can also 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.190
 to use your flower beds or in 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:49.230
 the planters at the foot of the trees 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.230
 fruit trees or between your flowering shrubs
