at<00:00:23.210> this<00:00:23.440> you<00:00:24.440> ever<00:00:24.560> wondered<00:00:24.950> a<00:00:25.100> good

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.370 
at this you ever wondered a good

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.250 
at this you ever wondered a good
argument<00:00:25.910> for<00:00:25.940> buying<00:00:26.570> an<00:00:26.840> aftermarket

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
argument for buying an aftermarket

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.090 
argument for buying an aftermarket
straight<00:00:28.010> through<00:00:28.280> exhaust<00:00:28.640> or<00:00:29.300> full<00:00:29.570> flow

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
straight through exhaust or full flow

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.950 
straight through exhaust or full flow
then<00:00:31.100> this<00:00:31.760> is<00:00:32.000> probably<00:00:32.450> it

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
then this is probably it

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.200 
then this is probably it
there's<00:00:33.650> your<00:00:33.830> intake<00:00:34.190> from<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.490> header<00:00:34.700> nice

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
there's your intake from the header nice

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.410 
there's your intake from the header nice
and<00:00:35.450> big<00:00:36.220> comes<00:00:37.220> into<00:00:37.490> this<00:00:37.610> first<00:00:37.910> through

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
and big comes into this first through

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.340 
and big comes into this first through
this<00:00:38.570> first<00:00:38.900> chamber<00:00:40.570> into<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.810> second

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
this first chamber into the second

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.110 
this first chamber into the second
chamber<00:00:43.630> or<00:00:44.630> it<00:00:44.750> bounces<00:00:45.200> around<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:45.940> then<00:00:46.940> is

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
chamber or it bounces around and then is

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.850 
chamber or it bounces around and then is
forced<00:00:47.600> through<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:50.390> gauze<00:00:50.720> if<00:00:51.200> you<00:00:51.530> can<00:00:51.680> pick

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
forced through the gauze if you can pick

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.370 
forced through the gauze if you can pick
it<00:00:51.890> up<00:00:52.040> there<00:00:52.720> but<00:00:53.720> is<00:00:54.040> steel<00:00:55.040> gauze<00:00:55.430> or

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
it up there but is steel gauze or

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.830 
it up there but is steel gauze or
perforated<00:00:57.380> thing<00:00:58.370> there<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:58.940> there<00:00:59.180> that

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
perforated thing there it is there that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.990 
perforated thing there it is there that
through<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:00.860> then<00:01:00.980> into<00:01:01.280> that<00:01:01.309> smaller

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
through that and then into that smaller

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.529 
through that and then into that smaller
hole<00:01:02.270> there<00:01:02.570> pipe<00:01:03.530> which<00:01:03.980> goes<00:01:04.309> through<00:01:04.670> that

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
hole there pipe which goes through that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:07.959 
hole there pipe which goes through that
second<00:01:06.200> chamber<00:01:06.530> right<00:01:06.889> through<00:01:07.219> it<00:01:07.310> into<00:01:07.490> the

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
second chamber right through it into the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:10.779 
second chamber right through it into the
third<00:01:08.179> chamber<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:09.130> then<00:01:10.130> it<00:01:10.219> bounces<00:01:10.609> around

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
third chamber and then it bounces around

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.090 
third chamber and then it bounces around
in<00:01:11.090> there<00:01:11.329> and<00:01:11.600> then<00:01:12.380> goes<00:01:12.590> through<00:01:12.619> those

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
in there and then goes through those

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.539 
in there and then goes through those
smaller<00:01:13.579> pipes<00:01:14.709> through<00:01:15.709> that<00:01:15.889> next<00:01:16.280> chamber

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
smaller pipes through that next chamber

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.559 
smaller pipes through that next chamber
into<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.569> back<00:01:17.780> chamber<00:01:18.819> where<00:01:19.819> it<00:01:19.850> betters

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
into the back chamber where it betters

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.510 
into the back chamber where it betters
around<00:01:20.899> again<00:01:23.319> you're<00:01:24.319> exiting<00:01:25.039> out<00:01:25.280> there

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
around again you're exiting out there

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.770 
around again you're exiting out there
yet<00:01:25.789> and<00:01:25.999> then<00:01:26.149> it<00:01:26.240> goes<00:01:26.389> through<00:01:26.630> those

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
yet and then it goes through those

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.179 
yet and then it goes through those
smaller<00:01:27.170> stub<00:01:27.829> ones<00:01:28.100> there<00:01:28.429> two<00:01:29.389> ones<00:01:29.630> again

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
smaller stub ones there two ones again

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.029 
smaller stub ones there two ones again
into<00:01:31.189> this<00:01:31.310> middle<00:01:32.090> chamber<00:01:32.889> where<00:01:33.889> it's

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
into this middle chamber where it's

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.529 
into this middle chamber where it's
pushed<00:01:34.429> through<00:01:35.149> steel<00:01:36.459> perforated<00:01:37.539> plate

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
pushed through steel perforated plate

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.620 
pushed through steel perforated plate
again<00:01:38.929> there's<00:01:39.319> the<00:01:39.499> perforations<00:01:39.979> there

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
again there's the perforations there

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.550 
again there's the perforations there
okay<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:41.899> then<00:01:42.740> finally<00:01:43.539> pushed<00:01:44.539> through<00:01:45.200> and

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
okay and then finally pushed through and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.709 
okay and then finally pushed through and
if<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:45.889> can<00:01:46.009> see<00:01:46.249> it<00:01:46.340> right<00:01:47.240> in<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.420> center

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
if you can see it right in the center

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.449 
if you can see it right in the center
there<00:01:47.749> there's<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.380> actual<00:01:48.649> exit<00:01:49.039> pipe<00:01:49.279> which

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
there there's the actual exit pipe which

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.309 
there there's the actual exit pipe which
goes<00:01:49.700> through<00:01:50.029> them<00:01:50.209> again<00:01:50.359> there<00:01:51.109> it<00:01:51.229> is

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
goes through them again there it is

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.559 
goes through them again there it is
there<00:01:51.499> in<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.679> middle<00:01:51.859> and<00:01:52.149> coming<00:01:53.149> out<00:01:53.299> the

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
there in the middle and coming out the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.550 
there in the middle and coming out the
back<00:01:54.170> now<00:01:55.099> look<00:01:55.279> at<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.459> size<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.849> that<00:01:55.939> hole

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
back now look at the size of that hole

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.370 
back now look at the size of that hole
you<00:01:57.560> can't<00:01:57.859> tell<00:01:58.130> me<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:58.899> this<00:01:59.899> thing<00:01:59.959> can

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
you can't tell me that this thing can

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.529 
you can't tell me that this thing can
breathe<00:02:00.619> properly<00:02:00.880> or<00:02:01.880> all<00:02:01.969> that<00:02:02.209> happening

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539
