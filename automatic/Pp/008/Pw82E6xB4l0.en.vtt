market<00:03:17.850> at<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.690> girl<00:03:18.989> gamer<00:03:19.290> market<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.790> has<00:03:21.060> a

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
market at the girl gamer market it has a

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.449 
market at the girl gamer market it has a
lot<00:03:21.660> more<00:03:21.690> variety<00:03:22.050> which<00:03:22.769> i<00:03:22.890> think<00:03:22.950> is<00:03:23.250> trying

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
lot more variety which i think is trying

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.729 
lot more variety which i think is trying
to<00:03:23.550> branch<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.209> divide<00:03:24.600> between<00:03:24.900> boys<00:03:25.709> and

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
to branch that divide between boys and

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.490 
to branch that divide between boys and
girls<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.550> certainly<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.600> think<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.110> game<00:03:28.350> is

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
girls and certainly I think this game is

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.650 
girls and certainly I think this game is
going<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.860> appeal<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.280> both<00:03:29.459> yes<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.480> might

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
going to appeal to both yes it might

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.470 
going to appeal to both yes it might
lead<00:03:30.960> to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
lead to

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.140 
lead to
the<00:03:31.540> female<00:03:31.870> market<00:03:32.319> because<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.340> Stella<00:03:33.819> and

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
the female market because of Stella and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.270 
the female market because of Stella and
just<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:35.080> type<00:03:35.319> of<00:03:35.349> things<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.799> Stella

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
just the type of things that Stella

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.300 
just the type of things that Stella
likes<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.760> do<00:03:36.940> but<00:03:37.690> it's<00:03:38.500> good<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:38.860> see<00:03:39.159> the

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
likes to do but it's good to see the

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.210 
likes to do but it's good to see the
packaging<00:03:39.819> doesn't<00:03:40.120> reflect<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.980> you

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
packaging doesn't reflect that and you

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.740 
packaging doesn't reflect that and you
can<00:03:42.340> see<00:03:42.519> in<00:03:42.670> detail<00:03:43.120> when<00:03:43.299> we<00:03:43.360> look<00:03:43.510> at<00:03:43.659> the

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
can see in detail when we look at the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.009 
can see in detail when we look at the
characters<00:03:44.230> how<00:03:45.190> they<00:03:45.430> sit<00:03:45.730> on<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.909> top<00:03:46.060> and

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
characters how they sit on the top and

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.860 
characters how they sit on the top and
then<00:03:47.409> Stella<00:03:48.069> is<00:03:48.280> actually<00:03:48.670> dressed<00:03:49.030> as<00:03:49.239> Elvis

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
then Stella is actually dressed as Elvis

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.369 
then Stella is actually dressed as Elvis
brilliant<00:03:50.860> so<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:52.269> can<00:03:52.450> see<00:03:52.660> all<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.230> little
