00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello today transforming a short to the 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.980
 old waist I went to a store 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.900
 second and I found for five dollars a 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.180
 shorcito that was the waist a bit 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.630
 old and back had a flag 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:21.699
 American painted so I brought it to 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:25.400
 house we need scissors a blade and 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.900
 a vegetable grater we are going to measure 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.600
 three fingers as they are watching with a 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.490
 pencil are going to draw a line is not 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.679
 worry without stain after it goes to 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.160
 wash and we will cut as well as you are 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:38.700
 seeing 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.120
 you're going to cut everything everything we always go 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.710
 to start at the front 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.140
 goes aside 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.809
 and now we turn the shorts and go to 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.600
 cut the other front equally 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.489
 we measure the three fingers we mark and 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.489
 we cut across the line 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.800
 same as in the other part once 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.890
 we have already cut our two 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.170
 strips from the front this has 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.080
 to be like you measure yourself the short you go 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.770
 to decide how long or short what 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.140
 you want 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.390
 in my case I like cortitas but not 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.920
 so much already know that these is where 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.890
 the waists are means like anna 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.869
 garters but I'm a little decent like that 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.640
 that was not kind in aller or now what 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.369
 let's do that is to measure again 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.369
 three fingers but in the back 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.150
 we draw a line with a down as 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.370
 are you watching if you notice we are 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.610
 also marking three lines or three 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.070
 high fingers to cut the same 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.250
 way as we cut in the part of the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.380
 front of the sun when we measure three fingers 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.070
 from the back where is the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.950
 Booty turns out that it's going to be a little more 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.260
 long that is down the buttocks not if a 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.090
 person is very long they will not be left 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.420
 a little more chiquitito and as you can see 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.100
 Waistband waistband measure always live 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.600
 the part of the buttocks will be left 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.750
 a little longer this is because of the shot 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.370
 and for the pompies if you want to be able 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.770
 cut it up there in the top 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.660
 so that the pockets can be seen as there 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.660
 some for these and it's up to you 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.569
 what we are going to do now once 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.730
 we have already cut part of our 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.370
 high legs that we have wished 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.069
 sorry let's grab two magazines 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.349
 old or some cardboard that have thick 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.480
 and we're going to put it in the part of the 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.730
 leg like this 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.110
 because we are going to use the cutter now 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.990
 well edge to it 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.290
 and we are going to make cuts everywhere 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:51.900
 as you want and then with your fingers 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.900
 you're going to start like fraying the 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.980
 so you will be courteous everywhere 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.390
 small holes of needles and diagonals 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.030
 Horizontal verticals 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.520
 in the part of the pockets where you 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.680
 want 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.410
 then the part of the legs you're going 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.710
 to start disengaging 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.750
 the most you can 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.150
 and this is up to you according to your 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.310
 I love creativity broken 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.320
 all sides so in the part where it 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.250
 puts strap also tells about 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.010
 cuts there is a small bag in the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.770
 bottom part also frays a 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.900
 little bit 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.570
 then I made small holes as you see here 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.540
 I'm getting in as the finger break is a 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.430
 huequito I love the holes in the 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.350
 back as you see now we are going to 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.810
 start doing it to cut too and what 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.850
 What I've done now is use our 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.680
 vegetable grater we have from the 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.050
 kitchen after using it we talked 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.940
 super well we return it to the kitchen and 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.120
 If you have a problem you will not achieve 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.220
 I just want you to see that 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.470
 let's scratch the fabric so that it 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.780
 wear now so you have this finish 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.460
 older because if we cut and if you 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.890
 we throw with your fingers it's like you see 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.740
 half ugly as it has been made by hand 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.700
 something like that and with the traitor we give him as 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.560
 that 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.400
 that touch like it 's from store and what 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.949
 we have bought in a store 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.610
 that I learned a long time ago actually 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:28.460
 I make my mini skirts millionths 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.199
 skirts I do everything then I learned 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.210
 to use the grater so I'm going super 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.210
 well as you see here I finished almost 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.430
 do not worry and cut there the 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.650
 Pockets will cover your skin as you see 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.370
 here are the holes but the fabric the 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.380
 pocket is down there so you're not going to 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.230
 show a lot of skin 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.570
 I already tried it on here, as you see, not me 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.240
 I'm tight like the models that 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.100
 sold in stores surpass chito me 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.790
 it's because I do not get used to using the 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.370
 Very close-fitting clothes 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.990
 but I tried it on so they could see now 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.030
 what we are going to do is put some 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.910
 gloves please protect yourself well 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.920
 hands and here I have already twisted everything well 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:15.009
 cortadito I also have a laundry 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.990
 small and here I have chlorine or bleach 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.090
 what we are going to do is empty it in 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.360
 our laundry that is well washed 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:26.480
 forgiveness washing or bucket I do not know how you 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.990
 call, let's put enough chlorine or 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.389
 bleach and let's submerge the trickle by 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.250
 the part of the pool because the part 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.979
 of the waistband because it 's the most 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.500
 thick not weak that will take a 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.229
 little more to follow what I want 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.050
 is that chlorine or bleach I despise 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:48.260
 in the shorts to the point that you 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.910
 see where you like it, you 're going to stop 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.639
 notice that when you are turning it around 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.520
 everywhere as well as I eat 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.770
 making're starting to notice that already 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.249
 is going to put this color like this or start 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.169
 get lost 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:03.779
 and you will also feel the fabric that is going to 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.339
 start warming up that looks like it's going to 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:07.049
 explode how hot this way 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:09.519
 you worry about that I want you to 

00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:11.809
 always put on gloves 

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:15.139
 then it's already hot and 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:17.839
 you chose the color of your new sun what 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:20.720
 what you are going to do is open the pipe and 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:23.090
 you're going to start rinsing with cold water 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.630
 rinse or as much as you can by the 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.090
 clothes soap whatever but you have to 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:32.840
 rinse so that the bleach or chlorine 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:36.260
 come out completely rinse it many 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.420
 many times 4 5 or 6 times so that 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.810
 the chlorine can go well 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:45.490
 after you already washed it well and almost 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:49.349
 there is no bleach or chlorine 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.349
 you are going to drain well well 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.820
 look how it turned out in the back 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.040
 I also sing like this all crazy mean 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.260
 different 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.780
 happily the flag that was behind 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.610
 painted did not go away at all this 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.280
 paint is good 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.620
 I do not know the person who has done well 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.259
 then you will drain well and in the 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.789
 success and you're going to take it to wash you're going to 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:18.389
 put to dry and this is the result 

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:20.909
 final I repeat again to me I have left 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.800
 wide you can look in those 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:26.150
 thrift stores or donation 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.620
 someone give them or the choro their dads 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.510
 those times 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.130
 you can put a little in the 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.860
 seamstress if they want to make them fit 

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.930
 I repeat to you, I do not like it 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.419
 use very tight clothes because I 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:42.300
 I feel uncomfortable, so as you see, look 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:44.490
 I get super super wide because I 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.229
 I feel comfortable and it is at the waist like 

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.419
 I'm showing them by putting their hand in 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:50.250
 the waist so they see put their hands 

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:53.790
 to pocket so they can see that you can not see 

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:57.000
 meat or is not very impugned and here is 

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:59.850
 the end result from the back 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.400
 and the end is a collage of how it was 

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:05.030
 I loved you I hope you also up
