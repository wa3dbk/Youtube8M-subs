00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
just in here I ground it up to here just

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.690 
just in here I ground it up to here just
from<00:02:25.650> our<00:02:25.740> room<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.100> helps<00:02:26.370> putting<00:02:26.640> the

from our room and helps putting the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.490 
from our room and helps putting the
battery<00:02:27.000> nor<00:02:27.150> easier<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.390> mean<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.810> then<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.440> I

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
battery nor easier I mean it then can I

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.960 
battery nor easier I mean it then can I
heard<00:02:28.650> nothing<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.520> makes<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.820> better

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
heard nothing it just makes it better
