00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.549 
on mobile devices so I don't even go on
facebook<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.719> means<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
facebook so that means that this is the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.380 
facebook so that means that this is the
first<00:00:52.829> time<00:00:53.070> seeing<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.579> there's<00:00:53.850> only<00:00:53.940> six

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
first time seeing this there's only six

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.110 
first time seeing this there's only six
days<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:55.079> complete<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.969> it

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
days to complete this as we know it

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.290 
days to complete this as we know it
right<00:00:57.329> now<00:00:58.070> generally<00:00:59.070> these<00:00:59.399> things<00:00:59.730> they

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
counted i usually grow the one that

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.210 
counted i usually grow the one that
costs<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.880> most<00:02:27.970> which<00:02:28.960> is<00:02:28.990> 5<00:02:29.500> million<00:02:30.040> and

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
costs the most which is 5 million and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.270 
costs the most which is 5 million and
you<00:02:30.310> just<00:02:30.940> got<00:02:31.180> continue<00:02:31.870> growing<00:02:32.170> until<00:02:32.920> you

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
you just got continue growing until you

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.690 
you just got continue growing until you
actually<00:02:33.550> get<00:02:34.540> enough<00:02:35.080> food<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.190> they

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
actually get enough food so that they

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.580 
actually get enough food so that they
will<00:02:36.850> count<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:42.030> alright<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.300> let's<00:02:43.930> just<00:02:44.320> stop

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
will count it alright so let's just stop

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.960 
will count it alright so let's just stop
there<00:02:44.950> because<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:46.209> taking<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.750> lot<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.970> how

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
there because it is taking a lot of how

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.640 
there because it is taking a lot of how
should<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.209> say<00:02:49.270> it's<00:02:49.660> taking<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.080> lot<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.260> coins

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
should I say it's taking a lot of coins

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.270 
should I say it's taking a lot of coins
now<00:02:51.300> we<00:02:52.300> have<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.480> lot<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.810> these<00:02:53.290> dragons<00:02:54.130> are

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
now we have a lot of these dragons are

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.070 
now we have a lot of these dragons are
just<00:02:54.310> filling<00:02:54.910> up<00:02:55.060> on<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.390> nest<00:02:55.660> because<00:02:55.900> I

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
just filling up on the nest because I

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.530 
just filling up on the nest because I
just<00:02:56.590> didn't<00:02:56.860> move<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.220> so<00:02:57.790> what<00:02:58.300> we're<00:02:58.420> going

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
just didn't move it so what we're going

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.330 
just didn't move it so what we're going
to<00:02:58.630> do<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.200> finish<00:02:59.739> that<00:02:59.920> breeding

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
to do is just finish that breeding

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.490 
to do is just finish that breeding
course<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.209> not<00:03:01.390> getting<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.780> counted<00:03:02.320> but

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
course is not getting it counted but

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.490 
course is not getting it counted but
when<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.160> breed<00:03:03.489> dragons<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.840> do<00:03:05.080> have<00:03:05.350> an

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
when you breed dragons you do have an

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.240 
when you breed dragons you do have an
opportunity<00:03:05.860> of<00:03:06.459> getting<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.330> counted<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.250> i

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
opportunity of getting it counted so i

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.110 
opportunity of getting it counted so i
am<00:03:09.730> going<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.380> breed<00:03:11.380> two<00:03:11.769> legendary<00:03:12.519> dragons

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
together and hopefully get it counted

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.040 
together and hopefully get it counted
into<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.709> game<00:03:18.450> all<00:03:19.450> right<00:03:19.600> maybe<00:03:19.840> i<00:03:19.959> don't

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
into the game all right maybe i don't

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.110

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
is probably not going to get counted

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.259 
is probably not going to get counted
because<00:03:29.920> usually<00:03:30.280> you're<00:03:30.640> looking<00:03:30.940> for<00:03:31.239> a
