00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.020
 or not 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.660
 good today we are going to do this organizes 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.660
 this lip organizer 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:37.070
 which is made with a cap of the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.070
 boxes of soul box and with divisions 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.610
 the division is good I was left with a 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.090
 little big but they can do more 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.090
 little 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.420
 let's see how it gets done 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.929
 While 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.070
 well I use the lid of the boxes 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:59.920
 to the mabhuh that is quite strong 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.980
 to be my lip organizer 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.700
 what we are going to need is a pencil a 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.800
 cutter or scissors and cardboard or cardboard 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.430
 soft if they also have to do the 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.430
 divisions 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.900
 with a rule we will take the height of 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.470
 the box that we have in this 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.790
 case are 3 centimeters and on the 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.790
 cardboard we are going to measure 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.710
 three centimeters 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:40.140
 we are marking what we are going to contribute 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.350
 band-aid strips that are going to be long 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.470
 of the letter 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:50.620
 and others that are going to be the width of the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:54.190
 box but all three centimeters 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.280
 Well I have porta of the strips 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.070
 What I did was mark them with pencil 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.720
 to have the labial divisions more 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.720
 or less to the extent of the plane 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.550
 now that we have you 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.050
 this is going to end 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.160
 the cilia 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.530
 A) Yes 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.000
 and to form the squares then 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.650
 what we are going to do is cut up the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.129
 half of a side 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.750
 and half of the other so that in 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.660
 castro 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.130
 good and this is how it is united 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.200
 can you do you want to have 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.870
 the hardest to be more armed 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.180
 so they were the divisions 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.280
 and the lipsticks go paraditos I have left 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.850
 a little big the squares can be 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.960
 make smaller believe like this 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.310
 so that it is better 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.060
 well I hope that far the states 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.060
 look forward
