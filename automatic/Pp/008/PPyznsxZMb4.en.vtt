00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.210
 two 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.940
 good as they are I hope very well the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.070
 today's video I will talk about couples 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.870
 ideals of anime that's because it's a 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.980
 topic that is talked about a lot and good 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.840
 it occurred to me to make a list of several 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.039
 animes and arm couples obviously this 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.420
 I did not work alone but I did not 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.570
 believe in the one that has helped me from the centrol 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.109
 or the gays so we will do this video 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.539
 between the two 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.669
 let's start and as an adult have a lot of tricks 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.340
 your ideal couples nobody you think that 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.920
 or maybe the scope for being that with such 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.480
 time a mourning by itself good good good 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.010
 those that maybe cynar others are 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.690
 they gave a very nice kiss and all that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.850
 money everything to look for seems a bit 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.590
 good gay and all that but I think it's not going 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.650
 to finish with another person bertoldi 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.130
 another couple please in which operated 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.130
 May night 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.850
 for martÃ­ control good I tell you 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.350
 other couples apart from those fairies that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.910
 just say electron there are great 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.800
 chances that it does not end with 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.110
 sakura since this one has a very 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.339
 similar to the routine way but not 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.840
 I would like that also with them we 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.220
 have also with gina is who 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.960
 she also has several chances since she 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.430
 if you're in love with Naruto about those 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.470
 what good but also bring another as 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.910
 he says I do not want to determine with sure 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.560
 but the one that I think has more chances 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.890
 that all is karina condolences maybe that the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.890
 he tried to kill 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.500
 Well now we go with the couples of 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.500
 he punishes having been expelled 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.270
 but also more us than by 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.090
 Example of goat to finish with someone 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.310
 that is a wing and vice mayor human and 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.930
 whatever is at the same time or otherwise 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.250
 time with russia but I do not believe with blonde 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.110
 because she already gave him to understand that no 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.190
 will leave the friends even though the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.200
 villa also until I have left to 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.520
 disc I think it is and do not see how we could 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.500
 see is quite in love with him though 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.700
 the boy does not notice this and hey 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.729
 should take advantage of the since you're 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.320
 as of deeds since girls like these 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.610
 there is not anywhere 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.020
 glove made of the author said kieron 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.460
 interest to earn more so not 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.930
 wants to mix it with the series without 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.850
 But I think at some point near 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.200
 of the end we will see some couple and good 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.150
 what we did with protagonists light end 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.230
 you are paying to anyone interested and 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.970
 that the only thing that interests him is 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.500
 find the one piece but what happens 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.330
 when in the glove and stable and lenses 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.980
 in tensing the girls and which candidates 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.660
 we have I think they look with what is the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.280
 I think it's the one that really loves 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.780
 light and since you want to marry him and 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.420
 for more than many light days and finished 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.640
 for a friend 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.379
 and neither of the two together so 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.780
 when I stay with the shots in charge 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.640
 and with only good maybe with workshops 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.790
 paisas cares and good can continue old 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.500
 most critical memories burgos ok too 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.540
 we have so with who could finish is 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.650
 so who falls in love with all I think 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.879
 at some point in his life he's going to 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.409
 find someone who really 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.269
 falls in love and that to think so much in other 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.829
 women but that will also be the end 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.390
 of the series has been part yet not 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:55.579
 we met the artist's person she 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.079
 will fall in love completely good anthony 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.549
 Also we are not much of love to 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.290
 7 what theoretical protagonist goes to 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.359
 finish with a piece of meat 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.890
 getting married and having children waiting 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.359
 we attack saying it does not make sense that 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.190
 need look what was going to end with 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.870
 laugh that is in love with the first 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.700
 chapter that we saw it and well I think that 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.290
 so cute couple but as with wampis not 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.780
 it is very important and if it happens to pass to 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.549
 end of the series is to say with love to the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.290
 obvious couple that we have but without 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.430
 institute by rne that you can not get to 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.049
 nothing because of this problem that 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.519
 It has a bug and becoming a conan 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.870
 but good update to the couple 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.909
 definitive critical mate 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.459
 you're wrong, chinche will end when 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:35.110
 there's a little detective girl you have a 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.110
 torpedo cold gay sun 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.480
 good but I do think that more was 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.909
 determined to be in with my house yes good 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.870
 they were very happy for a long time 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.349
 impossible because it indicates venues that 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.519
 electric abbot that my light house that 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.519
 what is right 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.000
 good in happy and we have a couple of 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.579
 couples I think I think it would be 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.010
 was born because he or maybe give his 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.859
 gray a team in which by the way 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.030
 grace was classic very good the truth is 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.129
 who has serious problems with 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.079
 gay relationships I think it will not end 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.000
 with light and more than obvious but also 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.409
 takes out the general of the series gray's good 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.940
 obviously with rain since also 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.650
 she is in love with him so for me 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.650
 those are two ideal couples facing 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.829
 good about six of them the truth is 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.780
 that I criticize antrum for its mentality 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.210
 to consider everyone gay but 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.669
 some very good couples 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.310
 is for jehovah, that is, the house of the 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.360
 book can give you a lot of heat if you do not 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.360
 need more 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.169
 mate critical troll good good rain 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.760
 I have to be a piece too and then the 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.310
 trap since we have according to sense and 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.479
 omega is would be please as always 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.760
 tell us understand how it has changed is 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.229
 between these two but according to 66 omega 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.820
 I repeat it seems that this was confirmed and 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:55.040
 good times got married something like that if 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.540
 I'm not wrong, not so much good alejandro 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.150
 I think we already have a couple of couples 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.070
 with you place and cure itches for lion me 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.090
 I think it was a very bad idea to do this 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.090
 video with the trunk 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.510
 I am the couples and approach with good 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.300
 I think it's more than obvious from the pull 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.580
 more for pikachu is for vital yuc but 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.400
 we also have ace for pikachu matris 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.870
 critics or phil coke and good back I do not know 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.610
 If I am they are typical but four couples of 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.630
 pokemon is the only one itself happens and 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.910
 I want there are those who are watching this 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.380
 video too so nothing guys that 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.690
 would be a couple of in several cities the 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.190
 year for me good here the troll although it 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.810
 he controls a little forgot because he entered what 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.880
 only you start in gay things or in 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.800
 morbid things however I think that in 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.850
 a couple of couples was right but hey 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.199

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.030
 second part of ideal couples of 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.160
 anime as well as they can make a 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.810
 part of the types of much 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.520
