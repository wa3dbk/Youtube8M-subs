00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.609
 I have long wanted to make this video 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:13.849

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.849

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.579
 I was not there in all the rooms but only in 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.270
 single room 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.980
 it takes them almost 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.079
 half the room and takes instead 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.079
 it is a detachment about the window 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 on Thursday I bought them at the epicenter height 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.940

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.600
 tell you everything 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 started with a window sill from one 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.980
 Fillon glasses 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.540
 I'm from the windowsill 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.350
 began to move on 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.110
 and my husband didn't 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.980
 shelves 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.370
 here are the usual wooden ones 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.310
 attached to the wall 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.479
 labor lamps 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.989
 some light fluorescent 18 2 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 I helped you buy cheap 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.700
 light fixtures 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.979
 inexpensive then lamps or here such 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.420
 us 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.420
 square 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:09.649
 farther 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.679
 their husband himself 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.739
 attached 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.849
 gradually I have plants 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:14.909
 increased 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.889
 and I bought 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.090
 first shelving 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.589
 first shelving 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:24.019
 to the left of the window 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.199
 here now I have a kindergarten nursery 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:28.359
 Kiyani already told the past 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:29.669
 video 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.469
 after the first run 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.469
 I purchased a second rack 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.409
 now he is standing next to 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.409
 we'll show everything 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.049
 and after this second shelving I acquired 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.439
 third rack and set 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.369
 next to the shelves 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.519
 so here is opposite the window 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.809
 because I felt sorry for the shelves 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.150
 remove the system all the same how much space 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.559
 but I saved 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.499
 I have two shelves here and here 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.499
 I have one stele ытabit shelves next 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:09.299
 I have a distance 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.299
 between shelves are different for example here 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.889
 from upper chamber ski 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:17.819
 thirty 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.229
 eight 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:20.589
 centimeters 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:23.589
 leader 30 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.689
 Further here here 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.249
 the same 38 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:32.319
 and also on the shelves 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.849
 bolted and in this way just 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:35.999
 she is 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:37.979
 here such 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.299
 what being like 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.499
 that's all here 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.859
 we have one switch 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.769
 seagull if i press this is not a reason 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.769
 that's all turned off 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.889
 including that is when we breakers 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.529
 are connected 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:58.529
 6 ex 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:01.529
 here are 10 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:05.759
 there are switches switches here already 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.249
 agyara 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:08.429
 two 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:11.429
 body same record kreshchatyk 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.379
 and second line counters 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.919
 this way off 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.199
 already known to all 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.639
 vegetable shelves shelves for vegetables and 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.639
 so slow 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.210
 on which I put my plants 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.639
 Tavriya Chimeno on the windowsill 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.719
 here's the lighting there is of course I still have 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:40.800
 no 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.610
 she is active well i probably won't be him 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.460
 do there because during the day 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.940
 the process is enough priest 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.560
 Sedan on the windowsill in the evening 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.659
 this is how the light burns 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.439
 wiped away my wife illuminates these here 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:00.029
 those points that stand on the windowsill 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:02.509
 and what I want to say 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.330
 our last 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.210
 how would their experiments with 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.360
 lighting 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.099
 this is how data is acquired 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.379
 LED strip in the kitchen 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.490
 and we still have a piece 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.740
 and I decided it 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.409
 Here is a quote 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.469
 have one manual shelf 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.009
 do so here 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.839
 and travel agents, I read a lot of different 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:26.680
 reviews 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.090
 a lot of people wrote that plants 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.559
 drawn out 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.349
 I don’t know I have here 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:36.669
 such here 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.580
 small 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.580
 that's because here the shelf is low 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.460
 25 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.009
 but also centimeters 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.569
 just such a kikireshko too 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:50.270
 there is no 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.599
 there are such 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.469
 taking root 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.689
 they fine grain themselves also there 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.080
 cuttings consist 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.770
 from apartment purchases 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.020
 people buy still one such status 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.879
 lowering fairway 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.050
 and 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.520
 generally 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.029
 male electric 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.669
 you can do all this well 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.669
 I have the lighting 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.909
 mainly for winter in winter and mostly 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.270
 almost all day long a little 

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:22.080
 turn on 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.419
 I look at the weather what's the weather outside 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:28.460
 attack for our first racks with me 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.029
 no lighting either 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:33.860
 she will usually do the blessing of the waters 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.319
 on the ceiling 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.330
 but I'm still daitova 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.759
 no piracy 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:39.999
 that's 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:41.929
 one of these days I will resist such here 

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:45.279
 high plants r is obtained 

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:48.599
 to us there is a pool unpretentious 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.520
 and I want to say more 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.759
 exists in our apartments such 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:54.680
 problem 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.229
 how are you there are a lot of plants 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:58.509
 lots of 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.129
 so poland 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:01.559
 humidity 

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:03.419
 and when I have a lot of humidity 100 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.129
 percentage almost because 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:08.419
 that I have very bad heating 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.410
 like that from the shrine 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.770
 understand and humidity 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.159
 it began to rain 

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:18.159
 inside 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.059
 almost to a hundred and ninety 

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:22.610
 percent moisture 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.960
 and therefore need a 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.210
 dehumidifiers 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.369
 I have a small one 

00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:31.529
 listen to 

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:33.519
 Well, it's not electric because 

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.369
 that electric takes a lot 

00:07:35.369 --> 00:07:36.339
 Sveta 

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:37.460
 I 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.090
 I bring here a tablet and here 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.090
 how much moisture does it collect 

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:45.800
 here is this dehydrator 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.460
 pill on report every 2 3 on on 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.460
 12 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.340
 together 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.340
 with so much moisture 

00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:59.259
