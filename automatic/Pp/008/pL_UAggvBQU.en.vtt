00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Today it's the code name 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.049
 hesse winter your new processors 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.150
 as well as a new socket and the iks 99 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.250
 chipset into the race also wants the new 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.290
 Ddr much memory in the desktop segment 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.759
 but what does the new one do? 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.560
 platform and where are the differences? 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.600
 to the previous version 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.430
 We will ask you these and other questions 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.449
 today fitting to the start of Hesse left 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:31.560
 clarify the rail 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:33.360
 have fun with the video hello and warmly 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.130
 welcome here at pc max i am the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.630
 reserve and I like to be cool for many 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.739
 more tests and news around the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.390
 hardware world look at the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.770
 main page of pc max the link to it 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.770
 you can find below in the description 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.570
 Today we want you intels new 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.699
 top model in the form of the intel core i7 5960 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.769
 Imagine this is iks 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.140
 To make a departure of thanks to hyperthreading 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.329
 can calculate up to 16 threads 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.640
 the high end cpu works at one 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.040
 basic clock of 3 ghz and came by turbo 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.560
 Mode raised to 3.5 ghz 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.770
 be intense for the new cpu one 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.890
 price of 999 dollars in front of the six-kernel 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.259
 core i7 5,930k but those with a 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.050
 base clock of 35 g now the per turbo 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.700
 can be raised to 37 returns to the 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.229
 processor was not just two small 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.920
 cut but works too 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.810
 only with 15 mb l3-cache trading is 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.479
 as well with the lot and the price 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.500
 amounts to about $ 500 83 dollars 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.119
 the smallest model of the series core i7 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.940
 5820 k works with a base clock of 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.509
 3.2 gigahertz and a turbo of 3.6 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.490
 ghz 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.640
 even the smallest model has 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.080
 a 15 MB L3 cache and Hyper 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.289
 in contrast to the larger models 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.090
 However, this must be with only 28 pci 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.429
 express lanes get along so that too 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.940
 only a freeware it was possible 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.690
 Price is rotting at 389 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.030
 dollars 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.660
 All cpu s work with a tdp of 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.220
 140 watts at the production of the new one 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.410
 compared to processors 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.890
 hessel and heidelberg, however, nothing 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.399
 changed 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.180
 so accommodates the ca 3 155 square meters 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.000
 big chip about 2.6 billion jpy gate 3d 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.160
 Transistors made in 22 nanometers 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.519
 the tdp has compared to the old one 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.110
 series in 10 watts increased to 140 watts 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.330
 Sufficient cooling should be so 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.790
 to be respected also is the new 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.620
 initial support of ddr4 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.140
 Memory of the standard with up to 2000 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.550
 133 mhz works more on the new 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.260
 platform you will experience in the next 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.760
 section compare now but once 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.379
 short hsp and a budget 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.950
 intel states that the eight cpu 5960 in the 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.360
 Compared to the predecessor six-core cpu 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.180
 4960 for example until 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.340
 20 percent faster 4k videos in adobe 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.100
 premiere per cc can edit or 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.890
 but in cinebench 15x up to 230 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.180
 faster 3d rendering dominates here 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.040
 Among other things, the advantages are shown 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.240
 know the two additional cpu 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.280
 however , on the 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.190
 technological innovations like the one at 5 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.770
 mb larger and now 20 mb l3 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.280
 cache and just the ddr 4 at their part 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.800
 help the pci express connection 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.300
 now takes over up to 40 lanes with 3.0 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.730
 standard and not on the basis of 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.650
 second generation as at x79 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.120
 platforms of the socket has become 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.400
 also changed though the name 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.560
 20 l v3 not much more likely 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.750
 keep up with 20 elfer pedestals is the new one 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.540
 cd and not compatible new is also the 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.910
 support of bdf four and thus as 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.430
 First platform are designed at all 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.180
 the new cpu on quad channel operation 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.310
 up to a clock rate of 2133 mhz 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.620
 if you use one rule per channel 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.180
 is because new ddr standard sets 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.280
 at least four gigabytes in size 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.340
 module in now with a voltage of 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.769
 1.2 volts instead of the previous one for 1 5 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.510
 volt at ddr3 work and with less 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.970
 Consuming a higher performance 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.040
 should be needed but also more 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.390
 contact in through a modified notch 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.790
 the wrong memory should be installed 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.100
 be prevented the new 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.320
 Processor generation is only with the ixs 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.430
 99 chipset compatible as before 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.230
 already became known 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.820
 goes hand in hand with the new pch 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.489
 mainly an improved one 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.979
 Support of modern technologies of 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.750
 the maximum 10 native sata ports 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.880
 can all with a speed 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.100
 of 64 bits per second 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.020
 the x79 chipset enabled without 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.630
 additional controller only six 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.860
 ports of which only two without addition 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.750
 chip operated at full power 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.580
 could be the number of chipset 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.340
 provided usb ports is located 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.080
 unchanged at 14 6 of them now offer 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.180
 but the usb 3.0 standard 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.190
 In addition, thunderbolt is also available in 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.050
 the second generation supports what 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.979
 up to four times faster than usb 3.0 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.780
 should be 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.460
 Last but not least, the new one 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.009
 chipset the support for the 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.589
 overclocking the base blog frequency 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.860
 that 's it from hess wx 99 chips 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:02.180
 as well as the lga 2011 3 whom we now 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.979
 he has a thumbs up 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.210
 go upstairs the video did not like 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.460
 Of course he can also do one 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.020
 Thanks for giving and who ours 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.490
 videos we liked so much 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.110
 want to see you again can we 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.309
 just subscribe here on youtube and 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.349
 you always see our new videos in 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:18.909
 your box exactly if it is a 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.909
 hard time and see you next time
