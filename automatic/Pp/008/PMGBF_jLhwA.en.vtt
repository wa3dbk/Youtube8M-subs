00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.579
 hello everyone my name is Ivan and you 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.679
 re-channel in the trade today i will show 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:14.379
 how to make wonderful dough for 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.270
 pasta and cares on products at home 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.280
 conditions for any difficult 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.530
 fixtures rolled for themselves 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.570
 some see it as important for the test to us 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.170
 it takes 4 eggs to be more 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.370
 accurate then 4 yolks 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.800
 so now we will separate the yolk 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.050
 from protein 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:37.289
 we lay an egg on hand and squirrel runs down 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.289
 through the fingers of joy go to us 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.289
 now we add white to our yolks 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:45.399
 buffalo 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.329
 quite a bit 10-15 grams and some 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.550
 lemon juice 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.069
 I add lemon juice to 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.519
 the dough was more elastic and added 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:57.179
 taste a little sour now add 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.179
 salt and pepper 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.500
 then add all the soap and flour 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.350
 the character is whole meal from 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.930
 durum wheat add 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.860
 characters in tablespoons so they 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.470
 were with slides 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.240
 but if you didn't find her in the store then 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.180
 alternative replacement can be found 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.000
 this semolina somewhere two and a half spoons with 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.680
 cities 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.070
 add flour 2 tablespoons of a hill 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.420
 now everything needs to be mixed in 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.320
 dough will become 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.450
 lumpy continue the topic further 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.540
 knead hands to bring up 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.360
 homogeneous consistency 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.180
 during kneading so that the dough does not stick 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.890
 add a bit of dough to the characters 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.350
 should be hard enough and 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.040
 elastic so when you bend it 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.860
 she didn't break 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.030
 it turns out such a lump of dough 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.640
 now we need to wrap it in a film 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.460
 and put in the fridge for about an hour 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.160
 so that it stood and acquired the necessary 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.560
 the form stood half an hour in the refrigerator 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.310
 now I dreamed of shooting a film and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.950
 we can start cooking pasta 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.230
 we cut our piece into four parts 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.690
 we will use one remaining and 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.640
 we will cover with a film necessarily beds 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.000
 the remaining dough wrap so that it does not 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.130
 evil add some characters to begin 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.300
 roll out 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.040
 Now I will show you several types 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.390
 a pair that can be cooked at home 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.040
 ourselves we got an oval tortilla 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.420
 we need a long straight rectangle 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:44.450
 this we fold the edges so that they are 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.450
 even and continue to tell the share 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.360
 to cook pasta from exploring 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.650
 need to roll very thin 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.860
 almost transparent so we did 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.520
 rectangular horn dough we have it 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.870
 we put and sprinkle everything small to 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.540
 cutting time 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:13.190
 it does not stick together fold in half and 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:16.520
 so several times it turns out something 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:21.020
 like this roll take a sharp knife and 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.110
 chop grandfather about thick 4 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.110
 millimeter 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.460
 expand our sliced ​​rolls and 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.700
 Here we have long hair and 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.000
 the connection cut even more and 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.660
 you will be a full portion not yet 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.940
 ready now I will show you fall into 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.110
 a brothel and this is a tax long post like these 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:58.060
 clouds to her then she is much wider and slightly 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.060
 thicker add the same way and 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.940
 we cut wide strips 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:13.060
 cut super 7 6 strips from you 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.920
 get a portion cook for them 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.190

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:32.160
 roll out half enough for us 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:38.050
 Farfalle slices they are of the thinnest 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:41.710
 Roll out the dough as thin as possible. 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:54.100
 thick enough now we turn 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:58.780
 dough and cut the edges then 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:01.120
 unfold yo take a knife 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.490
 corrugated blade and cut 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.490
 short strips 2 centimeters long 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.160
 farfalle is bows 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:28.220
 we take our sliced ​​stripes in two 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:31.250
 fingers in the middle and squeeze you 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.380
 it turns out bows if you have a little bit 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.610

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.610
