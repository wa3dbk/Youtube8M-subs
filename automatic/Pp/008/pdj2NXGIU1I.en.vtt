00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
setup with the HTC hd2 I've yet to turn

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.259 
setup with the HTC hd2 I've yet to turn
it<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.559> very<00:00:13.679> first<00:00:13.950> time<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.460> to

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
it on for the very first time and to

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.390 
it on for the very first time and to
start<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:15.719> have<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:16.109> remove<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.710> back<00:00:16.980> battery

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
start we have to remove the back battery

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.099 
start we have to remove the back battery
cover<00:00:17.609> which<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.029> kind<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.480> difficult<00:00:18.660> and

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
cover which is kind of difficult and

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.990 
cover which is kind of difficult and
remove<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.680> piece<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.400> plastic<00:00:20.850> that's

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
remove the piece of plastic that's

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.759 
remove the piece of plastic that's
covering<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.359> battery<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.080> idea<00:00:22.439> here<00:00:22.740> is

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
covering the battery so the idea here is

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.259 
covering the battery so the idea here is
that<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.010> sort<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.250> lift<00:00:23.550> up<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> left

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
that you sort of lift up on the left

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.900 
that you sort of lift up on the left
side<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:25.230> there<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.279> goes<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.699> feel<00:00:26.820> like

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
side it there it goes you feel like

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.490 
side it there it goes you feel like
you're<00:00:27.029> gonna<00:00:27.090> break<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.359> by<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.869> way<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.289> is

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
you're gonna break it by the way this is

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.490 
you're gonna break it by the way this is
absolutely<00:00:29.250> 100%<00:00:29.699> metal<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:31.140> real

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
absolutely 100% metal it's it's real

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.889 
absolutely 100% metal it's it's real
brush<00:00:31.920> metal<00:00:32.160> not<00:00:32.489> fake<00:00:32.790> stuff<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.690> looks

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
brush metal not fake stuff and it looks

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.470 
brush metal not fake stuff and it looks
gorgeous<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.860> let's<00:00:35.040> take<00:00:35.280> out<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.640> little

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
gorgeous so let's take out this little

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.790 
gorgeous so let's take out this little
piece<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> plastic<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> battery<00:00:37.710> is

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
piece of plastic and the battery is

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.950 
piece of plastic and the battery is
about<00:00:38.100> twelve<00:00:38.520> hundred<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.090> fifty<00:00:39.750> million

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
about twelve hundred and fifty million

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.020 
about twelve hundred and fifty million
powers<00:00:40.379> or<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.649> kind<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.309> small<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:41.910> we're

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
powers or so kind of small but we're

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.850 
powers or so kind of small but we're
assuming<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.480> hd2<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.410> good<00:00:43.559> battery

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
assuming the hd2 is really good battery

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.529 
assuming the hd2 is really good battery
management<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.850> we're<00:00:44.940> gonna<00:00:45.030> put<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.360> SIM

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
management so we're gonna put in the SIM

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.279 
management so we're gonna put in the SIM
card<00:00:46.700> there<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.789> goes<00:00:47.969> put<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> battery<00:00:49.050> in

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
card there it goes put the battery in

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.010 
card there it goes put the battery in
and<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.739> battery<00:00:50.100> cover<00:00:50.370> back<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:51.059> right<00:00:51.870> now

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and the battery cover back on right now

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.420 
and the battery cover back on right now
I<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.289> plugged<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.280> begins

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
I have it plugged in so that it begins

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.880 
I have it plugged in so that it begins
charging<00:00:53.760> immediately<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:55.620> how<00:00:55.770> this

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
charging immediately and see how this

so let's see what happens when we go

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.660 
so let's see what happens when we go
through<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> first<00:01:08.909> time<00:01:09.090> setup<00:01:09.360> process

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.539 

quietly<00:01:14.670> brilliant<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.890> there<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.340> an

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
LED indicator light at the top there

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.140 
LED indicator light at the top there
which<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.710> good<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.159> know<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.030> no

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.580 
gonna click Next I just tap very lightly
to<00:01:30.390> see<00:01:30.600> how<00:01:30.659> sensitive<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> screen<00:01:31.409> was

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
to see how sensitive the screen was

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.530 
to see how sensitive the screen was
looks<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> tap<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.299> bit

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
looks like I have to tap a little bit

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.960 
looks like I have to tap a little bit
harder<00:01:34.100> we're<00:01:35.100> gonna<00:01:35.189> compare<00:01:35.579> screen

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
harder we're gonna compare screen

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
harder we're gonna compare screen
sensitivity<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> iPhone<00:01:37.259> coming<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.220> in

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
sensitivity to the iPhone coming up in

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.580 
sensitivity to the iPhone coming up in
in<00:01:38.549> future<00:01:38.909> video<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.990> setting<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:40.350> for

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
in future video so it's setting up for

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.190 
in future video so it's setting up for
AT&amp;T<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> United<00:01:41.820> States<00:01:42.060> learn<00:01:42.930> how<00:01:43.170> to
