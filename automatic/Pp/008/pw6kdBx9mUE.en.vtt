00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
that we really get are not the best we

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.360 
that we really get are not the best we
get<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.020> few<00:00:34.200> nice<00:00:34.500> brazilian<00:00:34.739> players<00:00:35.130> in

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
get a few nice brazilian players in

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.740 
get a few nice brazilian players in
there<00:00:35.550> like<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.120> back<00:00:36.300> here<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.480> believe

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
there like in this back here I believe

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.869 
there like in this back here I believe
you<00:00:36.840> get<00:00:36.960> malos<00:00:37.410> which<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.800> too<00:00:37.950> bad<00:00:38.160> so

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
you get malos which is not too bad so

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.490 
you get malos which is not too bad so
I'll<00:00:38.940> probably<00:00:39.120> try<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.690> use<00:00:39.960> same<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.350> our

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
I'll probably try and use same in our

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.770 
I'll probably try and use same in our
squad<00:00:40.860> sometimes<00:00:41.309> because<00:00:41.640> he<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.570> very

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
squad sometimes because he is a very

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.510 
squad sometimes because he is a very
good<00:00:42.899> player<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.290> basically<00:00:43.770> ask<00:00:43.920> Walter

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
good player so basically ask Walter

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.010 
good player so basically ask Walter
