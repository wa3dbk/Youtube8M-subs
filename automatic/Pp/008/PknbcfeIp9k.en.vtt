00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.310 
regional shows as a welterweight in a
middleweight<00:00:48.059> because<00:00:48.300> there<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.539> no<00:00:48.750> some<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
middleweight because there is no some of

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.270 
middleweight because there is no some of
the<00:00:49.379> shows<00:00:49.559> don't<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> middle

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280

the shows don't have a middle
welterweight<00:00:50.969> class<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:52.079> always<00:00:52.170> like

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
welterweight class so I was always like

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.130 
welterweight class so I was always like
the<00:00:52.620> smallest<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:54.000> did<00:00:54.210> well<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.809> based<00:00:54.989> on

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the smallest but did well just based on

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.500 
the smallest but did well just based on
my<00:00:55.289> condition<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.820> now<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.390> they

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
my condition but at the now that they

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.430 
my condition but at the now that they
have<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.629> welter<00:00:57.899> weight<00:00:57.930> class<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.350> the

that<00:05:34.419> be<00:05:34.479> well<00:05:34.990> I<00:05:35.020> want<00:05:35.320> to<00:05:35.470> maximize<00:05:35.919> the

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
that be well I want to maximize the

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.330 
that be well I want to maximize the
weight<00:05:37.150> at<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.990> best<00:05:38.229> possible<00:05:38.500> condition<00:05:39.280> I

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
weight at the best possible condition I

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.680 
weight at the best possible condition I
guess<00:05:39.490> everyone's<00:05:39.940> trying<00:05:40.180> to<00:05:40.300> that<00:05:40.419> but<00:05:40.540> I've

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
guess everyone's trying to that but I've

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.690 
guess everyone's trying to that but I've
brought<00:05:40.990> in<00:05:41.290> great<00:05:41.620> condition<00:05:42.160> I<00:05:42.220> know<00:05:42.280> I<00:05:42.400> can

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
brought in great condition I know I can

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.510 
brought in great condition I know I can
do<00:05:42.940> that<00:05:43.150> I<00:05:43.419> just<00:05:43.780> need<00:05:43.990> to<00:05:44.140> maximize<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:45.250> most

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
do that I just need to maximize the most

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.850 
do that I just need to maximize the most
weight<00:05:45.880> I<00:05:45.910> could<00:05:46.240> bring<00:05:46.479> as<00:05:46.720> far<00:05:46.930> as<00:05:47.050> muscle<00:05:47.500> in

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
weight I could bring as far as muscle in

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.909 
weight I could bring as far as muscle in
the<00:05:48.460> class<00:05:48.729> so<00:05:49.240> my<00:05:49.570> goal<00:05:49.810> for<00:05:50.110> next<00:05:50.560> year<00:05:50.770> will

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
the class so my goal for next year will

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.190 
the class so my goal for next year will
be<00:05:51.070> to<00:05:51.250> pack<00:05:51.490> on<00:05:51.729> some<00:05:52.090> good<00:05:52.360> quality<00:05:52.840> muscle

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
be to pack on some good quality muscle

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.590 
be to pack on some good quality muscle
with<00:05:53.530> keeping<00:05:54.310> the<00:05:54.430> solid<00:05:54.850> condition<00:05:55.360> I<00:05:55.450> don't

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
with keeping the solid condition I don't

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.180 
with keeping the solid condition I don't
want<00:05:55.720> to<00:05:55.780> just<00:05:55.930> put<00:05:56.110> on<00:05:56.229> weight<00:05:56.500> to<00:05:56.740> just<00:05:56.979> have

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
want to just put on weight to just have

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.730 
want to just put on weight to just have
weight<00:05:57.460> on<00:05:57.700> the<00:05:57.910> scale<00:05:57.940> but<00:05:58.450> to<00:05:58.990> bring<00:05:59.289> quality

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
weight on the scale but to bring quality

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.279 
weight on the scale but to bring quality
weight<00:06:00.310> back<00:06:00.820> and<00:06:01.150> improve<00:06:01.630> and<00:06:01.900> I<00:06:02.020> think<00:06:02.229> I

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
weight back and improve and I think I

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.529 
weight back and improve and I think I
improved<00:06:02.530> this<00:06:02.770> year<00:06:02.830> my<00:06:03.610> overall<00:06:03.789> physique

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
improved this year my overall physique

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.159 
improved this year my overall physique
was<00:06:05.289> bigger<00:06:05.620> a<00:06:05.740> little<00:06:06.070> better<00:06:06.400> but<00:06:07.090> I<00:06:07.390> this

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
was bigger a little better but I this
