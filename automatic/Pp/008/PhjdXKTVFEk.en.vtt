00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
any okay first we are caramelizing the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.930 
any okay first we are caramelizing the
sugar<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.400> instead<00:01:14.910> of<00:01:15.030> using<00:01:15.290> 1<00:01:16.290> cup<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.560> sugar

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
sugar so instead of using 1 cup of sugar

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.030 
sugar so instead of using 1 cup of sugar
we<00:01:17.940> only<00:01:18.149> put<00:01:18.830> 1/2<00:01:19.830> cup<00:01:19.890> each<00:01:20.610> pan<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.830> just<00:01:22.830> use

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
we only put 1/2 cup each pan I just use

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.240 
we only put 1/2 cup each pan I just use
1/2<00:01:23.340> cup<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.910> sugar<00:01:24.259> so<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> will<00:01:25.590> melt<00:01:25.830> fast

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
1/2 cup of sugar so it will melt fast

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.219 
1/2 cup of sugar so it will melt fast
and<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.610> will<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:26.940> get<00:01:27.180> burned<00:01:29.869> another<00:01:30.869> tip

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
and it will not get burned another tip

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.370 
and it will not get burned another tip
is<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.920> use<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.429> thick<00:01:32.759> pan<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:34.170> sugar

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
is to use a thick pan so that the sugar

is to use a thick pan so that the sugar
when<00:01:34.800> you<00:01:34.920> caramelize<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.700> sugar<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.300> won't

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
when you caramelize the sugar it won't

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.210 
when you caramelize the sugar it won't
get<00:01:36.810> burned<00:01:37.289> easily<00:01:39.560> here's<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.649> completely

caramelized<00:01:42.229> sugar<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.770> pan<00:01:46.970> first<00:01:47.970> we

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
caramelized sugar in a pan first we

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.440 
caramelized sugar in a pan first we
separate<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.050> yolk<00:01:49.259> from<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.649> white<00:01:50.450> because

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
separate the yolk from the white because

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.290 
separate the yolk from the white because
all<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:51.929> need<00:01:52.170> are<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.910> yolk<00:01:53.910> stalks<00:01:56.300> likely

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
all we need are the yolk stalks likely

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.840 
all we need are the yolk stalks likely
mix<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.959> egg<00:01:58.140> now<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.190> pour<00:01:59.550> in<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
mix the egg now we pour in the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.890 
mix the egg now we pour in the
evaporated<00:02:00.720> milk

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.180 

two<00:02:04.530> cans<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.190> evaporated<00:02:05.310> milk<00:02:06.950> mixes<00:02:07.950> and

two cans of evaporated milk mixes and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.780 
two cans of evaporated milk mixes and
then<00:02:08.720> condensed<00:02:09.720> milk<00:02:09.960> we're<00:02:10.740> also<00:02:10.920> using<00:02:11.280> two

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
then condensed milk we're also using two

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.450 
then condensed milk we're also using two
cans<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.240> condensed<00:02:12.660> milk<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:14.010> double

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
cans of condensed milk for this double

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.000 
cans of condensed milk for this double
recipe<00:02:15.920> then<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:17.100> add<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.580> 2<00:02:18.050> TSP<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.350> vanilla

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
recipe then we add in 2 TSP of vanilla

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.090 
recipe then we add in 2 TSP of vanilla
extract<00:02:20.520> mix<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:22.410> all<00:02:22.650> together<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:25.100> we're

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
extract mix it all together and we're

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.420 
extract mix it all together and we're
almost<00:02:26.310> ready<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.880> pour<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.780> pan

almost ready to pour it in the pan
enough<00:02:30.290> now<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.350> pour<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:33.920> mixture<00:02:34.920> milk

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
enough now we pour in the mixture milk

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.110 
enough now we pour in the mixture milk
mixture<00:02:36.030> into<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> pan<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:38.120> another

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.900 
critical another another critical step
is<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.880> use<00:02:44.910> our<00:02:45.270> strainer<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.350> strain<00:02:46.830> all<00:02:47.430> the
