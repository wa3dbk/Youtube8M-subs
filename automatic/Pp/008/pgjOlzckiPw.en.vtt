00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
not only more efficient but deeper and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.210 
not only more efficient but deeper and
the<00:02:27.210> internet<00:02:27.540> has<00:02:27.990> yet<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.650> find<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.950> way<00:02:29.040> that

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
the internet has yet to find a way that

the internet has yet to find a way that
can<00:02:29.310> reproduce<00:02:29.520> them<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:30.420> know<00:02:30.540> if<00:02:30.690> others

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
can reproduce them you know if others

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.760 
can reproduce them you know if others
can<00:02:31.080> say<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.710> can<00:02:31.740> I'm<00:02:32.190> open<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:32.910> but

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
can say that it can I'm open to it but

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.530 
can say that it can I'm open to it but
about<00:02:34.770> human<00:02:35.010> relationships<00:02:35.310> are<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.820> in<00:02:36.180> fact

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540

about human relationships are in in fact
human<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:39.210> know<00:02:39.330> let<00:02:39.870> us<00:02:39.900> use<00:02:40.320> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
human and so you know let us use the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.870 
human and so you know let us use the
internet<00:02:40.740> for<00:02:40.770> all<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.220> gives<00:02:41.520> us<00:02:41.670> and

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
internet for all that it gives us and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.120 
internet for all that it gives us and
all<00:02:42.240> its<00:02:42.420> value<00:02:42.750> but<00:02:43.230> let<00:02:43.380> us<00:02:43.410> not<00:02:43.680> believe

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
all its value but let us not believe

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.050 
all its value but let us not believe
that<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.520> can<00:02:44.610> replace<00:02:44.850> things<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:47.790> are

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
that it can replace things that that are

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.610 
that it can replace things that that are
hard<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.570> replace
