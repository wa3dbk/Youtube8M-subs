00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.500 

okay<00:00:02.010> here<00:00:02.220> we<00:00:02.340> have<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.460> beautiful<00:00:02.730> trumpeter

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
okay here we have a beautiful trumpeter

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.570 
okay here we have a beautiful trumpeter
clock<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.049> this<00:00:04.110> clock<00:00:04.380> was<00:00:04.589> made<00:00:04.859> by<00:00:05.040> Amelia

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
clock and this clock was made by Amelia

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.930 
clock and this clock was made by Amelia
nearly<00:00:06.060> and<00:00:06.210> Ferg<00:00:06.420> tried<00:00:06.660> in<00:00:06.839> Germany<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.680> the

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
nearly and Ferg tried in Germany in the

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.299 
nearly and Ferg tried in Germany in the
late<00:00:08.940> 1860's<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.740> an<00:00:10.889> early<00:00:11.280> example

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
late 1860's so this is an early example

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.070 
late 1860's so this is an early example
of<00:00:12.000> his<00:00:12.150> work<00:00:13.759> and<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.969> clock<00:00:15.210> uses<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> large

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
of his work and the clock uses a large

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.730 
of his work and the clock uses a large
robust<00:00:16.710> wood<00:00:17.190> plate<00:00:17.520> movement<00:00:18.380> with<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> large

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
robust wood plate movement with a large

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.769 
robust wood plate movement with a large
wind<00:00:20.070> chest<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> double<00:00:21.119> pumping<00:00:21.510> bellow

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
wind chest and the double pumping bellow

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.040 
wind chest and the double pumping bellow
system<00:00:22.410> with<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> pen<00:00:23.609> music<00:00:24.090> wheel<00:00:24.269> to

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
system with the pen music wheel to

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.560 
system with the pen music wheel to
reproduce<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.800> complex<00:00:26.460> musical<00:00:27.029> trumpeters

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
reproduce a complex musical trumpeters

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.019 
reproduce a complex musical trumpeters
tune<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.859> top<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.279> each<00:00:29.400> hour<00:00:29.640> or

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
tune at the top of each hour or

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.980 
tune at the top of each hour or
on-demand

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
on-demand

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.590 
on-demand
so<00:00:31.830> these<00:00:31.980> trumpeter<00:00:32.460> clocks<00:00:32.759> vary<00:00:33.090> both<00:00:33.390> in

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
so these trumpeter clocks vary both in

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.620 
so these trumpeter clocks vary both in
size<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.260> complexity<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:36.030> smaller

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
size and complexity of the smaller

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.440 
size and complexity of the smaller
blower<00:00:37.079> style<00:00:37.559> trumpeters<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.940> utilize<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
blower style trumpeters that utilize a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.799 
blower style trumpeters that utilize a
simple<00:00:40.050> cuckoo<00:00:40.440> movement<00:00:40.879> that<00:00:41.879> reproduce<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
simple cuckoo movement that reproduce a

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.860 
simple cuckoo movement that reproduce a
simple<00:00:43.200> bugle<00:00:43.710> call<00:00:43.980> once<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:45.059> each<00:00:45.090> hour<00:00:45.450> so

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
simple bugle call once for each hour so

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.170 
simple bugle call once for each hour so
these<00:00:46.620> clocks<00:00:46.920> were<00:00:47.160> much<00:00:47.370> more<00:00:47.610> rare<00:00:47.910> there

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
these clocks were much more rare there

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.840 
these clocks were much more rare there
were<00:00:48.270> much<00:00:48.450> more<00:00:48.660> complex<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.670> today<00:00:50.670> they're

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
were much more complex and today they're

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.420 
were much more complex and today they're
much<00:00:51.000> more<00:00:51.210> collectible<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
much more collectible you can see the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.970 
much more collectible you can see the
clock<00:00:53.640> has<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> beautiful<00:00:54.620> walnut<00:00:55.620> case<00:00:57.949> has<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
clock has a beautiful walnut case has a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.170 
clock has a beautiful walnut case has a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
twigs and roots twist and wrap and it's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.520 
twigs and roots twist and wrap and it's
hard<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.149> capture<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.780> video<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.380> this

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
hard to capture in a video but this

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.410 
hard to capture in a video but this
whole<00:02:04.770> front<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.250> clock<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.700> round<00:02:06.030> so

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
whole front of the clock is round so

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.139 
whole front of the clock is round so
this<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.719> not<00:02:06.869> flat<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.680> there's<00:02:08.489> domes<00:02:08.819> out

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
this is not flat but there's domes out

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.490 
this is not flat but there's domes out
into<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.720> room

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.150 

you<00:02:12.920> can<00:02:13.100> see<00:02:13.340> it's<00:02:13.490> just<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.730> beautiful<00:02:15.160> carved

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
you can see it's just a beautiful carved

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.460 
you can see it's just a beautiful carved
example<00:02:19.210> this<00:02:20.210> clock<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:20.630> just<00:02:20.660> undergone<00:02:21.440> a
