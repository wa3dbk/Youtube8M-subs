00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello girls welcome once again the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.270
 today we will learn how to give them 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.510
 a pretty shape to our eyebrows plus 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.059
 how to keep them from home for all 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.549
 this we need a pencil eyeliner in 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.890
 white color other pencil of any 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.529
 color simply make it a pencil a 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.570
 eyebrow clamp if you get one that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.369
 have the point quite thin because 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.260
 It will be much better some brush 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.930
 to comb your eyebrows as you can see 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.179
 This is a little brush from a mask 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.309
 eyelashes and what I did was clean it 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.690
 very well wait for it to dry and that's 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.820
 what I use to clean my set also 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.399
 we are going to need a shadow for eyebrows 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.350
 in a light brown color other in the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.270
 dark brown color and a little 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.530
 corrector and a brush to apply the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.629
 right you can have all these 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.280
 materials at hand let's start what 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.170
 first thing we're going to do is define the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.360
 shape of our eyebrows we are going to locate 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.329
 the pencil eyeliner on the tip of 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.430
 our nose like that and the other end what 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.010
 let's align with the the place where 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.690
 begins our eye is to say that there is 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.449
 where you should start the asses then 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.670
 we simply mark a dot above 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.340
 in this way and a point down 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.290
 in this way and there we are seeing which one 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.720
 is going to be the thickness of the eyebrow now 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.700
 we again mark we put the pencil 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.000
 eyeliner at the tip of national and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.430
 Looking ahead, let's locate it by 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.560
 where does the pupil of the eye pass? 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.270
 the pupil is not in the middle of the eye 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.520
 that's where it's going to be like the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.170
 curvita of the points is marked here and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.000
 we mark down also in this way 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.920
 now again putting the pencil in the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.600
 tip of the nose but this time where 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.610
 ends the eye that means that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.439
 that's where the cee should come 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 then there we mark a dot too 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.580
 now having all these points what 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.039
 let's just do is join them 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.409
 all and we're going to grab the same pencil 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.970
 eyeliner as a kind of rule and the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.640
 let's start to unite all simply 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.830
 good takes out and what he's going to do is make 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.830
 we mark up first and now we mark 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.060
 something strange is that it will stay and not 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.370
 be scared but what are we going to do 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.320
 now it is to take our eyebrow tweezers and 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.530
 we are going to remove all the little vellitos 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.360
 that are above and below or above 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.360
 that white line here we are going to do 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.000
 then never feel that I have taken you away 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.130
 all the little things what we do 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.480
 it is simply to clean all those goods 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.370
 white with a washcloth 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.930
 make-up remover or with your make-up remover 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.580
 favorite another thing you can do to 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.220
 that your eyebrows look like more 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.380
 squares is combing them a bit towards 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.670
 up like this and the part that 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.319
 it's on the sides of just actions 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.239
 that then all these hairs that you 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.100
 you see here the one that stand out you can 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.560
 cut with a little scissors and at that step 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.150
 I do it because if I cut all of his 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.100
 tickets then my eyebrows are going to see 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.989
 much thinner because I already have it 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.730
 pretty thin then just what 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.320
 what I do is comb the ones and put them in their 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.420
 site but if you have eyebrows 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.709
 thick you can remove these hairs 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.239
 with a strip what we are going to do is 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.040
 make up our eyebrows a little to 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.050
 cover all those holes that are there 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.390
 as open where they lack little hairs 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.760
 something like that then what I do is that 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.040
 it took some of the clearest shadow 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.440
 where is the eyebrow and I'm going like doing it 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.360
 as an outline only on the principle of 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.430
 the cee as you can see here on this side 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.270
 I do not do it square because actually 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.580
 Eyebrows 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.740
 to go as if blurring from the most 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.510
 clear up to the darkest thing up until 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.370
 until the end then if I do 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.290
 here as a square you will see an eyebrow 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.810
 as too marked then I 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.030
 I simply frame here what is like 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.070
 contour of the eyebrows and already this part the 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.080
 left free I do not have to do it like a 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.970
 square stripe because it is not necessary 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.160
 now with that same shadow clarita I'm going 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.140
 as filling and you always have to 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.810
 Follow the natural shape of your eyebrow 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.950
 go to do like an eyebrow and lie 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.900
 because that is going to notice too much 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.290
 always follow the natural way of your 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.030
 eyebrow 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.950
 now with the darkest shadow then 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.930
 I'm going to outline what the rest of 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.760
 the eyebrow is to say the part of here below 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.590
 so how can you see if that 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.570
 effect that goes as from the clearest 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.610
 even the darkest can realize 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.860
 I'm using the same brush that 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.690
 they bring the eyebrow shadows but if you 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.830
 you have an ice cream service, this one is 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.200
 as an angle you can use it 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.880
 perfectly I use it actually this 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.250
 for comfort for not having to be 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.440
 washing other brush and cough after but 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.940
 if you have a big one like I said 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.040
 you can use perfectly if you want 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.080
 achieve a slightly cleaner effect in 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.970
 the eyebrow this we can accommodate with a 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.510
 little bit of concealer and we're just going 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.030
 to 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.400
 the corrector and we are applying it just 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.960
 below the eyebrows in this way 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.280
 besides that in this way we are also going 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.990
 to illuminate a little this area 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.090
 It also looks great and we do this 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.100
 below and above with this that 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.530
 we are achieving is how to clean 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.540
 it was like a little bit or like excess 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.220
 shadows and maybe the shadow came off a 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.590
 little bit then with this we are 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.940
 achieving that effect and now with those 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.430
 fingers because we're just going to go 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.500
 blurring everything is correct and that's how it is 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.090
 how is the end result you 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.100
 I recommend that when you go to epilate 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.080
 the eyebrows is to have a place where there 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.610
 much clarity because there are little 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.170
 they are very young and do not look simple 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.580
 view and you know that the more 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.470
 practice then the better will be the 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.070
 results so that's been all for 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.950
 today 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.690
 I hope you liked it and it worked for you

 also how to pluck eyebrows from 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.340

 power state and I love it because it covers what 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.950
 enough and makes me not that I do not 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.920
 I go so fast so brillitos 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.310
 my skin remains matt for several hours 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.310
 of the day
