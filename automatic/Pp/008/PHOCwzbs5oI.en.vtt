using a different keep I'm trying to

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.920 
using a different keep I'm trying to
think<00:01:37.340> her<00:01:38.340> best<00:01:38.700> way<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.780> use<00:01:39.900> a

think her best way to do it to use a
different<00:01:40.020> key<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.710> Barry<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.280> truly<00:01:41.970> one

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
different key because Barry is truly one

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.760 
different key because Barry is truly one
can<00:01:42.360> that's<00:01:42.540> what<00:01:42.720> let<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.110> team<00:01:43.320> down<00:01:43.560> was
