food you know just basic dragon bearded
dragon<00:00:51.059> food<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.480> she<00:00:51.780> doesn't<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:52.860> eat

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
dragon food but she doesn't really eat

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.500 
dragon food but she doesn't really eat
it<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.399> some<00:00:54.120> calcium<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:56.270> think<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.420> was

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
it and some calcium so I think it was

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.750 
it and some calcium so I think it was
about<00:00:57.600> 150<00:00:58.260> was<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.559> sale<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.699> a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
about 150 was on sale but it was a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
about 150 was on sale but it was a
pretty<00:00:59.910> good<00:01:00.090> price<00:01:02.719> so<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.899> decided<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.739> go

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
pretty good price so we decided to go

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.130 
pretty good price so we decided to go
with<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.640> different<00:01:06.330> type<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.479> setup<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.900> know

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
with a different type of setup you know

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.350 
with a different type of setup you know
usually<00:01:07.920> people<00:01:07.950> either<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:08.850> sand<00:01:09.090> or

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
usually people either just have sand or

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.399 
usually people either just have sand or
have<00:01:09.570> carpet<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.409> both<00:01:10.560> um<00:01:12.320> we<00:01:13.320> were

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
have carpet but we have both um we were

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.750 
have carpet but we have both um we were
kind<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> hesitant<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.100> use<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.520> hand

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
kind of hesitant to use this hand

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
kind of hesitant to use this hand
because<00:01:15.030> we've<00:01:15.180> heard<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.450> many<00:01:15.509> bad<00:01:15.750> things

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
because we've heard so many bad things

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.660 
because we've heard so many bad things
about<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.409> big<00:01:17.100> dragons<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.580> get

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
about it that big dragons can get

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.060 
about it that big dragons can get
impacted<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:19.259> could<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.439> really<00:01:19.590> bad<00:01:19.680> for

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
impacted and it could be really bad for

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.350 
impacted and it could be really bad for
them<00:01:20.159> maybe<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.000> even<00:01:21.299> some

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
them maybe I'm I think even some

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.429 
them maybe I'm I think even some
respiratory<00:01:21.930> problems<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:23.130> um<00:01:23.630> I<00:01:24.630> haven't

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
respiratory problems but um I haven't

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
respiratory problems but um I haven't
really<00:01:25.619> seen<00:01:25.770> any<00:01:26.009> issues<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.460> her<00:01:26.689> eating

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
really seen any issues with her eating

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.390 
really seen any issues with her eating
it<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:28.170> digesting<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.890> mean<00:01:29.040> she<00:01:29.159> doesn't

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
it or digesting it I mean she doesn't

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.980 
it or digesting it I mean she doesn't
just<00:01:29.520> sit<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:29.909> eat<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.420> anything

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
just sit there and eat it or anything

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.859 
just sit there and eat it or anything
she<00:01:31.470> might<00:01:31.740> um<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.299> little<00:01:33.540> bit<00:01:33.659> one

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
she might um in just a little bit one

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.010 
she might um in just a little bit one
maybe<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.170> cricket<00:01:34.530> runs<00:01:34.710> over<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:36.020> she

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
maybe a cricket runs over there and she

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.230 
maybe a cricket runs over there and she
eats<00:01:37.140> him<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.860> mean<00:01:38.549> she<00:01:38.670> poops<00:01:38.880> every<00:01:39.090> day

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
eats him but I mean she poops every day

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.990 
eats him but I mean she poops every day
she's<00:01:39.869> able<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> digest<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.130> that's<00:01:41.909> all

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
she's able to digest it so that's all

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.240 
she's able to digest it so that's all
I'm<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.270> worried<00:01:42.600> about<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:43.619> clean

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
I'm really worried about I clean

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.240 
I'm really worried about I clean
everyday<00:01:44.640> her<00:01:45.540> poop<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.110> know<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:47.009> she<00:01:47.220> is

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
everyday her poop so I know that she is

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.830 
everyday her poop so I know that she is
digesting<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> we<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.329> carpet

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
digesting it so we do have the carpet

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.200 
digesting it so we do have the carpet
here<00:01:52.200> where<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> food<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.090> because<00:01:54.090> we

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
here where the food is because we

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.630 
here where the food is because we
figured<00:01:54.509> only<00:01:54.720> put<00:01:54.899> some<00:01:55.079> worms<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.490> know

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
figured only put some worms or you know

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.749 
figured only put some worms or you know
her<00:01:56.850> leafy<00:01:57.719> greens<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.590> carrots<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.549> stuff

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
her leafy greens and carrots and stuff

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.130 
her leafy greens and carrots and stuff
like<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.450> they<00:02:00.570> did<00:02:00.719> fall<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
like that that if they did fall in the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.139 
like that that if they did fall in the
sand<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:01.770> she<00:02:01.950> would<00:02:02.100> obviously<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.850> more

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
sand then she would obviously be more

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.240 
sand then she would obviously be more
prone<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.979> ingesting<00:02:04.979> sand<00:02:06.020> but<00:02:07.160> it's<00:02:08.160> been

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
prone to ingesting sand but it's been

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.350 
prone to ingesting sand but it's been
working<00:02:08.429> out<00:02:08.580> great<00:02:08.729> she<00:02:09.000> does<00:02:09.149> get<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
working out great she does get the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.020 
working out great she does get the
calcium<00:02:09.569> everywhere<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.259> course<00:02:10.319> but<00:02:10.679> she

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
calcium everywhere of course but she

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.580 
calcium everywhere of course but she
digs<00:02:12.030> into<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.629> bowl

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
digs into the bowl

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.070 
digs into the bowl
but<00:02:14.310> that's<00:02:14.849> easier<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.330> clean<00:02:15.540> than<00:02:15.750> having

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
but that's easier to clean than having

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.330 
but that's easier to clean than having
to<00:02:16.170> clean<00:02:16.349> out<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.650> sand<00:02:16.830> because<00:02:16.920> if<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.190> can

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
to clean out the sand because if you can

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.530 
to clean out the sand because if you can
see<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.569> sands<00:02:18.810> actually<00:02:19.230> pretty<00:02:19.500> clean

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
see like the sands actually pretty clean

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.930 
see like the sands actually pretty clean
it<00:02:21.540> sparkles<00:02:22.140> too<00:02:22.379> all<00:02:23.099> right<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:23.459> okay

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
it sparkles too all right it's okay

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.949 
it sparkles too all right it's okay
but<00:02:24.660> um<00:02:24.900> yeah<00:02:25.830> then<00:02:26.489> um<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:27.510> rock<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.930> she's

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
but um yeah then um this rock that she's

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.500

this side of the tank to get closer to

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.840 
this side of the tank to get closer to
the<00:03:17.910> UVB<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.329> she<00:03:18.540> uses<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.870> like<00:03:19.139> crazy

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
this side of the tank is stays around 80

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.569 
this side of the tank is stays around 80
to<00:03:22.530> 85<00:03:22.980> degrees<00:03:23.450> depending<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:24.540> how<00:03:24.920> hot<00:03:25.920> my

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
to 85 degrees depending on how hot my

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:27.770 
to 85 degrees depending on how hot my
house<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:26.940> right<00:03:27.120> now<00:03:27.239> it's<00:03:27.359> pretty<00:03:27.540> hot<00:03:27.660> it's

like 90 degrees outside and super humid
so<00:03:30.049> probably<00:03:31.049> turn<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.260> air<00:03:31.380> on<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.590> little<00:03:31.889> bit

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
so probably turn the air on a little bit

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.030 
so probably turn the air on a little bit
um<00:03:32.790> we<00:03:33.450> have<00:03:33.599> her<00:03:33.750> little<00:03:33.930> swimming<00:03:34.650> pool<00:03:34.829> back

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
bit of energy stuff like that and I

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.780 
bit of energy stuff like that and I
really<00:04:01.319> recommend<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:01.799> because<00:04:01.889> I<00:04:02.099> believe<00:04:02.639> it
