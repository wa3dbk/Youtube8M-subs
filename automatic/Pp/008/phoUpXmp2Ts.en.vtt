about<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.670> that<00:00:38.719> on<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> very<00:00:39.989> front

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
about this is that on the very front

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.340

there's an outside zipper and inside

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.490 
there's an outside zipper and inside
it's<00:00:43.620> very<00:00:44.250> small<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> fit<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.350> my

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
