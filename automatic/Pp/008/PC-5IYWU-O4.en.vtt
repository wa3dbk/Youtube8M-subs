00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.710
 a further welcome to one 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.780
 new sequence form the thursday 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.550
 Last week I have my top 3 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.710
 summer salads presented the more 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.240
 had posted today on thursday 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.800
 until twelve o'clock at night is also the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.330
 Last chance for your favorites 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.340
 voting does not mean yet 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.470
 made you watch the video was 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.850
 last week and agrees again from 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.710
 with a thumbs up for yours 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.519
 favorites 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.500
 so now only one today 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.599
 relatively small video a relative 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.250
 simple recipe by the last week 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.469
 so elaborate or to turn 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.120
 three different salads at the same time 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.160
 three different videos about four 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.290
 different videos at the same time 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.140
 is a hammering day to turn it all 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.239
 and therefore something relatively simple 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.070
 but no less neckar that's real 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.870
 mega broken definitely out of it is 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.670
 One of those recipes was one of those 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.680
 do it again and again and almost one 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.500
 vegan you have to chocolat with a super 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.590
 delicious topping on top of that really 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.420
 again the coast of the more right 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.770
 even tastier makes us have too 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.710
 the only way you have to chocolat 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.350
 it is followed by a packet of his 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.650
 tofu a 100 gram blackboard dark 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.540
 chocolate 1 packet vanilla sugar and 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.310
 optional still a shot around if you 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.869
 I also want to omit 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.850
 needed the last sentence my computer 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.830
 broke down and the whole night too long 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.360
 needed and I really did somehow 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.229
 hung at three o'clock at night and stuff like that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.140
 May I have a mousse au chocolat 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.080
 made with a shot around because that 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.390
 had to be real somehow then found 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.430
 just so that you have the chocolate in it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.110
 melt water bath and then in the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.329
 in the meantime have the whole stop 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.100
 you can slowly melt away 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.890
 then his tofu nice 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.590
 Stir frothy with one if we 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.540
 quite normal hand mixer and then too 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.159
 directly in shot with it if you 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.560
 want to have and of course 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.040
 aspects of vanilla sugar and then then 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.080
 easy 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.610
 Add molten chocolate mass 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.860
 and watch your motto show cola 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.660
 you can do it all in glasses 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.730
 bottling like I do this here 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.100
 this mason jars or a whole 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.750
 normal bowls and all the wheel in the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.900
 put fridge a bit cold 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.170
 and that's really mega neckar you can 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.610
 then just a finished soya tub 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.460
 For example, take the has from 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.690
 all vegetarian de who received the 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.880
 are already a bit older or 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.350
 I have a rough night again 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.250
 done the following, and I've 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.860
 even better burned plaid like 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.120
 It says kaschin is made and pays 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.100
 you just make that easy 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.410
 A fireproof vessel accepts such a 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.890
 ceramic bowls or something is there 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.840
 two tablespoons two to three tablespoons 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.020
 dark dark sugar so brown 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.570
 pure cane then either too 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.459
 two or three tablespoons or in the 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.070
 water or me both that year 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.020
 on two to three tablespoons of liquid 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.290
 also comes and he is a good 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.880
 handful of kashin kernels pure and mixed 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.130
 quite as well through and then in two 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.050
 minutes in the microwave 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.920
 give 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.780
 you really have to do that somehow 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.940
 be careful sometimes it is already 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.890
 three times these two minutes too much 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.570
 sometimes you need three times two 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.910
 minutes almost always in between 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.290
 Take a break to touch and then for 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.850
 another two minutes in the microwave 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.980
 give and then you have livestock from 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.980
 Christmas market roasted almonds have 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.410
 you keep burnt cashew kernels and the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.170
 you can then simply on baking paper 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.180
 Add or cool on slab paper 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.610
 let and then then easy 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.730
 nice crumble and with on the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.799
 Colleagues or tasted so delicious 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.720
 the unconditioned outside of the variant but 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.570
 also the mousse au chocolat itself or 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.340
 with cream tasted totally delicious 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.790
 any case we'll see you here directly 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.560

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.870
 favorites for the summer salad i 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.340
 I'm curious who your favorite is there 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.930
 that still has a real head 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.610
 head if everything is still open 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.519
 if you have not voted how 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.250
