00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.319
 Welcome to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.000
 four 7.0 in a short shirt and for 200 euros 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.700
 samsung once again has a tablet 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.500
 something from the front in the market 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 actually looks like the samsung 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.990
 galaxy s 5 we have it here again 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.390
 nice chrome frame then of course once 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.470
 the two android buttons and a button 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.240
 with the wii the tablet again and again 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.970
 if we can not wake up laterally 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.140
 want to press the button as synonymous with 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.250
 smartphones already used so here's the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.779
 on and off switch the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.879
 volume control and also a micro sd 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.690
 card slot around the 8 gigabytes internal 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.969
 expand memory 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.710
 2 176 grams, the device of the mine weighs 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.840
 marvel quad core processor in there 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.000
 one has gigabyte ram and a 3 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.820
 megapixel camera behind and a 1.3 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.350
 megapixel camera in front at the bottom 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.420
 of course a micro-usb connection with it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.670
 We can not charge the usb for the money 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.860
 3 and no closure that is it 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.270
 Of course we are not waterproof 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.680
 have a headphone jack on top and 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.960
 by the way, you have the backside right now 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.340
 already seen slightly roughened and always 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.370
 interesting surface but completely off 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.600
 Plastic feels like I would say 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.430
 controversial 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.350
 Of course there is something in the hand 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.369
 Non-slip but it feels 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.530
 very cheap 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.229
 in comparison, the LG for example 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.890
 also has a lg pad 7.0 at the infrared 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.960
 forward with it 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.310
 better processors better display in 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.409
 7 inch area for the same price 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.210
 I will definitely feels as 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.110
 In any case, much higher quality 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.520
 ours feels the asus eee pad seven hd 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.890
 I feel better too 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 then in comparison with me later more 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.920
 otherwise we will sink very briefly 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.250
 Of course here is the new kit kat 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.200
 surface of samsung where we have one here 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.400
 still relatively due to surface 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.710
 but also down here 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.000
 google search same with us if we 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.229
 below, of course, on the little icon 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.090
 can go see us what the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.479
 programs outside we are from hungary 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.340
 that's why a few are dedicated 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.869
 still on it but otherwise the standard 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.399
 Of course we already have google apps 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.950
 I know I'll take a quick look at the camera 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.990
 on it and then you see me already 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.280
 always from camera to wide angle so 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.780
 I do not have to sit far away 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.520
 you can even see my camera 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.719
 here half fits in the picture and if 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.430
 I now briefly the rear camera 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.540
 look at me then we can do that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.710
 Training stop picture here too 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.239
 look where we are here in one 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.470
 shopping center and here are the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.190
 speed could I have something 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.800
 be better but otherwise one 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.900
 I totally okay the camera for smaller ones 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 snapshots if we are still short 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.950
 in the browser you have seen 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.920
 the display rotates relatively slowly resp 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.160
 disgusting that is by no means 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.420
 a top product if we look at the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.340
 short keyboard look even without wifi 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.420
 you can see that you are fine here 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.010
 but what you can type on it 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.540
 speed and also respectively 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.060
 of course I have a lot more to do 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.810
 place then according to our texts 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.480
 enter 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.380
 on the samsung galaxy tab 47,000 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.730
 I hope you liked it 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.710
 I especially like the thin one here 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.290
 Screen frame the price could still 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.910
 well below 200 euros, there are 150 130 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.890
 euro will hopefully that will end 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.960
 yet but definitely will by then 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.920
 a solid product from samsung with 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.780
 of course strong competition 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.410
 Meanwhile in financial trouble has until the 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.300
 next time 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.670
 my name is pascal and that of samsung 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.670
 nx11 your 7.0 in the first dealers
