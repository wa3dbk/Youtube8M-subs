and we won't be able to do any work
until<00:02:27.130> after<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.549> so<00:02:28.420> its<00:02:28.510> all<00:02:28.720> turning<00:02:29.019> into

a nightmare I'm just back from the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.170 
a nightmare I'm just back from the
council<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.400> they've<00:02:36.400> said<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
council and they've said that the

by<00:02:50.109> anybody<00:02:50.670> basically<00:02:51.670> they've<00:02:51.880> said<00:02:52.209> that

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
by anybody basically they've said that

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.880 
by anybody basically they've said that
we<00:02:53.350> had<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.560> warrant<00:02:54.070> that<00:02:54.640> allowed<00:02:55.060> us<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.890> work

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
we had a warrant that allowed us to work

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.130 
we had a warrant that allowed us to work
we<00:02:57.190> work<00:02:57.670> around<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.239> existing<00:02:58.720> building

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
we work around the existing building

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.690 
we work around the existing building
that<00:02:59.290> we've<00:02:59.440> got<00:02:59.680> which<00:02:59.980> there<00:03:00.400> was<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.519> couple

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
that we've got which there was a couple

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.780 
that we've got which there was a couple
of<00:03:00.850> walls<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.180> bit<00:03:01.329> left<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.799> they<00:03:03.549> weren't

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
of walls a bit left and they weren't

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.309 
of walls a bit left and they weren't
sound<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.269> we've<00:03:04.420> knocked<00:03:04.600> them<00:03:04.810> down<00:03:05.019> to

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
sound so we've knocked them down to

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.380 
sound so we've knocked them down to
rebuild<00:03:05.739> them<00:03:05.890> again<00:03:06.160> but<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.760> knocking<00:03:07.030> them

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
rebuild them again but in knocking them

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.559 
rebuild them again but in knocking them
down<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:08.590> warrant<00:03:09.100> on<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:10.030> building<00:03:10.450> is

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
down that warrant on that building is

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.960 
down that warrant on that building is
now<00:03:10.780> no<00:03:11.170> longer<00:03:11.200> valid<00:03:11.769> because<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.640> building

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
now no longer valid because the building

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.090 
now no longer valid because the building
doesn't<00:03:13.090> exist<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.410> even<00:03:14.650> though<00:03:14.680> it's<00:03:14.889> pretty

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
doesn't exist so even though it's pretty

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.370 
doesn't exist so even though it's pretty
much<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.370> same<00:03:15.819> thing<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.389> I<00:03:16.959> spent<00:03:17.170> two

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
much the same thing and I spent two

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.170 
much the same thing and I spent two
thousand<00:03:17.829> pounds<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.459> waited<00:03:18.850> six<00:03:19.120> months

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
thousand pounds and waited six months

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.180 
thousand pounds and waited six months
for<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.690> warrant<00:03:20.049> from<00:03:20.260> them<00:03:20.819> they<00:03:21.819> have

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
for the warrant from them they have

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.710 
for the warrant from them they have
cancelled<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.579> said<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:25.000> it's<00:03:25.180> now

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
cancelled that and said that it's now

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.620 
cancelled that and said that it's now
wasted<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.580> we've<00:03:27.670> had<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.910> resubmit<00:03:28.240> for<00:03:28.600> a

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
wasted so we've had to resubmit for a

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.840 
wasted so we've had to resubmit for a
new<00:03:28.780> warrant<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.560> it's<00:03:30.010> illegal<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.490> start

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
new warrant and it's illegal to start

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.310 
new warrant and it's illegal to start
work<00:03:31.120> without<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:32.490> but<00:03:33.660> they<00:03:34.660> said<00:03:34.990> that<00:03:35.170> we

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
work without that but they said that we

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.940 
work without that but they said that we
can<00:03:35.590> start<00:03:36.010> work<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:37.090> while<00:03:38.020> they<00:03:38.290> they<00:03:38.710> look

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
can start work and while they they look

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.230 
can start work and while they they look
through<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.280> warrant<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.790> we<00:03:39.880> can<00:03:40.030> hopefully

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
through the warrant and we can hopefully

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.560 
through the warrant and we can hopefully
move<00:03:40.570> things<00:03:40.810> forward<00:03:41.050> a<00:03:41.230> bit<00:03:41.380> quicker<00:03:42.570> the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
move things forward a bit quicker the

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.270 
move things forward a bit quicker the
other<00:03:43.720> thing<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:43.960> that<00:03:44.440> they're<00:03:44.950> obviously

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
other thing is that they're obviously

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.640 
other thing is that they're obviously
they're<00:03:46.150> not<00:03:46.270> happy<00:03:46.510> about<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.990> foundations

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
they're not happy about the foundations

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.090 
they're not happy about the foundations
that<00:03:47.860> we've<00:03:48.160> got<00:03:48.430> important<00:03:49.270> place<00:03:49.540> and

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
that we've got important place and

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.340 
that we've got important place and
particularly<00:03:51.100> this<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.910> steps<00:03:52.450> here<00:03:52.780> which

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
particularly this the steps here which

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.020 
particularly this the steps here which
are<00:03:53.530> throughout<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:53.980> whole<00:03:54.280> thing<00:03:54.580> and

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
are throughout the whole thing and

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.900 
are throughout the whole thing and
underneath<00:03:55.660> here<00:03:56.020> was<00:03:56.230> bed<00:03:56.710> rock<00:03:56.980> solid<00:03:57.430> rock

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
underneath here was bed rock solid rock

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.620 
underneath here was bed rock solid rock
and<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:59.560> problem<00:04:00.190> that<00:04:00.730> we<00:04:00.880> had<00:04:01.060> was<00:04:01.090> there

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
and the problem that we had was there

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.360 
and the problem that we had was there
was<00:04:01.720> rock<00:04:01.959> everywhere<00:04:02.320> without<00:04:02.709> digging<00:04:03.160> out

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
was rock everywhere without digging out

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.790 
was rock everywhere without digging out
solid<00:04:04.000> rock<00:04:04.030> because<00:04:04.990> this<00:04:05.110> is<00:04:05.230> just<00:04:05.260> built<00:04:05.650> on

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
solid rock because this is just built on

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.710 
solid rock because this is just built on
a<00:04:05.830> huge<00:04:06.220> rock<00:04:06.520> then<00:04:07.180> it<00:04:07.360> would<00:04:07.480> be<00:04:07.600> very

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
a huge rock then it would be very

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.140 
a huge rock then it would be very
difficult<00:04:08.020> for<00:04:08.530> us<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.880> lay<00:04:10.030> the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
difficult for us to to lay the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.760 
difficult for us to to lay the
foundation<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:10.810> they're<00:04:10.959> all<00:04:11.050> step<00:04:11.440> like<00:04:11.740> this

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
foundation so they're all step like this

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.280 
foundation so they're all step like this
but<00:04:12.730> they<00:04:12.820> weren't<00:04:12.970> happy<00:04:13.420> about<00:04:13.450> these<00:04:13.900> steps

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
but they weren't happy about these steps

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.560 
but they weren't happy about these steps
they<00:04:14.560> thought<00:04:14.830> that<00:04:15.120> there<00:04:16.120> may<00:04:16.330> not<00:04:16.510> be

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
they thought that there may not be

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.440 
they thought that there may not be
enough<00:04:16.959> clearance<00:04:17.950> underneath<00:04:18.640> them<00:04:18.970> in

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
enough clearance underneath them in

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.200 
enough clearance underneath them in
effect<00:04:20.019> what<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:20.410> means<00:04:20.680> is<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:20.980> if<00:04:21.850> the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
effect what that means is that if the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.180 
effect what that means is that if the
two<00:04:22.360> steps<00:04:22.690> are<00:04:22.840> like<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.140> they<00:04:23.410> can't<00:04:24.070> be

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
two steps are like that they can't be

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.400 
two steps are like that they can't be
like<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:25.660> that<00:04:25.840> would<00:04:25.930> leave<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:26.140> thin

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
like that and that would leave a thin

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.780 
like that and that would leave a thin
bit<00:04:26.590> they<00:04:26.680> have<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:26.980> have<00:04:27.100> an<00:04:27.220> overlap<00:04:27.610> like

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
bit they have to have an overlap like

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.700 
bit they have to have an overlap like
this<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.210> they<00:04:28.690> weren't<00:04:28.900> sure<00:04:29.200> that<00:04:29.230> we<00:04:29.530> had

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
this and they weren't sure that we had

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.940 
this and they weren't sure that we had
the<00:04:29.860> right<00:04:30.010> overlap<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.330> we<00:04:32.230> do<00:04:32.410> but

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
the right overlap so and we do but

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.920 
the right overlap so and we do but
anyway<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.430> we've<00:04:33.940> got<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.180> engineer

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
anyway the we've got a engineer

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.450 
anyway the we've got a engineer
certificate<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:35.500> they've<00:04:35.650> now<00:04:35.890> been<00:04:36.130> signed

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
certificate and they've now been signed

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.080 
certificate and they've now been signed
off<00:04:36.610> so<00:04:36.990> we<00:04:37.990> can<00:04:38.200> begin<00:04:38.830> work<00:04:39.220> at<00:04:39.490> last<00:04:39.760> and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
off so we can begin work at last and

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.030 
off so we can begin work at last and
hopefully<00:04:40.660> we'll<00:04:40.870> we'll<00:04:41.560> meet<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.890> next

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
hopefully we'll we'll meet the next

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.750 
hopefully we'll we'll meet the next
deadline<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:44.530> next<00:04:44.830> day<00:04:44.950> things<00:04:45.250> continued

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
deadline the next day things continued

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.969 
deadline the next day things continued
at<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:45.910> pace<00:04:46.150> again<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:47.470> we<00:04:47.620> started<00:04:47.890> putting

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
at a pace again and we started putting

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.980 
at a pace again and we started putting
the<00:04:48.130> block<00:04:48.340> work<00:04:48.580> up<00:04:48.850> for<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.630> foundations

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
the block work up for the foundations

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.060 
the block work up for the foundations
the<00:04:52.990> building<00:04:53.320> warrant<00:04:53.620> was<00:04:53.740> with<00:04:53.919> the

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
the building warrant was with the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.860 
the building warrant was with the
council<00:04:54.580> with<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:54.970> sixteen<00:04:55.419> hundred<00:04:55.690> quid
