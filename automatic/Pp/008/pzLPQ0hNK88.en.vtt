so let's get to going here this one no
you<00:00:58.920> make<00:00:59.129> banana<00:00:59.340> copper<00:01:02.840> okay<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.220> is

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
you make banana copper okay and this is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.870 
you make banana copper okay and this is
two<00:01:06.770> together<00:01:07.770> right<00:01:08.280> okay

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
two together right okay

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.820 
two together right okay
a<00:01:08.909> little<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.450> little<00:01:09.570> light<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.470> take<00:01:10.680> it

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
a little a little light going on take it

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.440 
a little a little light going on take it
off<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.130> put<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.340> back<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:12.240> got<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
off and put it back on in we got a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.420 
off and put it back on in we got a
little<00:01:13.140> light<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:13.979> how<00:01:14.250> that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
little light going on here how that

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.480 
little light going on here how that
works<00:01:15.560> how<00:01:16.560> many<00:01:16.710> volts<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> pass<00:01:17.340> them

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
works how many volts do you pass them

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.469 
works how many volts do you pass them
through<00:01:17.520> there<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.060> know<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.330> is

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
through there do you know this is

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.810 
through there do you know this is
probably<00:01:18.930> about<00:01:19.049> two<00:01:19.560> point<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.100> volts<00:01:20.130> right

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
probably about two point one volts right

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.450 
probably about two point one volts right
now<00:01:21.530> hookup<00:01:22.530> all<00:01:22.680> three<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.009> them<00:01:23.159> let's<00:01:23.310> see

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
now hookup all three of them let's see

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.730 
now hookup all three of them let's see
if<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> intensity<00:01:24.180> gets<00:01:24.450> bigger<00:01:24.720> they<00:01:25.409> are

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
if the intensity gets bigger they are

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:36.950 
if the intensity gets bigger they are
greater<00:01:27.290> it's<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.799> Bobby<00:01:31.400> hey

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.590 

oh<00:01:47.159> yeah<00:01:48.159> that's<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:48.909> lot<00:01:49.090> more<00:01:49.270> intense

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
oh yeah that's a lot more intense

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.280 
oh yeah that's a lot more intense
there's<00:01:50.560> three<00:01:51.360> running<00:01:52.360> this<00:01:52.780> should<00:01:53.110> run

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
there's three running this should run

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.560 
there's three running this should run
about<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:54.070> would<00:01:54.520> say<00:01:54.640> about<00:01:54.790> three<00:01:55.090> point<00:01:55.360> two

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
about I would say about three point two

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.690 
about I would say about three point two
right<00:01:56.229> now<00:01:56.380> folks<00:01:56.860> go<00:01:57.310> through<00:01:57.640> all<00:01:58.479> right

right now folks go through all right
that<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:01.060> awesome<00:02:01.540> wonder<00:02:02.470> how<00:02:02.590> many<00:02:02.649> we<00:02:02.890> can

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
that is awesome wonder how many we can

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.950 
that is awesome wonder how many we can
hook<00:02:03.159> up<00:02:03.310> together<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:04.479> need<00:02:04.600> more<00:02:04.720> force

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
hook up together we need more force

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.500 
hook up together we need more force
posture<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.470> know
