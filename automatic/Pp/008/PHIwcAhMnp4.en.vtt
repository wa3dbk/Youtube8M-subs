00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:14.569 
wrapping paper and I'm going to use a

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:16.899 
wrapping paper and I'm going to use a
pen<00:01:14.749> using<00:01:15.020> tape<00:01:15.259> actually<00:01:15.859> because<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.700> glue

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
pen using tape actually because the glue

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.879 
pen using tape actually because the glue
pen<00:01:17.149> it<00:01:17.270> takes<00:01:17.539> a<00:01:17.630> long<00:01:17.749> time<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:17.929> dry<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.590> I

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:18.889 
pen it takes a long time to dry and I

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:21.609 
pen it takes a long time to dry and I
just<00:01:19.100> tape<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:19.880> together<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:20.929> you<00:01:21.170> have<00:01:21.319> a<00:01:21.350> cone

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
just tape it together so you have a cone

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.249 
just tape it together so you have a cone
right<00:01:21.829> there<00:01:22.130> now<00:01:23.060> what<00:01:23.450> we're<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:24.049> sites

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
right there now what we're the sites

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.300 
right there now what we're the sites

to put this together now I did use a
double<00:02:07.069> sided<00:02:07.249> tape<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:08.030> put<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.080> cones

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
double sided tape to put the cones

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.059 
double sided tape to put the cones
around<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.580> cardboard<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.530> then<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.620> secured

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
around the cardboard and then I secured

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.370 
around the cardboard and then I secured
it<00:02:13.160> with<00:02:13.459> some<00:02:13.760> glue<00:02:13.940> just<00:02:14.450> in<00:02:14.569> case<00:02:14.810> but<00:02:15.140> it

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
it with some glue just in case but it

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.410 
it with some glue just in case but it
worked<00:02:15.590> faster<00:02:15.980> for<00:02:16.160> me<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:17.150> know<00:02:17.209> it's

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
worked faster for me and you know it's

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.230 
worked faster for me and you know it's
easier<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:19.070> think<00:02:19.400> we'll<00:02:19.490> have<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.850> wait<00:02:20.000> over

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
easier the think we'll have to wait over

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.640 
easier the think we'll have to wait over
and<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.360> do<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.600> let<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.750> dry<00:02:20.990> so<00:02:21.490> but

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
and I do it let it dry so but

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.460 
and I do it let it dry so but
either<00:02:22.829> or<00:02:23.040> either<00:02:23.069> way<00:02:23.519> it<00:02:23.700> works<00:02:23.939> and<00:02:24.470> this

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
either or either way it works and this

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.720 
either or either way it works and this
one<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.769> actually<00:02:26.099> going<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.400> be<00:02:26.519> my

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
one is actually going to be my

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.160 
one is actually going to be my
daughter's<00:02:27.180> wreath<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:27.780> I'm<00:02:27.870> going<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.049> just

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
daughter's wreath so I'm going to just

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.899 
daughter's wreath so I'm going to just
lay<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.439> out<00:02:28.530> for<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:28.829> I'm<00:02:28.950> not<00:02:29.069> going<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.489> glue

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
lay it out for you I'm not going to glue

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.210 
lay it out for you I'm not going to glue
it<00:02:29.939> or<00:02:30.209> tape<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.629> together<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.860> you'll<00:02:32.069> get

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
it or tape it together but you'll get

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.119 
it or tape it together but you'll get
the<00:02:32.340> idea<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:33.030> way<00:02:33.959> she<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.620> know<00:02:34.680> put

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
the idea that way she can you know put

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.130 
the idea that way she can you know put
together<00:02:35.250> our<00:02:35.519> own<00:02:35.549> with<00:02:35.879> too<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.720> let<00:02:36.900> me<00:02:36.989> show

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
together our own with too so let me show

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.369 
together our own with too so let me show
you<00:02:37.170> how<00:02:37.379> to<00:02:37.439> roll<00:02:37.680> them<00:02:37.829> into<00:02:37.950> cones<00:02:39.379> so

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
you how to roll them into cones so

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.050 
you how to roll them into cones so
here's<00:02:40.560> your<00:02:40.709> wrapping<00:02:41.040> paper<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:41.849> will

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
here's your wrapping paper so you will

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.240 
here's your wrapping paper so you will
hold<00:02:42.720> on<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.049> corner<00:02:43.409> with<00:02:43.829> your<00:02:43.980> thumb

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
hold on to this corner with your thumb

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.240 
hold on to this corner with your thumb
and<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:45.239> just<00:02:45.480> simply<00:02:45.810> roll<00:02:46.019> this<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.530> like

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
and you just simply roll this in like

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.949 
and you just simply roll this in like
this<00:02:47.870> until<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.959> have<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.140> cone<00:02:49.439> and<00:02:50.810> make<00:02:51.810> sure

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
this until you have a cone and make sure

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.160 
this until you have a cone and make sure
you<00:02:52.079> hold<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:53.329> this<00:02:54.329> side<00:02:54.599> here

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
you hold on to this side here

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.390 
you hold on to this side here
then<00:02:55.379> you'll<00:02:55.530> secure<00:02:55.889> it<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.190> tape<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:59.040> found

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
then you'll secure it you tape I found

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.589 
then you'll secure it you tape I found
that<00:02:59.519> tape<00:02:59.760> works<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.989> lot<00:03:01.170> easier<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.950> faster

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
that tape works a lot easier and faster

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.770 
that tape works a lot easier and faster
so<00:03:03.599> now<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.810> have<00:03:04.049> this<00:03:04.200> cone-shaped

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
so now you have this cone-shaped

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.259 
so now you have this cone-shaped
wrapping<00:03:06.780> paper<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.379> I<00:03:08.280> pre<00:03:08.760> made<00:03:08.909> all<00:03:09.120> these

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
wrapping paper so I pre made all these

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.879 
wrapping paper so I pre made all these
earlier<00:03:09.659> so<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.019> way<00:03:10.139> doesn't<00:03:10.439> take<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:10.709> long

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
earlier so that way doesn't take so long

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.550 
earlier so that way doesn't take so long
to<00:03:11.220> show<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.430> how<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.959> do<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.379> they'll

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
to show you how to do it they'll

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.050 
to show you how to do it they'll
probably<00:03:13.650> take<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.069> at<00:03:14.159> least<00:03:14.310> an<00:03:14.430> hour<00:03:14.579> hour

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
probably take you at least an hour hour

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.390 
probably take you at least an hour hour
and<00:03:15.359> a<00:03:15.389> half<00:03:15.569> depending<00:03:15.870> on<00:03:16.170> how<00:03:16.319> big<00:03:17.099> you<00:03:17.220> want

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.920 
cut on the edge and around and you can
secure<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:33.480> with<00:03:34.169> tape<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:35.599> you<00:03:36.599> should<00:03:36.810> be

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.340 
remember it is about six inches across
the<00:04:09.910> middle<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.300> kind<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.570> about<00:04:10.810> three

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
the middle that kind of about three

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.980 
the middle that kind of about three
inches<00:04:11.650> across<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.400> we're<00:04:13.180> using<00:04:13.390> about<00:04:13.630> at

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
inches across and we're using about at

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.710 
inches across and we're using about at
least<00:04:14.140> thirty<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:15.010> these<00:04:15.220> little<00:04:15.610> cones<00:04:15.970> which

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
least thirty of these little cones which

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.590 
least thirty of these little cones which
is<00:04:16.870> four<00:04:17.109> inches<00:04:17.410> by<00:04:17.590> four<00:04:17.829> inches<00:04:17.859> --eye<00:04:18.609> we

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
is four inches by four inches --eye we

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.230 
is four inches by four inches --eye we
made<00:04:19.780> about<00:04:19.930> 35<00:04:20.890> of<00:04:21.040> these<00:04:21.160> cones<00:04:21.489> so<00:04:22.180> I'm

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
made about 35 of these cones so I'm

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.880 
made about 35 of these cones so I'm
gonna<00:04:22.360> probably<00:04:22.510> use<00:04:22.720> between<00:04:23.140> thirty<00:04:23.740> to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
gonna probably use between thirty to

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.550 
gonna probably use between thirty to
thirty-five<00:04:24.540> depending<00:04:25.540> on<00:04:25.630> how<00:04:25.750> close<00:04:26.050> you

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
thirty-five depending on how close you

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.450 
thirty-five depending on how close you
want<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:27.010> put<00:04:27.970> them<00:04:28.120> together<00:04:28.350> or<00:04:29.350> how<00:04:29.530> compact

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
want to put them together or how compact

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.500 
want to put them together or how compact
you<00:04:30.610> want<00:04:30.790> to<00:04:30.850> clean<00:04:31.000> up<00:04:31.060> packed<00:04:31.330> it<00:04:31.450> up

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
you want to clean up packed it up

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.900 
you want to clean up packed it up
together<00:04:32.020> in<00:04:32.200> there<00:04:32.410> so<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.130> big<00:04:33.340> wreath<00:04:33.760> I

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
together in there so the big wreath I

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.050 
together in there so the big wreath I
made<00:04:34.200> we<00:04:35.200> used<00:04:35.470> about<00:04:35.680> I<00:04:36.220> think<00:04:36.490> it<00:04:36.580> was<00:04:36.670> fifty

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
made we used about I think it was fifty

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.420 
made we used about I think it was fifty
two<00:04:37.210> of<00:04:37.360> these<00:04:37.510> cones<00:04:37.890> but<00:04:38.890> that<00:04:39.040> was<00:04:39.130> a<00:04:39.160> lot

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
two of these cones but that was a lot

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.190 
two of these cones but that was a lot
bigger<00:04:39.940> wreath<00:04:40.330> I<00:04:41.200> believe<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:43.690> circle

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
bigger wreath I believe the the circle

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.170 
bigger wreath I believe the the circle
cardboard<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.890> use<00:04:45.130> for<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.370> measure<00:04:45.760> twelve

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
cardboard I use for that measure twelve

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.610 
cardboard I use for that measure twelve
and<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.360> half<00:04:46.390> inches<00:04:46.900> so<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:50.050> bigger<00:04:50.380> wreath

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
and a half inches so the bigger wreath

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.370 
and a half inches so the bigger wreath
that<00:04:50.650> I<00:04:50.890> made<00:04:51.070> earlier<00:04:51.460> measures<00:04:52.270> I<00:04:52.780> just

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
that I made earlier measures I just

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.080 
that I made earlier measures I just
measured<00:04:53.530> it<00:04:53.830> so<00:04:54.010> it's<00:04:54.130> about<00:04:54.220> twenty<00:04:54.940> four

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
measured it so it's about twenty four

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.860 
measured it so it's about twenty four
inches<00:04:55.740> across<00:04:56.790> for<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:57.820> whole<00:04:58.150> thing<00:04:58.450> with<00:04:58.840> a

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
inches across for the whole thing with a

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.000 
inches across for the whole thing with a
twelve<00:04:59.410> and<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.590> half<00:05:00.210> inches<00:05:01.210> in<00:05:01.450> diameter<00:05:02.010> for

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
twelve and a half inches in diameter for

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.790 
twelve and a half inches in diameter for
the<00:05:03.070> up<00:05:03.340> carpet<00:05:03.760> that<00:05:03.880> he<00:05:03.970> used<00:05:04.270> so<00:05:05.140> for<00:05:05.620> this

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
the up carpet that he used so for this

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.159 
the up carpet that he used so for this

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
one's going to be a smaller one but

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.830 
one's going to be a smaller one but

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
project she wanted to make one on our

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.210 
project she wanted to make one on our
own<00:05:30.450> so<00:05:31.450> you<00:05:31.780> can<00:05:31.930> use<00:05:32.080> glue<00:05:32.500> you<00:05:32.680> can<00:05:32.830> just<00:05:32.979> put

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
own so you can use glue you can just put

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.340 
own so you can use glue you can just put
the<00:05:33.310> glue<00:05:33.640> on<00:05:33.970> your<00:05:34.030> template<00:05:34.690> on<00:05:34.810> your<00:05:35.020> circle

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
the glue on your template on your circle

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.380 
the glue on your template on your circle
template<00:05:35.650> there<00:05:35.919> or<00:05:36.430> you<00:05:37.150> can<00:05:37.270> use<00:05:37.360> a

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
template there or you can use a

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.340 
template there or you can use a
double-sided<00:05:37.960> tape<00:05:38.260> which<00:05:38.590> is<00:05:38.919> what<00:05:39.310> I<00:05:39.340> did<00:05:39.460> I

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
double-sided tape which is what I did I

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.540 
double-sided tape which is what I did I
just<00:05:41.350> pretty<00:05:41.620> much<00:05:41.740> put<00:05:42.100> this<00:05:42.220> double-sided

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
just pretty much put this double-sided

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.550 
just pretty much put this double-sided
tape<00:05:42.850> all<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.060> way<00:05:43.240> around<00:05:43.930> and<00:05:46.320> it<00:05:47.320> worked

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
tape all the way around and it worked

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.370 
tape all the way around and it worked
fine<00:05:47.830> but<00:05:48.160> then<00:05:48.580> it<00:05:48.970> was<00:05:49.180> it<00:05:49.450> wasn't<00:05:49.660> sticking

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
fine but then it was it wasn't sticking

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.469 
fine but then it was it wasn't sticking
too<00:05:50.950> well<00:05:51.160> so<00:05:51.370> I<00:05:51.430> went<00:05:51.550> ahead<00:05:51.700> and<00:05:51.940> put<00:05:52.450> some

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
too well so I went ahead and put some

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.530 
too well so I went ahead and put some
glue<00:05:52.660> in<00:05:52.960> between<00:05:53.280> each<00:05:54.280> cone

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
glue in between each cone

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.570 
glue in between each cone
so<00:05:56.540> you<00:05:56.600> would<00:05:56.810> just<00:05:59.860> play<00:06:00.860> them<00:06:01.070> like<00:06:01.100> that

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
so you would just play them like that

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.190 
so you would just play them like that
