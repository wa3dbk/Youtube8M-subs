shape so this is this dedication you
shape<00:00:35.640> now<00:00:36.629> we're<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.929> copy<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.710> make

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
shape now we're going to copy and make

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.389 
shape now we're going to copy and make
an<00:00:38.699> L<00:00:38.910> shape<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> first<00:00:40.949> thing<00:00:41.039> we<00:00:41.219> need<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
an L shape so the first thing we need to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.540 
an L shape so the first thing we need to
do<00:00:41.550> here<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.420> save<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.050> drawing<00:00:43.410> ass<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
do here is to save this drawing ass and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.910 
do here is to save this drawing ass and
with<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> different<00:00:45.780> name<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.260> let's<00:00:46.499> go<00:00:46.859> to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
with a different name so let's go to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.279 
with a different name so let's go to
file<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:48.800> save<00:00:49.800> us<00:00:50.359> and<00:00:51.359> then<00:00:51.600> there's<00:00:52.199> a

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
file and save us and then there's a

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.700 
file and save us and then there's a
different<00:00:52.739> name<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.640> cyclase<00:00:54.480> L<00:00:54.899> shape

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
different name like cyclase L shape

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.790 
different name like cyclase L shape
instead<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.280> using<00:00:56.489> shape<00:00:58.399> well<00:01:00.530> ok<00:01:01.530> now<00:01:01.739> we

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
instead of using shape well ok now we

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.240 
instead of using shape well ok now we
have<00:01:02.370> saved<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.659> new<00:01:03.929> file<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:05.010> can

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
have saved this as a new file so we can

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.420 
have saved this as a new file so we can
remove<00:01:05.910> three<00:01:06.630> steps<00:01:08.900> it's<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.200> block<00:01:10.500> but

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
remove three steps it's not a block but

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.610 
remove three steps it's not a block but
now<00:01:12.360> because<00:01:13.010> these<00:01:14.010> drawings<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.670> not<00:01:15.620> then

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
now because these drawings are not then

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.860 
now because these drawings are not then
we<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.890> remove<00:01:17.010> it<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.420> them<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
we can remove it just like them in the

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
we can remove it just like them in the
move<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:19.350> we're<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> rotate

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
move and then we're going to rotate

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.280 
move and then we're going to rotate
these<00:01:20.340> three<00:01:21.590> two<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.890> place<00:01:24.050> select<00:01:25.050> them<00:01:25.260> and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
these three two in place select them and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.830 
these three two in place select them and
the<00:01:25.530> point<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.340> rotate<00:01:26.670> around<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.240> then<00:01:27.450> just

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the point to rotate around and then just

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.550 
the point to rotate around and then just
touch<00:01:28.380> them<00:01:28.560> screen<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.250> set<00:01:29.490> into<00:01:29.670> place<00:01:30.560> okay

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
touch them screen is set into place okay

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.830 
touch them screen is set into place okay
and<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.830> remove<00:01:32.220> three<00:01:32.970> steps<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.420> let's<00:01:33.600> add

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and we remove three steps so let's add

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.820 
and we remove three steps so let's add
three<00:01:34.140> steps<00:01:35.450> select<00:01:36.450> them<00:01:36.720> from<00:01:37.050> two<00:01:37.530> point

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
three steps select them from two point

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.020 
three steps select them from two point
and<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.610> copy<00:01:39.120> button<00:01:40.670> okay<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.820> don't<00:01:41.910> have

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and then copy button okay we don't have

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.950 
and then copy button okay we don't have
to<00:01:42.210> make<00:01:43.050> this<00:01:43.320> into<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.980> block<00:01:44.720> because<00:01:45.720> when

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
to make this into a block because when

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.540 
to make this into a block because when
you<00:01:46.110> draw<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.440> into<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.770> drawing<00:01:47.010> or<00:01:47.160> insert

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
you draw it into a drawing or insert

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.490 
you draw it into a drawing or insert
into<00:01:47.760> drawn<00:01:48.120> later<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:49.290> will

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
into drawn later on it will

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.520 
into drawn later on it will
automatically<00:01:50.400> make<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.940> book<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.410> can

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
automatically make it a book so we can

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.680 
automatically make it a book so we can
leave<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.130> parks<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:54.440> you<00:01:55.440> can<00:01:55.650> actually

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
leave it in parks here you can actually

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.300 
leave it in parks here you can actually
break<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.750> steps<00:01:58.290> are<00:01:58.440> also<00:01:58.590> block<00:01:58.980> so<00:01:59.250> you

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
break the steps are also block so you

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.660 
break the steps are also block so you
can<00:01:59.610> write<00:02:00.030> them<00:02:00.270> ok<00:02:01.200> let's<00:02:01.530> open<00:02:01.800> insert<00:02:02.490> this

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
can write them ok let's open insert this

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.840 
can write them ok let's open insert this
now<00:02:03.120> into<00:02:03.720> those<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.740> make<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.980> new<00:02:05.220> drawing<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
now into those so make a new drawing and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.509 
now into those so make a new drawing and
just<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:07.320> make<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.800> little<00:02:07.950> bit<00:02:08.099> more<00:02:08.250> real

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
just to make it a little bit more real

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:14.420 
just to make it a little bit more real
let's<00:02:09.149> create<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.509> room<00:02:10.909> by<00:02:11.909> touching<00:02:13.430> the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
let's create a room by touching the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.200 
let's create a room by touching the
smaller

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
smaller

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.040 
smaller
go<00:02:15.500> down<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.980> then<00:02:17.760> select<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.600> point<00:02:18.840> where

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
go down and then select the point where

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.320 
go down and then select the point where
you<00:02:19.140> want<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.620> insert<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.550> new<00:02:20.880> furniture

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
you want to insert this new furniture

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.360 
you want to insert this new furniture
that<00:02:21.960> we<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.320> created<00:02:24.680> insert<00:02:25.680> furniture

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
that we just created insert furniture

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.290 
that we just created insert furniture
and<00:02:26.640> when<00:02:26.850> we<00:02:27.030> go<00:02:27.180> down<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.750> list<00:02:28.020> here<00:02:29.300> there

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
and when we go down the list here there
