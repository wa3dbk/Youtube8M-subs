00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
details to start really really out here

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.350 
details to start really really out here
and<00:00:56.770> then<00:00:56.950> and<00:00:57.370> have<00:00:57.640> some<00:00:57.790> fun<00:00:57.940> with<00:00:58.090> it<00:00:58.210> and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
and then and have some fun with it and

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:09.770 
and then and have some fun with it and
just<00:00:58.420> spend<00:00:58.600> two<00:00:58.840> days<00:00:59.110> being<00:00:59.620> creative

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.150 

the<00:01:10.780> energy<00:01:11.170> level<00:01:11.410> in<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.560> room<00:01:11.710> was<00:01:11.860> pretty

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
the energy level in the room was pretty

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.520 
the energy level in the room was pretty
cool<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:12.490> was<00:01:12.610> really<00:01:12.850> high<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.300> I<00:01:14.170> think<00:01:14.410> that

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
cool it was really high and I think that

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.890 
cool it was really high and I think that
the<00:01:14.680> level<00:01:15.009> of<00:01:15.280> enthusiasm<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:16.509> you<00:01:16.570> saw<00:01:16.780> in

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
the level of enthusiasm that you saw in

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.680 
the level of enthusiasm that you saw in
the<00:01:16.930> eyes<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.500> sparkles<00:01:18.430> you<00:01:18.640> know<00:01:18.729> smooth

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
violet in the eyes just tells you

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.700 
violet in the eyes just tells you
everything<00:01:22.570> I<00:01:22.750> feel<00:01:22.900> like<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.140> relationship

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
everything I feel like the relationship

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.800 
everything I feel like the relationship
become<00:01:24.220> became<00:01:24.550> really<00:01:24.729> tight<00:01:25.240> I<00:01:25.420> think<00:01:25.690> I

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
become became really tight I think I

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.150

of silly ideas there's a lot of

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.870 
of silly ideas there's a lot of
enlightenment<00:01:28.869> so<00:01:29.590> getting<00:01:29.950> getting<00:01:30.340> getting

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
enlightenment so getting getting getting

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.749 
enlightenment so getting getting getting
the<00:01:31.270> communication<00:01:32.140> going<00:01:32.290> each<00:01:33.160> makes<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:33.700> a

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
the communication going each makes it a

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.420 
the communication going each makes it a
lot<00:01:33.880> easier<00:01:33.940> both<00:01:34.479> both<00:01:35.080> excited<00:01:35.590> it's<00:01:36.340> a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
lot easier both both excited it's a

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.620 
lot easier both both excited it's a
totally<00:01:36.700> different<00:01:37.000> approach<00:01:37.060> than<00:01:37.240> what

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
totally different approach than what

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.160 
totally different approach than what
we're<00:01:37.750> used<00:01:37.780> to

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
we're used to

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.100 
we're used to
we're<00:01:38.950> starting<00:01:39.220> with<00:01:39.310> something<00:01:39.610> that<00:01:39.729> is

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
we're starting with something that is

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.530 
we're starting with something that is
backwards<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.530> it<00:01:41.970> really<00:01:42.970> compels<00:01:43.300> us<00:01:43.390> to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
backwards and it really compels us to

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.780 
backwards and it really compels us to
come<00:01:43.690> up<00:01:43.810> with<00:01:43.960> new<00:01:44.110> ideas<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.800> then<00:01:45.369> we<00:01:45.520> flip

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
come up with new ideas and then we flip

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.240 
come up with new ideas and then we flip
it<00:01:45.820> on<00:01:46.000> its<00:01:46.030> head<00:01:46.210> suddenly<00:01:46.890> yeah<00:01:47.890> yeah<00:01:48.039> what

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
it on its head suddenly yeah yeah what

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.469 
it on its head suddenly yeah yeah what
if<00:01:48.340> we<00:01:48.429> did<00:01:48.580> do<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.850> in<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:48.970> cool<00:01:49.149> way<00:01:49.179> you<00:01:49.330> know

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
if we did do that in a cool way you know

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.620 
if we did do that in a cool way you know
what<00:01:49.720> if<00:01:49.810> we<00:01:49.960> we<00:01:50.710> did<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.039> backwards<00:01:51.850> makes

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
what if we we did that backwards makes

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.920 
what if we we did that backwards makes
your<00:01:52.750> brain<00:01:52.929> I<00:01:53.170> think<00:01:53.590> differently
