00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and and windy and here because of the

mild<00:01:11.580> temperatures<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.119> need<00:01:12.299> whether<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:13.049> get

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
mild temperatures we need whether to get

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.440 
mild temperatures we need whether to get
the<00:01:13.320> birds<00:01:13.530> out<00:01:13.740> moving<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.000> days<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.270> we

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the birds out moving so the days that we

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.749 
the birds out moving so the days that we
really<00:01:15.900> shoot<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.200> lot<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.470> ducks<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.070> when

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
really shoot a lot of ducks here is when

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.590 
really shoot a lot of ducks here is when
we<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.180> cloudy<00:01:18.630> skies<00:01:19.250> rain<00:01:20.390> maybe<00:01:21.390> of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
we have cloudy skies rain maybe of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.200 
we have cloudy skies rain maybe of
either<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.900> strong<00:01:22.229> south<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:22.860> north<00:01:22.890> wind<00:01:23.369> but

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
either a strong south or north wind but

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.940 
either a strong south or north wind but
predominantly<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.810> strong<00:01:25.110> south<00:01:25.439> wind<00:01:25.740> we

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
predominantly a strong south wind we

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.070 
predominantly a strong south wind we
have<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> storms<00:01:26.549> blowing<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.450> when<00:01:27.990> we

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
have the storms blowing here so when we

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.359 
have the storms blowing here so when we
do<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.650> Ducks<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.100> more<00:01:29.280> aggressive

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
do that the Ducks get more aggressive

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.630 
do that the Ducks get more aggressive
they<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:30.030> out<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.329> feed<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:32.100> we're

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
they get out and feed so when we're

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.850 
they get out and feed so when we're
hunting<00:01:32.939> ducks<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.329> those<00:01:33.509> conditions<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.200> try

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
hunting ducks in those conditions I try

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.069 
hunting ducks in those conditions I try
to<00:01:34.890> lean<00:01:35.159> more<00:01:35.189> towards<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.060> lot<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.750> different

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
to lean more towards a lot of different

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.359 
to lean more towards a lot of different
hands<00:01:37.500> very<00:01:37.920> aggressive<00:01:38.159> feed<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:39.450> lot<00:01:39.960> louder

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
hands very aggressive feed a lot louder

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.609 
hands very aggressive feed a lot louder
due<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> high<00:01:41.820> winds<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
due to the high winds so this is a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.249 
due to the high winds so this is a
little<00:01:43.860> example<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.060> our<00:01:45.720> high

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
little example of what I do and our high

00:01:46.259 --> 00:02:04.860 
little example of what I do and our high
wind<00:01:46.590> storm<00:01:47.100> days

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:14.490 

hey

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.410 

and<00:02:15.500> as<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.770> can<00:02:15.920> see<00:02:15.950> there<00:02:16.460> everything

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
and as you can see there everything

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.160 
and as you can see there everything
picked<00:02:17.720> up<00:02:17.900> tempo<00:02:18.410> speed<00:02:19.010> volume<00:02:20.170> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
picked up tempo speed volume the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.770 
picked up tempo speed volume the
cadences<00:02:21.650> picked<00:02:21.920> up<00:02:22.100> everything<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:22.780> that

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
cadences picked up everything so that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.690 
cadences picked up everything so that
works<00:02:24.020> for<00:02:24.230> us<00:02:24.260> out<00:02:24.620> here<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.340> Pacific

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
works for us out here in the Pacific

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.790 
works for us out here in the Pacific
Flyway<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.180> hopefully<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.230> can<00:02:27.380> take<00:02:27.590> some<00:02:27.740> of

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
Flyway so hopefully you can take some of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.030 
Flyway so hopefully you can take some of
these<00:02:27.860> tips<00:02:28.130> back<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.550> where<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.820> hunt
