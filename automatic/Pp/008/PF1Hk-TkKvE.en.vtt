 How about how good you are to get a 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.189
 new video on this occasion is a pact 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.570
 school but good more than your school and 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.580
 it's just a little bit back to the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.200
 routine of each one of you and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.500
 you since some will go to school 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.010
 others will go to university and others will go 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.540
 the institute then well good without more 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.090
 which is a bit to encompass a little 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.180
 everything and good I hope some ideas a 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.580
 so many various not different 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.890
 well what in each place of the 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.300
 peninsula for example here then when 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.430
 begin to collegiate a site yes that is 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.850
 true that as it is already in the 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.739
 cool a little more over there and in 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.420
 other sites is still summer total 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.610
 so good I wanted to do a little 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.500
 mixture although good speaking in general 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.840
 yes, it is true that the return 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.489
 when we go back to school or to 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.680
 institute yes that is true then good 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.079
 that keeps doing that keeps doing 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.879
 very good weather then well then 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.070
 depends a bit on the world area of 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.219
 You are watching me, I wanted to do 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.460
 a little bit more covered and others 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:09.430
 Well more normal are super outfits 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.399
 basic but that just me 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.600
 they like and I hope that you also like that 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.600
 what are we going with it 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.000
 ok then we start with this first 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.100
 outfit first as you see with a 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.830
 pretty basic shirt in a tone 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.659
 Burgundy that you can find it in 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.310
 stradivarius stores is still from the 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.170
 last season but currently the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.880
 they have again and that has the detail 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.619
 of the back so good a zipper 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.590
 and that is to say a number with shorts 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.210
 super basic jeans and with this weather 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.399
 not that you have seen me before 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.430
 also distracts several with a sandal 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.430
 flat 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.650
 I think it's a super basic ace but 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.580
 same comfortable time and very nice 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.580
 so 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 was 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.710
 on this occasion for this second outfit 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.900
 of caught a sleeve shirt until the 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.670
 elbow so loose with asymmetrical cut of 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.280
 this green color that I think is beautiful 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.960
 and that every fall returns this color 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.150
 that side shirt and you can 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.670
 find the leptis is the same 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.320
 fall season that comes in already and I've 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.660
 put back with the same shorts and 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.750
 this time with a few drops that the truth 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.530
 that I've hunted for rebates in bershka 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.660
 in this tone as taupe and so good 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.459
 I think it's a date because the truth 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.310
 that not only dress me like this but 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.820
 combine it like that I liked it a lot and well 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.820
 that I love 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.870
 in this next audio and it is also very 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.120
 comfortable with this time again with the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.129
 shorts some converse type shirts 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.810
 white with a shirt that everything 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.810
 always comes back other seasons and with 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.849
 a white basic shirt below is 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.430
 an outfit as that very case the 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.080
 comfortable casual and that seems super 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.220
 appropriate as good for the back to 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.220
 school for the return to routine 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.659
 the next outfit and this time I already 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.030
 I put a monkey is in combination of 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.530
 black and white colors with this one 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.049
 small belt that what it does is 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.180
 mark the waist then there are lights are 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.250
 very feminine but instead of putting 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.290
 dancer or wedge things ready and decided 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.269
 put it again with the same t-shirts 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.329
 White type converse because it gives you a 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.810
 so good touch more modern and not so 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.810
 dress 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.269
 and for those who want to go with more 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.249
 equally but beautiful and more tapaditas 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.530
 this time, well, some jeans 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:55.930
 this same season of zara with these 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.489
 small broken into wedges in 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.469
 combination with the shirt that are 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.060
 pull and bear and this shirt that I eat 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:03.370
 I say is from stradivarius that you have it 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.200
 right now in store that as is not from 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.120
 Topitos has white polka dots and 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.069
 you know that I am sea and moles and I 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.840
 love and the truth that good is 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.590
 a sweet and super simple but that I 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.590
 it looks lovely 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.639
 and this dose is still a little 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.680
 also formal 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.880
 the idea is exactly the same only that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.430
 change what is the combination a little 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.560
 of colors and shoes a shirt this 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.680
 once pink stick with polka dots in white u 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.870
 other clear jeans that are from bershka 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.750
 It's been quite a while and these dancers 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.690
 that are from this pink season and that 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.310
 they are sandal type and pitu the truth that 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.410
 when I saw them I fell in love with them and they are 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.680
 super comfortable and well it's a light and 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.920
 as you see very simple but very dressed 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.880
