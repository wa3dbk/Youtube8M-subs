00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.030
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.670
 new research team follow 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.969
 we prove our size today and take care of it 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.500
 nothing ec cards about everything oversize 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.230
 what great and very beautiful sitting 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.179
 and where we are not an issue ours 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.269
 Designer of this question as beautiful woman 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.189
 today both institutes are enchanting 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.160
 discovered colors and we also today 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.290
 would you say the xxl and 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.810
 also a bit hot a bit sexy 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.120
 I do not like it 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.890
 like to combine even this year 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.780
 though it still exists, it still is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.490
 can look very sexy and very elegant 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.500
 Tomorrow you have to look something 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.870
 tailor so that's great and 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.450
 Nevertheless, control shows or needs it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.100
 maybe better combined 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.110
 In any case, it's important how you feel about it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.150
 it combined and I would say so 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.500
 What I like doing is a genius service 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.300
 and just the big one is about that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.010
 I personally like that of course 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.390
 looks and otherwise so when the cut 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.710
 is definitely important too 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.860
 Do not pay any attention to them 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.850
 wrong start and despite 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.220
 first of all, who is dangerous 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.650
 now for example i have got here 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.390
 already curious attracted the idea was 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.920
 okay for me if you're called up wide 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.810
 somehow had to go down a bit 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:25.140
 have you fun yes it is a kind 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.600
 vest that is me figure but 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.810
 pretty casual already august exactly 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.670
 is hand-woven organic silk and the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.680
 Suits is hand embroidered work women 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.390
 and moldova come together and there 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.290
 the number is a journalist so to speak 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.400
 now a little bit in the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.170
 change direction so I stood 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.109
 at least for her it's a modern one 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.450
 to hide underneath it 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.369
 since it cut in the clus and after 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.579
 longer on the front right, that's also more likely 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.819
 annoying but dressed like 140 anyway 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.799
 Do you combine your parts like that ? 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.420
 For example, I am always good 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.399
 to have out of the park center and so on 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.170
 some colors that are a professional and 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.360
 then to give a contrast through 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.700
 that is quite good then that 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.009
 I think because the special one xxl me 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.560
 mag is easy to be dressed and 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.849
 So somehow volume covers that I like that 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.739
 personally wearing comfort completely everything 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.799
 dressed very tight then shows you so 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.480
 a lot if you somehow share 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.709
 if I am a very nice one 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.870
 communicate is just such a 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:31.329
 feel good Vierling what I basically 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.920
 what is much higher at isabelle 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.900
 finds or is that so current 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.069
 Now it's always a collection 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.989
 little expert 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.579
 There are also many very narrow ones 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.349
 simple parts in the not so 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.390
 will be voluminous but in any case 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.140
 always somewhere every collection a part 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.769
 his agents 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.489
 where is my inspiration yours 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.690
 basically I start with one 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.790
 collection and actually have 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.530
 no idea where I will land the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.540
 It means that it always arises in the process 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.859
 in the middle of it and you are a fabric den 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.630
 I am very happy because I think it's great 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.639
 it is somehow the colors are so it 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.019
 is always different and it is 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.549
 really that arises from sap 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.989
 then somehow and then always becomes clear 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.780
 for me what is actually behind it 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.459
 and what I mean by that is a great trend 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.349
 xxl just makes fun I think it's great 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.870
 comfortable to wear and coaching 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.960
 Tensioned net taken aft we 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.600
 quite accurate and indeed at kathrin 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.240

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.410

 shoulders and three quarter sleeves 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.150
 for a degree of nonchalance already 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.280
 not often here but then pick it up 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.410

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.250
 so that this piece varied 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.500
 can use 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.170
