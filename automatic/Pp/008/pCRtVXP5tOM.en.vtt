want to be using a heavy brush and hurt
our<00:03:08.330> custom<00:03:08.750> wheels<00:03:10.330> now<00:03:11.330> our<00:03:11.510> tire<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.959> clean

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
our custom wheels now our tire is clean

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.449 
our custom wheels now our tire is clean
but<00:03:12.470> as<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:12.739> see<00:03:12.799> it's<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.010> little<00:03:13.190> bit<00:03:13.280> dry

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
but as you can see it's a little bit dry

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.220 
but as you can see it's a little bit dry
and<00:03:13.910> we<00:03:14.269> need<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.450> go<00:03:14.540> ahead<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:14.720> apply<00:03:14.840> some

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
and we need to go ahead and apply some

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.059 
and we need to go ahead and apply some
dressing<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.769> it<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:16.010> let's<00:03:16.160> do<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.980> our

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
dressing to it so let's do that so our

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.880 
dressing to it so let's do that so our
silk<00:03:19.370> shine<00:03:19.580> dressing<00:03:20.150> has<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.750> new<00:03:21.140> car<00:03:21.440> scent

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
silk shine dressing has a new car scent

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.170 
silk shine dressing has a new car scent
so<00:03:22.099> that's<00:03:22.220> one<00:03:22.430> thing<00:03:22.580> that<00:03:22.640> everybody<00:03:22.940> likes

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
so that's one thing that everybody likes

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.729 
so that's one thing that everybody likes
is<00:03:23.420> that<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.630> gives<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.870> natural<00:03:24.079> scent<00:03:24.650> it

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
is that it gives a natural scent it

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.530 
is that it gives a natural scent it
