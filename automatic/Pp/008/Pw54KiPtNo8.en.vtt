00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.660
 O 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.140
 aging that is a concern of 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.850
 whether or not everyone will be as it happens 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.330
 in the life of an athlete in the 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.730
 ballerina regina maura one of the icons of 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.030
 classic ballet here from the federal district 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.520
 will be 70 years old 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.020
 and looks the way she has let 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.900
 talk to her to know what she 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.520
 regina does age it seems to 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.220
 you do not exist right 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.850
 Look, I do not say there are no people. 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:59.140
 that we grow older in everything but 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.820
 you try to keep working 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.160
 the joy of seeing others his disciples 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.110
 growing in your hand you can give 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.810
 all of you, do not you see your 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.270
 work continues with others and you 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.530
 feels increasingly rejuvenated and power 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:21.970
 demonstrate this work neither monica nor 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:27.330
 do not exercise the muscles 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.600
 cost will not pull the elongation at 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.780
 Continue 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.020
 You can continue to work on your 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.119
 body independent of age 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.740
 Did you start dancing at what age? 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.740
 I started with seven years in the river of 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.020
 January with teacher luiza carbonell 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.990
 then moved to Marlene rosé after 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.259
 I went to dance and theater school 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.810
 municipal 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.720
 and when I was in the penultimate year of 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.220
 theater I did contest for the body of 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.929
 May when he was in the penultimate year of 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.080
 school did ballet contest 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.940
 I only had to go to school at school. 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.910
 to continue doing one more year 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.300
 theoretical subjects because the subjects 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.819
 techniques that was power of which was class 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.719
 I already tip ta 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.510
 How do you say you are a dancer? 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:18.249
 that I had passed a contest and you 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.099
 dance more and dance professionally 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:23.079
 up to 30 more or less 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.230
 professionally up to 40 and today 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.900
 Regina, I already told you about our 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.829
 Internet user to our viewer who 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.280
 You're going to make 70 years unbelievable 70 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.129
 years 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.980
 You're still very proud and you make a 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:42.219
 class you give a whole class we see 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.189
 your elasticity you still put your foot in the 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:46.150
 hand but do the stretching in the 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.579
 bar 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.980
 make a daughter one for reminding you 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.969
 all the body in the legs if you 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.969
 I wish I can demonstrate 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.000
 that the musculature is not cable then which 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.400
 It's the secret of marriage if you 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.379
 keep working because I show you 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.440
 all the class lines I make a point of 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:17.560
 show not only to show them 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.440
 as for myself that I feel good 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.560
 working my muscles 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.819
 now we can define that ballet 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.700
 be a very strong exercise of high 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.760
 high- voltage output I think 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.670
 because, in addition to 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.709
 stretching you too 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.410
 work and jump you make 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.450
 erotic things, besides working 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.400
 also head to me as soon as 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.560
 Dancer in the donkey does not exist in my 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.540
 daughter because you have to decorate the 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.129
 space has to decorate the movements 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.900
 You have to work the same time. 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.280
 Do you work with your head? 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.250
 the other leg to the other thing 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.250
 each thing I say that the motor control 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.859
 for real its very good it's very important 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.590
 It's critical that you grow old for yourself. 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:13.859
 means what knowledge every time 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:16.870
 more knowledge and experience 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.840
 continuing to learn always 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.330
 The more you live the more you learn. 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.310
 We are always looking for new techniques going 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.930
 I 'm going to go get some new ones to 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.919
 our dancers grow old and grow 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.430
 to live 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.460
 I think and live in Brazil, that's what it is 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.889
 learn from those who have lived well 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.889
 These years, thank you all. 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.310
