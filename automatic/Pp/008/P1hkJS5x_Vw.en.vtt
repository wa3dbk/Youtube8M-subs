see if i could bring you guys in a

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.290 
see if i could bring you guys in a
little<00:02:33.590> bit<00:02:33.709> closer<00:02:34.069> without<00:02:34.519> coming<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:35.090> too

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
little bit closer without coming in too

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.720 
little bit closer without coming in too
close<00:02:35.540> because<00:02:35.870> then<00:02:36.290> this<00:02:36.440> camera<00:02:36.920> goes<00:02:37.489> all

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
close because then this camera goes all

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.759 
close because then this camera goes all
out<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:38.060> whack<00:02:38.239> but<00:02:39.049> there<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.410> can<00:02:39.590> see<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
out of whack but there you can see the

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.370 
out of whack but there you can see the
only<00:02:40.190> thing<00:02:40.370> probably<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:41.780> notice<00:02:42.260> is

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
only thing probably that I notice is

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.289 
only thing probably that I notice is
that<00:02:42.410> it's<00:02:42.620> wrinkling<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:43.670> little<00:02:43.970> bit<00:02:44.090> from

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
that it's wrinkling a little bit from

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.320 
that it's wrinkling a little bit from
the<00:02:44.330> corner<00:02:44.930> but<00:02:45.860> basically<00:02:46.370> that's<00:02:46.849> it<00:02:47.120> it's

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
the corner but basically that's it it's

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.479 
the corner but basically that's it it's
holding<00:02:47.720> on<00:02:47.870> pretty<00:02:48.140> nicely<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:49.430> um<00:02:51.489> that's

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
holding on pretty nicely so um that's

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.490 
holding on pretty nicely so um that's
the<00:02:52.940> three-hour<00:02:53.390> mark<00:02:54.280> which<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.989> 223<00:02:56.989> already

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
the three-hour mark which is 223 already

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.979 
the three-hour mark which is 223 already
