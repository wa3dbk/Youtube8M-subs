process<00:04:27.630> we<00:04:28.020> implemented<00:04:28.560> vending<00:04:29.490> so<00:04:30.330> we

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
process we implemented vending so we

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.880 
process we implemented vending so we
started<00:04:30.690> out<00:04:30.750> with<00:04:30.840> one<00:04:30.900> vending<00:04:31.470> machine<00:04:31.770> it

was<00:04:31.950> for<00:04:32.130> office<00:04:32.400> supplies<00:04:32.790> because<00:04:33.570> we

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
was for office supplies because we

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.900 
was for office supplies because we
wanted<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.930> test<00:04:34.170> out<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.440> process<00:04:34.860> easy<00:04:35.460> no

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910
