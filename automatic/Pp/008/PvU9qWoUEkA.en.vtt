Europe one is an eight one two nine so I

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.710 
Europe one is an eight one two nine so I
mean<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:04.489> know<00:03:04.519> it's<00:03:04.790> not<00:03:04.940> like<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.150> six<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.660> a

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
mean you know it's not like a six and a

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.539 
mean you know it's not like a six and a
seven<00:03:05.750> but<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.410> mean<00:03:06.859> it's<00:03:06.980> very<00:03:07.010> very

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
seven but I mean it's very very

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.509 
seven but I mean it's very very
difficult<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:08.209> have<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:09.319> horse<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:10.250> know<00:03:10.370> we

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
difficult to have the horse you know we

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.309 
difficult to have the horse you know we
say<00:03:10.760> we<00:03:10.940> want<00:03:11.120> them<00:03:11.299> equally<00:03:11.690> subtle<00:03:12.139> both

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
say we want them equally subtle both

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.460 
say we want them equally subtle both
ways<00:03:12.620> I'm<00:03:13.340> not<00:03:13.670> sure<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:13.970> that's<00:03:14.470> that's

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
ways I'm not sure that that's that's

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.849 
ways I'm not sure that that's that's
workable<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.670> that<00:03:16.849> really<00:03:17.120> happens<00:03:17.630> on<00:03:17.870> the

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
workable that that really happens on the

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:27.750 
workable that that really happens on the
same<00:03:19.099> day

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:37.030 

okay<00:03:28.760> that's<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.120> small<00:03:29.450> seven

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.080 

that's<00:03:37.640> all<00:03:37.879> right<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:39.739> again<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.400> reason<00:03:40.580> not

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
that's all right so again the reason not

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.970 
that's all right so again the reason not
more<00:03:41.420> than<00:03:41.659> a<00:03:41.810> seven<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.379> just<00:03:42.680> there's

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
more than a seven is just there's

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.710 
more than a seven is just there's
there's<00:03:43.370> not<00:03:43.579> enough<00:03:43.849> compulsion<00:03:44.269> in<00:03:44.629> the

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
there's not enough compulsion in the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.110 
there's not enough compulsion in the
last<00:03:44.930> history<00:03:45.439> all<00:03:46.099> right<00:03:46.159> but<00:03:46.579> technically

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
last history all right but technically

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.220 
last history all right but technically
it's<00:03:47.420> correct

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
it's correct

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.170 
it's correct
alright<00:03:48.920> girls<00:03:49.220> let's<00:03:49.340> do<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.909> dreaded

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
alright girls let's do the dreaded

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.660 
alright girls let's do the dreaded
Perewitz<00:03:50.980> ok<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.900> first<00:03:53.900> let's<00:03:54.500> come<00:03:54.860> on<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.370> big

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
Perewitz ok so first let's come on a big

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.670 
Perewitz ok so first let's come on a big
circle<00:03:56.180> here<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:56.540> can<00:03:56.720> pick<00:03:56.959> whichever<00:03:57.379> lead

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
circle here you can pick whichever lead

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.270 
circle here you can pick whichever lead
you<00:03:57.890> want<00:03:58.159> isn't<00:03:58.849> that<00:03:58.940> nice<00:04:00.069> because<00:04:01.069> they're

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
you want isn't that nice because they're

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.149 
you want isn't that nice because they're
going<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.459> do<00:04:01.579> that<00:04:01.760> anyway<00:04:02.829> in<00:04:03.829> other<00:04:03.920> words

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
going to do that anyway in other words

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.750 
going to do that anyway in other words
the<00:04:04.280> your<00:04:04.579> best<00:04:04.879> side<00:04:05.739> ok<00:04:06.739> and<00:04:07.010> let's<00:04:07.189> do<00:04:07.489> the

the your best side ok and let's do the

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.910 
the your best side ok and let's do the
pirouette<00:04:08.120> canner<00:04:08.629> and<00:04:08.780> we<00:04:09.230> call<00:04:09.500> it<00:04:09.709> very

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
pirouette canner and we call it very

collective canner for a very simple

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.110 
collective canner for a very simple
reason<00:04:11.780> we<00:04:12.200> really<00:04:12.500> meet<00:04:12.680> Kerouac<00:04:13.159> Cantor<00:04:13.549> but

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
reason we really meet Kerouac Cantor but

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.490 
reason we really meet Kerouac Cantor but
we<00:04:14.209> don't<00:04:14.420> have<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.629> pirouette<00:04:14.959> Cantor<00:04:15.319> in<00:04:15.409> the

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500

we don't have to pirouette Cantor in the
rule<00:04:15.650> book<00:04:15.859> okay<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.090> we<00:04:17.479> didn't<00:04:17.690> want<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:17.900> put

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
it in the rule book because it's already

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:20.949 
it in the rule book because it's already
big<00:04:20.030> enough<00:04:20.060> don't<00:04:20.570> you<00:04:20.660> think

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959

so<00:05:00.990> in<00:05:01.199> the<00:05:01.319> pirouette<00:05:01.710> canter<00:05:02.310> we<00:05:02.490> want<00:05:02.759> to

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:02.879 
so in the pirouette canter we want to

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.260 
so in the pirouette canter we want to
see<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.300> horse<00:05:03.830> lower<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:05.729> haunches<00:05:06.210> and

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
see the horse lower the haunches and

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.909 
see the horse lower the haunches and
take<00:05:06.750> more<00:05:07.020> weight<00:05:07.319> and<00:05:08.659> Katie<00:05:09.659> what<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.080> saw<00:05:10.469> is

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
take more weight and Katie what I saw is

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:11.600 
take more weight and Katie what I saw is
the<00:05:11.219> horse

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
the horse

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.050 
the horse
slow<00:05:11.939> down<00:05:12.409> but<00:05:13.409> I<00:05:13.439> didn't<00:05:13.889> really<00:05:14.280> see<00:05:14.729> her

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
slow down but I didn't really see her

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.159 
slow down but I didn't really see her
articulate<00:05:18.060> more<00:05:18.300> in<00:05:18.509> the<00:05:18.659> hip<00:05:18.900> and

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
articulate more in the hip and

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.219 
articulate more in the hip and
articulate<00:05:19.919> more<00:05:20.159> in<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.490> cycle<00:05:21.150> she<00:05:21.810> says<00:05:22.020> no

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
articulate more in the cycle she says no

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:23.379 
articulate more in the cycle she says no
I<00:05:22.259> don't<00:05:22.560> think<00:05:22.620> so

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
I don't think so

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.689 
I don't think so
so<00:05:24.389> we<00:05:24.750> have<00:05:25.080> to<00:05:25.229> be<00:05:25.319> careful<00:05:25.830> as<00:05:25.919> judges<00:05:26.430> that

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
so we have to be careful as judges that

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.600 
so we have to be careful as judges that
we<00:05:26.849> don't<00:05:27.150> reward<00:05:27.960> just<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.919> slowing<00:05:29.430> down

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
we don't reward just the slowing down

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.820 
we don't reward just the slowing down
okay<00:05:30.180> we<00:05:30.360> want<00:05:30.569> to<00:05:30.689> see<00:05:30.960> those<00:05:31.229> joints

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
okay we want to see those joints

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.600 
okay we want to see those joints
compress<00:05:32.460> we<00:05:32.729> want<00:05:32.939> to<00:05:33.060> see<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:35.340> horse

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
compress we want to see the horse

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.820 
compress we want to see the horse
actually<00:05:36.419> take<00:05:36.689> the<00:05:36.930> weight<00:05:37.110> because<00:05:37.590> that's

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
actually take the weight because that's

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.860 
actually take the weight because that's
