a coincidence that this is all happening

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.230 
a coincidence that this is all happening
now<00:02:14.860> rather<00:02:15.370> than<00:02:15.600> than<00:02:16.600> some<00:02:16.840> other<00:02:16.960> time<00:02:18.240> in

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
now rather than than some other time in

now rather than than some other time in
every<00:02:19.570> community<00:02:19.750> dialogue<00:02:20.500> what<00:02:20.800> task<00:02:21.190> force

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
every community dialogue what task force

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.850 
every community dialogue what task force
has<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.850> be<00:02:21.940> disrupted<00:02:22.510> why<00:02:22.810> we<00:02:23.500> can't<00:02:23.710> have<00:02:23.770> a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
has to be disrupted why we can't have a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.350 
has to be disrupted why we can't have a
dialogue<00:02:24.340> where<00:02:24.580> we<00:02:24.610> can't<00:02:24.940> get<00:02:25.060> information

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
dialogue where we can't get information

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.510 
dialogue where we can't get information
and<00:02:25.750> learn<00:02:25.930> how<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.200> successfully<00:02:27.070> and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
and learn how to successfully and
