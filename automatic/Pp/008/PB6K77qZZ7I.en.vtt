he is 6 let's check what would happen if
now<00:01:20.330> black<00:01:21.330> takes<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.960> 6<00:01:22.640> then<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.700> will

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
now black takes on is 6 then you will

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
now black takes on is 6 then you will
have<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.360> variation<00:01:24.689> Knight<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.860> g5<00:01:27.020> Knight

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
have this variation Knight to g5 Knight

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.600 
have this variation Knight to g5 Knight
is<00:01:28.200> attacked<00:01:28.759> with<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> Queen<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.420> Bishop

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
so after Knight goes to from D to f6

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.410 
so after Knight goes to from D to f6
then<00:01:39.470> white<00:01:40.010> would<00:01:40.250> end<00:01:40.460> up<00:01:40.850> with<00:01:41.060> an<00:01:41.180> extra
