it's pretty cool you just form the field
again<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:26.159> even<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.729> guess<00:01:26.880> reaps

hexie summon him not bad

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.350 
hexie summon him not bad
the<00:01:30.659> only<00:01:30.810> downside<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.850> an<00:01:32.970> Oct

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the only downside is that this is an Oct

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.490 
the only downside is that this is an Oct
exclusive<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.079> kind<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.409> those

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
exclusive this is kind of one of those

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.410 
exclusive this is kind of one of those
things<00:01:34.770> again<00:01:35.070> where<00:01:35.340> it's<00:01:35.880> probably<00:01:36.180> gonna

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
things again where it's probably gonna

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.910 
things again where it's probably gonna
be<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.630> while<00:01:36.780> before<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.470> car<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.860> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
be a while before we get this car and it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.130 
be a while before we get this car and it
might<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:39.119> guess<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.600> won't<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:39.930> in

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
might not be it I guess it won't be in

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.920 
might not be it I guess it won't be in
primal<00:01:40.680> origin<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.280> us<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.790> don't<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.630> hate

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
primal origin for us I don't know I hate

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.819 
primal origin for us I don't know I hate
the<00:01:43.049> way<00:01:43.140> they're<00:01:43.290> kind<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.470> doing<00:01:43.710> this

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the way they're kind of doing this

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.679 
the way they're kind of doing this
lately<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.820> kind<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.210> Hillary

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
lately but it's kind of like the Hillary

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.450 
lately but it's kind of like the Hillary
cards<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.500> chronomaly<00:01:46.950> cards<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.369> we

didn't get from Lisa the Valiants so

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.109 
didn't get from Lisa the Valiants so
yeah<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:49.860> hopefully<00:01:50.189> we'll<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.610> card

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119

this<00:02:27.510> working<00:02:27.840> out<00:02:27.900> maybe<00:02:28.170> even<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.530> like<00:02:28.680> rock

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
this working out maybe even in like rock

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.440 
this working out maybe even in like rock

different rock Oquawka mirror cards I

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.350 
different rock Oquawka mirror cards I
see<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.430> kind<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.700> come<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:35.940> handy<00:02:36.150> for<00:02:36.240> them

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
see this kind of come in handy for them

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.120 
see this kind of come in handy for them
and<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.600> guess<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.080> know<00:02:37.200> if<00:02:37.470> people<00:02:38.010> actually

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
and I guess you know if people actually

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
and I guess you know if people actually
use<00:02:38.400> go-go-go

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
use go-go-go

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.790 
use go-go-go
I<00:02:39.180> guess<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.990> could<00:02:40.140> come<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.410> handy<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.680> know

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
I guess I could come in handy I know

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.620 
I guess I could come in handy I know
they<00:02:40.980> have<00:02:41.130> like<00:02:41.280> their<00:02:41.430> zombie<00:02:42.000> build<00:02:42.360> and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
they have like their zombie build and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.510 
they have like their zombie build and
all<00:02:43.050> -<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.440> works<00:02:43.620> out<00:02:43.830> pretty<00:02:44.160> well<00:02:44.340> so

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
all - that works out pretty well so

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.130 
all - that works out pretty well so
maybe<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.480> could<00:02:45.690> be<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.810> good<00:02:45.960> addition

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
maybe that this could be a good addition

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.010 
maybe that this could be a good addition
to<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.530> as<00:02:46.650> well<00:02:46.800> I'm<00:02:47.130> not<00:02:47.250> really<00:02:47.370> sure

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
to that as well I'm not really sure

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.360 
to that as well I'm not really sure
nonetheless<00:02:49.020> though<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.740> cool<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.070> see

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
nonetheless though it is cool to see

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.160 
nonetheless though it is cool to see
another<00:02:50.790> number<00:02:51.300> card<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.810> said<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.050> don't

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
another number card like I said I don't

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.900 
another number card like I said I don't
think<00:02:52.590> we've<00:02:53.040> heard<00:02:53.190> about<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:53.520> one<00:02:53.670> before

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
think we've heard about this one before

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.430 
think we've heard about this one before
maybe<00:02:54.090> I'm<00:02:54.270> just<00:02:54.480> not<00:02:54.570> remembering<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.320> don't

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
maybe I'm just not remembering I don't

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.170 
maybe I'm just not remembering I don't
think<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.680> was<00:02:55.740> from<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.010> manga<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.520> or<00:02:56.910> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
think it was from the manga and or the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.750 
think it was from the manga and or the
anime<00:02:57.540> but<00:02:57.780> I'm<00:02:57.930> not<00:02:58.020> really<00:02:58.170> sure<00:02:58.760> again

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
anime but I'm not really sure again

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.120

really like this card's effect I like
how<00:04:33.419> it's<00:04:33.539> something<00:04:33.810> different<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.469> know

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
how it's something different you know

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.050 
how it's something different you know
like<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:34.800> said<00:04:34.949> it's<00:04:35.099> armored<00:04:35.370> I'm<00:04:35.520> version<00:04:35.969> and

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
like I said it's armored I'm version and

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.159 
like I said it's armored I'm version and
you<00:04:36.150> know<00:04:36.240> for<00:04:36.449> next<00:04:36.659> C<00:04:36.780> I<00:04:36.810> think<00:04:37.020> it's<00:04:37.110> the

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
you know for next C I think it's the

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.080 
you know for next C I think it's the
first<00:04:37.349> type<00:04:37.650> of<00:04:37.680> really<00:04:38.580> that<00:04:38.729> we've<00:04:38.879> seen

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
first type of really that we've seen

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.999 
first type of really that we've seen
like<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.719> I<00:04:40.439> can't<00:04:40.620> wait<00:04:40.710> for<00:04:40.830> this<00:04:40.889> one

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
like that and I can't wait for this one

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.529 
like that and I can't wait for this one
to<00:04:41.069> come<00:04:41.189> out<00:04:41.280> either<00:04:41.460> but<00:04:42.150> yeah<00:04:42.240> what<00:04:42.449> do<00:04:42.509> you

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
to come out either but yeah what do you

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.330

think<00:04:42.629> about<00:04:42.990> these<00:04:43.199> three<00:04:43.500> member<00:04:43.889> monsters

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340
