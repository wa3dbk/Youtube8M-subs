sawed-off short-barreled rifle simply

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.189 
sawed-off short-barreled rifle simply
because<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.280> was<00:01:02.430> torch<00:01:02.760> cut<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> ATF<00:01:03.870> spec

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
because it was torch cut to the ATF spec

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.039 
because it was torch cut to the ATF spec
which<00:01:04.589> requires<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.309> removal<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.330> quarter

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
which requires the removal of a quarter

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.080 
which requires the removal of a quarter
inch<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.320> material<00:01:07.409> using<00:01:08.369> an<00:01:08.700> oxy<00:01:09.030> acetylene

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
inch of material using an oxy acetylene

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.340 
inch of material using an oxy acetylene
torch<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:10.049> three<00:01:10.320> places<00:01:10.700> that<00:01:11.840> was<00:01:12.840> done<00:01:13.049> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
torch in three places that was done and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.420 
torch in three places that was done and
then<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> was<00:01:14.840> painstakingly<00:01:15.920> jig<00:01:16.920> back<00:01:17.189> up

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
then it was painstakingly jig back up

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.340 
then it was painstakingly jig back up
and<00:01:17.670> welded<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> ton<00:01:19.110> ton<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:21.350> cleanup

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and welded and then a ton ton of cleanup

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.300 
and welded and then a ton ton of cleanup
work<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.950> do

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
work to do

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.580 
work to do
so<00:01:23.840> it's<00:01:24.840> an<00:01:24.990> unreal<00:01:25.350> quantity<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.189> work<00:01:26.509> just

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
so it's an unreal quantity of work just

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.760 
so it's an unreal quantity of work just
essentially<00:01:28.590> saw<00:01:28.860> four<00:01:29.159> rifle<00:01:30.320> but<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.530> done

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
essentially saw four rifle but it's done

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:40.789 
essentially saw four rifle but it's done
and<00:01:32.040> now<00:01:32.610> I've<00:01:32.820> got<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.290> legal<00:01:36.590> yeah<00:01:37.619> legal<00:01:39.799> ion

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
and now I've got a legal yeah legal ion

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.649 
and now I've got a legal yeah legal ion
blaster

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
blaster

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.560 
blaster
so<00:01:42.659> you'll<00:01:43.560> notice<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.100> grenade<00:01:44.850> Cup<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.390> not

so you'll notice the grenade Cup is not

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.080 
so you'll notice the grenade Cup is not
yet<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
yet on it

California so this is also originally
constructed<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> longer<00:01:52.890> barrel<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.310> be

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
constructed with a longer barrel to be

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.679 
constructed with a longer barrel to be
in<00:01:53.520> compliance<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:54.060> their<00:01:54.240> single-shot

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
diameter ring inside it that'll serve

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.660 
diameter ring inside it that'll serve
two<00:02:06.479> purposes<00:02:07.220> it's<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> be<00:02:08.489> right

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
two purposes it's going to be right

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.130 
two purposes it's going to be right
inside<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.300> lip<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.720> the

inside the lip of the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.300 
inside the lip of the
of<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.500> canister<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:13.060> right<00:02:13.480> here<00:02:13.720> at<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.960> end

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.830 

yeah<00:02:18.310> that'll<00:02:18.610> that'll<00:02:18.820> create<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.300> bit<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.720> a

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
yeah that'll that'll create a bit of a

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.160 
yeah that'll that'll create a bit of a
vortex<00:02:20.380> effect<00:02:20.770> for<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.280> fireballs<00:02:21.730> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
vortex effect for the fireballs and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.020 
vortex effect for the fireballs and
it'll<00:02:23.170> keep<00:02:23.380> any<00:02:23.680> sort<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.070> grenade<00:02:24.460> from

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
it'll keep any sort of grenade from

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.940 
it'll keep any sort of grenade from
being<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.600> able<00:02:25.990> to<00:02:26.050> be<00:02:26.140> inserted<00:02:26.620> into<00:02:26.830> it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
being and able to be inserted into it

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.220 
being and able to be inserted into it
and<00:02:27.160> eliminate<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.850> issues<00:02:28.480> with<00:02:28.810> having<00:02:29.140> a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
and eliminate the issues with having a

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.320 
and eliminate the issues with having a
grenade<00:02:29.530> launcher<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.040> California<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:31.180> that's

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
grenade launcher in California so that's

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.410 
grenade launcher in California so that's
all<00:02:31.510> happening<00:02:31.540> before<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.170> comes<00:02:32.350> in<00:02:33.420> I'm

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
all happening before it comes in I'm

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.330 
all happening before it comes in I'm
gonna<00:02:34.600> have<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.840> make<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.050> bushing<00:02:35.560> or<00:02:36.280> an

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
gonna have to make a bushing or an

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.980 
gonna have to make a bushing or an
adapter<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:36.910> threads<00:02:37.180> onto<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:37.570> barrel

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
adapter that threads onto this barrel

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.720 
adapter that threads onto this barrel
and<00:02:38.230> then<00:02:38.350> adapts<00:02:38.770> it<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.160> threads<00:02:39.460> for

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
and then adapts it to the threads for

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.520 
and then adapts it to the threads for
the<00:02:39.880> grenade<00:02:40.180> launcher<00:02:40.600> Cup<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.470> don't

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
the grenade launcher Cup and I don't

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.930 
the grenade launcher Cup and I don't
know<00:02:41.740> what<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.890> spec<00:02:42.130> is<00:02:42.310> yes<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:42.640> haven't<00:02:42.790> been

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
know what the spec is yes I haven't been

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.410 
know what the spec is yes I haven't been
able<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.150> make<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:45.240> but<00:02:46.920> test-fired<00:02:47.920> this

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
able to make that but test-fired this

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.330 
able to make that but test-fired this
today<00:02:49.420> actually<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:51.810> she<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:52.900> 100%

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340

we<00:02:57.550> was<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.820> little<00:02:57.850> worried<00:02:58.240> on<00:02:58.300> this<00:02:58.480> one<00:02:58.630> just

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
we was a little worried on this one just

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.050 
we was a little worried on this one just
because<00:02:58.840> unlike<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.440> Mo's<00:02:59.650> ins<00:02:59.920> which<00:03:00.670> take

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
because unlike the Mo's ins which take

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.270 
because unlike the Mo's ins which take
all<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.300> pressure<00:03:01.450> up<00:03:01.720> front<00:03:02.020> an<00:03:02.290> Enfield<00:03:03.100> has

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
all the pressure up front an Enfield has

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.860 
all the pressure up front an Enfield has
the<00:03:03.520> lugs<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.030> rear<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.450> there's<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.690> very

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
the lugs in the rear and there's a very

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.920 
the lugs in the rear and there's a very
real<00:03:08.080> chance<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.530> when<00:03:08.770> you<00:03:09.300> remove<00:03:10.300> and

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
real chance that when you remove and

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.810 
real chance that when you remove and
then<00:03:11.020> replace<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.890> put<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:12.130> much<00:03:12.310> heat<00:03:12.580> into

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
then replace and put this much heat into

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.690 
then replace and put this much heat into
a<00:03:12.850> receiver<00:03:13.860> no<00:03:14.860> matter<00:03:15.040> how<00:03:15.190> careful<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:15.610> are

a receiver no matter how careful you are

no matter how much you are attended to

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.949 
no matter how much you are attended to
the<00:03:19.630> details<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:21.070> can<00:03:21.630> create<00:03:22.630> some<00:03:22.810> pretty

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
the details it can create some pretty

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.250 
the details it can create some pretty
significant<00:03:23.830> issues<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:27.450> proof<00:03:28.450> tested<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:28.989> I

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
significant issues so proof tested it I

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.560 
significant issues so proof tested it I
actually<00:03:29.980> have<00:03:30.280> some<00:03:30.400> video<00:03:30.550> I'll<00:03:31.060> attach<00:03:31.360> the
