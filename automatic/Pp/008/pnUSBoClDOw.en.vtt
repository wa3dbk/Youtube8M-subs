00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello friends how are you here I leave you 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.650
 this last video that I recorded from the set 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.650
 that I bring Christmas is very fast and 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.170
 salable I lengthen the bed of the nail 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.070
 but if they do not , it will also be 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.800
 great I'm using a red leader 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.989
 Golden leader and crisis mix of the year 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.780
 past and it is green it quoted with red that I 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.700
 gave last year also the red 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.579
 has leaders of all kinds that I 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.580
 I found in my geographical drawers but 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.260
 they are red then now it can be better 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.360
 have complicated me less and create a 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.190
 only mix but this was what I liked 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.650
 of this set that is all mixed up in this 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.780
 case I wanted it to stand out more than 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.090
 red the tone that you want that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.660
 excel more you put more of 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.100
 that if you want more gold or more green 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.670
 I finished stirring everything but it looks 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.670
 beautiful 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.960
 this green mix quote makes the effect 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.600
 as well as if it were a finite Christmas 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.890
 with beads, the beam is a golden 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.400
 green and red why I brought mine that 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.409
 It was all colors with golden tones 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.729
 that made the effect like little lights and 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.729
 I also put it on 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.880
 I build the thin almonds 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.039
 taking advantage of this is a tip for the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.159
 end here with pink acrylic 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.869
 translucent I give it an effect 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.750
 makeup but I am to the taste of 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.689
 everyone spherical too well 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.970
 easy to make two droplets let 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.299
 the acrylic flow take care not to 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:58.390
 lose or more the redondito and is the 3d 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:00.729
 fastest and easiest in the whole world 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.920
 well I'm retiring I let you see 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.659
 the full application I hope this 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.640
 design has been to your liking and what 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.000
 can offer in their business to their 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.160
 customers and it's all as always many
