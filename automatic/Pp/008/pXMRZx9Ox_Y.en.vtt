00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.809
 the ocu on the cost of their presentations in Brazil 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.560
 rajoy 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.560
 so injury session 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.449
 it is extensive 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.289
 said this he pointed 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.289
 justin theroux 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.350
 placing us in such a distant 2133 gift of peace between the different races of 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.280
 the galaxy find equilibrium caused a turiasaurus we call will we 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.130
 will check everyone thanks to a new technology here is where 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.280
 we enter to fire us as they are chiapas and evidently we have to 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.980
 get peace to remain stable 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.330
 as in any region 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.330
 we can choose different parameters of his character will go from the physicists 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.320
 as sex but and other attributes 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.870
 to the provenance and his predetermined abilities as a soldier 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.710
 what enriches characters 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.580
 geither first moment that we choose as it is logical to solange the story 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 will vary and will be built on our decisions 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.070
 facing expenses in the way other 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.540
 answer with one phrase there was another and do not trust john and pillar 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.670
 will undoubtedly make history take a course there were others and that our 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.180
 objectives are 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.180
 easiest is to complete 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.760
 the action pair that you have issues is very high in the case of an RPG 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.260
 It is not usual to have such a high percentage 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.720
 we will always shoot third person coupled with variety of weapons still 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.980
 more willing you prepared for one type or another of soldier we have 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.170
 selected 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.689
 the shootings will almost be as intense as any suter 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.150
 but if I make a mark especially the rpg is the exploration 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.540
 and this time our protagonist of 'researching and moving around 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.069
 different planets 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.040
 and we will do it aboard a vehicle called a capable off-road frame and 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.809
 aero slip 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:17.549
 in each of them we will see some give clues and gather information 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.840
 but careful stopping our decisions that information will be 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.219
 Free or paid 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.569
 as well as that we can strengthen some friendships that can be of 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.429
 great help the future of adventure 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:32.729
 In the face of such responsibility we will not be alone because it was possible to choose 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.779
 comrades who will be those who obey or these orders 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:39.389
 failed huerta has managed to recreate a title that introduce us a galaxy 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.579
 with worlds exceptionally of them 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.859
 where a multitude of different races and customs abound 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.369
 from the call to Normandy area we can go selecting towards planet 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:49.499
 we want to go 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.889
 In each of them, varied and intense missions await us. 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.679
 of this title one of the most essential of the xbox 360 catalog 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:02.779
 The visual finish of mass effect is amazing in every way from 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:05.809
 the partial reproduction design is to say that the characters 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:10.049
 to their animations to the own batted enclosures we move as well as a 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.979
 textures effects liters very well worked 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.979
 the sound section is excellent with good compositions 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:19.389
 the dollar is missing 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.899
 neither has online mode 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:24.899
 even just with these two negative notes that we have found 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.980
 more effect has been able to be placed thanks to his colleague as a whole as one of the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.150
 big
