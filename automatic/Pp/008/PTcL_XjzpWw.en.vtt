wondering where we're at and that's my

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.420 
wondering where we're at and that's my
naval<00:00:34.410> base<00:00:34.590> over<00:00:34.860> there<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> lot<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.399> guys

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
are asking where's the naval base and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.860 
are asking where's the naval base and
it's<00:00:37.380> right<00:00:37.500> over<00:00:37.530> there<00:00:38.059> if<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.270> jump<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.629> can

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
it's right over there if we jump we can

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.680 
it's right over there if we jump we can
see<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.200> castle<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.770> over<00:00:40.980> there<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:42.090> this

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
see the castle it's over there and this

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.630 
see the castle it's over there and this
is<00:00:42.870> actually<00:00:43.290> where<00:00:43.500> our<00:00:43.770> spawn<00:00:44.129> point<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
is actually where our spawn point is

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.340 
is actually where our spawn point is
that<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.000> should<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.200> believe

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
that it should be right there I believe

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
that it should be right there I believe
and<00:00:47.570> this<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.989> made<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.530> little<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.980> area

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and this is I made this little like area

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.619 
and this is I made this little like area
so<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.700> case<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.030> die<00:00:51.170> I<00:00:52.170> spawn<00:00:52.860> safely<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
so in case I die I spawn safely and I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
so in case I die I spawn safely and I
come<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.410> ladder<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.949> just

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
come down here with the ladder and just

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.139 
come down here with the ladder and just
in<00:00:56.640> case<00:00:57.000> any<00:00:57.360> monsters<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:58.559> happened<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
in case any monsters so what happened to

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.779 
in case any monsters so what happened to
get<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.300> somehow<00:01:01.010> there's<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.100> door<00:01:02.340> here<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
get in somehow there's a door here to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.030 
get in somehow there's a door here to
prevent<00:01:03.030> them<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:03.439> coming<00:01:04.439> all<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> way

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
prevent them from coming all the way

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.789 
prevent them from coming all the way
into<00:01:05.250> my<00:01:05.400> base<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:06.049> built<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.200> underground

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
into my base I built this underground

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.800 
into my base I built this underground
tunnel<00:01:08.310> will<00:01:08.790> not<00:01:08.939> underground<00:01:09.299> under<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
tunnel will not underground under the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.240 
tunnel will not underground under the
water<00:01:10.760> I'm<00:01:11.760> very<00:01:11.820> similar<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:13.680> other<00:01:13.710> one

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
water I'm very similar to the other one

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.850 
water I'm very similar to the other one
that<00:01:14.460> leads<00:01:14.670> into<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.360> giant<00:01:16.170> castle<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.290 
in here and you see my cactus farm and
cactus<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:37.920> didn't<00:03:38.580> think<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.850> needed<00:03:38.940> water

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
cactus I didn't think it needed water

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.180 
cactus I didn't think it needed water
and<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.600> don't<00:03:39.930> think<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.260> needs<00:03:40.650> water<00:03:40.739> but<00:03:41.160> I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
and I don't think it needs water but I

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.860 
and I don't think it needs water but I
wanted<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.700> add<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.060> water<00:03:42.239> for<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:42.690> nice

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
wanted to add the water for that nice

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.270 
wanted to add the water for that nice
cool<00:03:43.230> even<00:03:43.850> OCD<00:03:44.850> effect<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.450> have<00:03:46.280> where

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
cool even OCD effect that I have where

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.250 
cool even OCD effect that I have where
everything<00:03:47.519> needs<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.060> match<00:03:48.209> up<00:03:48.420> but<00:03:48.660> cactus

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
everything needs to match up but cactus

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.870 
everything needs to match up but cactus
doesn't<00:03:49.590> need<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.769> grow<00:03:49.920> on<00:03:50.040> sand<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.610> it

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
doesn't need to grow on sand and it

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.600 
doesn't need to grow on sand and it
needs<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.300> be<00:03:51.510> on<00:03:52.080> alternating<00:03:52.920> blocks<00:03:53.400> you

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
needs to be on alternating blocks you

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.340 
needs to be on alternating blocks you
can't<00:03:53.850> actually<00:03:54.030> like<00:03:54.360> cactus<00:03:54.810> next<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.260> each

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
can't actually like cactus next to each

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.699 
can't actually like cactus next to each
other<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:56.489> cactus<00:03:57.170> mine<00:03:58.170> will<00:03:58.530> look

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
other so this is cactus mine will look

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.050 
other so this is cactus mine will look
different<00:03:58.860> than<00:03:59.250> yours<00:03:59.489> unless<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.850> have<00:04:00.030> a

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
different than yours unless you have a

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.390 
different than yours unless you have a

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
texture package and then there's another

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.449 
texture package and then there's another
tree<00:04:06.260> now<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.320> castle<00:04:07.920> really<00:04:08.160> does<00:04:08.310> look

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
to see me do next my options that I was

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.659 
to see me do next my options that I was
really<00:04:33.360> thinking<00:04:33.630> of<00:04:34.020> is<00:04:34.199> either<00:04:34.410> going<00:04:35.340> back

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
really thinking of is either going back

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.210 
really thinking of is either going back
down<00:04:35.970> mine<00:04:36.360> shaft<00:04:36.720> or<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.590> mine<00:04:37.770> shaft<00:04:38.040> that<00:04:38.160> i

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
down mine shaft or the mine shaft that i

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.270 
down mine shaft or the mine shaft that i
have<00:04:38.490> here<00:04:38.520> underneath<00:04:39.210> here<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:39.979> going<00:04:40.979> all

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
have here underneath here and going all

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.219 
have here underneath here and going all
it<00:04:41.400> like<00:04:41.610> going<00:04:41.850> further<00:04:42.180> down<00:04:42.330> then<00:04:42.780> then

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
it like going further down then then

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.409 
it like going further down then then
like<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.130> cave<00:04:44.400> that<00:04:44.430> i<00:04:44.639> found<00:04:44.940> like<00:04:45.150> keep

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
like the cave that i found like keep

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.090 
like the cave that i found like keep
digging<00:04:45.870> straight<00:04:46.260> down<00:04:46.470> until<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:46.860> hit<00:04:46.979> the

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
digging straight down until I hit the

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.920 
digging straight down until I hit the
bedrock<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:47.669> then<00:04:47.790> try<00:04:48.449> to<00:04:48.479> find<00:04:48.750> some

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
bedrock and then try to find some

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.939 
bedrock and then try to find some
diamond<00:04:49.290> from<00:04:49.410> there<00:04:49.940> or<00:04:51.199> work<00:04:52.199> on<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.440> next

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
diamond from there or work on the next

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.680 
diamond from there or work on the next
tree<00:04:53.280> plantation<00:04:53.970> which<00:04:54.120> would<00:04:54.300> be<00:04:54.449> on<00:04:54.570> the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
tree plantation which would be on the

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.510 
tree plantation which would be on the
opposite<00:04:55.229> side<00:04:55.470> of<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.770> base<00:04:55.949> which<00:04:56.220> would<00:04:56.400> be

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
opposite side of the base which would be

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:04.430 
opposite side of the base which would be
over<00:04:56.729> there<00:04:59.060> next<00:05:00.060> one<00:05:00.479> was<00:05:01.340> digging<00:05:03.200> or<00:05:04.200> not

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
over there next one was digging or not

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.050 
over there next one was digging or not
digging<00:05:04.770> building<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.639> rest<00:05:05.820> of<00:05:05.970> these

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
digging building the rest of these

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.640 
digging building the rest of these
layers<00:05:06.389> because<00:05:06.690> that's<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.050> lot<00:05:07.200> of<00:05:07.229> work<00:05:07.470> and

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
layers because that's a lot of work and

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.740 
layers because that's a lot of work and
just<00:05:07.919> right<00:05:08.190> now<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:08.370> kind<00:05:08.700> of<00:05:08.880> not<00:05:09.389> sure<00:05:09.630> if

or what I was thinking about doing is
similar<00:05:23.100> to<00:05:23.220> what<00:05:23.340> i<00:05:23.370> did<00:05:23.610> here<00:05:23.639> and<00:05:24.060> build

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
similar to what i did here and build

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.640 
similar to what i did here and build
this<00:05:24.419> kind<00:05:24.630> of<00:05:24.720> little<00:05:24.930> island<00:05:25.380> and<00:05:25.560> then

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
this kind of little island and then

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.070 
this kind of little island and then
built<00:05:25.949> upon<00:05:26.250> it<00:05:26.490> I<00:05:26.669> was<00:05:27.360> thinking<00:05:27.479> about<00:05:27.690> just

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
built upon it I was thinking about just

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.230 
built upon it I was thinking about just
making<00:05:28.410> like<00:05:28.979> three<00:05:29.370> little<00:05:29.610> islands<00:05:30.180> out

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
making like three little islands out

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.070 
making like three little islands out
there<00:05:30.330> in<00:05:31.110> that<00:05:31.710> ocean<00:05:32.010> kind<00:05:33.000> of<00:05:33.120> x<00:05:33.510> where<00:05:33.870> that

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
there in that ocean kind of x where that

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.560 
there in that ocean kind of x where that
for<00:05:34.320> by<00:05:35.039> the<00:05:35.100> little<00:05:35.700> thing<00:05:36.150> that<00:05:36.180> I<00:05:36.389> made<00:05:36.539> over

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
for by the little thing that I made over

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.900 
for by the little thing that I made over
there<00:05:36.840> for<00:05:37.020> my<00:05:37.110> spawn<00:05:37.380> but<00:05:38.340> with<00:05:38.460> underground

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
there for my spawn but with underground

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.210 
there for my spawn but with underground
tunnels<00:05:39.419> and<00:05:39.660> kind<00:05:40.380> of<00:05:40.440> connecting<00:05:40.919> it<00:05:41.039> and

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
tunnels and kind of connecting it and

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.010 
tunnels and kind of connecting it and
making<00:05:41.400> three<00:05:41.880> different<00:05:41.910> mine<00:05:42.360> shafts<00:05:42.660> kind

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
making three different mine shafts kind

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.290 
making three different mine shafts kind
of<00:05:43.110> just<00:05:43.320> almost<00:05:43.650> side<00:05:44.160> by<00:05:44.340> side<00:05:44.580> but<00:05:44.940> with<00:05:45.270> a

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
of just almost side by side but with a

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.719 
of just almost side by side but with a
few<00:05:45.599> blocks<00:05:45.750> in<00:05:46.139> between<00:05:46.470> and<00:05:46.710> then<00:05:47.340> just<00:05:47.490> dig

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
few blocks in between and then just dig

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.370 
few blocks in between and then just dig
straight<00:05:47.940> down<00:05:48.030> in<00:05:48.360> each<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.750> them<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:49.080> kind

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
straight down in each of them and kind
