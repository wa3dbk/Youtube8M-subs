00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.260
 I'll show you how to do it today 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.750
 braid needles 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.560
 it gives you prym in two strengths 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.600
 So depending on the needle strength one uses 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.690
 the thinner or the thicker cable patterns 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:27.960
 Needle in instructions become personal 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:38.219
 as an auxiliary needle or cable needle 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:40.829
 I have a braid with her 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.359
 the stitch to the left times after 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.359
 be scratched right 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.750
 now they are scratched to the left 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.539
 that means you take these twice the 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.159
 to be sold to them for 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.869
 Muster Madl and hang her before work 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:09.710
 then you strictly the following two 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:14.110
 knit and then knit these two 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.110
 People of the breed look down on nobility 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.750
 Once again you take those on the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.270
 needle and pushes the stitches up to 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.740
 this bow 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.740
 that prevents it from slipping out 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.479
 the more people need to be sold 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.479
 the more helpful this needle 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.730
 so the following four people will be 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.920
 to the right was crossed then I take 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:39.110
 So these stitches from behind on the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:42.730
 needle knit the following two off and on 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.730
 then the mesh of the help nail 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.409
 and again from the back a sting up 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.409
 push through to the bow 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.900
 which pattern needles are so real 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:34.130
 helper pass knit at the zipfel 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.130
 most not lost
