although it's designed to come down cold
it's<00:01:20.220> possible<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> flaming<00:01:21.689> ball<00:01:21.900> could

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
it's possible that a flaming ball could

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.590 
it's possible that a flaming ball could
actually<00:01:22.470> reach<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.070> ground<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.970> cause<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
actually reach the ground and cause a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.899 
actually reach the ground and cause a
fire<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:26.009> very<00:01:26.220> careful<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
fire so you have to be very careful and

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.929 
fire so you have to be very careful and
watch<00:01:27.509> where<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.350> flaming<00:01:28.829> projectiles<00:01:28.979> come

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
watch where the flaming projectiles come

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.460 
watch where the flaming projectiles come
down<00:01:31.280> finally<00:01:32.280> when<00:01:33.119> your<00:01:33.479> roman<00:01:33.810> candle<00:01:34.290> has

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
down finally when your roman candle has

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.940 
down finally when your roman candle has
expended<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.189> its<00:01:35.220> energy<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.710> best

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
expended all its energy the best

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.069 
expended all its energy the best
practice<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> simply<00:01:39.420> douse<00:01:39.720> them<00:01:40.049> with

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
practice is to simply douse them with

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.920 
practice is to simply douse them with
water<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:41.189> make<00:01:41.400> sure<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.970> cooled<00:01:42.299> down<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
water to make sure it's cooled down and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.830 
water to make sure it's cooled down and
