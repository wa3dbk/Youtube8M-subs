really interested in video equipment you
know<00:00:11.070> lenses<00:00:11.519> stuff<00:00:11.730> like<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.780> is

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
know lenses stuff like that and this is

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.749 
know lenses stuff like that and this is
just<00:00:13.259> perfect<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:13.980> me<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.190> make<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> video<00:00:14.490> on

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
just perfect for me to make a video on

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.779 
just perfect for me to make a video on
this<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.179> glidecam<00:00:15.719> HD<00:00:16.590> two<00:00:16.800> thousand<00:00:17.340> it

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
this is the glidecam HD two thousand it

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.519 
this is the glidecam HD two thousand it
works<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> gimbal<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.140> basically<00:00:19.289> a

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
works on a gimbal and it's basically a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.050 
works on a gimbal and it's basically a
monopod<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.189> weights<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> bottom<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
monopod with weights on the bottom and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.700 
monopod with weights on the bottom and
then<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> mounting<00:00:21.660> bracket<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.170> top<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
then a mounting bracket on the top and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.609 
then a mounting bracket on the top and
it<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.430> makes<00:00:23.670> everything<00:00:24.080> insanely<00:00:25.080> smooth

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
it just makes everything insanely smooth

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.009 
it just makes everything insanely smooth
so<00:00:25.859> as<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.189> see<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:26.640> no<00:00:27.480> movement<00:00:27.960> at

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
so as you can see here no movement at

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.349 
so as you can see here no movement at
all<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.619> yeah<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.429> awesome<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.119> of

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
tips once I master the glidecam

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.770 
tips once I master the glidecam
technique<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.940> I've<00:00:36.030> been<00:00:36.149> wanting<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
technique so I've been wanting a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.139 
technique so I've been wanting a
glidecam<00:00:37.350> for<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> really<00:00:38.309> long<00:00:38.340> time<00:00:38.520> now<00:00:38.969> I've

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
glidecam for a really long time now I've

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.700 
glidecam for a really long time now I've
actually<00:00:39.719> spent<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> last<00:00:40.410> five<00:00:40.680> months

actually spent the last five months
watching<00:00:41.219> tutorials<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.540> how<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.690> use<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
watching tutorials on how to use a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.250 
watching tutorials on how to use a
glidecam<00:00:43.530> different<00:00:44.489> techniques<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.300> I'm<00:00:45.870> not

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
glidecam different techniques so I'm not

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.119 
glidecam different techniques so I'm not
that<00:00:46.710> new<00:00:47.190> into<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.360> space<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.500> guess<00:00:49.860> of

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that new into this space I guess of

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
that new into this space I guess of
steady<00:00:50.460> cams<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.180> know<00:00:51.539> how<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.780> work<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.199> you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
steady cams I know how to work it you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.770 
steady cams I know how to work it you
know<00:00:52.500> basics<00:00:53.370> pretty<00:00:53.879> pretty<00:00:54.300> simple<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
know basics pretty pretty simple the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.209 
know basics pretty pretty simple the
hard<00:00:54.930> part<00:00:55.110> was<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.379> bouncing<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.920> took<00:00:56.100> me

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
hard part was just bouncing it took me

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.670 
hard part was just bouncing it took me
about<00:00:56.340> two<00:00:56.550> hours<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:57.570> yeah<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.530> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
glidecam right now i just have it facing

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.670 
glidecam right now i just have it facing
towards<00:01:29.850> me<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.540> i<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.960> say<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.439> probably
