Anakin<00:03:37.600> that<00:03:38.070> Lego<00:03:39.070> has<00:03:39.280> made<00:03:39.580> so<00:03:39.850> far<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.480> think

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
Anakin that Lego has made so far I think

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.680 
Anakin that Lego has made so far I think
it's<00:03:41.530> detailed<00:03:42.250> really<00:03:42.610> well<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.240> like<00:03:43.420> the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
it's detailed really well and I like the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.280 
it's detailed really well and I like the
eyes<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.770> all<00:03:44.860> on<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.660> just<00:03:46.660> look<00:03:46.840> really<00:03:47.050> cool

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
eyes and all on it just look really cool

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.450 
eyes and all on it just look really cool
to<00:03:47.440> me

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
to me

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.360 
to me
but<00:03:48.730> let's<00:03:49.090> look<00:03:49.300> at<00:03:49.420> this<00:03:49.570> set<00:03:49.870> now<00:03:50.160> those<00:03:51.160> are

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
but let's look at this set now those are

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:59.940 
but let's look at this set now those are
all<00:03:51.640> five<00:03:51.910> of<00:03:51.940> your<00:03:52.210> minifigs<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:58.660> first<00:03:59.320> here

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
all five of your minifigs so first here

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.290 
all five of your minifigs so first here
is<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.600> platform<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.960> obi-wan<00:04:02.880> jumps<00:04:03.880> on<00:04:04.060> to

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
is the platform that obi-wan jumps on to

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.170 
is the platform that obi-wan jumps on to
in<00:04:04.570> the<00:04:04.810> lava<00:04:05.020> river<00:04:08.100> kind<00:04:09.100> of<00:04:09.220> top<00:04:09.460> view<00:04:09.790> of<00:04:09.850> it

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
in the lava river kind of top view of it

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.230 
in the lava river kind of top view of it
I<00:04:11.250> think<00:04:12.250> it's<00:04:12.340> really<00:04:12.460> accurate<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:13.210> the

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
I think it's really accurate to the

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.900 
I think it's really accurate to the
movie<00:04:15.660> then<00:04:16.660> you've<00:04:16.870> got<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:18.370> remaining

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
movie then you've got the remaining

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.840 
movie then you've got the remaining
Droid<00:04:19.420> or<00:04:20.250> mining<00:04:21.250> robot<00:04:21.960> that<00:04:23.430> Anakin<00:04:24.430> jumps

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
Droid or mining robot that Anakin jumps

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.380 
Droid or mining robot that Anakin jumps
on<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:26.310> during<00:04:27.310> their<00:04:27.460> fight<00:04:30.000> let's<00:04:31.000> get<00:04:31.240> the

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
on to during their fight let's get the

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.320 
on to during their fight let's get the
arms<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:31.930> all<00:04:32.670> and<00:04:33.670> see<00:04:33.850> it's<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.060> little<00:04:34.150> bit

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
arms and all and see it's a little bit

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.890 
arms and all and see it's a little bit
taller<00:04:35.020> than<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.860> platform<00:04:36.600> but<00:04:37.600> of<00:04:37.690> course

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
taller than the platform but of course

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.810 
taller than the platform but of course
it<00:04:38.080> doesn't<00:04:38.260> have<00:04:38.530> as<00:04:38.770> much<00:04:38.950> room<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.370> stand<00:04:39.580> on

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
it doesn't have as much room to stand on

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.220 
it doesn't have as much room to stand on
and<00:04:43.800> then<00:04:44.800> here<00:04:45.340> is<00:04:45.810> Anakin's<00:04:46.810> Jedi

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
and then here is Anakin's Jedi

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.000 
and then here is Anakin's Jedi

it you'll see right there that's where

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:37.290 
it you'll see right there that's where
r2d2<00:05:30.639> sits<00:05:33.629> and<00:05:35.099> this<00:05:36.099> is<00:05:36.250> the<00:05:36.460> bottom<00:05:37.150> of<00:05:37.240> the

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
here two of them I guess because no Lego

without qlik fire missiles they're cool

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:53.969 
without qlik fire missiles they're cool
on<00:05:52.090> some<00:05:52.360> sets<00:05:52.659> but<00:05:52.960> I<00:05:53.020> do<00:05:53.229> get<00:05:53.650> tired<00:05:53.830> of

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
on some sets but I do get tired of

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.649 
on some sets but I do get tired of
seeing<00:05:54.129> them<00:05:54.340> on<00:05:54.490> every<00:05:55.000> single<00:05:55.180> set<00:05:55.539> they

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
seeing them on every single set they

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.770 
seeing them on every single set they
make<00:05:55.900> now<00:05:56.169> it<00:05:56.440> seems<00:05:56.680> like<00:05:57.300> maybe<00:05:58.300> not<00:05:58.509> every

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
make now it seems like maybe not every

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.430 
make now it seems like maybe not every
one<00:05:58.900> but<00:05:58.960> just<00:05:59.289> about<00:06:00.750> and<00:06:01.750> here's<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.229> back

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
one but just about and here's the back

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.409 
one but just about and here's the back
you<00:06:03.370> see<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.550> engines<00:06:04.090> there<00:06:04.500> and<00:06:06.270> you<00:06:07.270> can

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
you see the engines there and you can

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:13.399 
you see the engines there and you can
open<00:06:07.690> up<00:06:07.810> the<00:06:08.379> cockpit<00:06:08.889> like<00:06:09.610> that<00:06:11.759> and

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
open up the cockpit like that and

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.550 
open up the cockpit like that and
there's<00:06:14.409> the<00:06:14.560> inside<00:06:14.979> of<00:06:15.250> the<00:06:15.370> cockpit<00:06:15.550> and

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
there's the inside of the cockpit and

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.070 
there's the inside of the cockpit and
the<00:06:17.560> cockpit<00:06:17.770> is<00:06:18.159> a<00:06:18.190> printed<00:06:19.000> piece<00:06:19.270> so<00:06:19.870> I<00:06:19.930> was

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
the cockpit is a printed piece so I was

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.050 
the cockpit is a printed piece so I was
very<00:06:20.110> happy<00:06:20.349> about<00:06:20.680> that

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
very happy about that

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.719 
very happy about that
you<00:06:22.330> don't<00:06:22.509> have<00:06:22.599> to<00:06:22.690> put<00:06:22.840> a<00:06:22.870> sticker<00:06:23.169> on<00:06:23.289> there

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
you don't have to put a sticker on there

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.360 
you don't have to put a sticker on there
so<00:06:24.729> that<00:06:24.759> was<00:06:25.000> very<00:06:25.060> nice<00:06:25.389> and<00:06:26.069> the<00:06:27.069> front

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
so that was very nice and the front

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.510 
so that was very nice and the front
piece<00:06:27.699> there<00:06:28.060> is<00:06:28.300> also<00:06:28.750> a<00:06:28.930> printed<00:06:29.319> so<00:06:29.949> that's

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
piece there is also a printed so that's

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:38.640 
piece there is also a printed so that's
another<00:06:30.729> place<00:06:36.300> so<00:06:37.300> this<00:06:37.509> is<00:06:37.659> the<00:06:37.840> underside

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
another place so this is the underside

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.980 
another place so this is the underside
of<00:06:38.710> the<00:06:38.979> ship<00:06:41.789> and<00:06:42.789> there's<00:06:43.000> your<00:06:43.210> like<00:06:43.750> fire

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
of the ship and there's your like fire

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:52.950
