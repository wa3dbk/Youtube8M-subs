00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.500
 the budget is already almost today we are going to 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.980
 show to work did not go null 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.129
 with a leveling sensor 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.730
 here we can see solenoid valve if it is 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:20.990
 a normal 110 volt solenoid valve 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.990
 120 AC 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.099
 today you see 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.380
 which it is connected to an outlet 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.020
 a normal house 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.040
 and we will make it work with a program 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.830
 arvelo simple 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.530
 here I have a pig and I did not have the 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.000
 connections although the connection is shown 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.040
 of the real sensor the water level 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.720
 and this one is responsible for activating 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:56.000
 solenoid valve that is connected at the end 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.000
 that gives me a signal to this led 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:04.570
 we use a 606 scr to control the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.220
 Alternating current flow 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:13.830
 to be able to connect this and it was heating 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.479
 to be careful because if not 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.119
 we found the easy one inside 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.280
 our outlet we can make 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.600
 exploit our circuit for it 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.770
 we can use a multimeter 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.220
 and so we can know what is the phase and the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.220
 neutral 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.670
 the phase of receptacles should go 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.930
 connected directly to the valve 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.610
 Y 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.690
 the negative of our our students 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.370
 will be connected 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.860
 to the middle part of our scr 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.800
 and the neutral of the outlet is going 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:01.280
 connected to the negative 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:03.760
 the negative of our ours we 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.760
 provides 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.619
 this now let's try it 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.820
 at the beginning the level of the sensor to 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.350
 will be submerged in the water so 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:23.220
 which will count the energy flow 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.360
 our valve will be off that 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.360
 let's take out the sensor 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.859
 and they take him 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.080
 when from finally coming 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.110
 Look at me 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.750
 the water will cut the luxury of energy and 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.100
 will prevent the alternating current from passing 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.940
 Through the scr our solenoid valves 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.940
 it will stop working 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.670
 they are cut then energy 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.390
 Now let's show the program 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.180
 our sensor 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.410
 the steel 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.510
 this is to stop 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.510
 our sensor the water level 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.110
 we declare the sensor pin that is 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.840
 what is the pin 12 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.680
 and here we can see our led 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.680
 that is this 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.480
 in the voice lab we declare it our 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.000
 sensor with an output with an input 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.640
 dogs and our led as a way out 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.680
 below we have the programming 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.900
 At the beginning we leave the elevators 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.549
 on that is when it's outside of 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.299
 water and our valve this detects that 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.299
 it detects that there is no signal 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:29.850
 and our lethal principle be turned off 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:32.409
 then when the water sensor that is 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:37.319
 within 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.319
 inside the tank and detect water 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.410
 the solenoid valve will go off 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.990
 finally let's see the other function 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.990
 time
