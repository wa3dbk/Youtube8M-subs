with<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> F<00:01:04.439> key<00:01:04.769> I'm<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:06.000> pull<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
with the F key I'm going to pull up the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.630 
with the F key I'm going to pull up the
filter<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.710> first<00:01:07.979> things<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.369> want<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.549> make

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
filter but first things I want to make

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.030 
filter but first things I want to make
sure<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.689> foreground<00:01:10.260> color<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.710> black

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
sure that the foreground color is black

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.890 
sure that the foreground color is black
so<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.840> made<00:01:12.840> sure<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.080> was<00:01:13.320> black<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.900> now

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
so I made sure that was black and now

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.190 
so I made sure that was black and now
I'm<00:01:16.049> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.259> go<00:01:16.380> over<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.830> sketch<00:01:18.200> photocopy

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
I'm going to go over to sketch photocopy

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.890 
I'm going to go over to sketch photocopy
I<00:01:21.020> want<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.220> shrink<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> bit<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.600> this

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I want to shrink this a bit and so this

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.899 
I want to shrink this a bit and so this
is<00:01:25.080> what<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.409> starts<00:01:25.770> out<00:01:25.920> at<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.670> little

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
is what it starts out at it's a little

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.580 
is what it starts out at it's a little
busy<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.420> that's<00:01:27.600> probably<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:28.020> too<00:01:28.290> far<00:01:28.560> off

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
busy but that's probably not too far off

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.760 
busy but that's probably not too far off
as<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.090> go<00:01:30.390> all<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> way<00:01:31.200> back<00:01:31.530> with

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
as you see if I go all the way back with

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.520 
as you see if I go all the way back with
detail<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.490> little<00:01:32.820> too<00:01:33.030> thin<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.439> I'm

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
detail it's a little too thin so I'm

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.630 
detail it's a little too thin so I'm
going<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.710> punch<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.130> up<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.400> bit

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
going to punch that up a bit

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.850 
going to punch that up a bit
and<00:01:37.549> that's<00:01:38.549> probably<00:01:39.049> let's<00:01:40.049> say<00:01:40.380> Rutter<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and that's probably let's say Rutter and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.590 
and that's probably let's say Rutter and
there's<00:01:41.100> probably<00:01:41.400> not<00:01:41.490> too<00:01:41.640> bad<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.450> is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
there's probably not too bad this is

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.410 
there's probably not too bad this is
what<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> effect<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.320> darkness<00:01:44.149> you<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.299> what

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
what the effect of darkness you see what

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.330 
what the effect of darkness you see what
happens<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.840> darkness<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.860> lower<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
happens with darkness you lower that a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.050 
happens with darkness you lower that a
bit<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.439> let's<00:01:49.439> say<00:01:49.619> we're<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:49.890> about<00:01:50.159> I'd<00:01:51.030> say

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
bit and let's say we're at about I'd say

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.700 
bit and let's say we're at about I'd say
28<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.020> probably<00:01:52.320> pretty<00:01:52.500> good<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:55.619> what

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
28 is probably pretty good and so what

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.050 
28 is probably pretty good and so what
we're<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.310> click<00:01:56.520> OK<00:01:56.850> at<00:01:56.939> this

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
we're going to do is click OK at this

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.830 
we're going to do is click OK at this
point<00:01:57.680> okay<00:01:58.680> see<00:01:58.860> what<00:01:59.070> happens<00:01:59.520> you've<00:01:59.790> got

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
point okay see what happens you've got

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.950 
point okay see what happens you've got
this<00:02:00.840> image<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.360> but<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.719> really

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
this image and but it's really

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.080 
this image and but it's really
distracting<00:02:04.649> isn't<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.070> all<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.430> brick<00:02:05.939> in

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
distracting isn't it all the brick in

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.969 
distracting isn't it all the brick in
the<00:02:06.180> background<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.079> I'm<00:02:07.530> going<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.770> take

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
the background so I'm going to take

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.580 
the background so I'm going to take
shift<00:02:08.789> command<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.869> quick<00:02:10.140> heat<00:02:10.379> for

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
shift command in is a quick heat for

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.450 
shift command in is a quick heat for
this

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
this

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.360 
this
I'm<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:11.880> call<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.270> background

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
I'm just going to call this background

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:21.020 
I'm just going to call this background
paint<00:02:14.990> light<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.220> effect<00:02:20.520> we're<00:02:20.730> doing<00:02:20.910> is

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
paint light so the effect we're doing is

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.670 
paint light so the effect we're doing is
we're<00:02:21.150> actually<00:02:21.240> painting<00:02:21.780> over<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.410> with

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
we're actually painting over this with

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.320 
we're actually painting over this with
white<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.250> makes<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.580> easier<00:02:23.880> for<00:02:23.940> erasing

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
white that makes it easier for erasing

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.210 
white that makes it easier for erasing
it's<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.780> new<00:02:24.900> layer<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.830> I'm<00:02:25.890> gonna<00:02:25.980> hit<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
it's a new layer so I'm gonna hit the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.030 
it's a new layer so I'm gonna hit the
brush<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.960> I<00:02:27.960> want<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.470> make<00:02:28.590> sure<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.980> I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
brush and I want to make sure that I

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.230 
brush and I want to make sure that I
actually<00:02:29.220> switch<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.880> foreground

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
actually switch the foreground

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.410 
actually switch the foreground
background<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.990> white<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.250> make<00:02:33.060> sure<00:02:33.090> that

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
background to white so make sure that

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.620 
background to white so make sure that
brush<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.810> nice<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.790> big<00:02:35.790> enough<00:02:36.060> initially

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
brush is nice and big enough initially

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.880 
brush is nice and big enough initially
and<00:02:36.750> you'll<00:02:36.960> kind<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.140> work<00:02:37.320> your<00:02:37.470> way<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.740> on

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
and you'll kind of work your way in on

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.800 
and you'll kind of work your way in on
the<00:02:37.950> edges<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:38.940> start<00:02:39.180> painting<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.660> see

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
the edges so if I start painting you see

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.480 
the edges so if I start painting you see
what<00:02:39.930> happens<00:02:40.290> I'm<00:02:40.830> going<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.070> go<00:02:41.160> ahead<00:02:41.250> and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
what happens I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.610 
what happens I'm going to go ahead and
speed<00:02:41.760> up<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.000> video<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.930> get<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> end<00:02:43.410> but

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
speed up the video to get to the end but

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.040 
speed up the video to get to the end but
you<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.860> kind<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.130> see<00:02:44.450> when<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.480> get<00:02:45.690> around<00:02:45.780> on

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
you can kind of see when I get around on

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.010 
you can kind of see when I get around on
the<00:02:46.140> details<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:47.630> get<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.750> there<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> little

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
the details I get in there a little

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.580 
the details I get in there a little
tighter

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
tighter

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.480 
tighter
I<00:02:51.680> wanted<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.770> want<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.070> brush<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.280> be<00:02:53.460> a

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
I wanted that want that brush to be a

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.920 
I wanted that want that brush to be a
little<00:02:53.610> bit<00:02:53.760> smaller<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.210> it<00:02:54.420> really<00:02:54.600> doesn't

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
little bit smaller and it really doesn't

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.570 
little bit smaller and it really doesn't
have<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.080> be<00:02:55.230> exact<00:02:55.620> because<00:02:55.800> these<00:02:56.040> are<00:02:56.220> color

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
have to be exact because these are color

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.980 
have to be exact because these are color
on<00:02:56.730> both<00:02:56.850> pictures<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.660> kind<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:57.840> see

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
on both pictures but you can kind of see

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.660 
on both pictures but you can kind of see
what<00:02:58.110> happen<00:02:58.350> okay<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:58.710> I<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:59.070> painted<00:02:59.370> in

everything white and basically knocked

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.370 
everything white and basically knocked
out<00:03:02.340> all<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.120> background<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.170> brick

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380
