stick to it when you're ready to roll it
up<00:00:43.170> mix<00:00:44.170> that<00:00:44.470> together<00:00:45.239> you'll<00:00:46.239> also<00:00:46.449> want<00:00:46.839> to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
up mix that together you'll also want to

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.399 
up mix that together you'll also want to
boil<00:00:47.199> six<00:00:47.739> cups<00:00:48.040> of<00:00:48.190> water<00:00:49.140> because<00:00:50.140> you'll<00:00:50.290> be

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
boil six cups of water because you'll be

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.700 
boil six cups of water because you'll be
adding<00:00:50.620> this<00:00:50.949> to<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:52.000> mixture<00:00:52.479> so<00:00:52.839> I'm<00:00:53.500> just

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
adding this to the mixture so I'm just

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.890 
adding this to the mixture so I'm just
going<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.750> pour<00:00:55.750> about<00:00:56.369> four<00:00:57.369> cups<00:00:57.790> in<00:00:58.180> to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
going to pour about four cups in to

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:07.740 
going to pour about four cups in to
begin<00:00:59.199> with<00:01:04.049> stir<00:01:05.049> that<00:01:05.350> around<00:01:06.420> don't<00:01:07.420> touch

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
begin with stir that around don't touch

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.910 
begin with stir that around don't touch
it<00:01:08.020> because<00:01:08.229> it's<00:01:08.619> very<00:01:08.890> hot<00:01:10.439> add<00:01:11.439> the

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
it because it's very hot add the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:21.070 
it because it's very hot add the
remainder<00:01:12.310> of<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:13.030> water

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.510 

throw<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.230> around<00:01:22.410> for<00:01:22.710> about<00:01:23.100> three<00:01:23.490> or

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
throw this around for about three or

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.970 
throw this around for about three or
four<00:01:23.760> minutes<00:01:24.120> just<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.200> all<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
four minutes just to get all of that

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.980 
four minutes just to get all of that
liquid<00:01:26.250> absorbed<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.540> mixture<00:01:32.990> it

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
liquid absorbed in this mixture it

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.600 
liquid absorbed in this mixture it
should<00:01:34.260> have<00:01:34.380> cooled<00:01:34.680> down<00:01:34.920> by<00:01:35.220> now

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
should have cooled down by now

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.860 
should have cooled down by now
so<00:01:35.700> now<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.910> can<00:01:36.180> get<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:36.600> with<00:01:36.750> your

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
so now you can get in there with your

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.290 
so now you can get in there with your
hands<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:37.590> you'll<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.640> want<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> start

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
hands and you'll just want to start

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.140 
hands and you'll just want to start
mixing<00:01:40.230> all<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.890> together<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.790> then

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
mixing all of this together and then

00:01:42.150 --> 00:02:04.530 
mixing all of this together and then
we're<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.440> need<00:01:43.800> it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.170 

the<00:02:05.290> step<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:05.710> totally<00:02:06.160> optional<00:02:06.370> but<00:02:07.000> what<00:02:07.150> I

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
the step is totally optional but what I

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.760 
the step is totally optional but what I
like<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.540> do<00:02:07.660> is<00:02:07.840> just<00:02:07.870> take<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.260> damp<00:02:08.470> paper

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
like to do is just take a damp paper

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.700 
like to do is just take a damp paper
towel<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.580> put<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.479> over<00:02:10.600> my<00:02:10.810> dough<00:02:10.869> so<00:02:11.440> it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
towel and put it over my dough so it

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:19.010 
towel and put it over my dough so it
doesn't<00:02:12.070> dry<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> leak<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.940> piece<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.600> your<00:02:13.750> dough

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:28.650 

add<00:02:20.020> some<00:02:20.320> flour<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.810> then<00:02:27.660> we're

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
add some flour to this and then we're

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.810 
add some flour to this and then we're
just<00:02:28.690> going<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.320> roll<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.670> out<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:33.610> can<00:02:33.790> make

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
just going to roll this out you can make

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.150 
just going to roll this out you can make
this<00:02:34.150> as<00:02:34.420> thick<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.560> as<00:02:35.950> wide<00:02:36.220> as<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:37.360> want<00:02:37.390> I

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
this as thick and as wide as you want I

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.430 
this as thick and as wide as you want I
tend<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.610> kind<00:02:40.270> of<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.450> medium<00:02:40.900> noodle<00:02:41.500> I

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
tend to like kind of a medium noodle I

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.830 
tend to like kind of a medium noodle I
don't<00:02:44.440> like<00:02:44.650> them<00:02:44.860> too<00:02:45.040> thin<00:02:45.460> but<00:02:46.060> it's<00:02:46.480> up<00:02:46.660> to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
don't like them too thin but it's up to

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.900 
don't like them too thin but it's up to
you<00:02:46.990> once<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.980> rolled<00:02:48.280> out<00:02:48.520> spread

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
you once you have that rolled out spread

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.550 
you once you have that rolled out spread
a<00:02:48.940> little<00:02:49.150> bit<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.510> flour<00:02:49.690> around<00:02:49.900> here<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.470> it

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
a little bit of flour around here so it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.190 
a little bit of flour around here so it
doesn't<00:02:50.590> stick<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:52.390> then<00:02:52.510> take<00:02:52.780> your<00:02:52.930> knife

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
doesn't stick and then take your knife

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.650 
doesn't stick and then take your knife
and<00:02:53.800> cut<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:55.720> in<00:02:56.680> half<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:57.430> then<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.300> place

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
and cut it in half and then you place

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.740 
and cut it in half and then you place
that<00:02:58.990> one<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.500> top<00:02:59.800> of<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.220> other<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.790> then

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
that one on top of the other and then

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.570 
that one on top of the other and then
now<00:03:01.990> we're<00:03:02.320> going<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.530> start<00:03:02.800> cutting<00:03:03.130> out<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
now we're going to start cutting out the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.370 
now we're going to start cutting out the
noodles<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.750> pretty<00:03:07.750> much<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.020> size
