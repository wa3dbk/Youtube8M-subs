right<00:01:02.609> now<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.299> the<00:01:03.389> fans<00:01:03.659> off<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.320> can

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
right now with the fans off so we can

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.060 
right now with the fans off so we can
hear<00:01:04.680> audio<00:01:05.840> there<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.990> go<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.620> got<00:01:07.770> ninety

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
hear audio there you go we got ninety

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.360 
hear audio there you go we got ninety
five<00:01:08.250> right<00:01:08.520> there

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.620 

and<00:01:14.370> just<00:01:14.550> end<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.820> fashioning<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:16.370> rain<00:01:17.370> gutter

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
and just end up fashioning a rain gutter

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.810 
and just end up fashioning a rain gutter
so<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:18.780> all<00:01:18.930> drip<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.560> little<00:01:20.340> bit<00:01:20.430> algae

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
so they all drip a little bit algae

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.180 
so they all drip a little bit algae
right<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.120> I<00:01:21.180> haven't<00:01:21.330> clean<00:01:21.570> them<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.840> week

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
right now I haven't clean them this week

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.610 
right now I haven't clean them this week
so<00:01:23.190> drips<00:01:24.030> off<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.300> chain<00:01:25.310> into<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> gutter

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
so drips off of chain into the gutter

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.460 
so drips off of chain into the gutter
back<00:01:28.620> into<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.160> reservoir<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.910> then<00:01:30.900> gets

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
back into the reservoir and then gets

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.410 
back into the reservoir and then gets
pumped<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.830> read<00:01:31.980> back<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.370> this<00:01:32.520> tube<00:01:32.760> all<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
pumped to read back up this tube all the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.960 
pumped to read back up this tube all the
way<00:01:33.720> through<00:01:37.190> of<00:01:38.190> TDS<00:01:38.730> meter<00:01:38.940> right<00:01:39.300> they're

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
way through of TDS meter right they're

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.000 
way through of TDS meter right they're
running<00:01:41.970> right<00:01:42.000> now<00:01:42.390> 1,300<00:01:43.380> I've<00:01:43.650> just<00:01:43.830> added

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
running right now 1,300 I've just added

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.520 
running right now 1,300 I've just added
pH<00:01:44.400> down<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.910> it's<00:01:45.060> rising<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.350> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
pH down so it's rising but right now it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.200 
pH down so it's rising but right now it
shows<00:01:46.710> four<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> half<00:01:47.160> pH<00:01:47.580> but<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:47.940> all<00:01:48.060> know

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
shows four and a half pH but we all know

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.790 
shows four and a half pH but we all know
that<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.510> needs<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.720> come<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.260> rising<00:01:49.680> as

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
that it needs to come up it's rising as

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.219 
that it needs to come up it's rising as

this<00:02:32.910> video<00:02:33.180> we'll<00:02:33.630> see<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.900> work<00:02:34.820> pumps<00:02:35.820> up

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
this video we'll see it work pumps up

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.740 
this video we'll see it work pumps up
through<00:02:36.180> here<00:02:36.950> drains<00:02:37.950> up<00:02:38.130> over<00:02:38.370> there<00:02:38.750> let's

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
through here drains up over there let's

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.060 
through here drains up over there let's
having<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.050> little<00:02:40.230> bit<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.410> issue<00:02:40.530> with<00:02:40.709> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
having a little bit of issue with the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.420 
having a little bit of issue with the
ebb<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.790> flow<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:43.530> instead<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.100> taking

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
ebb and flow so and instead of taking

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.210 
ebb and flow so and instead of taking
the<00:02:44.519> tall<00:02:44.730> caller<00:02:45.150> here<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:46.500> left<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:46.950> in

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
the tall caller here I just left that in

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.500 
the tall caller here I just left that in
there<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.550> when<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.700> pump<00:02:47.910> shuts<00:02:48.090> off<00:02:48.330> it

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
there and when the pump shuts off it

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.060 
there and when the pump shuts off it
drains<00:02:48.840> right<00:02:49.019> back<00:02:49.260> down<00:02:49.500> through<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.830> same

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
drains right back down through the same

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.710 
drains right back down through the same
hose<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.650> believe<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.160> 3/4<00:02:54.000> line<00:02:54.209> the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
hose this I believe is the 3/4 line the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.540 
hose this I believe is the 3/4 line the
fill<00:02:54.959> line<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.470> other<00:02:55.560> side<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.310> 1/2<00:02:56.820> inch

exit<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.700> off<00:03:02.880> right<00:03:03.180> now<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:03.720> we<00:03:03.840> can

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
exit it's off right now just so we can

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.300 
exit it's off right now just so we can
hear<00:03:04.140> audio<00:03:04.350> again<00:03:05.510> ran<00:03:06.510> our<00:03:06.690> own<00:03:06.750> electricity

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
hear audio again ran our own electricity

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.220 
hear audio again ran our own electricity
this<00:03:08.310> one<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.820> on<00:03:08.970> it's

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
this one is on it's

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.309 
this one is on it's
circuit<00:03:09.709> for<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:11.090> 1,000<00:03:11.840> watt<00:03:11.989> and

soon-to-be number-two 1000 watt which
will<00:03:15.769> go<00:03:15.890> right<00:03:16.099> there<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.580> that's<00:03:16.790> its<00:03:16.940> own

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
will go right there so that's its own

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.220 
will go right there so that's its own
dedicated<00:03:17.480> circuit<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:19.700> circuit<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.720> this

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
dedicated circuit that circuit and this

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.050 
dedicated circuit that circuit and this
are<00:03:21.500> just<00:03:21.650> for<00:03:21.799> fans<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.250> pumps<00:03:22.400> they're<00:03:22.909> both

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
are just for fans and pumps they're both

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.589 
are just for fans and pumps they're both
20<00:03:23.360> amp<00:03:23.510> circuits<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:24.760> there's<00:03:25.760> just<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.209> basic

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
20 amp circuits I there's just a basic

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.300 
20 amp circuits I there's just a basic
oscillating<00:03:27.349> fan<00:03:27.530> hung<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:27.980> upside<00:03:28.280> down

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
oscillating fan hung it upside down

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.660 
oscillating fan hung it upside down
works<00:03:29.000> just<00:03:29.450> fine<00:03:30.040> these<00:03:31.040> are<00:03:31.250> some<00:03:31.459> windows

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
works just fine these are some windows

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.630 
works just fine these are some windows
that<00:03:32.150> we<00:03:32.239> took<00:03:32.390> out<00:03:32.569> of<00:03:32.599> our<00:03:32.780> home<00:03:33.610> so<00:03:34.610> I

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
that we took out of our home so I

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.160 
that we took out of our home so I
incorporated<00:03:34.940> them<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.569> old<00:03:35.690> casement

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
incorporated them the old casement

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.710 
incorporated them the old casement
windows<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:36.709> when<00:03:36.920> we<00:03:37.040> want<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.280> breeze<00:03:37.720> not

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
windows so when we want a breeze not

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.089 
windows so when we want a breeze not
right<00:03:38.959> now<00:03:39.140> we<00:03:39.200> need<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.650> evaporative

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
right now we need the evaporative

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.589 
right now we need the evaporative
cooling<00:03:40.280> it's<00:03:40.519> too<00:03:40.670> hot<00:03:40.879> but<00:03:41.150> when<00:03:41.269> we<00:03:41.390> want

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
cooling it's too hot but when we want

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.380 
cooling it's too hot but when we want
that<00:03:41.750> breeze<00:03:42.019> we<00:03:42.980> can<00:03:43.129> have<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.489> another

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
that breeze we can have it another

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.900 
that breeze we can have it another
circulating<00:03:45.019> fan<00:03:45.200> it's<00:03:45.500> off<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:46.549> can<00:03:46.730> hear

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
circulating fan it's off so you can hear

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.949 
circulating fan it's off so you can hear
me<00:03:47.650> yes<00:03:48.650> this<00:03:49.430> is<00:03:49.609> not<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.790> ground<00:03:50.060> level<00:03:50.269> I

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
me yes this is not a ground level I

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.729 
me yes this is not a ground level I
actually<00:03:51.349> dug<00:03:51.709> it<00:03:51.920> down<00:03:52.160> four<00:03:52.609> feet<00:03:53.470> into<00:03:54.470> the

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
actually dug it down four feet into the

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.150 
actually dug it down four feet into the
earth<00:03:55.359> it<00:03:56.359> was<00:03:56.480> actually<00:03:56.840> not<00:03:57.829> too<00:03:57.980> difficult

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
earth it was actually not too difficult

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.580 
earth it was actually not too difficult
all<00:03:58.579> dug<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.030> all<00:03:59.090> by<00:03:59.269> hand<00:03:59.510> no<00:04:00.410> machinery<00:04:00.859> just

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
all dug it all by hand no machinery just

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.920 
all dug it all by hand no machinery just
these<00:04:03.590> guns

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
these guns

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.869 
these guns
so<00:04:05.930> hopefully<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:07.160> enjoyed<00:04:07.519> this<00:04:07.730> little

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
so hopefully you enjoyed this little

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.640 
so hopefully you enjoyed this little
video<00:04:08.060> here<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.540> more<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:08.780> come<00:04:08.959> I'll<00:04:09.349> try<00:04:09.590> to

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
video here and more to come I'll try to

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.470 
video here and more to come I'll try to
keep<00:04:09.950> some<00:04:10.160> updates<00:04:10.489> out<00:04:10.760> there<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.269> know

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
keep some updates out there I know

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.360 
keep some updates out there I know
people<00:04:12.049> with<00:04:12.260> greenhouses<00:04:12.680> love<00:04:13.069> seeing

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
people with greenhouses love seeing

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.089 
people with greenhouses love seeing
other<00:04:13.519> ideas<00:04:14.060> out<00:04:14.239> there<00:04:14.569> so<00:04:14.870> right<00:04:15.650> now<00:04:15.829> it's

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
other ideas out there so right now it's

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.909 
other ideas out there so right now it's
4<00:04:16.340> feet<00:04:16.549> down<00:04:16.789> into<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.329> earth<00:04:17.539> and<00:04:17.930> top<00:04:18.410> is<00:04:18.709> an

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
4 feet down into the earth and top is an

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.960 
4 feet down into the earth and top is an
11<00:04:19.130> foot<00:04:19.250> canopy<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:21.639> was<00:04:22.639> the<00:04:22.700> only<00:04:22.849> the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
11 foot canopy so I was the only the

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.570 
11 foot canopy so I was the only the
only<00:04:23.060> way<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.389> get<00:04:23.599> up<00:04:23.630> high<00:04:24.010> by<00:04:25.010> digging<00:04:25.340> down

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
only way to get up high by digging down

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.580 
only way to get up high by digging down
low<00:04:25.849> and<00:04:26.180> just<00:04:26.630> for<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.990> evaporative<00:04:27.410> cooling

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
low and just for the evaporative cooling

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.400 
low and just for the evaporative cooling
system<00:04:28.130> so<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.400> know<00:04:28.720> here's<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.900> tank<00:04:30.139> right

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
system so you know here's the tank right

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.390 
system so you know here's the tank right
here<00:04:31.990> it<00:04:32.990> actually<00:04:33.320> just<00:04:33.530> comes<00:04:33.919> out<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.250> that

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
here it actually just comes out to that

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.270 
here it actually just comes out to that
rain<00:04:34.580> gutter<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:35.090> then<00:04:35.810> inside<00:04:36.260> here<00:04:36.320> look<00:04:36.950> a
