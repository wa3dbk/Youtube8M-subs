nicely<00:02:21.519> in<00:02:21.849> your<00:02:21.879> fingers<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.769> it's<00:02:23.769> like

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
nicely in your fingers and it's like

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.670 
nicely in your fingers and it's like
dribbling<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.760> ball<00:02:24.909> and<00:02:25.209> soccer<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:26.409> fits

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
dribbling a ball and soccer it fits

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.259 
dribbling a ball and soccer it fits
really<00:02:26.860> nicely<00:02:27.159> and<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.610> can<00:02:27.730> just<00:02:27.879> toss<00:02:28.239> it

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
really nicely and you can just toss it

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.970 
really nicely and you can just toss it
on<00:02:28.659> the<00:02:28.690> mouse<00:02:28.930> pad<00:02:31.140> really<00:02:32.140> efficiently<00:02:32.739> with

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
on the mouse pad really efficiently with

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.430 
on the mouse pad really efficiently with
just<00:02:33.310> your<00:02:34.150> fingers<00:02:34.569> if<00:02:34.810> that's<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.230> type<00:02:35.379> of

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
just your fingers if that's the type of

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.680 
just your fingers if that's the type of
player<00:02:36.099> you<00:02:36.129> are<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.739> being<00:02:39.040> small<00:02:39.690> could

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
player you are so it being small could

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.199 
player you are so it being small could
probably<00:02:40.989> set<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.260> couple<00:02:41.530> people<00:02:41.830> off<00:02:42.209> but

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
probably set a couple people off but

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.509 
probably set a couple people off but
it's<00:02:43.390> not<00:02:43.569> like<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> laptop<00:02:44.290> mouse<00:02:44.530> where<00:02:45.220> it's

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
it's not like a laptop mouse where it's

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.119 
it's not like a laptop mouse where it's
just<00:02:45.610> like<00:02:45.909> unbearable<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.900> even<00:02:47.170> hold<00:02:47.920> it

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
just like unbearable to even hold it

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.600 
just like unbearable to even hold it
this<00:02:48.760> thing<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.599> nice<00:02:49.959> size<00:02:50.290> for<00:02:50.680> just

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
this thing is a nice size for just

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.910 
this thing is a nice size for just
tossing<00:02:52.030> around<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.299> mouth<00:02:52.510> as<00:02:52.780> with<00:02:53.709> just

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
tossing around the mouth as with just

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.339 
tossing around the mouth as with just
your<00:02:54.040> fingers<00:02:54.659> it<00:02:55.659> bill<00:02:55.840> gives<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.110> excellent

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
your fingers it bill gives you excellent

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.820 
your fingers it bill gives you excellent
control<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:57.190> fact<00:02:57.519> in<00:02:58.090> my<00:02:58.269> opinion<00:02:58.569> I<00:02:58.989> like<00:02:59.680> the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
control in fact in my opinion I like the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.170 
control in fact in my opinion I like the
field<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.190> can<00:03:00.340> do<00:03:00.520> better<00:03:00.700> than<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:01.000> side

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
field that can do better than the side

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.949 
field that can do better than the side
simply<00:03:02.170> because<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.770> fact<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.780> really

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
simply because of that fact so it really

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.059 
simply because of that fact so it really
just<00:03:05.200> depends

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
just depends

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.280 
just depends
the<00:03:06.459> type<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:06.700> game<00:03:06.969> where<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.269> are<00:03:07.420> they<00:03:08.109> can

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
the type of game where you are they can

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.640 
the type of game where you are they can
do<00:03:08.439> is<00:03:08.560> also<00:03:09.430> much<00:03:09.790> lighter<00:03:10.299> again<00:03:11.230> with<00:03:11.560> the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
do is also much lighter again with the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.530 
do is also much lighter again with the
numbers<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.189> probably<00:03:12.519> can't<00:03:12.819> really<00:03:13.269> tell

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
numbers you probably can't really tell

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.739 
numbers you probably can't really tell
but<00:03:14.290> his<00:03:14.739> eye<00:03:14.920> feels<00:03:15.340> like<00:03:15.670> it's<00:03:16.329> really

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:16.749 
but his eye feels like it's really

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:23.879 
but his eye feels like it's really
sturdy<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.730> brick<00:03:18.730> cut<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:22.200> kinzua<00:03:23.200> like

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
sturdy a brick cut and kinzua like

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.160 
sturdy a brick cut and kinzua like
you're<00:03:24.040> just<00:03:24.189> kind<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.400> tossing<00:03:24.849> around

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
you're just kind of tossing around

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.929 
you're just kind of tossing around
something<00:03:26.170> as<00:03:26.620> if<00:03:27.159> it's<00:03:27.340> just<00:03:27.489> floating<00:03:27.639> on

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
something as if it's just floating on

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:34.349 
something as if it's just floating on
air<00:03:30.180> again<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.450> prefer<00:03:32.169> the<00:03:32.379> Kinzu<00:03:32.950> for<00:03:33.790> that

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
air again I prefer the Kinzu for that

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.089 
air again I prefer the Kinzu for that
type<00:03:34.689> of<00:03:34.719> field<00:03:35.079> but<00:03:36.389> his<00:03:37.389> eyes<00:03:37.629> definitely

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
type of field but his eyes definitely

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.270 
type of field but his eyes definitely
definitely<00:03:39.510> close<00:03:40.510> second<00:03:41.049> as<00:03:41.469> far<00:03:41.769> as<00:03:41.799> the

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
definitely close second as far as the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:49.420 
definitely close second as far as the
way<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.459> play

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.589 

the<00:03:50.430> next<00:03:50.730> quick<00:03:50.909> thing<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.209> want<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.450> talk

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
the next quick thing I want to talk

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.949 
the next quick thing I want to talk
about<00:03:51.659> are<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.110> mouse<00:03:52.290> feet<00:03:53.629> these<00:03:54.629> are<00:03:54.810> both

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
about are the mouse feet these are both

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.339 
about are the mouse feet these are both
the<00:03:55.829> default<00:03:56.400> now<00:03:56.610> speed<00:03:56.939> that<00:03:57.090> come<00:03:57.329> with<00:03:57.599> the

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
the default now speed that come with the

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.699 
the default now speed that come with the
mouse<00:03:59.269> so<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.360> can<00:04:00.720> always<00:04:00.930> change<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.530> out

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
mouse so you can always change that out

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.949 
mouse so you can always change that out
and<00:04:02.099> give<00:04:02.790> yourself<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.239> different<00:04:03.420> experience

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
and give yourself a different experience

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.899 
and give yourself a different experience
but<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.730> Kinsey's<00:04:06.180> mouse<00:04:06.420> feet<00:04:07.640> make<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.819> a

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
but the Kinsey's mouse feet make it a

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.229 
but the Kinsey's mouse feet make it a
lot<00:04:09.120> stickier<00:04:09.450> as<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:10.409> can<00:04:10.590> see<00:04:10.819> it<00:04:11.819> just<00:04:12.000> goes

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
lot stickier as you can see it just goes

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.300 
lot stickier as you can see it just goes
from<00:04:13.049> one<00:04:13.560> place<00:04:13.769> to<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:13.950> next<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.280> stops<00:04:16.310> for

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
from one place to the next and stops for

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.640 
from one place to the next and stops for
a<00:04:17.340> lot<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.549> people<00:04:17.729> it<00:04:18.449> will<00:04:18.539> feel<00:04:19.289> like<00:04:19.350> that

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
a lot of people it will feel like that

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.680 
a lot of people it will feel like that
will<00:04:19.769> give<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.009> a<00:04:20.070> lot<00:04:20.190> more<00:04:20.220> precision<00:04:22.490> zai

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
will give you a lot more precision zai

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
will give you a lot more precision zai
just<00:04:24.690> kind<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:24.960> glides<00:04:25.260> around<00:04:26.930> see<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.500> kind

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
just kind of glides around see this kind

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.159 
just kind of glides around see this kind
of<00:04:28.830> floats<00:04:29.250> around<00:04:29.580> because<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.479> guess<00:04:30.930> these

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
of floats around because I guess these

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.230 
of floats around because I guess these
feet<00:04:31.530> are<00:04:31.680> more<00:04:31.919> like<00:04:32.160> Teflon<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:33.530> so<00:04:35.150> it's<00:04:36.150> a

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
feet are more like Teflon and so it's a

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.390 
feet are more like Teflon and so it's a
lot<00:04:36.360> easier<00:04:36.419> to<00:04:36.780> glide<00:04:37.080> with<00:04:37.110> it<00:04:37.470> also<00:04:38.190> the

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
lot easier to glide with it also the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.879 
lot easier to glide with it also the
fact<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:38.760> it's<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.090> lot<00:04:39.240> heavier<00:04:39.620> makes<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.770> so

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
fact that it's a lot heavier makes it so

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.279 
fact that it's a lot heavier makes it so
that<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.070> momentum<00:04:41.490> helps<00:04:42.120> carry<00:04:42.449> it<00:04:42.630> so<00:04:43.199> if

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
that the momentum helps carry it so if

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:44.480 
that the momentum helps carry it so if
you're<00:04:43.380> going<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.620> be<00:04:43.680> using<00:04:43.740> this<00:04:43.979> I<00:04:44.160> you<00:04:44.220> got

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
you're going to be using this I you got

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.240 
you're going to be using this I you got
a<00:04:44.520> grip<00:04:44.789> it'll<00:04:45.229> really<00:04:46.229> heavily<00:04:46.530> or<00:04:46.860> else<00:04:47.039> it's

because not only is it a popular mouse
and<00:04:58.289> gaming<00:04:58.680> but<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.310> has<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.610> most

and gaming but it has the most
comfortable<00:05:00.240> side<00:05:00.510> for<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.840> side<00:05:01.050> that<00:05:01.260> I

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
comfortable side for the side that I

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.529 
comfortable side for the side that I
know<00:05:01.440> of<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:02.190> pretty<00:05:02.580> much<00:05:02.610> every<00:05:03.000> pc<00:05:03.360> gamer

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
know of and pretty much every pc gamer

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:22.850 
know of and pretty much every pc gamer
has<00:05:03.720> at<00:05:03.870> least<00:05:03.990> felt<00:05:04.289> this<00:05:04.470> mouse<00:05:04.680> before

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.089 

they're<00:05:23.860> very<00:05:24.159> similar<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.610> feel<00:05:26.039> what<00:05:27.039> I

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
they're very similar and feel what I

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.619 
they're very similar and feel what I
find<00:05:27.369> is<00:05:27.490> actually<00:05:27.789> kind<00:05:27.939> of<00:05:27.969> interesting<00:05:28.119> is

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:28.629 
find is actually kind of interesting is

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.299 
find is actually kind of interesting is
that<00:05:28.659> the<00:05:29.139> wheel<00:05:29.469> Mouse<00:05:29.680> obstacle<00:05:29.919> is

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:30.309 
that the wheel Mouse obstacle is

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:33.119 
that the wheel Mouse obstacle is
actually<00:05:30.909> thinner<00:05:31.210> than<00:05:31.479> those<00:05:31.689> I<00:05:31.869> so<00:05:32.800> thus<00:05:32.979> I

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
actually thinner than those I so thus I

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.889 
actually thinner than those I so thus I
actually<00:05:33.369> does<00:05:33.759> feel<00:05:33.789> a<00:05:34.119> little<00:05:34.240> bit<00:05:34.479> bulkier

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:34.899 
actually does feel a little bit bulkier

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:38.519 
actually does feel a little bit bulkier
but<00:05:35.800> speaking<00:05:36.159> of<00:05:36.399> bulky<00:05:36.849> it's<00:05:37.659> definitely

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
but speaking of bulky it's definitely

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:41.999 
but speaking of bulky it's definitely
more<00:05:38.999> solid<00:05:39.999> this<00:05:40.240> mouse<00:05:40.479> so<00:05:41.110> microsoft<00:05:41.860> mouse

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:42.009 
more solid this mouse so microsoft mouse

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.209 
more solid this mouse so microsoft mouse
feels<00:05:42.430> more<00:05:42.729> hollow<00:05:43.830> but<00:05:44.830> it<00:05:44.949> is<00:05:45.039> definitely

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:45.219 
feels more hollow but it is definitely

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.320 
feels more hollow but it is definitely
lighter<00:05:45.699> as<00:05:45.909> well<00:05:46.889> so<00:05:47.889> basically<00:05:48.309> this<00:05:48.490> i<00:05:48.639> is<00:05:48.939> a

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
lighter as well so basically this i is a

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.670 
lighter as well so basically this i is a
kind<00:05:49.990> of<00:05:50.080> bulkier<00:05:50.559> more<00:05:51.550> featured<00:05:52.680> wheel

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
kind of bulkier more featured wheel

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.110 
kind of bulkier more featured wheel
Mouse<00:05:53.889> obstacle<00:05:55.529> the<00:05:56.879> registration<00:05:57.879> point
