00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
say it was easy and it didn't come with

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.600 
say it was easy and it didn't come with
practice<00:01:12.260> but<00:01:13.260> that's<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.560> damn<00:01:13.740> fast<00:01:14.070> time<00:01:14.340> I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
practice but that's a damn fast time I

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.249 
practice but that's a damn fast time I
just<00:01:15.060> got<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.360> gun<00:01:15.570> today<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.049> been<00:01:16.200> out

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
just got this gun today and I been out

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.810 
just got this gun today and I been out
here<00:01:16.409> practicing<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:17.070> an<00:01:17.189> hour<00:01:17.340> before

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
here practicing about an hour before

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.870 
here practicing about an hour before
this<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.409> our<00:01:19.619> third<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.369> fourth<00:01:20.430> try

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
this and this is our third or fourth try

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.910 
this and this is our third or fourth try
so<00:01:21.240> definitely<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.780> easy<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.350> four<00:01:22.619> point

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
so definitely not easy but four point

so definitely not easy but four point
three<00:01:23.070> two<00:01:23.460> three<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:24.270> four<00:01:25.200> point<00:01:25.259> three<00:01:25.470> one

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
three two three one four point three one

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.899 
three two three one four point three one
that's<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.119> I'm<00:01:27.270> talking<00:01:27.600> about<00:01:28.759> there<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.790> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
that's what I'm talking about there is a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.310 
that's what I'm talking about there is a
little<00:01:30.119> technique<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.049> I'll<00:01:31.110> share

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
little technique to this and I'll share

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.920 
little technique to this and I'll share
with<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.560> guys<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.950> case<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.930> are

with you guys in case you all are
interested<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.530> trying<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.890> enter<00:01:36.829> this

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
interested in trying to enter this

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.149 
interested in trying to enter this
particular<00:01:37.979> gun<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:39.150> heavy<00:01:39.420> barrel<00:01:39.659> and

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
particular gun is a heavy barrel and

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.050 
particular gun is a heavy barrel and
it's<00:01:41.159> quite<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> bit<00:01:41.520> easier<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:41.820> you've<00:01:41.939> got<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
it's quite a bit easier if you've got a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.880 
it's quite a bit easier if you've got a
heavy<00:01:42.240> barrel<00:01:42.450> because<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
heavy barrel because you can just if you

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.060 
heavy barrel because you can just if you
notice<00:01:44.189> here<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.549> receiver<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.560> not<00:01:46.560> much

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
notice here the receiver is not much

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.179 
notice here the receiver is not much
higher<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.970> off<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.659> barrel<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.229> then<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
higher up off the barrel and then if you

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.399 
higher up off the barrel and then if you
go<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.520> down<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.000> notice<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> barrel<00:01:51.659> nut<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
go on down you notice the barrel nut is

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.410 
go on down you notice the barrel nut is
also<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> little<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.189> higher<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.700> what<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
also a little bit higher so what that

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.580 
also a little bit higher so what that
allows<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.079> with<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.290> particular

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
allows you to do with this particular

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.870 
allows you to do with this particular
gun<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.430> sight<00:01:56.790> straight<00:01:57.270> down<00:01:58.880> straight

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
gun is just sight straight down straight

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.940 
gun is just sight straight down straight
down<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> barrel<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> Ruger

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
down the barrel just like with a Ruger

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.730 
down the barrel just like with a Ruger
LCP<00:02:02.310> or<00:02:02.850> or<00:02:03.180> some<00:02:03.600> your<00:02:03.750> small<00:02:03.990> pocket<00:02:04.350> pistols

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
LCP or or some your small pocket pistols

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.590 
LCP or or some your small pocket pistols
where<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.130> look<00:02:05.850> right<00:02:06.030> down<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> slide

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
where you just look right down the slide

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.059 
where you just look right down the slide
so<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.530> actually<00:02:07.740> not<00:02:09.319> very<00:02:10.319> difficult<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
so it's actually not very difficult to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.140 
so it's actually not very difficult to
hit

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
hit

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.030 
hit
but<00:02:12.659> just<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.959> cyclone<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.409> boat<00:02:13.680> getting

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
but just the cyclone the boat getting

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.339 
but just the cyclone the boat getting
back<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.400> target<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.200> making<00:02:16.200> those<00:02:16.319> shots

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
back on target and making those shots

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.880 
back on target and making those shots
count<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.129> where<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> difficulty<00:02:18.120> plays<00:02:18.510> in

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
count is where the difficulty plays in

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.429 
count is where the difficulty plays in
the<00:02:19.890> way<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.069> do<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.790> take<00:02:21.150> my<00:02:21.329> left<00:02:21.540> hand<00:02:21.840> pull

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
the way I do it I take my left hand pull
