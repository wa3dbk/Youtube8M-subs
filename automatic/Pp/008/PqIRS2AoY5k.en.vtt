this<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:01.890> demo<00:00:02.280> I'm<00:00:02.550> using<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:03.000> Kiwi<00:00:03.419> fuzz

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
this is a demo I'm using a Kiwi fuzz

this is a demo I'm using a Kiwi fuzz

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
setting in the HP mode which gives it

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.620 
setting in the HP mode which gives it
more<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.269> marsh<00:00:16.020> Alaska<00:00:16.590> sort<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.949> sound<00:00:17.630> the

Akili<00:00:18.930> fuzz<00:00:19.109> had<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.590> have<00:00:19.740> set<00:00:20.010> up<00:00:20.039> as<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> boost

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
Akili fuzz had I have set up as a boost

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.500 
Akili fuzz had I have set up as a boost
internally<00:00:21.660> which<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.170> very<00:00:22.410> low<00:00:22.590> fuzz<00:00:22.920> and

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
internally which is very low fuzz and

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.480 
internally which is very low fuzz and
just<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.600> little<00:00:25.050> bit<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.650> added<00:00:25.859> trouble<00:00:26.340> on

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
just a little bit of added trouble on

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.080 
just a little bit of added trouble on
the<00:00:26.640> tone<00:00:26.849> knob<00:00:28.189> I'm<00:00:29.189> using<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.699> custom

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
the tone knob I'm using a custom

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.620 
the tone knob I'm using a custom
defender<00:00:30.539> amp<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.380> PRS<00:00:32.369> standard<00:00:33.210> 22

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
defender amp and the PRS standard 22

00:00:33.630 --> 00:02:04.440 
defender amp and the PRS standard 22
satin

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.700 

you<00:02:05.450> can<00:02:05.570> actually<00:02:05.900> get<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.110> little<00:02:06.350> bit<00:02:06.560> more

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
you can actually get a little bit more

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.859 
you can actually get a little bit more
fuzz<00:02:07.070> out<00:02:07.250> of<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.460> fuzz<00:02:07.700> head<00:02:07.970> drop<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.660> boost

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
fuzz out of the fuzz head drop the boost

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.560 
fuzz out of the fuzz head drop the boost
back<00:02:09.140> just<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.530> little<00:02:09.560> bit<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:11.330> side

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
back just a little bit and this side

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.320 
back just a little bit and this side
actually<00:02:11.900> takes<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.650> existing<00:02:13.400> distortion

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
actually takes the existing distortion

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.850 
actually takes the existing distortion
on<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.480> OCD<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.140> gives<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.380> more<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.680> fuzzy

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
on the OCD and gives it more of a fuzzy

00:02:15.860 --> 00:03:06.150 
on the OCD and gives it more of a fuzzy
fuzzy<00:02:16.190> yeah

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.350 

here<00:03:07.160> okay<00:03:07.250> yeah<00:03:07.700> it's<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.910> little<00:03:08.000> bit<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.300> a

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
here okay yeah it's a little bit of a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.530 
here okay yeah it's a little bit of a
rip<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.959> whole<00:03:09.110> thing<00:03:10.150> usually<00:03:11.150> though

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
rip to the whole thing usually though

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.180 
rip to the whole thing usually though
I'm<00:03:11.720> sitting<00:03:12.110> this<00:03:12.260> fairly<00:03:12.560> low<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.040> just

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
I'm sitting this fairly low and just

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.420 
I'm sitting this fairly low and just
using<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.670> boost<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.709> give<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.770> OCD<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.250> a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
using the boost to give the OCD like a

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.250 
using the boost to give the OCD like a
different<00:03:16.790> lead<00:03:17.209> tone<00:03:17.540> color<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:17.959> actually

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
different lead tone color it actually

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:27.600 
different lead tone color it actually
boosts<00:03:18.470> up<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.770> volume<00:03:19.069> a<00:03:19.100> little<00:03:19.160> bit

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.670
