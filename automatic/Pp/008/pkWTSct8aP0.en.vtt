00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
proper manner of nutrition we try and

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.610 
proper manner of nutrition we try and
keep<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.149> protein<00:00:58.629> level<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.230> a<00:00:59.379> horse

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
keep the protein level in a horse

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.939 
keep the protein level in a horse
between<00:01:00.129> 12<00:01:00.519> and<00:01:00.789> 14<00:01:01.120> percent<00:01:01.510> protein<00:01:02.440> so

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
between 12 and 14 percent protein so

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.520 
between 12 and 14 percent protein so
this<00:01:03.190> is<00:01:03.399> a<00:01:03.430> this<00:01:04.269> is<00:01:04.330> a<00:01:04.480> 14<00:01:04.900> percent<00:01:05.200> protein

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
this is a this is a 14 percent protein

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.890 
this is a this is a 14 percent protein
feed<00:01:06.010> we<00:01:06.640> augment<00:01:07.150> it<00:01:07.300> with<00:01:07.330> a<00:01:07.480> little<00:01:07.750> bit<00:01:07.870> of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
feed we augment it with a little bit of

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.840 
feed we augment it with a little bit of
a<00:01:08.020> whole<00:01:08.290> out<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:08.740> that<00:01:09.100> probably<00:01:09.430> drops<00:01:09.700> the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
a whole out and that probably drops the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.720 
a whole out and that probably drops the
protein<00:01:10.240> just<00:01:10.480> a<00:01:10.570> bit<00:01:10.750> and<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:12.070> try<00:01:12.400> and<00:01:12.430> keep

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
protein just a bit and we try and keep

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.690 
protein just a bit and we try and keep
we<00:01:13.300> keep<00:01:13.540> track<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.840> their<00:01:14.110> their<00:01:14.530> carbs<00:01:15.040> we

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
know for a daily intake and so so we try

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.470 
know for a daily intake and so so we try
to<00:02:26.380> meet<00:02:26.680> those<00:02:26.920> minimum<00:02:27.330> requirements<00:02:28.330> and

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
to meet those minimum requirements and

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.390 
to meet those minimum requirements and
erase<00:02:28.720> loss<00:02:28.960> as<00:02:29.200> well<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.740> in<00:02:30.160> other

erase loss as well and in other

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.120 
erase loss as well and in other
situations<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.510> get<00:02:31.660> horses<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.290> need<00:02:32.530> more

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130

middle of the night or you know you're

muscle tightens up and it's painful it's
excruciating<00:02:55.330> pain<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:55.840> it's<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.590> way<00:02:56.740> for

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
excruciating pain and it's that way for

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.370 
excruciating pain and it's that way for
the<00:02:57.040> horse<00:02:57.280> -<00:02:57.550> we<00:02:58.090> have<00:02:58.270> found<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.810> horses<00:02:59.230> that

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
the horse - we have found in horses that

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.830 
the horse - we have found in horses that
have<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.890> repeat<00:03:00.520> over<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.060> over<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.660> over

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
have that repeat over and over and over

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.070 
have that repeat over and over and over
again<00:03:01.960> we<00:03:02.950> reduce<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.670> protein<00:03:04.240> to<00:03:04.720> below

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
again we reduce that protein to below

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.040 
again we reduce that protein to below
10%<00:03:05.470> we<00:03:06.370> keep<00:03:06.580> their<00:03:06.790> cob<00:03:07.120> side<00:03:07.450> but<00:03:07.930> we

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
10% we keep their cob side but we

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.500 
10% we keep their cob side but we
reduced<00:03:08.470> their<00:03:08.680> protein<00:03:09.070> below<00:03:09.340> 10%<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:10.180> it

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
reduced their protein below 10% and it

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.590 
reduced their protein below 10% and it
and<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:11.080> diminishes<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:12.640> amount<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.240> times

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
and it diminishes the amount of times

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.720 
and it diminishes the amount of times

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
where they tie up it's one of the things

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.400 
where they tie up it's one of the things
we<00:03:17.680> do<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:18.460> help<00:03:18.640> them<00:03:18.850> not<00:03:19.390> tie<00:03:19.660> up<00:03:19.810> tying<00:03:20.170> up

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.090 
lactic acid causes the muscles to bind
and<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:25.660> get<00:03:25.840> this<00:03:25.990> Charlie<00:03:26.410> life<00:03:26.560> situation

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
and you get this Charlie life situation

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.920 
and you get this Charlie life situation
and<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.340> horse<00:03:27.580> it's<00:03:27.880> very<00:03:28.180> very<00:03:28.420> painful<00:03:28.630> they

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
and a horse it's very very painful they

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.440 
and a horse it's very very painful they
can<00:03:29.080> barely<00:03:29.410> walk<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:29.890> it's<00:03:30.610> a<00:03:30.730> very<00:03:30.940> common

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
can barely walk and it's a very common

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.630 
can barely walk and it's a very common
thing<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.870> happens<00:03:32.200> quite<00:03:32.530> often<00:03:32.800> especially

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
thing it happens quite often especially

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.360 
thing it happens quite often especially
in<00:03:34.030> fillies<00:03:34.420> so<00:03:34.930> we<00:03:35.470> reduce<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.950> protein

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
in fillies so we reduce the protein

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.570 
in fillies so we reduce the protein
level<00:03:36.730> so<00:03:36.940> like<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.540> said<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:38.380> feed<00:03:38.740> program<00:03:39.070> in

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
horse is high or low so we determine

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.419
