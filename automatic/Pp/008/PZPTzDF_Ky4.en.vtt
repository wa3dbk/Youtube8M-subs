00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
trying it out and seeing how it performs

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.150 
trying it out and seeing how it performs
compared<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.529> feathering<00:00:22.800> propeller

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
compared to the feathering propeller

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.230 
compared to the feathering propeller
we've<00:00:23.340> been<00:00:23.460> using<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> last<00:00:23.939> few

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
we've been using for the last few

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.180 
we've been using for the last few
seasons

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.000 

I've<00:00:34.000> just<00:00:34.180> hauled<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.480> boat<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:34.900> had<00:00:35.740> it<00:00:35.830> get

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
I've just hauled the boat and had it get

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.270 
I've just hauled the boat and had it get
washed<00:00:36.280> so<00:00:36.730> we<00:00:36.910> can<00:00:37.090> compare<00:00:37.810> it<00:00:37.930> to<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.620> Kiwi

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
washed so we can compare it to the Kiwi

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.450 
washed so we can compare it to the Kiwi
pop<00:00:39.490> that<00:00:39.610> we've<00:00:39.730> had<00:00:39.850> on<00:00:39.970> before<00:00:40.090> which<00:00:41.460> we've

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
pop that we've had on before which we've

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.500 
pop that we've had on before which we've
been<00:00:42.670> writing<00:00:42.820> for<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.030> last<00:00:43.090> couple<00:00:43.480> of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
been writing for the last couple of

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.210 
been writing for the last couple of
months<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:44.200> bottoms<00:00:44.500> got<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:44.650> bit<00:00:44.770> fouled<00:00:45.040> up

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
months the bottoms got a bit fouled up

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.440 
months the bottoms got a bit fouled up
so<00:00:45.430> we're<00:00:45.880> cleaning<00:00:46.090> it<00:00:46.270> and<00:00:48.120> we'll<00:00:49.120> see<00:00:49.300> how

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
so we're cleaning it and we'll see how

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.780 
so we're cleaning it and we'll see how
this<00:00:49.570> compares<00:00:50.320> so<00:00:51.220> I'm<00:00:51.310> going<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:51.550> take<00:00:51.700> the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
this compares so I'm going to take the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.210 
this compares so I'm going to take the
old<00:00:51.910> pro<00:00:52.030> colour<00:00:52.210> off<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:52.660> swap<00:00:53.650> out<00:00:53.830> the<00:00:53.980> zinc

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
old pro colour off and swap out the zinc

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.530 
old pro colour off and swap out the zinc
while<00:00:54.400> I'm<00:00:54.520> at<00:00:54.640> it<00:00:54.670> there's<00:00:55.090> a<00:00:55.180> fair<00:00:55.360> bit<00:00:55.480> of

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
while I'm at it there's a fair bit of

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.080 
while I'm at it there's a fair bit of
lift<00:00:55.930> on<00:00:56.080> this<00:00:56.200> one<00:00:56.410> actually<00:00:56.530> but<00:00:56.970> just<00:00:57.970> let

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
lift on this one actually but just let

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.740 
lift on this one actually but just let
me<00:00:58.180> taking<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.660> prop<00:00:58.840> off<00:00:58.989> again<00:00:59.230> over<00:00:59.380> winter

it a couple of times a season and get
all<00:01:47.330> these<00:01:47.420> barnacles<00:01:47.750> out<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.340> water

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
all these barnacles out of the water

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.060 
all these barnacles out of the water
intakes<00:01:50.200> it's<00:01:51.200> amazing<00:01:51.590> how<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.740> critters

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
intakes it's amazing how the critters

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.170 
intakes it's amazing how the critters
get<00:01:52.250> in<00:01:52.370> there<00:01:53.950> all<00:01:54.950> right<00:01:55.100> so<00:01:55.520> I've<00:01:55.850> never<00:01:56.030> put

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
get in there all right so I've never put

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.580 
get in there all right so I've never put
one<00:01:56.270> of<00:01:56.360> these<00:01:56.420> on<00:01:56.480> before<00:01:56.750> but<00:01:57.260> it<00:01:57.380> seems

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
one of these on before but it seems

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.370 
one of these on before but it seems
pretty<00:01:57.740> logical<00:01:58.570> first<00:01:59.570> component<00:01:59.990> we<00:02:00.050> put<00:02:00.230> on

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
pretty logical first component we put on

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.890 
pretty logical first component we put on
is<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.830> locking<00:02:01.040> ring<00:02:01.190> this<00:02:02.000> will<00:02:02.240> spin<00:02:02.570> on<00:02:02.720> to

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
is the locking ring this will spin on to

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.690 
is the locking ring this will spin on to
the<00:02:03.050> propeller<00:02:03.500> itself<00:02:03.920> once<00:02:04.190> it's<00:02:04.340> on<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.640> be

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
the propeller itself once it's on and be

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.389 
the propeller itself once it's on and be
locked<00:02:04.850> in<00:02:05.060> with<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.270> free<00:02:05.840> set<00:02:06.080> screws<00:02:09.220> then<00:02:10.220> we

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
locked in with a free set screws then we

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.949 
locked in with a free set screws then we
have<00:02:10.580> this<00:02:12.310> bushing<00:02:13.310> here<00:02:14.260> sits<00:02:15.260> inside<00:02:15.590> that

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
have this bushing here sits inside that

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.910 
have this bushing here sits inside that
now<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:17.990> have<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.320> slide<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:21.170> rubber<00:02:21.470> bushing

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
now I have to slide this rubber bushing

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.350 
now I have to slide this rubber bushing
over<00:02:22.160> here<00:02:25.060> okay<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.120> I've<00:02:26.600> got<00:02:28.360> mostly

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
over here okay so I've got mostly

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.520 
over here okay so I've got mostly
components<00:02:29.870> on<00:02:29.930> here<00:02:30.140> except<00:02:30.350> for<00:02:30.470> this

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
components on here except for this

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.840 
components on here except for this
little<00:02:30.650> bushing<00:02:31.130> which<00:02:31.250> is<00:02:31.400> slides<00:02:31.730> over<00:02:31.940> the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
little bushing which is slides over the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.670 
little bushing which is slides over the
end<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:34.970> this<00:02:35.090> brass<00:02:35.330> hub<00:02:35.660> or<00:02:36.170> bronze<00:02:36.470> hub

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
end of this brass hub or bronze hub

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.410 
end of this brass hub or bronze hub
rather<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.220> it's<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:37.550> bit<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.820> tight<00:02:38.060> fit<00:02:38.390> so

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
rather so it's a bit of a tight fit so

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.710 
rather so it's a bit of a tight fit so
I'm<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:38.780> going<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:38.990> tap<00:02:39.140> it<00:02:39.290> on<00:02:39.380> very<00:02:39.620> gently

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
I'm just going to tap it on very gently

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:55.069 
I'm just going to tap it on very gently
put<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> little<00:02:41.870> bit<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:43.480> Kiwi<00:02:44.480> persuasion

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.110 

that<00:02:56.079> is<00:02:56.469> actually<00:02:56.859> looking<00:02:57.129> pretty<00:02:57.310> good

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
that is actually looking pretty good

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.110 
that is actually looking pretty good
okay<00:02:59.109> next<00:02:59.680> step<00:02:59.859> is<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.129> put<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.459> retaining

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
okay next step is to put the retaining

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.599 
okay next step is to put the retaining
nut<00:03:01.569> on<00:03:01.719> and<00:03:02.109> I'm<00:03:02.469> using<00:03:02.650> some<00:03:03.099> Loctite

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
nut on and I'm using some Loctite

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.789 
nut on and I'm using some Loctite
threadlocker<00:03:04.329> here<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.629> do<00:03:04.689> not<00:03:04.810> want<00:03:04.959> do<00:03:05.769> not

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
threadlocker here I do not want do not

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.759 
threadlocker here I do not want do not
want<00:03:05.950> this<00:03:06.159> spinning<00:03:06.519> off<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:07.709> losing<00:03:08.709> the

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
want this spinning off and losing the

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.009 
want this spinning off and losing the
propeller<00:03:09.129> so<00:03:10.799> this<00:03:11.799> will<00:03:12.359> take<00:03:13.359> care<00:03:13.689> of<00:03:13.840> that

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
propeller so this will take care of that

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.210 
propeller so this will take care of that
all<00:03:14.829> right

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
all right

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.309 
all right
I'm<00:03:15.730> going<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.060> talk<00:03:16.269> this<00:03:16.540> up<00:03:16.689> to<00:03:16.810> 72

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
I'm going to talk this up to 72

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:25.250 
I'm going to talk this up to 72
foot-pounds<00:03:17.889> of<00:03:17.950> torque

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.960 

okay<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.319> that's<00:03:26.560> torqued<00:03:27.040> up<00:03:27.189> the<00:03:27.639> next<00:03:27.849> step

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
okay so that's torqued up the next step

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.860 
okay so that's torqued up the next step
is<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.359> put<00:03:28.540> this<00:03:28.659> little<00:03:28.840> retaining<00:03:29.200> cap<00:03:29.530> on

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
is to put this little retaining cap on

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.319 
is to put this little retaining cap on
just<00:03:31.870> screws<00:03:32.169> into<00:03:32.319> the<00:03:32.379> end<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.769> the

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
just screws into the end of the

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.729 
just screws into the end of the
propeller<00:03:34.329> shaft<00:03:34.599> here<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.989> drive<00:03:35.169> shaft<00:03:35.439> and

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
propeller shaft here the drive shaft and

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.159 
propeller shaft here the drive shaft and
it'll<00:03:36.489> just<00:03:36.730> another<00:03:37.060> little<00:03:37.329> backup<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.959> stop

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
it'll just another little backup to stop

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.479 
it'll just another little backup to stop
the<00:03:38.349> screw<00:03:38.739> from<00:03:38.889> this<00:03:39.220> nut<00:03:39.879> from<00:03:40.030> backing<00:03:40.269> off

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
the screw from this nut from backing off

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:51.780 
the screw from this nut from backing off
so<00:03:42.810> right<00:03:43.810> here

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.470 

okay<00:03:54.160> right<00:03:55.160> now<00:03:55.430> I'm<00:03:55.640> going<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:55.880> slide<00:03:56.150> the

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
okay right now I'm going to slide the

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.110 
okay right now I'm going to slide the
propeller<00:03:57.230> itself<00:03:57.710> onto<00:03:58.310> here<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.760> see<00:03:58.970> these

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
propeller itself onto here you see these

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.220 
propeller itself onto here you see these
two<00:03:59.420> flanges<00:03:59.990> here<00:04:00.440> they<00:04:00.650> go<00:04:00.860> into<00:04:02.230> matching

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
two flanges here they go into matching

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.680 
two flanges here they go into matching
holes<00:04:03.770> in<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.340> matching<00:04:04.970> slots<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.480> the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
holes in the matching slots and the

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:17.729 
holes in the matching slots and the
green<00:04:06.140> rubber<00:04:06.430> bushing<00:04:07.430> here<00:04:07.580> so<00:04:08.410> all<00:04:09.410> it<00:04:09.650> goes

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.720 

of<00:04:18.739> course<00:04:18.799> things<00:04:19.340> like<00:04:19.459> this<00:04:19.519> will<00:04:19.670> look

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
of course things like this will look

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.830 
of course things like this will look
easy<00:04:19.940> in<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.180> magazines<00:04:22.540> okay<00:04:23.540> now<00:04:23.690> I'm<00:04:23.780> just

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
easy in the magazines okay now I'm just

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.060 
easy in the magazines okay now I'm just
persuading<00:04:24.470> this<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:24.680> go<00:04:24.770> a<00:04:24.830> little<00:04:24.920> bit

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
persuading this to go a little bit

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.260 
persuading this to go a little bit
further<00:04:25.220> forward<00:04:25.580> it's<00:04:25.820> sticking<00:04:26.030> on<00:04:26.180> the

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
further forward it's sticking on the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.150 
further forward it's sticking on the
rubber<00:04:26.450> bushing<00:04:26.810> in<00:04:26.900> here<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:27.290> it's<00:04:27.920> very

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
rubber bushing in here and it's very

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.560 
rubber bushing in here and it's very
difficult<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.610> tension<00:04:28.970> up<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.210> retainer

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
difficult to tension up the retainer

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.020 
difficult to tension up the retainer
here<00:04:29.870> so<00:04:30.140> I'm<00:04:30.290> just<00:04:30.320> tapping<00:04:30.680> it<00:04:30.860> very<00:04:31.730> gently

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
here so I'm just tapping it very gently

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.350 
here so I'm just tapping it very gently
a<00:04:34.810> little<00:04:35.810> bit<00:04:35.900> further<00:04:36.110> forward<00:04:37.120> which<00:04:38.120> makes

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
a little bit further forward which makes

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.930 
a little bit further forward which makes
it<00:04:38.480> easier<00:04:39.070> with<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.250> C<00:04:40.640> spanner<00:04:40.970> to<00:04:41.210> tighten

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
it easier with the C spanner to tighten

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.350 
it easier with the C spanner to tighten
the<00:04:43.940> retainer<00:04:44.300> up<00:04:45.700> okay<00:04:46.700> so<00:04:46.760> I'm<00:04:47.060> just<00:04:47.240> going

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
the retainer up okay so I'm just going

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.020 
the retainer up okay so I'm just going
to<00:04:47.450> get<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.380> last<00:04:48.530> turn<00:04:48.830> on<00:04:48.980> this<00:04:49.130> so<00:04:49.460> these

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
to get the last turn on this so these

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.700 
to get the last turn on this so these
two<00:04:50.300> little<00:04:50.540> Halfmoon<00:04:50.750> here<00:04:51.230> match<00:04:51.470> up

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
two little Halfmoon here match up

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.110 
two little Halfmoon here match up
because<00:04:52.160> they'll<00:04:52.400> be<00:04:52.430> locking<00:04:52.850> screws

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
because they'll be locking screws

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.180 
because they'll be locking screws
getting<00:04:53.450> in<00:04:53.540> there<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:56.380> there<00:04:57.380> we<00:04:57.530> are<00:04:57.560> so

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
getting in there and there we are so

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.490 
getting in there and there we are so
free<00:04:58.370> locking<00:04:58.760> screws<00:04:59.090> go<00:04:59.270> in<00:04:59.419> here<00:04:59.750> with

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
free locking screws go in here with

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
free locking screws go in here with
Loctite<00:05:00.919> on<00:05:01.130> them<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.760> will<00:05:01.910> stop<00:05:02.180> the

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
Loctite on them and that will stop the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.240 
Loctite on them and that will stop the
it'll<00:05:04.520> just<00:05:04.669> retain<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.390> propeller<00:05:05.720> in<00:05:05.900> place

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
it'll just retain the propeller in place

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.870 
it'll just retain the propeller in place
now<00:05:07.250> we're<00:05:07.790> just<00:05:09.490> screwing<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.669> retaining

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
now we're just screwing the retaining

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.910 
now we're just screwing the retaining
bolts<00:05:13.880> here

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.530 

a<00:05:18.860> little<00:05:19.860> bit<00:05:19.980> of<00:05:20.100> thread<00:05:20.820> Locker<00:05:21.060> on<00:05:21.180> them<00:05:21.390> as

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
a little bit of thread Locker on them as

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.500 
a little bit of thread Locker on them as
well<00:05:23.300> job<00:05:24.300> done<00:05:24.510> okay<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:27.150> was<00:05:27.300> a<00:05:27.360> bit<00:05:27.480> nervous

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
well job done okay I was a bit nervous

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.660 
well job done okay I was a bit nervous
about<00:05:27.870> this<00:05:28.080> installation<00:05:28.800> because<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.520> key

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
about this installation because the key

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.460 
about this installation because the key
we<00:05:29.790> prop<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:30.180> simplicity<00:05:30.780> yourself<00:05:31.260> to

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
we prop is simplicity yourself to

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.220 
we prop is simplicity yourself to
install<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.010> remove<00:05:32.130> but<00:05:32.580> actually<00:05:33.080> it<00:05:34.080> went

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
install and remove but actually it went

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.960 
install and remove but actually it went
surprisingly<00:05:34.470> well<00:05:34.860> weight<00:05:35.490> and<00:05:35.610> print<00:05:35.820> very

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
surprisingly well weight and print very

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.420 
surprisingly well weight and print very
well<00:05:36.210> indeed<00:05:36.480> and<00:05:36.750> I<00:05:37.170> had<00:05:37.710> no<00:05:37.860> problem<00:05:38.250> with<00:05:38.370> it

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
well indeed and I had no problem with it

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.910 
well indeed and I had no problem with it
and<00:05:38.730> any<00:05:39.360> reasonably<00:05:39.870> handy<00:05:40.380> minded<00:05:40.710> boat

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
and any reasonably handy minded boat

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.680 
and any reasonably handy minded boat
owners<00:05:41.190> should<00:05:41.280> have<00:05:41.370> no<00:05:41.520> problem<00:05:42.270> installing

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
owners should have no problem installing

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.430 
owners should have no problem installing
one<00:05:42.810> of<00:05:42.840> these<00:05:43.610> so<00:05:44.610> you<00:05:44.880> can<00:05:45.240> see<00:05:45.420> it<00:05:45.570> it's

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
one of these so you can see it it's

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:53.960 
one of these so you can see it it's
extremely<00:05:46.890> low<00:05:47.040> drag<00:05:49.160> and<00:05:52.520> so<00:05:53.520> you<00:05:53.610> go<00:05:53.730> from

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
extremely low drag and so you go from

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.370 
extremely low drag and so you go from
forward<00:05:54.240> to<00:05:54.300> reverse<00:05:55.370> just<00:05:56.370> like<00:05:56.580> that<00:05:57.380> you

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
forward to reverse just like that you

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.750 
forward to reverse just like that you
see<00:05:58.410> the<00:05:58.620> different<00:05:58.920> change<00:05:59.160> in<00:05:59.310> pitch<00:05:59.520> and

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
see the different change in pitch and

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.630 
see the different change in pitch and
reverse<00:06:00.560> as<00:06:01.560> opposed<00:06:01.950> to<00:06:02.040> forward<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:04.640> it

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
reverse as opposed to forward and it

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.630 
reverse as opposed to forward and it
will<00:06:05.790> also<00:06:05.960> Corson<00:06:06.960> up<00:06:07.110> with<00:06:07.740> them<00:06:10.520> with<00:06:11.520> this

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
will also Corson up with them with this

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.840 
will also Corson up with them with this
overdrive<00:06:12.090> function<00:06:12.770> that<00:06:13.770> we<00:06:14.460> have<00:06:14.580> to<00:06:14.700> try

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
overdrive function that we have to try

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.360 
overdrive function that we have to try
out<00:06:15.000> very<00:06:15.180> soon
