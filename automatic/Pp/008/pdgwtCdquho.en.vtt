00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
use the lip for right now for this first

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.179 
use the lip for right now for this first
step<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> first<00:00:18.570> thing<00:00:18.600> I'm<00:00:18.720> going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.869> do

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
step so the first thing I'm going to do

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.679 
step so the first thing I'm going to do
look<00:00:20.189> at<00:00:20.310> my<00:00:20.430> first<00:00:20.609> two<00:00:20.760> ingredients<00:00:21.330> which

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
look at my first two ingredients which

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.040 
look at my first two ingredients which
is<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.400> cup<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.550> warm<00:00:24.359> water<00:00:24.480> not<00:00:25.019> hot

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
is that cup of warm water not hot

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.490 
is that cup of warm water not hot
because<00:00:25.560> hot<00:00:25.859> will<00:00:26.039> kill<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> yeast<00:00:27.500> our

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
because hot will kill the yeast our

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.519 
because hot will kill the yeast our
active<00:00:28.920> dry<00:00:29.099> yeast<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.820> our<00:00:30.390> sugar<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.410> we're

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
active dry yeast and our sugar so we're

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.770 
active dry yeast and our sugar so we're
going<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.710> do<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.239> I'm<00:00:33.239> actually<00:00:33.360> put<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
going to do is I'm actually put the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.450 
going to do is I'm actually put the
water<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.200> first<00:00:38.059> I'm<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.300> put<00:00:40.460> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
water in first I'm going to put the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.869 
water in first I'm going to put the
yeast<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.969> second<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:43.770> sugar<00:00:44.040> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
yeast in a second and then the sugar and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.770 
yeast in a second and then the sugar and
what<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.329> goes<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:49.500> whoops

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
what it goes on here is the the whoops

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.200 
what it goes on here is the the whoops
the<00:00:51.780> yeast<00:00:52.280> when<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> warm<00:00:53.579> water<00:00:53.789> will

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the yeast when the warm water will

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.790 
the yeast when the warm water will
actually<00:00:54.239> start<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> bloom<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.469> bit<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
actually start to bloom a little bit and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
actually start to bloom a little bit and
then<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> sugar<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> act<00:00:57.329> as<00:00:57.480> its

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
then the sugar is going to act as its

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.729 
then the sugar is going to act as its
food<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.270> it<00:01:00.270> doesn't<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.600> anything<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.649> eat

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
food and it doesn't have anything to eat

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.179 
food and it doesn't have anything to eat
it<00:01:02.129> won't<00:01:02.430> work<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.570> right<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.199> I'm<00:01:05.100> just

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
it won't work out right so I'm just

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.040 
it won't work out right so I'm just
going<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> turn<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.640> up

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
going to turn this up

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.250 
going to turn this up
you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.040> by<00:01:08.190> hand<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.760> wanted

color and what's going on there is
you're<00:02:04.830> activating<00:02:05.190> your<00:02:05.460> yeast<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.500> you'll

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
you're activating your yeast and you'll

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.449 
you're activating your yeast and you'll
also<00:02:08.149> get<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.210> really<00:02:09.720> really<00:02:10.220> distinct<00:02:11.220> odor

at this point that way you know that the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.340 
at this point that way you know that the
yeast<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.520> working<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:14.959> don't<00:02:15.959> be<00:02:16.050> concerned

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
yeast is working so don't be concerned

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.170 
yeast is working so don't be concerned
it's<00:02:16.709> nothing<00:02:17.280> wrong<00:02:17.459> it's<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:18.030> it's

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
supposed to do that so I'm gonna let

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.979 
supposed to do that so I'm gonna let
this<00:02:20.280> go<00:02:20.489> for<00:02:20.640> another<00:02:20.730> five<00:02:21.300> seconds<00:02:21.660> or<00:02:21.810> so

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
just going to leave it alone not do

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.330 
just going to leave it alone not do
anything<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.040> we're<00:02:29.190> going<00:02:29.310> to

anything with it and we're going to

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.650 
anything with it and we're going to
where<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.550> throw<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> mixer<00:02:30.030> off<00:02:30.150> those<00:02:30.360> so

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
where to throw the mixer off those so

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.530 
where to throw the mixer off those so
let's<00:02:31.500> kill<00:02:31.709> our<00:02:31.830> mixer<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.670> let's<00:02:33.330> set<00:02:33.510> our

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
let's kill our mixer and let's set our

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.690 
let's kill our mixer and let's set our
timer<00:02:36.140> 10<00:02:37.140> minutes<00:02:37.410> I'll<00:02:37.890> be<00:02:38.040> back<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.340> 10
