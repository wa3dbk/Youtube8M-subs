00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.220
 This time, the Latics play from the before they the series of Schmidt games 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.879
 The players must try to get as many points as possible 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:14.530
 this happens 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.159
 by collecting the fab chips 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.349
 the later blog shows six numbers purely 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.729
 At the end of each row is a Pieks Red 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.609
 If this is achieved by a player he would have a corresponding chip 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.539
 Each participant starts before the game starts 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:35.910
 six game pieces of a color 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.450
 is a player's turn with the four dice and throws them 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.500
 The dice eyes thus obtained now give the fab rows in the player 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.410
 insert a character 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.430
 or in the course of a field in front of back may 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.999
 the litters 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.999
 may I group arbitrarily 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.070
 I decide for it "My throws 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.470
 to pull one 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.140
 and merge into a 6 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.260
 Accordingly, my character sits on the first field 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.640
 the tens row 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 and also the first field of the sixth row 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.620
 is the next player pushing 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.700
 his litter since 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.880
 a second and a third 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.550
 51 like another 5 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.980
 From this he formed groups again 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.370
 he leaves the two missing 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.229
 he puts the 2 and the 3 together to another 5 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.780
 Thus, the player is allowed to take three steps on the five-way trip 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.770
 pull in front 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.220
 the next player he throws a 4 a 5 and that makes sense 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.700
 whenever a player throws at least 2 ones 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.610
 attacks the Latinos excited 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.689
 this says that the player 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.740
 his use is expected to one 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.040
 may turn to any other number 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.990
 the blue player groups a 10 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.790
 and reach the Bix field 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.990
 thus for itself the appropriate for chips 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.990
 from the stack and put in his stock 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:13.229
 Now it is my turn again. I copy my dice to a 10 and 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:14.419
 his 8th 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.749
 in the eighth row, no character is yet to be seen 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.759
 this one is getting new ones 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.139
 in the tens row the light comes in to the front back 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:28.729
 while on the number fields any number of figures in a field 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:29.819
 may stand 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.109
 that on a pixel always only one figure stand 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.309
 I thus displace the blue player of his figure 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:38.749
 has to take back to his stock 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:42.510
 I myself receive the tens chip for reaching the ICS field 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.299
 at a later time I copy again, among other things, no drag in the 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.149
 Zehner series is already on the VIX world 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:55.449
 so I can not take another ship directly 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:59.019
 I can stay on the XL until a player displaces me 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:04.669
 A player of six types of different color manages to succeed 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.569
 would have a bonus for this set 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.589
 there is another bonus for each additional z 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.329
 However, the value decreases from time to time 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:16.980
 will be in a fares 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.069
 awarded the last check 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.919
 so this series will be closed 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.489
 the players next to their pieces back to their supply 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.699
 and from now on you can not use any more characters in this row 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.749
 once three rows have been completely emptied 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.599
 or the last big seats were awarded 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.239
 the game ends 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.369
 each player counts his accumulated points 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:45.729
 the player with the most points 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.199
