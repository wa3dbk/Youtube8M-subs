00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.189
 of cattle 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.209
 in 1968 I was born at 10 am on a Saturday morning 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.210

 therefore I am almost born on the counter edalini remains inculcated all this passion 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.729
 for the butcher shop 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:40.169
 and the specialty as we treat Piedmontese meats that are very good 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.769
 very delicate 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.220
 dish that goes for the greater the carpaccio auchan albese with we want

 call her and the nanny 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:50.899
 we do it in three different ways 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.609
 natural solar salt and oil 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.309
 and then with a room

 common function of flavors 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.589
 what we do more than others we leave Ligurian 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:16.339
 for more time and so that it becomes very fat that you see here 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:18.839
 and the real 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:23.489
 the real difference what you do once today is no longer used to do for 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.719
 the rush to sell 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:29.150
 let it hang and then wait in cell 0 degrees leave 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:33.389
 rest in such a way that it becomes very much more tender in all its parts 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.760
 at least 40 days we leave then for 40 days 2 months 3 months are here 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.929
 pushed to 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:44.719
 to make the fruit of the mind streaming so much that the professors 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.270
 do not hesitate to ask for mechanization 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.790
 I'm intrigued, I went to see everything we do 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.459
 in our processes 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.640
 truck in as3 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.159
 step stables in asti and surroundings 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.819
 my brother. he takes care of the infection, he tells farmers to eat and 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.199
 so we have our own flesh 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.199
 I have in front of a shop window that they go down to a jeweler's house 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:09.399
 what are the jewels inside 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:11.039

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.889
 is 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.019
 the thing that 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.799
 the more I would have liked to 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.659
 this restructuring was to make available everything we have 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.789
 in our skies 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.759
 the twenty-first refrigeration unit we have 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.680
 all the meat we have to keep it hidden behind the slaughter I'm sorry 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.659
 a little when I brought friends to see 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.659
 because in miami everyone in the cell really remained 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.129
 dazzled by everything from all this red gold that we have in heaven 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.889

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.020
 our vouchers 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.960
 to show how they are and how the maturation evolutions are 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.010
 and all the images you see shown here are 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.360
 the photos of the Milan fair 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.150
