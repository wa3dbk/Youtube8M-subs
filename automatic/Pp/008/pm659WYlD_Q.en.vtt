the final cover looks like final cover
actually<00:00:26.039> looks<00:00:26.160> like<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.779> is

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
actually looks like this this is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.999 
actually looks like this this is
dystopian<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.519> comes<00:00:29.730> out<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.470> May<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
dystopian and it comes out in May in the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.459 
dystopian and it comes out in May in the
UK<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:32.520> least<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.090> not<00:00:33.239> sure<00:00:33.510> about<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
UK at least and I'm not sure about the

UK at least and I'm not sure about the
u.s.<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.860> think<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.430> same<00:00:35.640> release<00:00:36.090> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
u.s. I think it's the same release a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.150 
u.s. I think it's the same release a
very<00:00:36.510> end<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.899> may<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.739> sounds<00:00:38.040> really

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
