normal part and cut normally around that

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.270 
normal part and cut normally around that
right<00:00:34.780> now<00:00:34.930> I'm<00:00:35.050> separating<00:00:35.530> out<00:00:35.650> the<00:00:35.830> curls

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
right now I'm separating out the curls

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.360 
right now I'm separating out the curls
and<00:00:36.610> just<00:00:37.120> making<00:00:37.300> sure<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:37.960> see<00:00:38.739> where<00:00:39.040> I<00:00:39.070> want

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
and just making sure I see where I want

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.520 
and just making sure I see where I want
to<00:00:39.520> make<00:00:39.640> cuts<00:00:39.879> and<00:00:40.180> here's<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.110> critical

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
to make cuts and here's the critical

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.400 
to make cuts and here's the critical
step<00:00:41.739> you<00:00:42.489> want<00:00:42.790> to<00:00:43.090> kind<00:00:43.390> of<00:00:43.540> mark<00:00:43.930> with<00:00:44.230> your

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
step you want to kind of mark with your

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.389 
step you want to kind of mark with your
fingers<00:00:44.860> using<00:00:45.220> a<00:00:45.280> pinching<00:00:46.239> motion<00:00:47.399> you're

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
fingers using a pinching motion you're

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.240 
fingers using a pinching motion you're
going<00:00:48.640> to<00:00:49.260> mark<00:00:50.260> where<00:00:50.559> you're<00:00:50.739> going<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:51.040> cut

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
going to mark where you're going to cut

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.970 
going to mark where you're going to cut
and<00:00:51.460> then<00:00:51.670> make<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:51.970> cut<00:00:52.360> directly<00:00:52.840> under<00:00:53.380> where

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
and then make a cut directly under where

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.139 
and then make a cut directly under where
your<00:00:54.130> fingers<00:00:54.460> are<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.680> firmly<00:00:57.100> pinched<00:00:57.730> where

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
your fingers are so firmly pinched where

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.080 
your fingers are so firmly pinched where
exactly<00:00:58.630> you<00:00:58.960> want<00:00:59.140> to<00:00:59.260> cut<00:00:59.590> and<00:00:59.860> then<00:01:00.160> cut

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
exactly you want to cut and then cut

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.910 
exactly you want to cut and then cut
directly<00:01:01.629> below<00:01:01.809> that<00:01:02.020> that<00:01:02.410> way<00:01:02.559> you<00:01:02.620> make

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
directly below that that way you make

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.799 
directly below that that way you make
sure<00:01:02.950> you<00:01:03.309> don't<00:01:03.520> cut<00:01:03.790> too<00:01:03.820> much<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:04.540> if<00:01:04.690> you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
sure you don't cut too much and if you

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.749 
sure you don't cut too much and if you
stretch<00:01:05.080> out<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.350> curl<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.619> look<00:01:05.950> at<00:01:06.100> it<00:01:06.250> you

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
stretch out the curl to look at it you

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.460 
stretch out the curl to look at it you
know<00:01:07.000> that<00:01:07.360> your<00:01:07.509> fingers<00:01:07.960> have<00:01:08.200> marked

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
know that your fingers have marked

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.469 
know that your fingers have marked
exactly<00:01:08.890> where<00:01:09.070> it's<00:01:09.220> supposed<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.700> be<00:01:09.880> when

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
exactly where it's supposed to be when

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.469 
exactly where it's supposed to be when
it's<00:01:10.630> not<00:01:10.810> stretched<00:01:11.200> out<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.640> make<00:01:13.119> sure<00:01:13.149> your

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
it's not stretched out so make sure your

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.630 
it's not stretched out so make sure your
cuts<00:01:13.930> are<00:01:14.140> symmetrical<00:01:14.799> by<00:01:15.040> doing<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.610> same

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
cuts are symmetrical by doing the same

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.130 
cuts are symmetrical by doing the same
cut<00:01:16.240> on<00:01:16.420> each<00:01:16.570> side<00:01:16.930> if<00:01:17.200> necessary<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:20.110> you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
cut on each side if necessary so you

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.320 
cut on each side if necessary so you
definitely<00:01:20.409> don't<00:01:20.710> want<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.549> stretch<00:01:22.060> out<00:01:22.299> the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
definitely don't want to stretch out the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.780 
definitely don't want to stretch out the
curl<00:01:22.780> when<00:01:22.990> you<00:01:23.110> cut<00:01:23.409> if<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.010> find<00:01:24.340> yourself

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
curl when you cut if you find yourself

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.969 
curl when you cut if you find yourself
doing<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.360> just<00:01:25.689> let<00:01:25.840> go<00:01:26.020> release<00:01:26.500> kind<00:01:26.860> of

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
doing that just let go release kind of

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.340 
doing that just let go release kind of
reset<00:01:27.340> and<00:01:27.670> then<00:01:28.240> use<00:01:28.510> your<00:01:28.540> fingers<00:01:28.810> in<00:01:29.290> a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
reset and then use your fingers in a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.109 
reset and then use your fingers in a
pinching<00:01:29.770> motion<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:30.400> mark<00:01:30.640> where<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:30.970> want

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
pinching motion to mark where you want

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.770 
pinching motion to mark where you want
the<00:01:31.330> cut<00:01:31.540> then<00:01:32.430> snip<00:01:33.430> directly<00:01:34.150> below<00:01:34.360> that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
the cut then snip directly below that

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.649 
the cut then snip directly below that
that<00:01:34.990> way<00:01:35.080> you<00:01:35.140> never<00:01:35.439> cut<00:01:35.770> off<00:01:35.890> too<00:01:36.100> much<00:01:36.659> like

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
that way you never cut off too much like

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.380 
that way you never cut off too much like
I<00:01:37.780> said<00:01:38.020> you<00:01:38.680> can<00:01:39.340> definitely<00:01:39.580> stretch<00:01:40.180> out

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
I said you can definitely stretch out

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.070 
I said you can definitely stretch out
the<00:01:40.780> curl<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.770> make<00:01:41.979> sure<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.630> can<00:01:43.840> see

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
the curl to make sure that you can see

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.320 
the curl to make sure that you can see
what<00:01:44.259> you're<00:01:44.409> doing<00:01:44.439> but<00:01:45.280> only<00:01:45.549> after<00:01:45.880> you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
what you're doing but only after you

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.570 
what you're doing but only after you
firmly<00:01:46.720> gripped<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.439> and<00:01:47.650> you<00:01:48.220> know<00:01:48.400> you're

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
firmly gripped it and you know you're

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.539 
firmly gripped it and you know you're
not<00:01:48.640> gonna<00:01:48.909> cut<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:49.780> stretched<00:01:50.290> out<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:51.040> it's

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
not gonna cut it stretched out and it's

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:52.920 
not gonna cut it stretched out and it's
going<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.700> bounce<00:01:51.939> back<00:01:52.210> shorter<00:01:52.689> than<00:01:52.840> you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
going to bounce back shorter than you

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.600 
going to bounce back shorter than you
thought<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:54.280> spent<00:01:55.240> plenty<00:01:55.689> of<00:01:55.930> time<00:01:56.610> shaking

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
thought so spent plenty of time shaking

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.330 
thought so spent plenty of time shaking
out<00:01:57.880> your<00:01:58.060> hair<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.869> make<00:01:58.990> sure<00:01:59.229> that<00:01:59.650> it<00:02:00.009> looks

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
out your hair to make sure that it looks

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.390 
out your hair to make sure that it looks
natural<00:02:01.350> sometimes<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:02.590> make<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.799> cut<00:02:03.159> and

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
natural sometimes you make a cut and

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.280 
natural sometimes you make a cut and

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.340 
make sure it's the shape that I like and
cut<00:03:50.069> each<00:03:50.280> curl<00:03:50.609> individually<00:03:51.299> so<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:52.109> start

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
cut each curl individually so the start

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
I'll kind of get clumps of curls and at

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.800 
I'll kind of get clumps of curls and at
the<00:03:55.260> end<00:03:55.440> I'll<00:03:55.709> be<00:03:55.769> cutting<00:03:56.389> every<00:03:57.389> single

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810

curl<00:03:58.079> one<00:03:58.889> by<00:03:59.069> one<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.700> that<00:04:00.540> does<00:04:00.810> take<00:04:01.079> some

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
curl one by one and that does take some

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.289 
curl one by one and that does take some
time<00:04:01.319> but<00:04:01.799> you<00:04:01.889> get<00:04:02.010> faster<00:04:02.430> as<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.579> go<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:03.120> it

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
time but you get faster as you go and it

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.539 
time but you get faster as you go and it
