00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.429
 the arrangement because we are sitting 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.400
 it does not allow us to share the warnings of 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.990
 lady baby who looked very relevant 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.340
 in terms of readers for what is going to 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.230
 tell us bread are more the silver ones 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.630
 crosses of black sabbath as I would say 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.359
 ricardo what is still hanging the miss 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.039
 monster storytellers we were not this 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.099
 late the mad press conference 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.570
 godfather's man bone metal by the 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.190
 public television was with him 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.290
 listened to what he said today is this afternoon 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.230
 please gentino and as you spotted the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.829
 back in this city 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.470
 if we have an amazing audience and that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.050
 good 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.390
 about that music because he believes that 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.120
 beyond the validity because they are 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.190
 creators of this musical genre 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.949
 if there is not a renewal because I do not 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.090
 there's why if we do that it stays 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.040
 valid 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.920
 two 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.600
 because good says that again coming back 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.710
 a little back they feel very 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.390
 fortunate for the life he has had 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.730
 for the music I was able to deploy and in 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.380
 definitively does not know what will happen to the 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.940
 heavy metal and considers that if it were like that 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.040
 I would betray 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.480
 at sixty-odd years old where 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.480
 get so much energy to keep going 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.710
 the same as always the passion energy what 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.710
 maintains 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.760

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.389
 [Applause] 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.140
 [Music] 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.470
 [Applause] 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.830
 [Music] 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.570
 they are three historical bands not only 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.910
 the sky there is also the rock that are 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:13.430

 motörhead three pillars bands 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:28.900
 fundamentals of heavy metal 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:31.180
 [Music] 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.489
 It is a super festival of anyone who 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.819
 is in this of the magazines in my case 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.950
 22 years ago but I'm still a fan 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.860
 festival that you know when they say monsters 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.480
 of rock is something supreme so good 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.760
 as local bands with a kind of 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.049
 cucarda that is great to enter what 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.299
 well also that we are proud of 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.060
 train with a kind of filter 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.530
 because the production from there is full 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.519
 of the level of the band you know it's 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.519
 it's not easy to enter 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.320
 [Music] 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.910
 but I find within what is a 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.770
 metal band we have many 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.970
 hardcore influences I like more 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.650
 as the biggest hasan mazinger panther are 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.180
 bands that have a lot to good more 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.310
 balls the front tics in the jargo that 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.070
 they have a movement of sounds very very 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.600
 assets cross they jump for the public 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.800
 who comes to see me I think he expects 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.060
 that and with a very much volume sound 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.110
 we use affirmations thanks a week 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.940
 let's say we try to hit hard to 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.730
 sonic and visual level that is a bit what 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.580
 that is styled for redundancy within 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:52.720
 of the fire extinguisher 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:52.720
