00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.770
 we promised you many 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.240
 news on the occasion of this sim in 2015 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.270
 and we will now talk 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.020
 handling with a new telescopic 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.300
 the 9300 5 ips hatch proposed by massey 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.760
 ferguson and I have by my side paul rigaud 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.920
 responsible product then paul ma 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.680
 first question where is in the 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.750
 range this loft 1305 this tram and a new 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.520
 product for the win for the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.070
 telescopic so a model that 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.800
 interspersed between the 9205 which is our 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.540
 compact jig and so the range of 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.180
 telescopic which is a template a little 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.490
 little more imposing of 9306 we support the 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.240
 407 sx plan so here is a request 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.340
 of customers 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.300
 what is the target for this product the 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.770
 target it's just a 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.990
 farmer who are looking for a 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.820
 telescopic which is powerful and compact 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.400
 at the same time compact that is to say that it will 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.190
 get in a width of 2010 and in 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.170
 a minimum height of 2 m is then 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.729
 that's true that at the dimensional level 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.640
 it's important in handling for 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.619
 maneuverability at engine level or 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.180
 are there two novelties then at 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.160
 motorization level is not complete 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.729
 4 interim with a 3 liter engine 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.410
 developing 600 horses high level so 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.569
 of the transmission we have a 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.390
 hydrostatic transmission gift that is 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.250
 common to the mass models of the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.690
 range massey ferguson but here we are on 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.030
 a hydrostatic transmission with two 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.569
 hydraulic ratios at the level of 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.759
 hydraulics 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.890
 we are on an open center of 108 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.319
 minutes 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.670
 for the telescopic so let's talk 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.330
 lifting now since that's when 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.730
 even the goal 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.680
 what are the capabilities at the level of 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.800
 capacities we are on a maximum capacity 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.470
 from three tons to five meters 80 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.150
 so then we'll talk now 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.890
 maintenance regular maintenance I think 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.860
 that it is facilitated through a broad 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.200
 hood that will give access to all the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.650
 motorisation and maintenance part 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.709
 regular 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.360
 that's actually this easy interview he 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.450
 is allowed by an engine position 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.250
 is in longitudinal position each 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.530
 mechanical organ on an engine or 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.750
 transmission is very easy to access by 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.680
 example the air filter is here for 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.400
 daily maintenance 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.780
 it's very easy to clean it up 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.360
 we find paul now at 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.100
 install in the cabin 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.860
 so it's true pole handling 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.080
 with a telescopic the main element 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.910
 it's still the visibility the good 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.730
 visibility and for that at massey 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.280
 ferguson we improved the cabin again 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.019
 of that 9 thousand 305 aixtron yes indeed 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.340
 a new cabin that allows 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.870
 to have a dashboard that is 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.519
 lowered to allow for a 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.470
 excellent visibility on his tool 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.900
 the front we have an excellent ex ante 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.370
 visibility on the height and a 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.049
 excellent visibility on the right this 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.140
 which is paramount on a telescopic 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.000
 then another important point the comfort 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.450
 working the manipulation or 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.850
 shifters 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.209
 indeed at the level of ergonomics that a 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.590
 little bit evolved on the 9300 5 x tra a 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.090
 inversion to left hand and available 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.450
 as well as a right hand inversion 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.290
 more on this new telescopic we 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.630
 can settle 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.220
 so the flow on the arrow in the 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.470
 rise and descent the household and the 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.239
 cavage that's a novelty too 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.370
 a novelty on this telescopic 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.780
 side shock damping for 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.440
 allow to have more comfort for 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.299
 the user 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.790
 that's how can we summarize a little 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.489
 little a synthesis on this novelty in 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.690
 telescopic the 9300 5 x tra well didier 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.610
 I would like the sphere in three words 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.500
 this compact conclusion because we 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.299
 stays on a template that can go in 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.750
 minimum height of 2 meters 10 and on 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.850
 a width of 2010 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.070
 stable because he has one year not the wheelbase 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.200
 of his big brothers, so big ones 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.910
 chassis of the range as well as powerful 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.410
 a powerful telescopic that will 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.900
 allow to realize all types of 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.230
 work for the farmer here thank you 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.230
