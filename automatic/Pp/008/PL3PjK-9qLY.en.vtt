00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
blue because i ordered it I looked at

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.160 
blue because i ordered it I looked at
the<00:00:38.550> keel<00:00:38.760> blue<00:00:39.059> better<00:00:39.239> because<00:00:39.510> i<00:00:39.750> thought

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the keel blue better because i thought

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.200 
the keel blue better because i thought
the<00:00:40.320> green<00:00:40.530> was<00:00:40.739> too<00:00:41.670> green<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the green was too green with the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.560 
the green was too green with the
bushings<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.899> everything<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.300> that's<00:00:45.300> why<00:00:45.539> I

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
bushings and everything so that's why I

00:00:45.570 --> 00:01:20.109 
bushings and everything so that's why I
got<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.020> tequila<00:00:46.739> blue<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.570> one<00:00:48.570> sec<00:01:17.030> all<00:01:18.030> right

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.359 

so<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.390> got<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.810> box<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.530> think<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.310> is

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
so we got the box I think this is

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.310
