00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
on my hard drive already and this is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.759 
on my hard drive already and this is
just<00:02:15.790> like<00:02:16.790> another<00:02:17.000> visual<00:02:17.840> other<00:02:17.989> of<00:02:18.440> the

just like another visual other of the

just like another visual other of the
partitions<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.489> have<00:02:19.670> on<00:02:19.880> my<00:02:20.060> hard<00:02:20.540> drive<00:02:21.340> okay

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
partitions I have on my hard drive okay

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.330

so you can see that I have C Drive which

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.289 
so you can see that I have C Drive which
is<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:26.420> huge<00:02:27.280> J<00:02:28.280> which<00:02:28.519> is<00:02:28.549> smaller<00:02:28.910> than<00:02:29.000> L

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
is a huge J which is smaller than L

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.190 
is a huge J which is smaller than L
which<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.660> smallest<00:02:30.700> I'm<00:02:31.700> not<00:02:31.910> sure<00:02:32.299> if<00:02:32.600> this

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
which is a smallest I'm not sure if this

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.289 
which is a smallest I'm not sure if this
size<00:02:33.560> over<00:02:33.860> here<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.130> how<00:02:34.280> much<00:02:34.430> I've<00:02:34.610> used<00:02:34.940> or

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
size over here is how much I've used or

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.120 
size over here is how much I've used or
how<00:02:35.720> much<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.079> in<00:02:36.290> total<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.739> think<00:02:36.950> it's<00:02:37.070> how

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
how much is in total I think it's how

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.060 
how much is in total I think it's how
much<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.519> total<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.720> have<00:02:39.049> 150<00:02:39.470> gigs<00:02:39.890> of

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
much is in total so I have 150 gigs of

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.979 
much is in total so I have 150 gigs of
it<00:02:40.190> C<00:02:40.700> 63<00:02:41.329> gigs<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.810> J<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:42.049> 24<00:02:42.860> gigs<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.280> L<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:44.959> I

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
it C 63 gigs of J and 24 gigs of L so I

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.410 
it C 63 gigs of J and 24 gigs of L so I
want<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.530> resize<00:02:46.040> my<00:02:46.070> C<00:02:46.670> partition<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.269> can

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
want to resize my C partition you can

actually<00:05:04.380> I've<00:05:05.380> made<00:05:05.680> a<00:05:05.710> mistake<00:05:05.800> see<00:05:06.220> over

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
actually I've made a mistake see over

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.200 
actually I've made a mistake see over
here<00:05:06.430> it<00:05:06.640> says<00:05:06.850> available<00:05:07.330> megabytes<00:05:08.200> is<00:05:09.210> 19.9

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
here it says available megabytes is 19.9

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.740 
here it says available megabytes is 19.9
gates<00:05:10.750> so<00:05:11.590> I<00:05:11.950> can't<00:05:12.280> really<00:05:12.490> have<00:05:12.820> this<00:05:13.060> 170

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
gates so I can't really have this 170

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.940 
gates so I can't really have this 170
gate<00:05:13.950> because<00:05:14.950> a<00:05:15.510> 150<00:05:16.510> plus<00:05:16.810> 19<00:05:17.680> is<00:05:18.930> 169<00:05:19.930> so<00:05:20.860> I'm

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
gate because a 150 plus 19 is 169 so I'm

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.030 
gate because a 150 plus 19 is 169 so I'm
gonna<00:05:21.130> make<00:05:21.250> it<00:05:21.340> 168<00:05:22.030> this<00:05:22.510> can<00:05:22.690> be<00:05:22.780> safe<00:05:23.040> and

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
gonna make it 168 this can be safe and
