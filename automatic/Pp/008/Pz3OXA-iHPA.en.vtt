00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.700

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.570
 can you have the form is this 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.910
 that today we meet for the 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.130
 video discovery of the avap corvo I do not 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.480
 do not know how audi a6 a small and b 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.430
 benon realized by month unfortunately 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.750
 because in a very short time I was able to 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.280
 the time you do I played twice 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.070
 and three maps I made 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.809
 completely torn so people I have 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.220
 asked a colleague of mine if he could 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.070
 not pass his gameplay and then was 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.360
 very nice to do it so good 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.470
 not want if its gameplay so that's 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.540
 for that I recommend it so 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.450
 I'll offer this video shots 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.190
 rifle or a code cf the d2 hoping 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.110
 pass on to make the discovery 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.289
 from there to hopefully the der of 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.460
 first to offers you a video on 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.020
 then pandev the bap 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.449
 she is very very low heavy see you 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.700
 even people it's on a frame 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.509
 heavenly but hey this map I 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.950
 find that she has a little bit 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.890
 mysterious at the bottom because there is 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.479
 a lot of things a little inconsistent the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.770
 daydream he's in a plane carcass 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.530
 so iliad plane that would have crashed 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.789
 forgotten from the next bap we see 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.440
 rafts of fortune so we can 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.940
 maybe you'll see normally at 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.100
 right is quickly done in the not see him 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.710
 pity but we see rafts of 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.259
 fortune and it's a little bit we can 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.049
 imagine that the survivors if we had in 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.830
 no longer escape 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.840
 since I do not understand that's why 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.290
 there are yachts for people 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.270
 wealthy next so handsome at this level 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.250
 this is the decor it is not used to big 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.979
 thing at the level of the same oral map 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.200
 to go complicated she is pretty but 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.350
 she is enough to make big 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.439
 big series both simple and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.130
 complicated actually wake finally you 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.270
 see in this part 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.840
 sixt rules that goes to do pretty bad 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.860
 but apart from a little good for dogs 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.509
 where to hide or go to 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.019
 the shelter and could yield chagossians 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.369
 his a6 a46 may hurt and 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.530
 the banks about the same 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.730
 it's complicated to be able to escape 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.370
 of bombardment on Slovak 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.310
 because good there is the little species of 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.670
 natural lice on the side that can be 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.760
 not too bad to be able to escape the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.459
 dogs and all that and there would also be 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.530
 on the carcass of plane or sailboats in 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.180
 face before the dogs by or to 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.190
 bombing and screaming strict which at 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.709
 beyond big havoc there or not more 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.420
 simple and I think a lot of people 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.870
 especially those who are very strong who 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.400
 to make me the big frag will be able to 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.860
 to please just like after behind 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.810
 frankly average then the fact that 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.390
 can go on the decor on board 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.849
 water that's nice I would like a 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.680
 trick I never tried to go on 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.540
 the on the edge of the water that I have 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.980
 never tried I will try smart 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.810
 i will try korea next your jewelry 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.190
 see what does it do if we can go a 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.000
 little bit in the water on board right away 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.000
 there was a degree 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.980
 do not try me I just wanted you 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.170
 propose a small gameplay 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.050
 quietly good gameplay ah with a 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.970
 correct fold because to make it simple 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.740
 and for good reason while at the exit for 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.210
 to confess who has a big team with 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.460
 which we lowered microstation of 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.840
 sources from it they are the 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.570
 curves will be done all the same 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.610
 pleasure and that's where the enemies or at 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.800
 very little discovered then will be able 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.490
 cruel and then in addition to the town hall 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.960
 spots have gone nice to the passage he has 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.390
 you have your life trying to be sure of 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:46.290
 lycos he dies at his request and the 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.290
 hooks that will do some frags 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.580
 he chains it this pleasure the locals and 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.380
 in addition as with points with his 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.340
 ducrocq station there is a lot of 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.430
 points and it's true that on this side 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.970
 there is way to make games be done 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.930
 pleasure of really at home had 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:08.680
 called to two by the waters and who will 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.690
 to make the party worried he so that they 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.130
 balloon happily for him after he has 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.350
 surely had to throw ball on 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.299
 bombing it's the bait of the throw of the 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.440
 palace that I personally have 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.630
 evil and that word by two sleeves and 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.000
 not too much where the scales each time 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.290
 that counts it's laying on the huge ones at 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.820
 passage 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.160
 who was succeeded him in itself 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.690
 Aircraft carcasses I do not know 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.850
 if it's me because I see a little 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.390
 little far the gameplay on the small screen 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.640
 of the software not I do not know how 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.110
 how can we do and if a trip 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.200
 to escape the dogs like that it must 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.430
 to be an idea people me what I 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.890
 going to do what I did not say it 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.020
 keep playing everywhere and you 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:51.100
 propose 3 1 points on the about 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.560
 other maps that have been presented I do not 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.880
 am more donations and that I have 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.350
 a little bit of matches on this map at 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.810
 early we sleep badly we do not know them and 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.970
 where it blows a lot of strong people 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.320
 who is playing right now and then I have 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.900
 a little bit wrong about that I have 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.210
 asked konÃ© to lend the gameplay bbb 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.830
 the next gameplay will be wood and 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.840
 then you will also wait to small 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.490
 his bi crazy option multi video half 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.070
 hour of play against a lot of things

 little sick at day scud 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.880
