multiplayer choice and I here and I'm

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.130 
multiplayer choice and I here and I'm
using<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.339> default<00:00:05.520> assault<00:00:06.420> class<00:00:06.690> with<00:00:07.020> the

using the default assault class with the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.620 
using the default assault class with the
m16<00:00:07.799> scavenger<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.550> harden<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.210> do<00:00:09.330> not<00:00:09.570> know

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
m16 scavenger and harden I do not know

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.629 
m16 scavenger and harden I do not know
where<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.929> third<00:00:10.110> one<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.860> do<00:00:10.920> not<00:00:11.250> care

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
where the third one is and I do not care

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.870 
where the third one is and I do not care
so<00:00:13.190> let's<00:00:14.190> go<00:00:14.340> ahead<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.580> get<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.849> the

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
so let's go ahead and get to the

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.970 
so let's go ahead and get to the
gameplay<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.960> spawn<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.470> don't<00:00:16.710> know<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
gameplay that spawn I don't know the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.099 
gameplay that spawn I don't know the
spawn<00:00:17.279> needs<00:00:17.609> yet<00:00:18.180> at<00:00:18.359> all<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.810> should<00:00:19.050> have

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
spawn needs yet at all I should have

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.519 
spawn needs yet at all I should have
waited<00:00:19.320> quite<00:00:19.920> some<00:00:20.279> time<00:00:20.520> for<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.529> but

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
waited quite some time for that one but

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.490 
waited quite some time for that one but
the<00:00:22.619> idea<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.460> catch<00:00:23.609> them<00:00:24.350> where<00:00:25.350> where

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the idea is to catch them where where

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.550 
the idea is to catch them where where
that<00:00:25.529> guy<00:00:25.740> just<00:00:25.980> jumped<00:00:26.070> off<00:00:26.599> and<00:00:27.599> my

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
that guy just jumped off and my

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.490 
that guy just jumped off and my
sensitivity<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.400> off<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.630> narrow<00:00:30.990> margin

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
sensitivity is off so that narrow margin

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.959 
sensitivity is off so that narrow margin
i<00:00:31.590> missed<00:00:31.830> there<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.460> guy<00:00:32.640> should<00:00:32.669> have

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
i missed there that guy should have

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.400 
i missed there that guy should have
dropped<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.950> i<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.460> guy<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.700> my<00:00:35.910> left

some sort of strategy to do good and
look<00:02:36.200> at<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.380> other<00:02:36.620> was<00:02:36.800> native<00:02:37.160> first<00:02:37.310> but

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
look at that other was native first but

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.680 
look at that other was native first but
it<00:02:37.550> was<00:02:37.670> RC<00:02:37.970> car<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.560> was<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:40.510> 17<00:02:41.510> kill

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
it was RC car so that was a 17 kill

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.180 
it was RC car so that was a 17 kill
streak<00:02:42.019> or<00:02:42.170> more<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:44.470> i<00:02:45.470> get<00:02:45.620> my<00:02:45.739> care<00:02:45.980> package

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
good start to a new account I was

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.839 
good start to a new account I was
ecstatic<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:51.650> next<00:02:52.010> three<00:02:52.340> or<00:02:52.400> four<00:02:52.610> games

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
ecstatic the next three or four games

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.920 
ecstatic the next three or four games
were<00:02:53.120> very<00:02:54.110> very<00:02:54.680> similar<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.720> though<00:02:56.720> most

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
were very very similar to it though most

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.449 
were very very similar to it though most
of<00:02:57.019> my<00:02:57.110> games<00:02:57.170> usually<00:02:57.530> won't<00:02:57.799> only<00:02:58.069> end<00:02:58.340> up

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
of my games usually won't only end up

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.569 
of my games usually won't only end up
with<00:02:58.640> maybe<00:02:58.880> 13<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.630> 15<00:02:59.780> kills<00:03:00.319> which<00:03:01.250> isn't

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
with maybe 13 to 15 kills which isn't

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.720 
with maybe 13 to 15 kills which isn't
too<00:03:01.700> bad<00:03:01.849> for<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.150> team<00:03:02.420> deathmatch<00:03:02.810> King

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
too bad for a team deathmatch King

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.199 
too bad for a team deathmatch King
especially<00:03:04.730> when<00:03:04.849> you're<00:03:05.030> playing

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
especially when you're playing

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.680 
especially when you're playing
consciously<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:07.150> might<00:03:08.150> do<00:03:08.329> some<00:03:08.510> more

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
consciously I might do some more

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.680 
consciously I might do some more
aggressive<00:03:09.590> game<00:03:09.769> play<00:03:09.980> later<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.760> objective

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
aggressive game play later and objective

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.400 
aggressive game play later and objective
based<00:03:11.900> games<00:03:12.260> but<00:03:12.920> don't<00:03:13.489> expect<00:03:13.579> too<00:03:14.000> much

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
based games but don't expect too much

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.960 
based games but don't expect too much
and<00:03:15.410> as<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.040> see<00:03:16.250> here<00:03:16.370> they<00:03:16.489> start<00:03:16.700> spawning

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
and as you see here they start spawning

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.300 
and as you see here they start spawning
behind<00:03:17.420> us<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:18.410> actually<00:03:18.560> fall<00:03:18.920> off<00:03:19.040> cliffs

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
behind us and I actually fall off cliffs

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.460 
behind us and I actually fall off cliffs
so<00:03:19.489> so<00:03:19.670> far<00:03:19.850> two<00:03:20.150> deaths<00:03:20.359> one<00:03:21.079> of<00:03:21.200> them<00:03:21.290> me
