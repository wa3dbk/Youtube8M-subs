00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
there again I'm not sure what exactly it

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.120 
there again I'm not sure what exactly it
does<00:04:36.600> but<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.380> sounds<00:04:37.710> like<00:04:37.740> it's<00:04:37.980> probably

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
does but it sounds like it's probably

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.850 
does but it sounds like it's probably
gonna<00:04:38.400> be<00:04:38.610> pretty<00:04:38.640> cool<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.530> if<00:04:40.530> you<00:04:40.710> know

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860
