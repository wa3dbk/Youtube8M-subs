played on the perimeter that much but
I've<00:01:35.770> been<00:01:36.220> really<00:01:36.610> shocked<00:01:36.940> by<00:01:37.179> what<00:01:37.899> how<00:01:38.410> his

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
I've been really shocked by what how his

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.070 
I've been really shocked by what how his
ball<00:01:38.770> skills<00:01:38.950> have<00:01:39.310> been<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:39.840> thought<00:01:40.840> they'd

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
ball skills have been I thought they'd

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.440 
ball skills have been I thought they'd
be<00:01:41.740> behind<00:01:42.160> little<00:01:42.820> bit<00:01:42.970> he's<00:01:43.060> behind<00:01:43.270> him

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
be behind little bit he's behind him

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.210 
be behind little bit he's behind him
about<00:01:43.600> running<00:01:43.960> but<00:01:44.140> he's<00:01:44.350> not<00:01:44.470> behind<00:01:44.800> him<00:01:45.009> in

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
about running but he's not behind him in

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.260 
about running but he's not behind him in
speed<00:01:46.179> and<00:01:46.800> I<00:01:47.800> think<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.550> big<00:01:48.759> thing<00:01:48.789> coming

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
speed and I think the big thing coming

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.060 
speed and I think the big thing coming
out<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.420> this<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:49.810> that<00:01:49.840> our<00:01:50.229> depth<00:01:50.500> on<00:01:50.679> special

the<00:02:37.950> day<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:40.520> mixing<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.640> matching<00:02:41.790> them

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
the day and mixing and matching them

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.910 
the day and mixing and matching them
with<00:02:42.150> others<00:02:42.990> different<00:02:43.320> receiver<00:02:43.620> so

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
with others different receiver so

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.670 
with others different receiver so
they're<00:02:44.610> getting<00:02:44.880> plenty<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.590> plenty<00:02:46.590> of

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
they're getting plenty of plenty of

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.990 
they're getting plenty of plenty of
turns<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.100> think<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> biggest<00:02:47.580> thing<00:02:47.760> we've

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
turns I think the biggest thing we've

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.850 
turns I think the biggest thing we've
done<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.270> increased<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.200> number<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.500> team

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
done is increased the number of team

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.290 
done is increased the number of team
plays<00:02:50.250> at<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:51.600> end<00:02:51.930> in

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
plays at the end in

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.080 
plays at the end in
which<00:02:54.140> because<00:02:54.710> we<00:02:54.860> have<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.280> lot<00:02:55.370> more<00:02:55.730> numbers

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
which because we have a lot more numbers

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.710 
which because we have a lot more numbers
than<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.450> evaluate<00:02:56.990> across<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.070> board<00:02:58.310> in<00:02:58.720> and

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
than to evaluate across the board in and

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.680 
than to evaluate across the board in and
get<00:02:59.900> our<00:03:00.020> quarterbacks<00:03:00.470> more<00:03:00.680> reps<00:03:00.950> so

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
get our quarterbacks more reps so

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.000 
get our quarterbacks more reps so
they've<00:03:02.690> all<00:03:02.870> they've<00:03:03.170> all<00:03:03.320> looked<00:03:03.560> pretty

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
they've all they've all looked pretty

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.760 
they've all they've all looked pretty
good<00:03:04.190> they<00:03:04.310> all<00:03:04.460> had<00:03:04.610> their<00:03:04.640> moments<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.300> know

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
good they all had their moments you know

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.350 
good they all had their moments you know
Kenny's<00:03:06.770> probably<00:03:07.250> going<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.090> be<00:03:08.180> the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
Kenny's probably going to be the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.430 
Kenny's probably going to be the
furthest<00:03:08.960> behind<00:03:09.110> as<00:03:09.590> we<00:03:09.740> move<00:03:09.950> further<00:03:10.190> move

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
furthest behind as we move further move

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.320 
furthest behind as we move further move
move<00:03:12.440> forward<00:03:12.980> this<00:03:13.130> week<00:03:13.460> because<00:03:13.850> of<00:03:14.090> all

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
move forward this week because of all

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.450 
move forward this week because of all
the<00:03:14.420> stuff<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:14.690> coach<00:03:15.440> Snyder<00:03:15.680> does<00:03:16.040> and

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
the stuff that coach Snyder does and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.130 
the stuff that coach Snyder does and
apparently<00:03:16.820> he<00:03:17.330> doesn't<00:03:17.570> give<00:03:17.750> us<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.960> chance

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
apparently he doesn't give us a chance

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.280 
apparently he doesn't give us a chance
to<00:03:18.320> go<00:03:19.010> undercover<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:20.150> single<00:03:21.080> safety

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
to go undercover to and single safety

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.630 
to go undercover to and single safety
because<00:03:21.800> there's<00:03:21.950> guys<00:03:22.130> coming<00:03:22.520> from

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
because there's guys coming from

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.670 
because there's guys coming from
everywhere<00:03:22.940> but<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:23.990> that's<00:03:24.140> good<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.560> bad

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
everywhere but that that's good and bad

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.140 
everywhere but that that's good and bad
to<00:03:24.830> that<00:03:24.950> but<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.190> think<00:03:25.430> he's<00:03:25.730> handling<00:03:26.090> it

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
to that but I think he's handling it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.470 
to that but I think he's handling it
pretty<00:03:26.390> well<00:03:26.540> all<00:03:27.080> those<00:03:27.290> guys
