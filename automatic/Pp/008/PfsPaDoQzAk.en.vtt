00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.970
 a greeting to all the friends of the corner 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.250
 We welcome you in informatics 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.230
 this new video as you already read from 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.009
 title in this video I will give you gods 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.890
 opinions concerning the elemental kernel 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.249
 csen why the question that many of you 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.249
 they make me is a comparison between the kernel 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:44.249
 elemental hicks and the kernel kernel 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:46.409
 phantom ask me certain questions and 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:49.469
 they asked me and to enclose everyone 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:51.629
 the pros and cons of these kernels therefore 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.489
 I decided to make a video dedicated only 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.159
 to this this video practically one 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.829
 review of this kernel so I can 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:02.010
 I'll start by talking to you more 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.070
 on my experience of use and on 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.650
 what the official developer that 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.920
 found on xda I leave links in 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.680
 description in his forum that opened up 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.070
 xda to let you read in detail the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.410
 features of this kernel do not 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.330
 take my impressions as one 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.340
 what seriously because in my opinion the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.320
 best use and the best 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.740
 experience must be precisely the user 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.770
 same to have it then try it not 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.610
 it costs nothing and so you can jump into 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.200
 this adventure, however, we come to the point 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.030
 based also on what he said 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.010
 developer according to him also a lot 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.590
 easy to install ok as any 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.620
 kernel is installed directly from 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.990
 recovery has good support for the 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.150
 multi rom as you know the applications 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.580
 multi rom that allows you to start many 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.260
 rom on the same device this 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.100
 meat is compatible with the application 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.220
 to the two main functions they are 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.250
 fundamentals that many of you will use 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.500
 which are the wake switch and the double tap 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.539
 to wake then double tap on 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.340
 screen when in stand by to activate it 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.390
 it's a swipe 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.250
 from right to left on the touch keys 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.489
 of the nexus and later we will also arrive at 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.950
 battery compartment on these two 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.650
 work by continuing to talk about the 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.720
 kernel the developer boasts of this 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.220
 kerr in the selection of frequencies 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.580
 independent for each core 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.799
 I think every kernel can do it 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.379
 great as the mud kernel for each 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.080
 core you can select a failure 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.420
 frequency of giger you can choose 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.739
 even the minimum automatic voltage 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.260
 there are no problems 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.090
 the maximum overclocking frequency e 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.180
 now we come to optimization 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.030
 of the battery this is a point that a 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.220
 many of you are interested and we begin a 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.670
 talk about using this kernel 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.620
 concerning the battery 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.890
 then conley two functions activated 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.250
 then from nice tap on wayne to sleep 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.239
 practically wake the developer 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.900
 ensures battery consumption of the 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.090
 0.5 percent so a minimal thing to be 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.959
 as I have tried it activating only 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.019
 these two functions with nothing else 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:28.470
 active the kernel is absolutely true 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.799
 consumption almost nothing however usually me 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.959
 along with these two functions 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.870
 I also leave the phone overclocked by 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.919
 usually with this kernel I leave it at 2.7 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.769
 giger and I don't mind that 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:46.019
 battery consumption because I want 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.120
 make the most of this phone 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.970
 even if I carry around one 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.489
 external battery then charging too 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.590
 the phone outside the home so I don't have 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.519
 problems, however, many of you wonder 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.139
 if it consumes from how I tried it the 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.209
 kernel consumes almost nothing with 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.549
 these two functions activated 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.470
 if you then add overclocking and stuff 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.030
 various then begins to weigh down 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.150
 a little battery 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.549
 I have the elemental hicks kernel combo 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.950
 shine on the move and I can say that I am 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.229
 I find many well try various 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.180
 combinations for example there are those who use the 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.009
 cleaned with 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.259
 iic if he says a bomb is found 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:28.050
 hopping it to you to decide 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.520
 an advice that I give you do not look at 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.820
 that's what 's in the video because I am 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.690
 stop at kernel version 0.23 you 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.310
 keep updating it on the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.130
 official developer because he comes 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.220
 improved a lot I had gods 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.009
 problems so I'm still stuck at one 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.930
 a somewhat old-fashioned version another thing 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.910
 which the developer says about this 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.139
 kernel which according to him is a point of 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.690
 force is that the kernel is not manageable 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.720
 with second-party applications according to 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.270
 he manage the kernel from an application 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.699
 downloadable for him a little space 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.310
 for me it's a very uncomfortable thing because 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.289
 if you need to set the kernel every time 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.570
 you have to install it and during the 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.630
 you will need an installation procedure 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.370
 enter all your settings and settings 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.590
 your options 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.660
 the developer does not say that none 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.470
 application can manage the kernel le 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.750
 normal applications that provide for 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.419
 handle any kernel can 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.820
 however manage it however they allow one 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.340
 very superficial management of the whole 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.979
 potential that the kernel does not 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.229
 you can go to perform the functions 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.840
 main on this dog then the normals 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:45.150
 kernel setup applications you can 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.690
 for example I do n't know how to set the 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.169
 frequency and various things though if you have to 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:55.280
 work in it and use settings 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:58.409
 you have to do it every time 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.270
 set it from the kernel installation 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.909
 one last thing in conclusion I want 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.669
 advise you of the channels that I have recently 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:08.820
 started sponsoring them so to speak 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:11.430
 a channel avoids android that deals 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.330
 especially also the nexus 5 and are 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:18.479
 they are also very good on this device 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.190
 emg electronics that is really very good 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.409
 on programming in general and 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.539
 especially on microcontrollers such as 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:26.430
 arduino if you share the same 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.430
 passion I leave the link in the 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.650
 description of the 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.600
 so that you can go and watch the 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.190
 their video then for this video and 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.810
 see you all next video 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.620
 always here on the corner channel 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.620
