00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.220 

so<00:00:00.329> here's<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:01.190> final<00:00:02.190> render<00:00:03.030> let's<00:00:03.929> jump

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
so here's the final render let's jump

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.380 
so here's the final render let's jump
right<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.500> compositing<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.460> see<00:00:05.790> how<00:00:06.330> to

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
right to compositing and see how to

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.709 
right to compositing and see how to
whole<00:00:06.690> thing<00:00:06.930> works<00:00:07.940> first<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.179> all<00:00:09.420> this

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
whole thing works first of all this

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.220 
whole thing works first of all this
whole<00:00:10.050> part<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.769> added<00:00:11.250> sort<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.849> mask<00:00:12.300> but<00:00:12.960> we

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
whole part I added sort of a mask but we

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.040 
whole part I added sort of a mask but we
won't<00:00:13.530> need<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:15.199> let's<00:00:16.199> open<00:00:16.410> up<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.980> glow

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
won't need this let's open up the glow

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.429 
won't need this let's open up the glow
let's<00:00:19.050> take<00:00:20.060> note<00:00:21.060> if<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.390> were<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.199> see

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
let's take note if you were and see

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.109 
let's take note if you were and see
what's<00:00:22.619> going<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.160> because<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.519> haven't<00:00:23.760> seen

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
what's going on because I haven't seen

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.500 
what's going on because I haven't seen
this<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.570> while<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.580> okay<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.609> first<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.240> all

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
this in a while so okay so first of all

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.130 
this in a while so okay so first of all
we<00:00:28.380> are<00:00:28.590> isolating<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.970> filament<00:00:30.539> because

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
we are isolating the filament because

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.690 
we are isolating the filament because
this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.610> where<00:00:32.610> our<00:00:32.910> glow<00:00:33.510> will<00:00:33.930> start<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> I

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
this is where our glow will start so I

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.470 
this is where our glow will start so I
see<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.090> there's<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:37.489> artifacts<00:00:38.489> here<00:00:39.059> so

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
see that there's some artifacts here so

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.500 
see that there's some artifacts here so
this<00:00:39.840> will<00:00:40.050> also<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.730> amplified<00:00:41.730> quite<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> bit

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
this will also be amplified quite a bit

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.630 
this will also be amplified quite a bit
as<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:43.469> go<00:00:43.710> down<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.940> node<00:00:45.149> network<00:00:46.430> but<00:00:47.430> let's

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
as we go down the node network but let's

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880 
as we go down the node network but let's
see<00:00:47.820> what's<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.660> okay

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
see what's going on here okay

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.979 
see what's going on here okay
so<00:00:50.219> first<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.700> we're<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.570> ting<00:00:51.780> this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
so first of all we're all a ting this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.779 
so first of all we're all a ting this
and<00:00:52.260> then<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.550> are<00:00:53.879> also<00:00:54.829> doing<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.100> same<00:00:56.129> here

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and then we are also doing the same here

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.380 
and then we are also doing the same here
but<00:00:57.000> we're<00:00:57.210> taking<00:00:57.570> more<00:00:58.640> elements<00:00:59.640> I'm

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
but we're taking more elements I'm

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.260 
but we're taking more elements I'm
wondering<00:01:00.870> if<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.440> actually<00:01:02.010> useful

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
wondering if this is actually useful

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.880 
wondering if this is actually useful
because<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.049> keep<00:01:04.229> working<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
because as you as you keep working you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.250 
because as you as you keep working you
tend<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> forget<00:01:05.729> what's<00:01:06.000> happening<00:01:06.570> before

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
tend to forget what's happening before

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.440 
tend to forget what's happening before
especially<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.430> add<00:01:08.580> lots<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.090> elements

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
especially if you add lots of elements

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.530 
especially if you add lots of elements
but<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:10.439> fine<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.070> we're<00:01:11.610> splitting<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
but that's fine so we're splitting the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.469 
but that's fine so we're splitting the
network<00:01:13.260> into<00:01:13.590> two<00:01:13.740> branches<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.580> upper

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
network into two branches the upper

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.380 
network into two branches the upper
branches<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> inner<00:01:17.150> filament<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
branches for the inner filament and the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.429 
branches for the inner filament and the
lower<00:01:19.020> branches<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.890> some<00:01:20.130> extra<00:01:20.759> punch<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
lower branches for some extra punch to

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.830 
lower branches for some extra punch to
the<00:01:22.680> glow<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.930> we're<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.290> blurring<00:01:25.740> this

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
the glow so we're then blurring this

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.170 
the glow so we're then blurring this
upper<00:01:27.840> filament<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.880> normalizing<00:01:29.880> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
upper filament and normalizing it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.690 
upper filament and normalizing it
because<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.500> take<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> look<00:01:31.920> down<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
because if you take a look down in the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.840 
because if you take a look down in the
lower<00:01:33.180> right<00:01:33.689> corner<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.710> sector<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
lower right corner of this sector if I

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.569 
lower right corner of this sector if I
click<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.630> get<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.990> value<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.040> towards<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
click you get the value so towards the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.670 
click you get the value so towards the
center<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.329> value<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.810> about<00:01:40.020> two<00:01:40.380> or

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
center we have a value of about two or

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.330 
center we have a value of about two or
so<00:01:41.119> which<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.299> bit<00:01:42.479> too<00:01:42.630> much<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.619> we're

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
so which is a bit too much so we're

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.280 
so which is a bit too much so we're
normalizing<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:45.780> means<00:01:46.049> we're

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
normalizing it which means we're

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.010 
normalizing it which means we're
bringing<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> between<00:01:47.040> zero<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
bringing it between zero and one it's a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.819 
bringing it between zero and one it's a
bit<00:01:49.170> duller<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:50.040> no<00:01:50.640> value<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:52.110> render

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
bit duller but no value on the render

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.929 
bit duller but no value on the render
goes<00:01:53.280> beyond<00:01:53.869> one<00:01:54.869> at<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.409> point<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.070> then

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
goes beyond one at this point and then

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.810 
goes beyond one at this point and then
we'll<00:01:57.210> add<00:01:57.509> some<00:01:57.590> glare<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:59.520> would<00:01:59.700> be

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
we'll add some glare this would be

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.020 
we'll add some glare this would be
pretty<00:02:00.030> intense<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.500> using<00:02:02.310> streaks

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
pretty intense I think using streaks

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.899 
pretty intense I think using streaks
here<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:04.200> sort<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.500> creates<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.189> first<00:02:05.490> layer

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
here this sort of creates a first layer

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.740 
here this sort of creates a first layer
of<00:02:06.469> glare<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:08.399> then<00:02:08.720> increase<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
of glare and we then increase the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.800 
of glare and we then increase the
brightness<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.560> little<00:02:10.590> bit<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.480> second<00:02:12.480> branch

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
brightness a little bit a second branch

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.940 
brightness a little bit a second branch
we're<00:02:13.200> doing<00:02:13.440> pretty<00:02:13.650> much

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
we're doing pretty much

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.160 
we're doing pretty much
same<00:02:14.310> we're<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.910> blurring<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.569> little<00:02:15.840> more

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
same we're just blurring a little more

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.780 
same we're just blurring a little more
and<00:02:16.500> we're<00:02:18.349> normalizing<00:02:19.349> after<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.400> glare

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
and we're normalizing after the glare

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.509 
and we're normalizing after the glare
and<00:02:21.530> then<00:02:22.530> we<00:02:22.739> make<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.099> a<00:02:23.160> little<00:02:23.310> brighter

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
and then we make it a little brighter

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.309 
and then we make it a little brighter
and<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.540> our<00:02:24.690> second<00:02:26.390> part<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.810> note

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
and we have our second part of the note

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.550 
and we have our second part of the note
we<00:02:28.860> add<00:02:29.160> them<00:02:29.730> together<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:31.110> obtain<00:02:31.530> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
we add them together so we obtain a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.080 
we add them together so we obtain a
final<00:02:32.150> first<00:02:33.150> pass<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.530> glare<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.819> will

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
final first pass of the glare this will

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.699 
final first pass of the glare this will
be<00:02:36.360> added<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:37.230> our<00:02:37.560> image<00:02:38.599> but<00:02:39.599> not<00:02:39.780> as<00:02:40.049> is<00:02:40.349> I

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
be added to our image but not as is I

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.250 
be added to our image but not as is I
think<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:41.400> toned<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.450> down<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.720> little<00:02:42.930> bit

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
think I toned it down a little bit

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.080 
think I toned it down a little bit
okay<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.099> we're<00:02:44.730> out<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.239> this<00:02:45.480> node<00:02:45.840> now<00:02:47.090> we

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
okay so we're out of this node now we

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.600 
okay so we're out of this node now we
are<00:02:48.360> adding<00:02:49.049> this<00:02:49.500> node<00:02:49.799> with<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.160> factor<00:02:50.580> of

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
are adding this node with a factor of

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.720 
are adding this node with a factor of
0.45<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:52.019> actually<00:02:52.500> not<00:02:52.680> all<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.340> but

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
0.45 so actually not all of this but

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.039 
0.45 so actually not all of this but
about<00:02:53.940> 50%<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.049> bit<00:02:55.200> less<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.790> what<00:02:57.120> we<00:02:57.360> have<00:02:57.660> now

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
about 50% a bit less so what we have now

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.839 
about 50% a bit less so what we have now
we<00:02:58.620> can<00:03:00.110> have<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.140> new<00:03:01.410> viewer<00:03:01.739> here<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.489> we<00:03:02.640> see

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
we can have a new viewer here so we see

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.900 
we can have a new viewer here so we see
what's<00:03:03.060> going<00:03:03.390> on<00:03:03.599> okay<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.560> we're<00:03:05.010> adding<00:03:05.220> the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
what's going on okay so we're adding the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.569 
what's going on okay so we're adding the
final<00:03:06.480> result<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:07.709> already<00:03:07.829> have<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> pretty

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
final result so we already have a pretty

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.830 
final result so we already have a pretty
interesting<00:03:08.970> effect<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:10.340> then<00:03:11.340> we<00:03:11.940> take<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
interesting effect and then we take the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.770 
interesting effect and then we take the
blurred<00:03:13.200> version<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:14.010> then<00:03:14.519> we<00:03:14.849> mix<00:03:15.239> them

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
blurred version and then we mix them

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.379 
blurred version and then we mix them
together<00:03:16.049> so<00:03:17.010> we<00:03:17.220> have<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.459> slightly<00:03:17.940> blurred

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
together so we have a slightly blurred

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.059 
together so we have a slightly blurred
version<00:03:19.220> mixed<00:03:20.220> with<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.819> final<00:03:21.269> render<00:03:22.069> 15%

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
version mixed with the final render 15%

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.090 
version mixed with the final render 15%
and<00:03:23.310> then<00:03:24.739> we<00:03:25.739> will<00:03:26.130> have<00:03:26.579> our<00:03:26.880> final

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
and then we will have our final

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.460 
and then we will have our final
correction<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.310> made<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.180> little<00:03:30.209> darker<00:03:30.959> in

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
correction I made it a little darker in

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.360 
correction I made it a little darker in
the<00:03:31.680> dark<00:03:31.950> parts<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.609> we<00:03:33.239> have<00:03:33.480> our<00:03:33.750> final

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
the dark parts and we have our final

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.640 
the dark parts and we have our final
render

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
render

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.960 
render
overall<00:03:37.610> I<00:03:37.940> think<00:03:38.000> it's<00:03:38.470> pretty<00:03:39.470> decent<00:03:39.970> the

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
overall I think it's pretty decent the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.699 
overall I think it's pretty decent the
lower<00:03:41.480> part<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:42.019> perhaps<00:03:42.200> a<00:03:42.500> bit<00:03:42.680> too

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
lower part is perhaps a bit too

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.059 
lower part is perhaps a bit too
reflective<00:03:43.129> and<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.450> inner<00:03:44.930> holder<00:03:45.379> is<00:03:45.650> a

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
reflective and the inner holder is a

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.820 
reflective and the inner holder is a
little<00:03:46.549> too<00:03:46.730> dull<00:03:47.000> for<00:03:47.420> my<00:03:47.659> for<00:03:48.019> my<00:03:48.049> taste<00:03:48.500> I

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
little too dull for my for my taste I

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.660 
little too dull for my for my taste I
had<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.580> add<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:50.180> bit<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.450> diffuse<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.950> bit<00:03:52.489> of<00:03:52.580> a

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
had to add a bit of diffuse a bit of a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.160 
had to add a bit of diffuse a bit of a
diffused<00:03:53.030> component<00:03:53.599> because<00:03:53.870> otherwise

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
diffused component because otherwise

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.210 
diffused component because otherwise
these<00:03:55.209> reflections<00:03:56.209> wouldn't<00:03:57.049> be<00:03:57.500> visible<00:03:57.739> at

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
these reflections wouldn't be visible at

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.580 
these reflections wouldn't be visible at
all<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:58.849> you<00:03:59.329> want<00:03:59.599> to<00:03:59.810> have<00:04:00.019> of<00:04:00.319> course

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
all and you want to have of course

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.030 
all and you want to have of course
anything<00:04:01.069> that's<00:04:01.370> very<00:04:01.849> close<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.510> bright

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
anything that's very close to a bright

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.860 
anything that's very close to a bright
light<00:04:04.040> source<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:05.180> have<00:04:05.329> to<00:04:05.480> have<00:04:05.659> some

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
light source you have to have some

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.530 
light source you have to have some
reflections<00:04:06.700> also<00:04:07.700> an<00:04:07.760> important<00:04:08.150> part<00:04:08.329> in

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
reflections also an important part in

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.210 
reflections also an important part in
the<00:04:08.690> render<00:04:09.019> in<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.340> sampling<00:04:10.879> tab<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:12.220> clamped

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
the render in the sampling tab I clamped

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.810 
the render in the sampling tab I clamped
the<00:04:13.519> maximum<00:04:14.209> value<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:14.780> 25<00:04:15.410> if<00:04:15.980> you<00:04:16.220> don't<00:04:16.549> you

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
the maximum value to 25 if you don't you

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.529 
the maximum value to 25 if you don't you
have<00:04:17.090> bright<00:04:17.389> spots<00:04:17.840> all<00:04:18.079> over<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.560> place<00:04:18.799> and

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
have bright spots all over the place and

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.060 
have bright spots all over the place and
also<00:04:20.539> the<00:04:20.720> higher<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.260> go<00:04:21.500> with<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:21.739> clamp

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
also the higher you go with a clamp

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.790 
also the higher you go with a clamp
value<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:23.150> more<00:04:23.389> realistic<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:24.169> get<00:04:24.380> because

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
value the more realistic you get because

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.980 
value the more realistic you get because
you<00:04:24.919> have<00:04:25.160> these<00:04:25.430> very<00:04:25.910> bright<00:04:26.180> reflections

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
you have these very bright reflections

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.290 
you have these very bright reflections
and<00:04:27.289> transmissions<00:04:28.250> inside<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.090> glass

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
and transmissions inside of the glass

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.469 
and transmissions inside of the glass
but<00:04:29.930> if<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:30.860> overdo<00:04:31.340> it<00:04:31.370> you'll<00:04:31.729> need<00:04:31.970> really

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
but if you overdo it you'll need really

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.189 
but if you overdo it you'll need really
lots<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:33.020> samples<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:34.510> merge<00:04:35.510> them<00:04:35.870> well

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
lots of samples to merge them well

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.909 
lots of samples to merge them well
together<00:04:36.580> in<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.850> in<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.120> final<00:04:38.479> render<00:04:38.919> it's

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
together in the in the final render it's

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.830 
together in the in the final render it's
also<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:40.460> bit<00:04:40.669> noisy

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
also a bit noisy

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.120 
also a bit noisy
I<00:04:41.979> used<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.310> final<00:04:43.960> preset<00:04:44.960> here<00:04:45.349> so<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.860> has<00:04:46.099> a

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
I used the final preset here so it has a

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.540 
I used the final preset here so it has a
total<00:04:47.770> 536<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.070> I<00:04:49.760> earliest<00:04:50.450> samples<00:04:51.340> you<00:04:52.340> can

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
total 536 and I earliest samples you can
