other specifications on it a 5.7 inch
display<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.780> resolution<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.870> only<00:02:29.110> going

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
display and the resolution is only going

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.730 
display and the resolution is only going
to<00:02:29.320> be<00:02:29.440> 1280<00:02:29.920> by<00:02:30.190> 720<00:02:31.170> but<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.260> will<00:02:32.410> have<00:02:32.560> two

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740

I<00:02:35.050> think<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.950> all<00:02:36.190> new<00:02:36.400> smartphones<00:02:37.000> if<00:02:37.180> they

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
I think that all new smartphones if they

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.240 
I think that all new smartphones if they
want<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.660> be<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:38.320> know<00:02:38.440> in<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.770> market

be six point nine millimeters thick
which<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.610> pretty<00:02:58.180> great<00:02:58.510> now<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.650> don't

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
which is pretty great now I don't

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.280 
which is pretty great now I don't
understand<00:03:00.220> on<00:03:00.370> how<00:03:00.520> they're<00:03:00.670> going<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:00.880> get<00:03:01.030> a

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
understand on how they're going to get a

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.270 
understand on how they're going to get a
110<00:03:02.290> crams<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:04.120> is<00:03:04.360> very<00:03:05.050> very<00:03:05.170> very<00:03:05.980> light

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
110 crams that is very very very light

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.470 
110 crams that is very very very light
and<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:08.620> would<00:03:08.800> get<00:03:09.700> me<00:03:09.730> thinking<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.390> the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
and that would get me thinking that the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.410 
and that would get me thinking that the
battery<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.870> not<00:03:11.050> going<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.230> be<00:03:11.350> that<00:03:11.380> large

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
battery is not going to be that large

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.140 
battery is not going to be that large
all<00:03:13.420> right<00:03:14.220> well<00:03:15.220> that's<00:03:15.340> all<00:03:15.490> I<00:03:15.610> got<00:03:15.760> about

to be 4.3 inch display but only 720p so

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.820 
to be 4.3 inch display but only 720p so
I<00:04:47.740> mean<00:04:48.220> technically<00:04:48.669> it<00:04:48.910> is<00:04:49.150> HD<00:04:49.570> but<00:04:50.199> not<00:04:50.349> 1080

I mean technically it is HD but not 1080

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.080 
I mean technically it is HD but not 1080
HD<00:04:51.389> they're<00:04:52.389> saying<00:04:52.630> that<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:54.060> processor<00:04:55.060> is

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
HD they're saying that the processor is

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.260 
HD they're saying that the processor is
going<00:04:55.419> to<00:04:55.509> be<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.690> Snapdragon<00:04:56.289> 400<00:04:56.919> processor

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
going to be the Snapdragon 400 processor

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.219 
going to be the Snapdragon 400 processor
which<00:04:58.270> again<00:04:58.690> is<00:04:58.930> a<00:05:00.419> dual-core<00:05:01.419> processor<00:05:02.110> it

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
which again is a dual-core processor it

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.540 
which again is a dual-core processor it
is<00:05:02.349> not<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:02.919> quad-core<00:05:03.750> processor<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:04.990> it<00:05:05.680> is<00:05:06.310> a

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
is not a quad-core processor and it is a

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.270 
is not a quad-core processor and it is a
1<00:05:06.639> point<00:05:07.270> 4<00:05:07.570> gigahertz<00:05:07.960> dual-core<00:05:08.349> processor

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
1 point 4 gigahertz dual-core processor

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.450 
1 point 4 gigahertz dual-core processor
okay<00:05:10.060> I<00:05:10.270> guess<00:05:10.900> that's<00:05:11.110> not<00:05:11.229> bad<00:05:11.470> for<00:05:11.710> a<00:05:11.740> 4.3

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
okay I guess that's not bad for a 4.3

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.249 
okay I guess that's not bad for a 4.3
inch<00:05:12.610> display<00:05:13.000> for<00:05:13.240> a<00:05:13.270> mid-range<00:05:13.690> smartphone

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
all I have to say is when this thing

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.149 
all I have to say is when this thing
does<00:05:16.900> come<00:05:17.110> out<00:05:17.229> it<00:05:17.470> better<00:05:17.680> not<00:05:17.830> be<00:05:17.889> that

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
does come out it better not be that

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.100 
does come out it better not be that
expensive<00:05:18.430> considering<00:05:19.360> that<00:05:19.630> you<00:05:19.840> can<00:05:19.990> get

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
expensive considering that you can get

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.469 
expensive considering that you can get
the<00:05:20.260> 14<00:05:20.740> 199<00:05:21.190> with<00:05:21.610> contract<00:05:22.570> I<00:05:24.389> don't<00:05:25.389> know<00:05:25.449> I

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.040 
the 14 199 with contract I don't know I
guess<00:05:26.669> you<00:05:27.669> have<00:05:27.880> to<00:05:27.909> put<00:05:28.240> out<00:05:28.360> a<00:05:28.389> mid-range

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
guess you have to put out a mid-range

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.899 
guess you have to put out a mid-range

you're<00:06:13.479> using<00:06:13.960> it<00:06:14.229> a<00:06:14.320> lot<00:06:14.349> when<00:06:15.070> I<00:06:15.130> did<00:06:15.430> the

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
you're using it a lot when I did the

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.450 
you're using it a lot when I did the
benchmark<00:06:17.199> tests<00:06:17.560> I<00:06:17.650> actually<00:06:17.830> got<00:06:18.159> that<00:06:18.340> up

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
benchmark tests I actually got that up

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.879 
benchmark tests I actually got that up
to<00:06:18.580> 125<00:06:19.389> degrees<00:06:19.930> so<00:06:20.229> you<00:06:20.289> have<00:06:20.500> to<00:06:20.590> be<00:06:20.710> careful

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
to 125 degrees so you have to be careful

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.820 
to 125 degrees so you have to be careful

I apparently<00:06:25.719> was<00:06:25.960> over<00:06:26.770> using<00:06:27.069> it<00:06:27.400> trying<00:06:27.759> to

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
I apparently was over using it trying to

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:29.670 
I apparently was over using it trying to
make<00:06:28.000> it<00:06:28.150> do<00:06:28.389> so<00:06:28.719> many<00:06:28.810> different<00:06:29.020> things<00:06:29.259> and

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
make it do so many different things and

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.920 
make it do so many different things and
the<00:06:29.949> benchmark<00:06:30.400> tests<00:06:30.759> do<00:06:31.419> work<00:06:31.689> your

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
the benchmark tests do work your

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.029 
the benchmark tests do work your
