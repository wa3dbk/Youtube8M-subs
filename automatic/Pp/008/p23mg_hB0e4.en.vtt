 here it comes out 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.390
 at the end of the chain 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.259
 and the reason for this smell 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.300
 there she is

 with which the gelatin is made to increase the proportion 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.720
 while pork skin arriving by whole pallets in its factory 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.410
 a raw material that costs him almost nothing 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.800
 and every day 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.720
 nearly 150 tons of plums reach

 3 these 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.450
 is 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.450
 then learn to choose between a bold ground 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.160
 marking a man in a hurry 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.210
 foam the evenings in a row 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.560
 this is a fly this bearish movement 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.740
 let's look at the gelatin 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.090
 at the origin of the product 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.440
 he said to be willing to originate gelatin why 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.190
 this one does not wait to see what's the problem the season with the club

 the Jewish Muslim community and others 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.190
 with the problem launch with that 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.400
 and it would be disappointing when watering the word given everyone

 the solution 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.220
 it is true that good 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 because suddenly it passed from the port of barcelona to apply
