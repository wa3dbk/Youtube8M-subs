 July time August September Great 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.210
 production in the south near Lima to the 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.080
 important hand to buy them tender are 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.400
 juicy sweets 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.119
 sometimes very tender 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.480
 like these that are well done 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.870

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.930
 mature hard corks look for you 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.040
 Super tender as we are going to do us 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.829
 you could eat raw in that the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.140
 quietly but let's serve them 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.280
 as an accompaniment to these shrimps 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.910
 I have here some shrimp 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.550
 tarapotinos 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.180
 and we are going to do it with a very 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.770
 simple fast grilled 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.110
 obviously accompanied by our 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.430
 compound butter and this is very 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.019
 fast is a very fast process now 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.730
 what are we going to do let's first season 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.620
 shrimp 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:16.460
 a little bit of salt the script 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.460
 with grated some garlic chopped oil 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.970
 revolts 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.690
 I have my son released him clean 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.920
 we take out the tips that are a bit hard 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.930
 let's put the white part 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.490
 from china we are going to cut as much or less 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.800
 the same size planted to be 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.220
 everything even we will grab a little the 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.220
 such holland 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.970
 We are going to put the Chinese onion there 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.970
 a splash of oil nothing more like 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.640
 that somehow cook evenly in the 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.259
 double flat iron and once the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.259
 poplars because it is a very fast cooking 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.420
 and let's go the first thing we're going to do with 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.420
 thrown on the grill 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.160
 you have to be careful not to burn 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.160
 a little more chinitos 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.030
 as big then it is burning not 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.030
 he fears me good there at the touch 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.909
 we have the shrimp 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.590
 about 14 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.720
 shrimp for this iron 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.879
 How is it? I'm not putting coral 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.310
 here I could also make a butter 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.830
 coral because not like we have done this and 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.459
 put the also and this high that no 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.910
 there is super fast cooking a stream of 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.910
 lemon 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.620
 ready that's what we do hot 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.810
 we remove what I put here where I am going 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.810
 serve I grab my butter 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.970
 Remember that this matter has to be 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.970
 a confit chili pepper 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.040
 and I'm from the hot as it is 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.879
