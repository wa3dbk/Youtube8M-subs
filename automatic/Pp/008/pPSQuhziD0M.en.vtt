deleted<00:01:12.640> that<00:01:12.760> what<00:01:13.600> I'd<00:01:13.720> recommend<00:01:13.900> doing<00:01:14.170> is

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
deleted that what I'd recommend doing is

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.830 
deleted that what I'd recommend doing is
highlighting<00:01:14.770> everything<00:01:15.520> from<00:01:15.729> 1.5.2<00:01:16.540> and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
highlighting everything from 1.5.2 and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.050 
highlighting everything from 1.5.2 and
deleting<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.440> all<00:01:17.650> and<00:01:18.070> then<00:01:18.250> then<00:01:18.820> you<00:01:18.940> can

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
deleting it all and then then you can

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.870 
deleting it all and then then you can
just<00:01:20.220> load<00:01:21.220> other<00:01:21.460> then<00:01:22.119> you<00:01:22.210> can<00:01:22.360> just<00:01:22.680> update

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
important by the way and then you're

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.029 
important by the way and then you're
gonna<00:04:21.250> hit<00:04:21.519> save<00:04:21.820> profile<00:04:22.740> then<00:04:23.740> go<00:04:23.860> to

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
gonna hit save profile then go to

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.570 
gonna hit save profile then go to
profile<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.850> put<00:04:25.300> it<00:04:25.419> at<00:04:25.570> mods<00:04:26.580> otherwise

that<00:04:28.360> was<00:04:28.510> kind<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:29.050> pointless<00:04:29.320> step<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.919> do

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
that was kind of a pointless step to do

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.909 
that was kind of a pointless step to do
on<00:04:30.520> your<00:04:30.699> profile<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.419> then<00:04:32.050> just<00:04:32.410> type<00:04:32.620> in

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
on your profile and then just type in

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:41.900 
on your profile and then just type in
your<00:04:34.110> minecraft<00:04:35.110> account<00:04:36.990> ok<00:04:37.990> then<00:04:38.440> hit<00:04:38.919> play

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.820 

and<00:04:42.910> there's<00:04:43.180> no<00:04:43.300> way<00:04:43.419> to<00:04:43.479> check<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:44.080> mod<00:04:44.620> loader

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
and there's no way to check a mod loader

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.059 
and there's no way to check a mod loader
inside<00:04:45.370> minecraft<00:04:45.819> I<00:04:45.910> don't<00:04:46.090> think<00:04:46.270> but<00:04:47.110> um<00:04:47.289> as

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
inside minecraft I don't think but um as

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.260 
inside minecraft I don't think but um as
you<00:04:48.220> can<00:04:48.250> see<00:04:48.430> it<00:04:48.520> didn't<00:04:48.669> crash<00:04:48.849> so<00:04:49.030> that's<00:04:49.180> a

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
you can see it didn't crash so that's a

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.270 
you can see it didn't crash so that's a
good<00:04:49.360> sign<00:04:49.569> but<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.169> way<00:04:50.319> to<00:04:50.380> check<00:04:50.770> that<00:04:50.830> if

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
good sign but the way to check that if

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.790 
good sign but the way to check that if
there's<00:04:51.460> my<00:04:51.639> Laura<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.539> close<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:52.960> up<00:04:53.080> those

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
there's my Laura and close it up those

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.760 
there's my Laura and close it up those
those<00:04:53.979> up<00:04:54.190> and<00:04:54.789> you<00:04:55.030> just<00:04:55.240> go<00:04:55.440> 2%<00:04:56.440> up<00:04:56.530> data

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
those up and you just go 2% up data

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.640 
those up and you just go 2% up data
percent<00:04:57.370> again<00:04:57.610> dot<00:04:58.000> minecraft<00:04:58.270> and<00:04:58.840> then

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
percent again dot minecraft and then

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.920 
percent again dot minecraft and then
just<00:05:00.220> see<00:05:00.639> that<00:05:00.880> you'll<00:05:01.120> have<00:05:01.180> a<00:05:01.479> mod<00:05:01.750> loader

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
just see that you'll have a mod loader

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.529 
just see that you'll have a mod loader
txt<00:05:02.470> file<00:05:02.680> right<00:05:02.979> there<00:05:03.009> and<00:05:03.430> if<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:04.360> didn't

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
txt file right there and if you didn't

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.050 
txt file right there and if you didn't
crash<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.229> also<00:05:05.710> that's<00:05:06.009> a<00:05:06.130> good<00:05:06.250> they'll<00:05:06.880> so

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
crash and also that's a good they'll so

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.779 
crash and also that's a good they'll so
that<00:05:07.210> means<00:05:07.419> that<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:07.720> do<00:05:07.870> have<00:05:08.020> my<00:05:08.169> loader

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
that means that you do have my loader

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.430 
that means that you do have my loader
