00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.550
 well the match was very very difficult very 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.090
 disputed 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.450
 We know about the quality that it has 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.210
 that has the rival and it was nothing 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.869
 different than what we knew that 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.869
 you could present 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.220
 and good the most important thing is that for 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.150
 we are that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.789
 we scored a goal 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.070
 that we had several opportunities 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.559
 opportunities more than de gaulle it was 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.360
 a part where we have pending 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.720
 continue to follow 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.300
 obviously working the load of 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.210
 parties in liberators added to the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.280
 travels 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.640
 have generated fatigue in several players 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.790
 today we had already planned the change in 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.809
 the 45 minutes of nacho by johnny 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.250
 because they come with a very strong load 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.470
 match the two 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.870
 and today was a risky day for them 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.110
 for all that has been these last 15 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.900
 days 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.170
 so I think that Wednesday so much 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.760
 nacho like me or those who did not come 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.130
 monte rafa 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.750
 boselli will surely get very 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.760
 rested to the party for now I'm not going 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.160
 to open the umbrella to spend anything 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.690
 later but now I'm going 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.730
 the two do not 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.290
 it's good that we have to travel that 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.720
 we have to play here today that the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.380
 Wednesday there is another one that on Saturday another the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.560
 Wednesday other 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.750
 it means that the players have done 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.280
 things very well the last championship 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.100
 as for all this to be 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.710
 simply happening that sometimes good 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.920
 there you have to rest some 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.530
 players and there is no option to choose and the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.960
 what enters is the day that has its chance 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.030
 and you have to show me matosas you 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.799
 is wrong I have to play today 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.500
 we know that with was with this defeat 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.319
 we're going to have to get down in position 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.390
 within the general table but also 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.130
 we still have six games by 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.840
 ahead 67 matches where we have to 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.729
 make a difference here it's about looking 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.959
 the rating independently of 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.980
 tournament of the liberators and 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.110
 pitifully 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.930
 we went in asleep and at a wedding we were 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.340
 They go up on the scoreboard and there is 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.140
 it complicates us a little bit because never 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.720
 they went out to attack 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.700
 but well we do not try unfortunately 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.980
 the objective was not achieved but good 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.420
 we have to keep working we had another 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.660
 more than winning to get us the zone of 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.240
 classification and now what is 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.000
 the goal that was that at times by 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.500
 the subsedes played well had arrival 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.440
 which is important even though I do not 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.590
 I had none so many were created 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.360
 spaces for my colleagues and against a 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.010
 strong rival who plays well who is 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.500
 dangerous has very players 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.350
 important and now there are two final 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.690
 two endings that are two classics and good 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.370
 What better come from a triumph and we know 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.019
 that there is also no other way to win 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.019
 these matches to classify
