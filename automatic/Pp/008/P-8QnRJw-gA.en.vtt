hey guys it's CJ from smart Kate I calm
and<00:00:06.210> in<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.390> video<00:00:06.540> we're<00:00:06.839> going<00:00:06.960> to

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
and in this video we're going to

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.589 
and in this video we're going to
benchmark<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.770> motorola<00:00:08.340> droid<00:00:08.370> bionic<00:00:08.970> from

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.120 
processor and a full gig of ram so let's
see<00:00:18.660> how<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.779> holds<00:00:19.380> up<00:00:19.529> through<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> variety

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
see how that holds up through a variety

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.310 
see how that holds up through a variety
of<00:00:20.369> benchmarks<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.689> first<00:00:21.930> we're<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
of benchmarks so first we're going to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.400 
of benchmarks so first we're going to
run<00:00:22.500> quadrant<00:00:23.689> you<00:00:24.689> guys<00:00:24.869> should<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.230> familiar

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
run quadrant you guys should be familiar

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.529 
run quadrant you guys should be familiar
with<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:26.039> benchmarking<00:00:26.730> utility<00:00:27.240> by<00:00:27.359> now

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
with this benchmarking utility by now

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.240 
with this benchmarking utility by now
and<00:00:29.119> it<00:00:30.119> runs<00:00:30.330> fairly<00:00:30.660> quickly<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.320> we'll<00:00:32.099> let

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
and it runs fairly quickly so we'll let

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.799 
and it runs fairly quickly so we'll let
it<00:00:32.279> run<00:00:32.550> its<00:00:32.579> course<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:33.510> real<00:00:33.809> time<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:35.780> as<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it run its course in real time and as a

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.920 
it run its course in real time and as a
reminder<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.680> always<00:00:38.129> post<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.940> benchmark

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
reminder I always post the benchmark

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.930 
reminder I always post the benchmark
results<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> description<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.790> these

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
results in the description of these

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.799 
results in the description of these
videos<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.730> sure<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.940> skip<00:00:45.270> ahead<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.539> that

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
videos so be sure to skip ahead to that

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.260 
videos so be sure to skip ahead to that
if<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.200> don't<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.530> time<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.129> watch<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:48.030> full

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
if you don't have time to watch the full

00:00:48.270 --> 00:01:01.800 
if you don't have time to watch the full
video

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:10.070 

just<00:01:02.740> about<00:01:02.980> done<00:01:03.310> here<00:01:04.020> last<00:01:05.020> sequence<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
just about done here last sequence and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.830 
just about done here last sequence and
the<00:01:11.080> results<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:13.000> let's<00:01:13.240> see<00:01:13.480> what<00:01:13.510> we<00:01:13.810> have

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
the results so let's see what we have

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.000 
the results so let's see what we have
here<00:01:15.240> zoom<00:01:16.240> in<00:01:16.390> on<00:01:16.510> that<00:01:17.010> looks<00:01:18.010> like<00:01:18.220> we're<00:01:18.430> at

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
here zoom in on that looks like we're at

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.370 
here zoom in on that looks like we're at
2440<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:22.180> sure<00:01:22.360> if<00:01:22.510> you<00:01:22.630> can<00:01:22.780> see<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:23.080> let

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
2440 not sure if you can see that let

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:34.080 
2440 not sure if you can see that let
that<00:01:23.590> focus<00:01:26.970> 2004<00:01:27.970> 44<00:01:29.760> 2440<00:01:31.980> all<00:01:32.980> right<00:01:33.190> not

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
that focus 2004 44 2440 all right not

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.530 
that focus 2004 44 2440 all right not
bad<00:01:34.360> of<00:01:34.660> a<00:01:34.840> score<00:01:35.490> seems<00:01:36.490> pretty<00:01:36.850> similar<00:01:37.360> to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
bad of a score seems pretty similar to

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.070 
bad of a score seems pretty similar to
what<00:01:37.780> we<00:01:37.900> got<00:01:38.140> with<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.760> droid<00:01:39.760> 3<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:40.930> make

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
what we got with the droid 3 to make

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.190 
what we got with the droid 3 to make
sense<00:01:41.350> so<00:01:42.010> let's<00:01:42.220> go<00:01:42.400> back<00:01:42.670> home<00:01:42.940> and<00:01:43.270> then

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
sense so let's go back home and then

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.290 
sense so let's go back home and then
we'll<00:01:44.380> run<00:01:44.590> CF<00:01:45.250> bench<00:01:47.550> now<00:01:48.550> this<00:01:48.700> one<00:01:48.910> takes<00:01:49.180> a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
we'll run CF bench now this one takes a

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.630 
we'll run CF bench now this one takes a
while<00:01:49.479> so<00:01:49.780> I'll<00:01:49.990> let<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.290> do<00:01:51.100> its<00:01:51.250> thing<00:01:51.340> and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
while so I'll let it do its thing and

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.270 
while so I'll let it do its thing and
then<00:01:51.790> come<00:01:52.540> back<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.750> show<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.350> results

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.740 

all<00:02:00.280> right<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.640> it<00:02:00.970> looks<00:02:01.090> like<00:02:01.210> it's<00:02:01.360> done

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
all right and it looks like it's done

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.830 
all right and it looks like it's done
let's<00:02:02.020> go<00:02:02.229> ahead<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.710> scroll<00:02:03.130> down<00:02:03.190> here<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
let's go ahead and scroll down here to

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.230 
let's go ahead and scroll down here to
the<00:02:04.990> interesting<00:02:05.619> scores<00:02:06.039> these<00:02:06.700> bottom

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the interesting scores these bottom

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.150 
the interesting scores these bottom
three<00:02:07.509> right<00:02:07.720> here<00:02:07.750> we<00:02:08.050> have<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> native<00:02:08.740> score

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
three right here we have a native score

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.130 
three right here we have a native score
of<00:02:11.310> nine<00:02:12.310> thousand<00:02:12.880> five<00:02:13.600> hundred<00:02:13.630> and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
of nine thousand five hundred and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.770 
of nine thousand five hundred and
thirty-five<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:15.120> then<00:02:16.120> we<00:02:16.240> have<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.420> java

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
thirty-five and then we have a java

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.090 
thirty-five and then we have a java
score<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:18.000> 2631<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.420> overall<00:02:20.350> score<00:02:20.710> of<00:02:20.740> five

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
score of 2631 and overall score of five

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.590 
score of 2631 and overall score of five
thousand<00:02:21.610> three<00:02:21.850> hundred<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.330> ninety-two<00:02:24.600> so

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
thousand three hundred and ninety-two so

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.600 
thousand three hundred and ninety-two so
that's<00:02:25.780> CF<00:02:26.170> bench<00:02:29.040> go<00:02:30.040> back<00:02:30.220> home<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:32.610> now

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
that's CF bench go back home and now

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.680 
that's CF bench go back home and now
let's<00:02:33.880> pull<00:02:34.180> up<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:35.430> 22<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.700> believe<00:02:37.510> that's

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
let's pull up and 22 I believe that's

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.070 
let's pull up and 22 I believe that's
how<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:37.960> pronounce<00:02:38.319> it<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:39.490> we'll<00:02:39.970> go<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.210> test

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
how you pronounce it so we'll go to test

00:02:41.080 --> 00:03:03.190 
how you pronounce it so we'll go to test
and<00:02:41.470> start<00:02:42.160> test

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.680 

alright<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:04.280> one's<00:03:04.550> finished<00:03:05.000> as<00:03:05.450> well

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
alright and this one's finished as well

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.540 
alright and this one's finished as well
so<00:03:06.260> we<00:03:06.410> have<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.560> total<00:03:06.800> score<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:08.800> 4931<00:03:09.800> let's

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
so we have a total score of 4931 let's

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.520 
so we have a total score of 4931 let's
go<00:03:10.700> ahead<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.150> run<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.599> multi-touch<00:03:12.170> test

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
go ahead and run the multi-touch test

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.800 
go ahead and run the multi-touch test
and<00:03:12.739> see<00:03:13.069> how<00:03:13.250> many<00:03:13.310> simultaneous<00:03:13.700> points<00:03:14.690> of

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
and see how many simultaneous points of

contact we can get let me warn you this
one<00:03:17.599> can<00:03:17.930> recognize<00:03:18.920> many<00:03:19.610> many<00:03:20.560> points<00:03:21.560> here

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
one can recognize many many points here

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.070 
one can recognize many many points here
it's<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.640> little<00:03:22.910> hard<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.300> do<00:03:23.450> this<00:03:23.599> but<00:03:23.870> as<00:03:23.989> you

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
it's a little hard to do this but as you

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.170 
it's a little hard to do this but as you
can<00:03:24.200> see<00:03:24.440> I<00:03:24.470> can<00:03:24.590> pretty<00:03:24.980> much<00:03:25.099> fit<00:03:25.519> all<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.730> my

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
can see I can pretty much fit all of my

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.930 
can see I can pretty much fit all of my
fingers<00:03:26.660> on<00:03:26.900> there<00:03:27.680> at<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:27.950> same<00:03:28.190> time<00:03:30.940> it

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
fingers on there at the same time it

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.020 
fingers on there at the same time it
goes<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.180> little<00:03:32.360> crazy<00:03:32.480> but<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.500> can<00:03:33.680> see<00:03:33.920> a

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
goes a little crazy but you can see a

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.220 
goes a little crazy but you can see a
data<00:03:35.030> points<00:03:35.540> recognizing<00:03:36.380> right<00:03:36.560> there

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
data points recognizing right there

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.600 
data points recognizing right there
pretty<00:03:39.230> cool<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:39.980> let's<00:03:40.010> jump<00:03:40.549> back<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:41.410> go<00:03:42.410> to

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
pretty cool so let's jump back and go to

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.870 
pretty cool so let's jump back and go to
fill<00:03:43.610> amo<00:03:43.940> this<00:03:44.299> one<00:03:44.540> will<00:03:44.720> test<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:46.640> web

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
fill amo this one will test the the web

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
browser performance kind of a unique

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.819 
browser performance kind of a unique
benchmark<00:03:50.239> and<00:03:50.420> we'll<00:03:51.049> let<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.230> run<00:03:51.680> its

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
benchmark and we'll let that run its

course this one takes a while so I'll
show<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.349> some<00:03:54.650> of<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:54.890> but<00:03:55.130> most<00:03:55.579> likely
