 on head to 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:17.970
 slightly develop 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:22.830
 completely here is rather blue pink 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.050
 than technology let's work with it 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.800
 the city 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.399
 But with such sounds Komi like this have 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.890
 immediately create an idea 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:38.510
 horizontal and vertical 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.239
 create lots of boxes with this 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.340
 smaller palette knife, too, the same 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.079
 favor of the benefit of the other as a 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.469
 ol'ga 3 Tsvetikov sozdash clot dark 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:01:00.989
 houses there away 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:01:05.580
 here it's a moment he'll Grace 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:09.110
 pump up light bright ideas of houses and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.710
 here they are somewhere under the strokes and fear 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.810
 somewhere just making one stroke 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.509
 putty somewhere under the stroke moment 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.930
 somewhere a putty creates an idea 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:26.880
 a lot of houses where we have light 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.670
 you can type like a palette knife and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.409
 green light 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.170
 can you insure you can brush like 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.130
 please, well, here's a bright idea to hatch and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.850
 flax in the sense of so here with such here 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.820
 such 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.990
 or a bigger brush then there is 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.369
 this is movement 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.210
 Stroke can you put it here 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.909
 ladyships who are there before 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.420
 will you take yellow pink 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.420
 whitewash 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.799
 but before you put them a little bit 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.220
 rake 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:11.269
 rake in this space seated 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.519
 favor pink 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:17.260
 orange favor chip replacement greener 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:21.610
 It will be like this and in favor of pink 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.739
 then fill in a bit if that 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.360
 more degree 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:33.099
 the results but there in general is pink 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:39.170
 accent here they are leaving 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:42.790
 perspective outgoing perspective and myself 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.160
 yes you are free 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.370
 partly many of the houses that you 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.349
 will fill here 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:03:01.879
 you can complement them like this 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:10.400
 cut glasses like that and even 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:12.280
 and the Tajiks literally give the odds 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.670
 don't do such a big 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.129
 someday this house compensates a little 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.310
 raised these and then you will have care 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:25.879
 that is, a little bit and well pin down those 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:30.379
 more you have there behind the mountain they are a little 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:32.150
 taller but not enough and manage to 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:36.829
 small palette knife 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.370
 under the hatch here such a square on 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.170
 visible e 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.519
 rectangles here these 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.840
 have time for rectangles under the strokes 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:54.260
 most likely the work of this artist 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:57.530
 five times larger than ours is pretty to him 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.639
 it was easy to do these things for you 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.130
 somewhat more complicated 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:07.819
 so if what do I do not integrate 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:11.599
 doing so finely fine because well 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.459
 just forget the time consuming weight you can 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.430
 finger can only finger does 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.329
 round then and you need direct and 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.329
 rectangular 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.410
 so but everything is so good to say 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:33.659
 so here is this obscuring character 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:37.349
 houses a little bit here show 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.349
 obscure character 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:52.599
 the closer your darkness will be 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:55.750
 more active and less 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:05:01.120
 distinguishable village I just like that 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:07.870
 chess board with non-chess orders 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:14.530
 agree here these darkness too let 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:16.930
 naedut naedut houses a succession of high and 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:21.220
 low 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.220
 here is such 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:27.800
 from this side you will eat a little 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.449
 red and brown brown over on 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.130
 also begins to participate not only 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:38.419
 cold sti 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:43.759
 there is still a lake if you want you can 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:51.469
 also show like this 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:57.590
 so this is the water's gloss 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:06:04.370
 gloss with a hint of reflection like this 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:06.650
 gloss well she immediately looks different beyond 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.449
 account of what is reflected 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:15.430
 it turns out the effect of water then you shield 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:19.130
 these are houses houses 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:23.990
 light to know about against the background of dark water 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:26.509
 let there be bright donky logical here 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.289
 thick paint do not create too this 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:34.969
 far to be so aggressive then 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:38.960
 is there all a bit of biology white and 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:43.379
 but you can step linochka a little bit 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:49.889
 with a little bit of film and that was 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:52.770
 it is clear that this is a city but not very thick 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:55.349
 watched it out I'm not trying too thick 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.490
 it is put and even if it turned out 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:07:01.199
 too thick 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:03.990
 try to trample trample cool 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:08.270
 with how constructiveness appeared in 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.270
 this place and not scary a little darker 

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:21.000
 here, too, yes as if to 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.729
 blocked bright blond blocked 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.500
 the dark poem is there some 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:27.500
 manifestations of bands somehow
