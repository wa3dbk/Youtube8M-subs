came for much the same area and trying

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.400 
came for much the same area and trying
to<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> picture<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.110> British

to get a picture of the British

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.220 
to get a picture of the British
population<00:00:55.789> from<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.940> genetic<00:00:57.629> point<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.020> view

geneticist<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:22.020> challenge

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
geneticist I really like the challenge

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800 
geneticist I really like the challenge
of<00:01:23.009> looking<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.299> differences<00:01:24.689> between

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
of looking at differences between

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
of looking at differences between
populations<00:01:25.409> what's<00:01:25.619> causing<00:01:25.860> them<00:01:26.130> these

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
populations what's causing them these

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.539 
populations what's causing them these
questions<00:01:27.270> are<00:01:28.020> quite<00:01:28.350> difficult<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.369> that's

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
questions are quite difficult and that's

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.429 
questions are quite difficult and that's
what<00:01:29.729> really<00:01:29.850> excites<00:01:30.000> me<00:01:30.299> we're<00:01:31.079> cutting

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
what really excites me we're cutting

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.490 
what really excites me we're cutting
edge<00:01:31.560> population<00:01:32.250> genetics<00:01:33.320> we're<00:01:34.320> really

edge population genetics we're really

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.179 
edge population genetics we're really
looking<00:01:34.740> at<00:01:35.310> differences<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.500> DNA<00:01:37.500> sequence

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
are the markers and we're looking at

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
are the markers and we're looking at
their<00:01:42.689> frequencies<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.530> how<00:01:43.710> they<00:01:43.890> vary<00:01:44.130> in

to a you know sort of faint Romney study

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.150 
to a you know sort of faint Romney study
switch<00:02:15.180> one<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.750> main<00:02:16.200> things<00:02:16.530> he<00:02:16.770> was

talking about was you know your health

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.410 
talking about was you know your health
so<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.950> course<00:02:20.130> it's<00:02:20.370> important<00:02:21.000> years<00:02:21.180> for

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
so of course it's important years for

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.900 
so of course it's important years for
people<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.810> go<00:02:22.800> forward<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:23.250> auntie<00:02:23.610> power

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
delivered not only to the scientist was

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.140 
delivered not only to the scientist was
all<00:02:31.980> sorts<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.460> people<00:02:32.790> have<00:02:32.940> taken<00:02:33.510> power

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
all sorts of the people have taken power

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.850 
all sorts of the people have taken power
and<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.360> right<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.630> general<00:02:37.110> population

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
and to the right of general population

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.240 
and to the right of general population
logic<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.570> people<00:02:39.930> come<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.260> we've<00:02:40.530> explained

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
logic so people come in we've explained

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.890 
logic so people come in we've explained
to<00:02:41.430> them<00:02:41.520> what<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.760> projects<00:02:42.180> about<00:02:42.480> what's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
to them what the projects about what's

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.380 
to them what the projects about what's
required<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.709> them<00:02:44.010> talk<00:02:44.250> about<00:02:44.280> anonymity

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
required for them talk about anonymity

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:54.920 
required for them talk about anonymity
then<00:02:46.140> we<00:02:46.260> lead<00:02:46.410> them<00:02:46.530> through<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.830> forms<00:02:53.930> and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
then we lead them through the forms and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.150 
then we lead them through the forms and
we<00:02:55.050> actually<00:02:55.200> then<00:02:55.410> take<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> blood<00:02:55.890> sample

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
we actually then take a blood sample

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.920 
we actually then take a blood sample
from<00:02:56.490> them<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.270> is<00:02:57.420> important<00:02:57.870> because

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
from them and this is important because

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:08.520 
from them and this is important because
we<00:02:58.260> need<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.440> DNA

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.040 

and<00:03:08.620> then<00:03:09.490> we<00:03:09.730> do<00:03:09.970> some<00:03:10.209> simple<00:03:10.540> smell<00:03:10.900> and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
and then we do some simple smell and

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.480 
and then we do some simple smell and
taste<00:03:11.170> tests

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.170 

yeah<00:03:18.230> we<00:03:19.230> then<00:03:19.440> take<00:03:19.800> some<00:03:20.760> skin<00:03:20.970> colour

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
yeah we then take some skin colour

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.890 
yeah we then take some skin colour
measurements<00:03:22.580> and<00:03:23.580> then<00:03:23.970> finally<00:03:24.450> we<00:03:24.570> move<00:03:24.750> on

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
measurements and then finally we move on

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.920 
measurements and then finally we move on
to<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.140> photograph<00:03:25.740> so<00:03:25.770> we're<00:03:26.070> actually

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
to the photograph so we're actually

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.490 
to the photograph so we're actually
interested<00:03:27.930> in<00:03:28.200> hands<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.780> then<00:03:30.930> finally<00:03:31.380> we

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
interested in hands and then finally we

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.480 
interested in hands and then finally we
take<00:03:31.680> 3-dimensional<00:03:32.370> photographs<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.970> people

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
take 3-dimensional photographs of people

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.790 
take 3-dimensional photographs of people
the<00:03:35.490> next<00:03:35.820> stage<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.360> our<00:03:36.510> study<00:03:36.870> we're<00:03:37.590> now

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
the next stage of our study we're now

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.330 
the next stage of our study we're now
taking<00:03:38.510> pictures<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.690> people's<00:03:40.050> faces<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:41.190> we

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
taking pictures of people's faces so we

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.550 
taking pictures of people's faces so we
can<00:03:41.550> analyze<00:03:41.810> components<00:03:42.810> statistically

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
can analyze components statistically

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.050 
can analyze components statistically
differently<00:03:44.250> than<00:03:44.400> those<00:03:44.550> different

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
differently than those different

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.850 
differently than those different
features<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.660> then<00:03:46.050> look<00:03:46.260> for<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.500> genetic

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
features and then look for the genetic

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.550 
features and then look for the genetic
factors<00:03:47.160> behind<00:03:47.580> that<00:03:48.000> what<00:03:48.990> are<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.350> genes

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
factors behind that what are the genes

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.800 
factors behind that what are the genes
what<00:03:50.040> are<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.280> variations<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:51.030> determine

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
what are the variations that determine

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.230 
what are the variations that determine
facial<00:03:52.170> features<00:03:52.620> will<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.460> be<00:03:53.580> possible<00:03:54.060> to

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
facial features will it be possible to

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.950 
facial features will it be possible to
reconstruct<00:03:55.050> from<00:03:55.710> a<00:03:55.800> piece<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.010> DNA<00:03:56.930> what<00:03:57.930> a

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
reconstruct from a piece of DNA what a

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.420 
reconstruct from a piece of DNA what a
person<00:03:58.410> really<00:03:58.560> looked<00:03:58.860> like<00:03:58.950> I<00:03:59.220> mean<00:03:59.400> that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
person really looked like I mean that

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.290 
person really looked like I mean that
obviously<00:03:59.640> has<00:04:00.180> interesting<00:04:00.870> applications<00:04:01.590> I

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
obviously has interesting applications I

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.430 
obviously has interesting applications I
don't<00:04:03.300> think<00:04:03.450> there's<00:04:03.630> anything<00:04:03.960> you<00:04:04.260> really

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
don't think there's anything you really

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.010 
don't think there's anything you really
quite<00:04:04.770> comfortable<00:04:05.070> be<00:04:05.460> done<00:04:05.670> anyway<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:06.360> in

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
quite comfortable be done anyway on in

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.350 
quite comfortable be done anyway on in
this<00:04:07.200> sort<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.560> detail<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.160> scale<00:04:08.550> really

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
this sort of detail and scale really

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.960 
this sort of detail and scale really
probing<00:04:09.930> by<00:04:10.140> going<00:04:10.500> into<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.250> past<00:04:11.520> by

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
probing by going into the past by

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.180 
probing by going into the past by
getting<00:04:12.420> people<00:04:12.630> who<00:04:12.960> truly<00:04:13.470> representative

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
getting people who truly representative

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.820 
getting people who truly representative
the<00:04:14.520> areas<00:04:14.820> from<00:04:14.940> which<00:04:15.030> they<00:04:15.360> come<00:04:18.440> or<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.470> have

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
the areas from which they come or I have

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.130 
the areas from which they come or I have
like<00:04:20.160> pristine<00:04:20.670> low<00:04:20.850> tide<00:04:21.090> but<00:04:21.480> I<00:04:21.690> don't<00:04:21.930> look

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
like pristine low tide but I don't look

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.310 
like pristine low tide but I don't look
for<00:04:22.320> skating<00:04:22.680> or<00:04:23.300> at<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.390> moment<00:04:24.810> my<00:04:24.930> favorite

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
for skating or at the moment my favorite

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.870 
for skating or at the moment my favorite
I<00:04:25.410> think<00:04:25.620> is<00:04:25.800> see<00:04:26.160> no<00:04:26.880> more<00:04:27.150> car<00:04:27.450> strength<00:04:28.880> yeah

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
I think is see no more car strength yeah

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.440 
I think is see no more car strength yeah
that's<00:04:30.360> why<00:04:30.540> I<00:04:30.570> like<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.200> one<00:04:31.320> yep<00:04:32.420> well<00:04:33.420> I

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
that's why I like that one yep well I

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.150 
that's why I like that one yep well I
would<00:04:33.690> see<00:04:33.870> a<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:34.230> know<00:04:34.290> a<00:04:34.350> nice<00:04:34.530> easy<00:04:34.890> to

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
would see a you know a nice easy to

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.870 
would see a you know a nice easy to
drink<00:04:35.400> single<00:04:35.880> more

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
drink single more

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.000 
drink single more
well<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:38.910> can't<00:04:39.420> like<00:04:39.660> Li<00:04:40.020> throwing<00:04:40.440> actually

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
well I can't like Li throwing actually

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.470 
well I can't like Li throwing actually
and<00:04:41.220> I'm<00:04:41.310> hoping<00:04:41.670> I'm<00:04:41.820> gonna<00:04:41.970> be<00:04:42.210> able<00:04:42.330> to

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
and I'm hoping I'm gonna be able to

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.380 
and I'm hoping I'm gonna be able to
visit<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.350> distillery<00:04:44.040> on<00:04:44.160> my<00:04:44.400> one<00:04:44.790> day<00:04:45.060> here

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
visit the distillery on my one day here

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.350 
visit the distillery on my one day here
and<00:04:46.280> examine<00:04:47.280> whether<00:04:47.520> I<00:04:47.640> really<00:04:48.000> got<00:04:48.330> that

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
and examine whether I really got that

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.510 
and examine whether I really got that
square<00:04:48.930> foot<00:04:49.110> of<00:04:49.140> land<00:04:49.290> that<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:49.860> bought<00:04:50.130> wants

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
square foot of land that I bought wants

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.020 
square foot of land that I bought wants
to<00:04:50.640> be<00:04:50.760> a<00:04:50.790> friend<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.420> distillery
