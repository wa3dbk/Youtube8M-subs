Keynes<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:05.820> suction<00:02:06.510> it<00:02:06.600> was<00:02:06.780> gone<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.200> tried

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
Keynes here suction it was gone I tried

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.710 
Keynes here suction it was gone I tried
it<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:07.980> my<00:02:08.130> hair<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.670> there<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.509> not<00:02:09.660> enough

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
it in my hair but there is not enough

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.250 
it in my hair but there is not enough
product<00:02:10.350> in<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.920> sample<00:02:11.430> thing<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.480> wash<00:02:12.900> my

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
product in the sample thing to wash my

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.080 
product in the sample thing to wash my
whole<00:02:13.740> head<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.640> hair

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
whole head of hair

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.310 
whole head of hair
so<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:16.850> basically<00:02:17.850> wasted<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> bunch<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:19.200> it

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
so I basically wasted a bunch of it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.870 
so I basically wasted a bunch of it
because<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.709> would<00:02:20.130> have<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.310> use<00:02:20.550> like<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
because I would have to use like the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.340 
because I would have to use like the

works<00:04:35.970> great<00:04:36.510> for<00:04:36.539> my<00:04:36.840> hair<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.770> I<00:04:38.250> use<00:04:38.820> this

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
works great for my hair so I use this

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.170 
works great for my hair so I use this
and<00:04:39.419> I<00:04:40.100> mostly<00:04:41.100> got<00:04:41.340> this<00:04:41.550> for<00:04:41.789> the<00:04:41.880> winter

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
and I mostly got this for the winter

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.580 
and I mostly got this for the winter
there's<00:04:42.419> still<00:04:42.690> some<00:04:42.900> in<00:04:42.930> here<00:04:43.169> though<00:04:43.350> but

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
there's still some in here though but

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.730 
there's still some in here though but
probably<00:04:44.039> half<00:04:44.900> because<00:04:45.900> my<00:04:46.080> hand<00:04:46.320> was<00:04:46.410> really

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
probably half because my hand was really

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.200 
probably half because my hand was really
staticky<00:04:47.430> in<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.639> winter<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.090> this

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
staticky in the winter and this

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.920 
staticky in the winter and this
obviously<00:04:49.020> helped<00:04:49.380> a<00:04:49.500> lot<00:04:50.150> after<00:04:51.150> using<00:04:51.660> this

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930
