conditions Alex huh okay what about the
la<00:00:48.690> ninia<00:00:48.989> effect<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.739> time<00:00:50.039> around<00:00:50.190> what

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
la ninia effect this time around what

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.010 
la ninia effect this time around what
exactly<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.510> where<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.780> going

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
exactly is that and where is that going

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.189 
exactly is that and where is that going
to<00:00:52.110> play<00:00:52.260> itself<00:00:52.500> out<00:00:53.030> ok<00:00:54.030> well<00:00:54.300> la<00:00:54.629> ninia<00:00:54.899> is

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
to play itself out ok well la ninia is

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.470 
to play itself out ok well la ninia is
the<00:00:55.379> cooling<00:00:55.829> effect<00:00:56.219> that's<00:00:56.489> coming<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.090> from

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the cooling effect that's coming in from

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.020 
the cooling effect that's coming in from
the<00:00:57.629> equatorial<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.710> eastern<00:00:59.309> Pacific<00:00:59.850> it's

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the equatorial and eastern Pacific it's

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.650 
the equatorial and eastern Pacific it's
the<00:01:00.180> ocean<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:01.890> totally<00:01:02.850> affects<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the ocean and it totally affects the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.140 
the ocean and it totally affects the
weather<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
weather as we know it and the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.690 
weather as we know it and the
interesting<00:01:06.659> thing<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:07.350> week<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:08.100> 69

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
interesting thing this week was 69

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.260 
interesting thing this week was 69
scientists<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.630> eight<00:01:09.900> countries<00:01:09.930> have

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
scientists from eight countries have

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.570 
scientists from eight countries have
very<00:01:12.270> closely<00:01:12.720> looked<00:01:13.229> at<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> Arctic<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
very closely looked at the Arctic and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.850 
very closely looked at the Arctic and
we're<00:01:14.820> missing<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.299> lot<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.630> ice<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.590> ice

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
we're missing a lot of ice and that ice

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.640 
we're missing a lot of ice and that ice
is<00:01:16.890> directly<00:01:17.700> correlated<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.659> see<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
is directly correlated you see with the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.340 
is directly correlated you see with the
cold<00:01:19.950> weather<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.780> predicted

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
cold weather that is that it's predicted

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.100 
cold weather that is that it's predicted
to<00:01:22.380> happen<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.700> Northeast<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.450> the

to happen in the Northeast and the

to happen in the Northeast and the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
Atlantic this year imagine our old

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.960 
Atlantic this year imagine our old
refrigerators<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:29.189> used<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
refrigerators we used to have the

freezer on the top the freezer on the
top<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.960> Arctic<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.939> old

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
top is like the Arctic and in in the old

top is like the Arctic and in in the old
days<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.720> Arctic<00:01:37.049> was<00:01:37.200> cold<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
days the Arctic was cold and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.920 
days the Arctic was cold and
self-contained<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.509> earth<00:01:39.659> is

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
self-contained but as the earth is

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.219 
self-contained but as the earth is
starting<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.380> warm<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.610> cold<00:01:42.060> blobs<00:01:42.540> from

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
starting to warm up the cold blobs from

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.770 
starting to warm up the cold blobs from

the top of our freezer are drifting

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.100 
the top of our freezer are drifting
south<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.189> all<00:01:47.399> upside<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:48.149> Alex<00:01:48.630> yeah

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
south so it's all upside down Alex yeah

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.420 
south so it's all upside down Alex yeah
you<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.590> what's<00:01:49.770> interesting<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.159> talked

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
you know what's interesting you talked

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.580 
you know what's interesting you talked
about<00:01:50.460> California<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> Carolinas<00:01:52.320> being
