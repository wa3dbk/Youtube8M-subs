00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello dear friends hunter themselves 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.839
 today would like to start releasing for 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.429
 you a series of tutorial in which I would 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.400
 I wanted to meet on a strange 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.230
 plugin called voxel sniper and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.960
 With this plugin you can 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.770
 make very epic maps change 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.769
 Mykraft tablet, that is, it's all 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.750
 procedures called terraforming and 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.680
 let's start by reading the plugin 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.279
 and 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.690
 that you need something to work with him so us 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.239
 you need to pick up an arrow and gunpowder 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.870
 we already have it now we make the day 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.840
 and the most simple and the team needs it 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.309
 us for painting the surface now you 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.989
 show in detail what she exactly do 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.989
 for this pajamas service power d10 and 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.710
 now the command we write is slash vi 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.829
 This command will help us more precisely with 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.550
 using it we can choose a block on which 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.070
 would be for me 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.890
 replaced by one or another surface that is 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.710
 here is our land pit i want to replace u with 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.580
 stone i put 1 ie idi stone 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.850
 one here wog select one stone and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.520
 Now, and the team is not the main note 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.560
 more but it is needed and so 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.590
 remove us or rather when we will 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.509
 paint the surface so that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.509
 we were cleaned and direct and then this is all 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.270
 manually so do not clean up so we write 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.560
 team Blvd spheres and p 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.420
 five and now a very long team she 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.000
 also not necessarily it is needed only 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:49.020
 then if you want to clean the trees then 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.869
 there it is so long and so 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.880
 so let's get one more team 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.549
 important and about him almost forgot about 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.740
 service and 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.149
 number from 1 to 100 but you can and up to 150 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.270
 150 row will pull even on the coolest 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.179
 computers and this is the radius of the brush on which 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.380
 will work i mean i put 10 well 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.190
 let's see us doing from the team 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.900
 here's how you see she completely paints but 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.620
 do not destroy blocks, that is, it is just 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.480
 they repaint but physical properties 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.550
 it we have a stone but how would she 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.160
 for me to repaint something wrong said 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:33.760
 replace soon here we repaint our 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.240
 the peninsula so and after that command I would 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.550
 wanted to introduce another team 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:44.250
 which team is this you will see as we 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.250
 finish now clear our peninsula 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.440
 so here we often take everything but that's all 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.680
 still I will not choose at least part 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.680
 abbey road and so long then 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.530
 so well and here we replaced the whole earth then 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.780
 have we got a peculiar such 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.650
 stone island 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.530
 so cute and let's 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.280
 introduce you to the next team 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.100
 Another nuance and after each 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.310
 use any command you need to write 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.300
 slashdot ie in or frescoes and she 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.350
 clears the history of our past 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:39.630
 use the procedure more precisely with 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:41.280
 tassel well and now team b t and this 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.080
 the team helps us plant trees 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.730
 absolutely any that are in the game 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.630
 minecraft that is, as you can see 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.400
 issued 3 big tree &amp; red wood even more 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.150
 many trees i mean we can choose 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.000
 any a trade ordinary victor tree this 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.320
 big red wood and birch tree 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.400
 general, everything is done so bt and tree 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.320
 let's say a big tree 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.130
 Here we have chosen a large prison tree 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.000
 we plant it 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.769
 this command is suitable for creating 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.750
 beautiful forest if your epic map 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.980
 any or just general when you 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.830
 do the server so here we are planted 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:32.100
 trees the second part of our 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:35.330
 Peninsula here but this of course guys 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.700
 The most simple commands of this foreign 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.430
 plug-in all the commands I put under the video and 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.410
 still there will be tutorials commands that 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.990
 help you make 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:50.640
 beautiful parks of the mountain without much difficulty 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.080
