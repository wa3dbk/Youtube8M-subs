00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.919 

the<00:00:07.379> biggest<00:00:07.589> risk<00:00:07.970> that<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.000> think<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.540> involve

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
the biggest risk that I think is involve

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.740 
the biggest risk that I think is involve
in<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.290> mission<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.889> human<00:00:11.429> failure<00:00:11.790> as<00:00:12.509> soon

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
in this mission is human failure as soon

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.410 
in this mission is human failure as soon
as<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.559> developed<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.400> tested<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.299> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
as it is developed and tested in a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.620 
as it is developed and tested in a
chamber<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:16.619> will<00:00:16.680> function<00:00:17.240> but<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> human

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
chamber it will function but the human

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.599 
chamber it will function but the human
person<00:00:19.279> you<00:00:20.279> never<00:00:20.460> know<00:00:20.760> if<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.900> will<00:00:22.050> deliver

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
person you never know if it will deliver

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.800 
person you never know if it will deliver
because<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.880> think<00:00:24.090> about<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.330> lot<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.539> things

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
because we think about a lot of things

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.509 
because we think about a lot of things
you<00:00:24.990> know<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:25.650> as<00:00:25.769> always<00:00:25.920> something<00:00:26.369> out

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
you know but as always something out

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.269 
you know but as always something out
there<00:00:27.230> that<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.349> would<00:00:28.529> never<00:00:28.710> believe<00:00:29.099> this

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
there that you would never believe this

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.160 
there that you would never believe this
is<00:00:29.429> going<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.699> happen<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.510> might<00:00:30.900> kill

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
is going to happen and that might kill

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.150 
is going to happen and that might kill
you

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.280 

if<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.940> thought<00:00:36.150> this<00:00:36.330> was<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> suicide<00:00:37.530> stunt<00:00:38.430> I

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
if I thought this was a suicide stunt I

possibly what we're doing out here at
the<00:01:06.840> Antelope<00:01:07.710> Valley<00:01:07.740> Fair<00:01:08.220> Grounds<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
the Antelope Valley Fair Grounds is to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.670 
the Antelope Valley Fair Grounds is to
take<00:01:10.920> Felix<00:01:11.190> up<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> bungee<00:01:12.200> platform<00:01:13.200> where

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
take Felix up on a bungee platform where

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.560 
take Felix up on a bungee platform where
he's<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> step<00:01:14.310> off<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
he's going to step off and get the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.900 
he's going to step off and get the
sensation<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:16.290> what<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.009> exit<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.520> gonna<00:01:17.729> be

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
sensation of what that exit is gonna be

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.910 
sensation of what that exit is gonna be
like<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.990> wouldn't<00:01:19.229> normally<00:01:19.380> think<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
like so you wouldn't normally think a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.280 
like so you wouldn't normally think a
bungee<00:01:20.490> jump<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.940> terms<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.450> prepping<00:01:22.050> for<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
bungee jump in terms of prepping for a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.590 
bungee jump in terms of prepping for a
high-altitude<00:01:22.500> jump<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.000> gives<00:01:24.210> him<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
high-altitude jump but it gives him the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.960 
high-altitude jump but it gives him the
sensation<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.430> step<00:01:26.729> off

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
sensation of what it's like to step off

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.570 
sensation of what it's like to step off
that<00:01:27.000> platform<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:28.500> try<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.860> control<00:01:29.220> that

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
that platform to try and control that

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.150 
that platform to try and control that
forward<00:01:30.090> rotation<00:01:30.600> step<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> unknown<00:01:31.800> is

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
forward rotation step in the unknown is

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.090 
forward rotation step in the unknown is
always<00:01:32.400> difficult<00:01:32.630> we're<00:01:33.630> still<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:34.100> have

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
always difficult we're still have have

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.680 
always difficult we're still have have
an<00:01:35.220> unknown<00:01:35.520> which<00:01:35.729> means<00:01:35.940> what<00:01:36.360> happens<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
an unknown which means what happens to

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.910 
an unknown which means what happens to
human<00:01:36.930> body<00:01:37.140> when<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> great<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> speed<00:01:37.830> of

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
human body when a great the speed of

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.559 
human body when a great the speed of
sounds<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.759> at<00:01:38.850> least<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.179> want<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.450> know

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
sounds so at least you want to know

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:45.960 
sounds so at least you want to know
you're<00:01:40.080> able<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.319> handle<00:01:40.740> your<00:01:41.250> exits

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.670 

in<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.690> morning<00:01:46.930> it<00:01:47.020> was<00:01:47.080> actually<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.500> first

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
in the morning it was actually the first

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.800 
in the morning it was actually the first
time<00:01:47.830> that<00:01:47.980> we<00:01:48.310> were<00:01:48.460> lifting<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.300> capsule

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
time that we were lifting the capsule

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.110 
time that we were lifting the capsule
outside<00:01:50.320> of<00:01:50.410> a<00:01:50.470> building<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.970> most

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
outside of a building and the most

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.670 
outside of a building and the most
important<00:01:52.510> thing<00:01:52.660> to<00:01:52.780> me<00:01:52.900> was<00:01:52.930> to<00:01:53.230> see<00:01:53.410> how

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
important thing to me was to see how

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.860 
important thing to me was to see how
much<00:01:53.830> that<00:01:54.070> capsule<00:01:54.580> is<00:01:55.060> moving<00:01:55.420> back<00:01:55.630> when<00:01:55.840> I

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
much that capsule is moving back when I

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.100 
much that capsule is moving back when I
get<00:01:56.110> off<00:01:56.290> because<00:01:57.100> if<00:01:57.370> you<00:01:57.520> over<00:01:58.420> rotate<00:01:58.720> on

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
get off because if you over rotate on

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.020 
get off because if you over rotate on
the<00:01:59.620> exit<00:02:00.010> you<00:02:00.100> know<00:02:00.220> you<00:02:00.310> take<00:02:00.610> this<00:02:00.880> over

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
the exit you know you take this over

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.940 
the exit you know you take this over
this<00:02:01.300> rotation<00:02:01.750> all<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.020> way<00:02:02.140> down<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.860> you

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
this rotation all the way down and you

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.740 
this rotation all the way down and you
can't<00:02:03.220> use<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.610> air<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:04.090> stop<00:02:04.330> this<00:02:04.510> because

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
can't use the air to stop this because

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.350 
can't use the air to stop this because
there<00:02:04.930> is<00:02:05.020> no<00:02:05.170> air<00:02:05.290> we<00:02:05.890> had<00:02:06.010> no<00:02:06.190> idea<00:02:06.360> what's

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
there is no air we had no idea what's

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.030 
there is no air we had no idea what's
gonna<00:02:07.450> happen<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.080> capsule<00:02:08.500> as<00:02:08.680> he<00:02:08.800> slide

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
gonna happen to the capsule as he slide

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.220 
gonna happen to the capsule as he slide
to<00:02:09.190> see<00:02:09.340> forward<00:02:09.760> as<00:02:09.880> he<00:02:09.970> climbs<00:02:10.240> out<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.810> as

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
to see forward as he climbs out and as

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.920 
to see forward as he climbs out and as
he<00:02:11.350> hops<00:02:11.560> off<00:02:11.800> so<00:02:12.550> we're<00:02:13.360> really<00:02:13.540> curious

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
he hops off so we're really curious

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.300 
he hops off so we're really curious
about<00:02:13.990> what's<00:02:14.290> gonna<00:02:14.380> happen<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.740> angles<00:02:15.130> and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
about what's gonna happen to angles and

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.770 
about what's gonna happen to angles and
stuff<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.730> when<00:02:15.880> we<00:02:15.970> found<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.300> morning<00:02:16.510> was

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
stuff and when we found this morning was

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.270 
stuff and when we found this morning was
that<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.990> capsule<00:02:17.290> doesn't<00:02:17.680> move<00:02:17.800> as<00:02:17.950> much<00:02:18.130> as

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
that the capsule doesn't move as much as

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.070 
that the capsule doesn't move as much as
we<00:02:18.400> thought<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.850> with<00:02:19.150> all<00:02:19.600> that<00:02:19.810> weight

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
we thought it with all that weight

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.800 
we thought it with all that weight
hanging<00:02:21.040> from<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.340> one<00:02:21.490> spot<00:02:21.790> it's<00:02:22.540> pretty

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
hanging from the one spot it's pretty

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.470 
hanging from the one spot it's pretty
stationary<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.760> last<00:02:27.970> time<00:02:28.150> we<00:02:28.210> made<00:02:28.360> these

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
stationary the last time we made these

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.570 
stationary the last time we made these
jumps<00:02:28.900> we<00:02:29.890> were<00:02:30.010> out<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.340> different

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
jumps we were out of a different

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.580 
jumps we were out of a different
aircraft<00:02:31.000> with<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> smaller<00:02:31.780> side<00:02:32.080> door<00:02:32.320> what

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
aircraft with a smaller side door what

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.840 
aircraft with a smaller side door what
we're<00:02:32.710> doing<00:02:32.860> today<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.190> right<00:02:33.310> up<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.490> tailgate

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
we're doing today is right up a tailgate

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.130 
we're doing today is right up a tailgate
aircraft<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.570> will<00:02:34.660> be<00:02:34.750> able<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.930> bring<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
aircraft that will be able to bring the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.500 
aircraft that will be able to bring the
pressure<00:02:35.350> up<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.740> full<00:02:35.950> pressure<00:02:36.250> 3<00:02:36.730> psi<00:02:37.120> you

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
pressure up to full pressure 3 psi you

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.240 
pressure up to full pressure 3 psi you
get<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.690> new<00:02:37.810> chest<00:02:38.140> pack<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:38.830> we've<00:02:38.950> done<00:02:39.100> now

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
get the new chest pack so we've done now

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.500 
get the new chest pack so we've done now
is<00:02:39.310> we've<00:02:39.400> made<00:02:39.550> some<00:02:39.730> modifications<00:02:40.330> he

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
is we've made some modifications he

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.930 
is we've made some modifications he
seemed<00:02:40.690> happy<00:02:41.050> with<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.370> we're<00:02:42.370> gonna<00:02:42.460> test<00:02:42.790> it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
seemed happy with it we're gonna test it

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.310 
seemed happy with it we're gonna test it
out<00:02:43.030> in<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.300> first<00:02:43.540> jump<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:43.900> we'll<00:02:44.080> see<00:02:44.260> how

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
out in this first jump and we'll see how

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.590 
out in this first jump and we'll see how
it<00:02:44.380> goes<00:02:44.520> what<00:02:45.520> was<00:02:45.670> really<00:02:46.000> interesting<00:02:46.180> was

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
it goes what was really interesting was

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.680 
it goes what was really interesting was
fascinating<00:02:47.260> was<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.560> see<00:02:47.830> his<00:02:48.670> flipping<00:02:49.390> over

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
fascinating was to see his flipping over

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.949 
fascinating was to see his flipping over
it<00:02:50.650> was<00:02:50.739> actually<00:02:51.160> pretty<00:02:51.640> easy<00:02:52.090> as<00:02:52.660> very

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
it was actually pretty easy as very

it was actually pretty easy as very
natural<00:02:53.500> for<00:02:53.709> him<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:54.760> again<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.060> shows<00:02:55.270> us

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
natural for him so again it shows us

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.590 
natural for him so again it shows us
that<00:02:55.690> he's<00:02:55.900> able<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.440> control<00:02:57.040> himself<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:58.390> go

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
that he's able to control himself and go

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.199 
that he's able to control himself and go
into<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.900> delta<00:02:59.380> actually<00:03:00.130> track<00:03:00.430> upside<00:03:00.940> down

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
into a delta actually track upside down

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.690 
into a delta actually track upside down
infinity<00:03:01.810> I'm<00:03:02.530> super<00:03:02.950> happy<00:03:03.070> with<00:03:03.400> today

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
perfect you need a lot of practice and

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.820 
perfect you need a lot of practice and
