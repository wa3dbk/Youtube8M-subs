let's take a closer look at the figure

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.920 
let's take a closer look at the figure
now<00:02:31.489> okay<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:32.550> he<00:02:32.819> has<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.940> front<00:02:33.390> view<00:02:33.690> you

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
are much much bigger figures like each

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.370 
are much much bigger figures like each
figure<00:03:50.459> it's<00:03:50.700> it's<00:03:51.090> its<00:03:51.269> own<00:03:51.389> size<00:03:51.750> like<00:03:52.260> they

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
figure it's it's its own size like they

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.289 
figure it's it's its own size like they
don't<00:03:52.560> they<00:03:53.340> don't<00:03:53.489> really<00:03:53.609> fit<00:03:53.730> with<00:03:54.150> the
