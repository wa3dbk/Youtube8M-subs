00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.250 
quickly you can see there's a multitude
of<00:00:31.550> five<00:00:32.550> dollar<00:00:32.790> transactions<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.780> there's

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
of five dollar transactions and there's

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.290 
of five dollar transactions and there's
several<00:00:34.800> $50<00:00:35.370> transactions<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.030> there<00:00:36.210> as

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
several $50 transactions in there as

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.049 
several $50 transactions in there as
well<00:00:36.450> I'm<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.290> skip<00:00:37.530> through<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> pages

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
well I'm going to skip through the pages

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.139 
well I'm going to skip through the pages
so<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:40.440> how<00:00:40.590> many

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
so you can see just how many

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.139 
so you can see just how many
transactions<00:00:42.149> were<00:00:42.270> generated<00:00:43.850> if<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.000> look

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
transactions were generated if you look

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.779 
transactions were generated if you look
there<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> dates<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:46.020> up<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> 18th<00:00:47.640> of

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
there the dates are up to the 18th of

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.260 
there the dates are up to the 18th of
June<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.980> says<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.280> scroll<00:00:50.520> back<00:00:50.550> across<00:00:50.910> again

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
June it says we scroll back across again

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.760 
June it says we scroll back across again
now<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.140> see<00:00:54.170> lots<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.350> five<00:00:55.559> dollar

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
now you can see lots of five dollar

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.160 
now you can see lots of five dollar
transactions<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.820> $50<00:00:57.329> transactions<00:00:57.960> in

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
transactions so $50 transactions in

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.420 
transactions so $50 transactions in
there<00:00:58.460> all<00:00:59.460> throughout<00:01:00.920> June<00:01:01.920> there's<00:01:02.250> not

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
there all throughout June there's not

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.100 
there all throughout June there's not
one<00:01:02.640> day<00:01:02.670> when<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.210> didn't<00:01:03.629> actually<00:01:03.780> earn

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
one day when we didn't actually earn

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.730 
one day when we didn't actually earn
anything<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> 18th<00:01:06.500> skip<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.680> next

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
anything up to the 18th skip to the next

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.550 
anything up to the 18th skip to the next
page<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:11.750> probably<00:01:12.750> won't<00:01:12.960> go<00:01:13.170> through<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
page I probably won't go through all of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.499 
page I probably won't go through all of
them<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.130> there<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.280> several<00:01:14.640> several

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
them because there are several several

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.660 
them because there are several several
pages<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.200> imagine<00:01:16.290> between<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.860> 22nd

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
pages you can imagine between the 22nd

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.620 
pages you can imagine between the 22nd
of<00:01:17.729> May<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.530> on<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> 18th<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.159> June<00:01:20.400> there<00:01:20.630> but

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
of May and on the 18th of June there but

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
of May and on the 18th of June there but
this<00:01:21.780> processor<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.409> next<00:01:28.650> page<00:01:28.860> but

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
this processor and the next page but

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.370 
this processor and the next page but
there<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.810> volume<00:01:31.110> of

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
there you can see the the volume of

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.840 
there you can see the the volume of
transactions<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.130> coming<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.610> every

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
transactions that are coming in every

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.020
