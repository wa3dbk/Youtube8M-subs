00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:32.460
 compost is what plants need 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.050
 as an organic fertilizer this 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.450
 even better than the experienced university humus 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.539

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.899

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.409
 the pit is not ruined it is literally half a meter 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:19.439
 from the ground the size is 700 millimeters by 1500 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.840

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.840

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.740
 size like my mom i am only 4.5 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.740

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.530

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.330
 cover 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.780
 you see what Californian does 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:56.610
 worms with this mass 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.750
 green mass in just a year green 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.350
 mass turns gorgeous goo 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.530
 tutti in touch for on our planet this 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.140

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.420
 very high temperature days and became 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.750

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:45.830
