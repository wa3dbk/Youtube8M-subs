hello 
we're back

00:00:15.063 --> 00:00:17.095
with one more video from E Ai Ta Servido

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:21.083
Today I'm going to teach you
an orange cake

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:25.092
well, i'll start for the ingredients ok?

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:30.061
3 tablespoon of butter

00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:34.092
3 cups of wheat flour

00:00:34.092 --> 00:00:38.052
1 cup of orange juice

00:00:38.052 --> 00:00:42.075
2 cups of white sugar

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:47.034
1 tablespoon of baking powder

00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:50.024
grated orange peel

00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:52.023
4 eggs yolks

00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:54.032
4 egg whites

00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:58.042
well to start we'll knock on the electric mixer

00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:02.007
the sugar

00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:07.042
the 4 eggs yolks

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:09.040
and the butter

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.082
until creamy  and clear

00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:22.069
like this

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:30.061
Now I'll add 3 more ingredients, they are:

00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:33.022
grated orange peel

00:01:33.022 --> 00:01:35.031
the orange juice

00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:38.031
and the wheat flour

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.030
mix and back to the eletric mixer

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.012
well, once you get the homogeneous mass 
like this

00:02:05.012 --> 00:02:08.021
and the ingredients are already incorporated

00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:10.065
lastly we add

00:02:10.065 --> 00:02:13.067
the baking powder

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:23.052
and the eggs whites

00:02:23.052 --> 00:02:30.061
now mixing slowly , until incorporate all

00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:37.037
This recipe is for a large baking pan

00:02:37.037 --> 00:02:45.027
but I chose to make two small

00:02:45.027 --> 00:02:50.047
Now I'll put in the preheat oven 180 degrees to 35/40 min.

00:02:50.047 --> 00:02:52.058
and  we see the result

00:02:52.058 --> 00:02:57.003
well, this is the time to see if the cake is ready
lets go?

00:02:57.003 --> 00:03:04.084
insert a toothpick and if  it comes out clean
its time to take out

00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:10.063
This is the result of our cake

00:03:10.063 --> 00:03:13.050
