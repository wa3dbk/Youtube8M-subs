the brain and reading out from the brain

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.840 
the brain and reading out from the brain
and<00:00:54.809> one<00:00:55.530> way<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> read<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.309> from<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.640> brain

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
and one way to read out from the brain

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.290 
and one way to read out from the brain
is<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.329> read<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.170> activity<00:00:58.710> optically<00:00:59.300> so

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
is to read out the activity optically so

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
is to read out the activity optically so
if<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.199> convert<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> activity<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
if you can convert the activity of the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.369 
if you can convert the activity of the
neurons<00:01:02.309> into<00:01:03.030> lights<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:04.050> we<00:01:04.199> can

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
neurons into lights then we can

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.770 
neurons into lights then we can
literally<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:05.160> how<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.489> brain<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.060> actually

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
literally see how the brain is actually

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.960 
literally see how the brain is actually
computing<00:01:07.410> and<00:01:07.590> its<00:01:07.860> current<00:01:08.130> study<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.790> goal

computing and its current study the goal

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.219 
computing and its current study the goal
is<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.330> try<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> figure<00:01:09.750> out<00:01:09.869> whether

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
is really to try to figure out whether

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
is really to try to figure out whether
there<00:01:10.530> are<00:01:10.560> ways<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:11.040> record<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.580> neural

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
there are ways to record the neural

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.190 
there are ways to record the neural
activity<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.439> all<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:14.130> cells<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.700> an<00:01:14.850> organism

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
activity of all the cells in an organism

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.929 
activity of all the cells in an organism
for<00:01:16.200> example<00:01:16.560> there's<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.979> small<00:01:17.220> worm<00:01:17.490> C

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
for example there's a small worm C

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.440 
for example there's a small worm C
elegans<00:01:17.970> which<00:01:18.780> has<00:01:18.960> only<00:01:19.140> 302<00:01:19.920> neurons<00:01:20.450> those

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
elegans which has only 302 neurons those

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.870 
elegans which has only 302 neurons those

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
neurons mediate sensation movement

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.899 
neurons mediate sensation movement
decision-making<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.350> forth<00:01:25.670> if<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.790> can

record<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.570> neural<00:01:27.869> activity<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.530> fast

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
record the neural activity the fast

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.440 
record the neural activity the fast
electrical<00:01:29.280> pulses<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.700> these<00:01:30.000> cells<00:01:30.210> use

electrical pulses that these cells use

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.240 
electrical pulses that these cells use
to<00:01:30.600> compute<00:01:30.930> throughout<00:01:31.680> an<00:01:31.799> entire<00:01:31.860> nervous

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
to compute throughout an entire nervous

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.890 
to compute throughout an entire nervous
system<00:01:32.400> then<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.299> might<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.420> possible<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
system then it might be possible to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
system then it might be possible to
figure<00:01:34.110> out<00:01:34.380> how<00:01:34.799> different<00:01:35.520> parts<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.939> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
with very large field of view what we

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.120 
with very large field of view what we
found<00:02:00.210> was<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.540> indeed<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.649> could<00:02:01.860> take

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
found was that indeed we could take

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.859 
found was that indeed we could take
simultaneous<00:02:02.820> 3-dimensional<00:02:03.540> images

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
simultaneous 3-dimensional images

simultaneous 3-dimensional images
throughout<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.320> entire<00:02:04.649> body

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
throughout the entire body

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.490 
throughout the entire body
of<00:02:05.909> an<00:02:06.090> organism<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.869> along<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> way<00:02:07.290> we

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
of an organism and along the way we

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.499 
of an organism and along the way we
picked<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.070> neural<00:02:08.310> activity<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.880> cells

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
picked up the neural activity of cells

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.449 
picked up the neural activity of cells
throughout<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.019> brain<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.190> various

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
throughout the brain and the various

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.100 
throughout the brain and the various
ganglia<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:11.970> make<00:02:12.329> up<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.569> nervous<00:02:12.810> system

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
ganglia that make up the nervous system

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.320 
ganglia that make up the nervous system
now<00:02:13.920> because<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.520> can<00:02:14.670> image<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.120> neural

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
now because we can image the neural

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.180 
now because we can image the neural
activity<00:02:15.810> throughout<00:02:16.470> an<00:02:16.620> entire<00:02:16.709> nervous

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.180

we<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.599> avoid<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.170> problem<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.680> not<00:02:19.890> knowing

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
we can avoid the problem of not knowing

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.610 
we can avoid the problem of not knowing
where<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:21.030> particular<00:02:21.930> computation<00:02:22.470> is

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
where a particular computation is

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.199 
where a particular computation is
happening<00:02:22.980> we<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.519> see<00:02:23.670> everything<00:02:23.970> that's

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
happening we can see everything that's

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.880 
happening we can see everything that's
going<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.170> allows<00:02:25.410> us<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.620> pinpoint

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
going on and that allows us to pinpoint

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.009 
going on and that allows us to pinpoint
where<00:02:26.790> information<00:02:27.180> processing<00:02:27.870> is

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
where information processing is

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.379 
where information processing is
occurring
