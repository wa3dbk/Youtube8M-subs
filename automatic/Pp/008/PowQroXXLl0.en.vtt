00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
certain consequences and I want to keep

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.860 
certain consequences and I want to keep
my<00:06:39.590> channel<00:06:40.100> as<00:06:40.220> clean<00:06:40.610> as<00:06:40.850> possible<00:06:40.910> that's

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
my channel as clean as possible that's

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.110 
my channel as clean as possible that's
why<00:06:42.110> I<00:06:42.140> always<00:06:42.500> use<00:06:42.680> my<00:06:43.100> own<00:06:43.280> material<00:06:43.910> when<00:06:44.090> I

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
why I always use my own material when I

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.240 
why I always use my own material when I
do<00:06:44.210> the<00:06:44.390> tutorials<00:06:45.020> and<00:06:45.290> that's<00:06:46.040> why<00:06:46.220> I

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
do the tutorials and that's why I

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.060 
do the tutorials and that's why I
haven't<00:06:46.700> really<00:06:47.120> showed<00:06:47.419> you<00:06:47.690> any<00:06:48.070> mixed
