 Hello my friends and welcome another lesson on Tuesdays. 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.640
 I am Leonardo Pereznieto and today we will draw a train 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.600
 with lots of smoke. 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.100
 We will use graffiti powder with a leather cloth. 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:29.600
 Wipe the surplus on a rough piece of paper, and now ... let's sketch! 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.410
 Start with the basic sketch where you want the smoke to be, 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.179
 and then make a few shadows. 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.719
 The reason why I suggest you use this technique is because 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.679
 the pen can leave lines and stronger traces, 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:50.600
 while the dust leaves a more ethereal look ideal for the smoke. 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.900
 We continue to add shadows to build shapes and volume. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.840
 Then with a soft rubber or plain pencil 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.979
 you can take out the light ... and continue on, 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.900
 pulling more light and shadow. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 This is just fun! 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.689
 If you want to emphasize or reinforce some boundaries 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.810
 You can do it with the pencil but do it moderately and carefully 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.700
 so it would not look solid. 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 And now ... train. 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.159
 I know I know, I kept the smoke so much 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.400
 I nearly forgot about the train. 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.159
 In this case, it will be very simple, small and suggestion 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 It has an edge on the underside and rail. 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.390
 And here on the side, we will be able to see lightly another wagon, 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.390
 Let's clear some trees in the distance and we can quickly build a landscape 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.600
 with the appearance of leather and graphite. 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.000
 I'll stretch the smoke down as 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.300
 would come out of the tube. 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.300
 Draw the other trees closer and darker. 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.690
 By the way, I get the graphite powder by storing it 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.000
 when you sharpen your graphite peaks, 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.480
 otherwise you can get them by rubbing the tip of the pen 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.400
 on sanding paper. 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.600
 With extra fine rubber, 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.980
 if you do not have this you can cut a triangular piece 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.900
 tire with scalpel. 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.500
 Excellent! 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.500
 It's ready! 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.750
