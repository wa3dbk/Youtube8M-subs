what<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.130> learned<00:01:20.430> off<00:01:20.549> youtube<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.150> best

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
what I learned off youtube is the best

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.990 
what I learned off youtube is the best
thing<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.950> reverse<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.549> tension

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
thing to do is just reverse the tension

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.820 
thing to do is just reverse the tension
and<00:01:24.229> we're<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.380> try<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.590> do<00:01:25.710> this

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
and we're going to try and do this

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.640 
and we're going to try and do this
backwards<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.210> bit<00:01:27.299> harder<00:01:27.650> because

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
backwards a little bit harder because

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.770 
backwards a little bit harder because
for<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.100> camera<00:01:29.400> okay<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.570> it's

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
for the camera okay see just go it's

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.270 
for the camera okay see just go it's
like<00:01:30.900> flutter<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.619> way<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> cannot<00:01:32.070> get

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
like flutter going that way I cannot get

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.859 
like flutter going that way I cannot get
it<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> go<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.729> way<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.450> I've<00:01:33.570> heard<00:01:33.750> on

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
it to go this way and I've heard on

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.020

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
why would you pick it backwards well you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.109 
why would you pick it backwards well you
don't<00:01:37.740> intentionally<00:01:38.189> pick<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.670> backwards

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
don't intentionally pick it backwards

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.880
