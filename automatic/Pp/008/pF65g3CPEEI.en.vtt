comparing<00:01:53.759> them<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.299> wing<00:01:54.570> looks<00:01:54.899> stronger

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
comparing them this wing looks stronger

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.840 
comparing them this wing looks stronger
it<00:01:57.930> looks<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.409> won't<00:01:58.649> break<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.369> impact

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
it looks like it won't break on impact

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.550 
it looks like it won't break on impact
like<00:02:00.840> shatter<00:02:01.259> okay<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:03.060> looks<00:02:03.689> amazing<00:02:04.259> when

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
like shatter okay so looks amazing when

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
like shatter okay so looks amazing when

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
she's moving like with the wings flying

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.199 
she's moving like with the wings flying

looks amazing same textures do you see
how<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.010> wing<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.550> similar<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.540> one

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
how this wing is similar to this one

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.960 
how this wing is similar to this one
except<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.320> little<00:02:19.590> bit<00:02:19.770> darker<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.430> two

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
same thing flying flying wings in then

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.680

old one so bright and it looks faded and
it's<00:02:41.160> hard<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.460> see<00:02:41.790> where<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.210> one<00:02:42.450> looks

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
it's hard to see where this one looks

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.770 
it's hard to see where this one looks
detailed<00:02:43.260> really<00:02:44.220> amazing<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.850> colors<00:02:45.210> to

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
around here but see this where our wings

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.860 
around here but see this where our wings
are<00:03:07.830> in<00:03:07.950> wings<00:03:08.220> are<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.580> wings<00:03:08.940> our<00:03:09.150> out<00:03:09.420> things

the back you couldn't even see this
white<00:03:23.790> if<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.420> had<00:03:24.570> texture<00:03:24.930> or<00:03:25.140> not<00:03:25.320> because

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
white if it had texture or not because

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
texture lines the head looks more

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.259 
texture lines the head looks more
detailed<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.730> if<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.690> look<00:03:33.870> at<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:35.030> hmm<00:03:36.030> it

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
looks like they've taken off texture

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.540 
looks like they've taken off texture
from<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.330> wing<00:03:39.600> because<00:03:39.959> this<00:03:40.860> looks<00:03:41.040> over

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
from the wing because this looks over

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.000 
from the wing because this looks over
textured<00:03:42.030> almost<00:03:42.420> it<00:03:42.600> looks<00:03:42.780> grainy<00:03:43.230> or<00:03:43.590> this

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
gold the helmet and this gold plating on

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.479 
gold the helmet and this gold plating on
the<00:04:09.570> top<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.110> wings<00:04:10.320> at<00:04:10.650> near<00:04:11.340> the

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
the top of the wings at near the

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.750 
the top of the wings at near the
shoulders<00:04:11.970> arm<00:04:12.799> so<00:04:13.799> front<00:04:14.220> side<00:04:15.169> back<00:04:16.169> side<00:04:16.760> to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
shoulders arm so front side back side to

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.090 
shoulders arm so front side back side to
show<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.150> two<00:04:18.330> differences<00:04:18.900> they<00:04:19.440> retextured

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
show the two differences they retextured

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.039 
show the two differences they retextured
the<00:04:20.250> wings<00:04:20.459> that<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.910> textures<00:04:21.810> are<00:04:21.930> in

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
the wings that the textures are in

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.320 
the wings that the textures are in
different<00:04:22.229> spots<00:04:22.710> they<00:04:23.340> took<00:04:23.640> away<00:04:23.820> some<00:04:24.300> of

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
different spots they took away some of

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.570 
different spots they took away some of
the<00:04:24.450> color<00:04:24.780> so<00:04:25.080> that<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.410> have<00:04:25.680> emphasis<00:04:26.400> on

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
the color so that you have emphasis on

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.200 
the color so that you have emphasis on
the<00:04:26.700> nice

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
the nice

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.960 
the nice
blue<00:04:27.300> color<00:04:27.630> this<00:04:28.169> is<00:04:28.350> over<00:04:28.680> bright<00:04:29.009> and<00:04:29.280> just

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
blue color this is over bright and just

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.170 
blue color this is over bright and just
again<00:04:30.410> looks<00:04:31.410> really<00:04:32.250> weird<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.819> it<00:04:32.970> looks

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
again looks really weird and it looks

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.510 
again looks really weird and it looks
over<00:04:33.449> textured<00:04:34.110> because<00:04:35.039> they're<00:04:35.220> adding

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
over textured because they're adding

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.040 
over textured because they're adding
these<00:04:35.639> grainy<00:04:36.030> lines<00:04:36.389> that<00:04:36.599> make<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.900> look

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
these grainy lines that make it look

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.200 
these grainy lines that make it look
like<00:04:37.199> stone<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.650> it's<00:04:38.039> not<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.190> bird<00:04:38.460> wing<00:04:38.669> or

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
like stone and it's not a bird wing or

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.749 
like stone and it's not a bird wing or
this<00:04:39.449> one<00:04:39.690> it<00:04:40.229> still<00:04:40.800> looks<00:04:40.830> like<00:04:41.160> ice<00:04:41.370> but

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
this one it still looks like ice but

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.529 
this one it still looks like ice but
because<00:04:42.630> she<00:04:42.780> is<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:42.930> frost<00:04:43.349> bird<00:04:43.620> rip<00:04:43.919> but<00:04:44.580> at

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
because she is the frost bird rip but at

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.339 
because she is the frost bird rip but at
least<00:04:45.720> looks<00:04:46.080> more<00:04:46.319> realistic<00:04:47.360> then<00:04:48.360> this

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
least looks more realistic then this

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.640 
least looks more realistic then this
might<00:04:49.530> be<00:04:49.710> one<00:04:49.860> of<00:04:49.889> the<00:04:50.069> coolest<00:04:50.340> anivia<00:04:50.970> skins

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
might be one of the coolest anivia skins

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.580 
might be one of the coolest anivia skins
hextech<00:04:52.650> anivia<00:04:53.720> get<00:04:54.720> zoom<00:04:55.229> in<00:04:55.380> on<00:04:55.500> this<00:04:55.680> so

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
hextech anivia get zoom in on this so

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.839 
hextech anivia get zoom in on this so
looks<00:04:58.590> amazing<00:04:59.400> they<00:04:59.580> retextured<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.680> looks

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
looks amazing they retextured it looks

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.749 
looks amazing they retextured it looks
crazy<00:05:02.849> all<00:05:03.360> obviously<00:05:03.930> hextech<00:05:04.470> it's<00:05:04.800> like<00:05:05.039> a

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
crazy all obviously hextech it's like a

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.290 
crazy all obviously hextech it's like a
hextech<00:05:06.509> Victor<00:05:06.990> I'm<00:05:07.139> pretty<00:05:07.380> sure<00:05:07.530> so<00:05:08.490> show

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
hextech Victor I'm pretty sure so show

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.430 
hextech Victor I'm pretty sure so show
front<00:05:10.139> side<00:05:10.889> back<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.699> side<00:05:11.900> looks<00:05:12.900> really

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
front side back and side looks really

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.400 
front side back and side looks really
cool<00:05:13.650> looks<00:05:14.220> plated<00:05:14.669> so<00:05:15.300> old<00:05:15.660> one<00:05:15.870> two<00:05:16.020> new<00:05:16.199> one

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
cool looks plated so old one two new one

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.830 
cool looks plated so old one two new one
the<00:05:17.070> obvious<00:05:17.580> differences<00:05:18.180> are<00:05:18.419> that<00:05:18.479> they

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
the obvious differences are that they

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.629 
the obvious differences are that they
added<00:05:19.259> this<00:05:19.470> right<00:05:19.770> here<00:05:20.039> the<00:05:20.190> textures

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
added this right here the textures

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.140 
added this right here the textures
underneath<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.360> head<00:05:21.960> they<00:05:22.800> added<00:05:23.159> a<00:05:23.580> a

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
underneath the head they added a a

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.620 
underneath the head they added a a
better<00:05:24.630> color<00:05:24.990> and<00:05:25.470> shading<00:05:25.949> on<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.520> back<00:05:27.270> of

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
better color and shading on the back of

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.570 
better color and shading on the back of
pipes<00:05:27.990> where<00:05:28.380> this<00:05:28.560> one<00:05:28.800> has<00:05:29.130> terrible

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
pipes where this one has terrible

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.499 
pipes where this one has terrible
lighting<00:05:30.419> and<00:05:31.130> they<00:05:32.130> darkened<00:05:32.699> up<00:05:32.880> this<00:05:33.180> right

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.509 
lighting and they darkened up this right

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.200 
lighting and they darkened up this right
wing<00:05:33.810> they<00:05:34.530> took<00:05:34.830> away<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:35.400> strip<00:05:35.729> of<00:05:35.909> blue

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
wing they took away the strip of blue

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.439 
wing they took away the strip of blue
that<00:05:36.240> was<00:05:36.599> right<00:05:36.810> here<00:05:37.050> on<00:05:37.380> both<00:05:38.009> sides<00:05:38.449> they

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
that was right here on both sides they

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.360 
that was right here on both sides they
took<00:05:39.690> it<00:05:39.720> away<00:05:39.930> made<00:05:40.409> it<00:05:40.530> a<00:05:40.650> just<00:05:40.919> a<00:05:41.039> solid

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
took it away made it a just a solid

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.189 
took it away made it a just a solid
color<00:05:41.580> and<00:05:42.090> put<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.360> blue<00:05:42.539> on<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:42.810> back<00:05:43.020> of

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
color and put the blue on the back of

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.010 
color and put the blue on the back of
the<00:05:43.320> wing<00:05:43.469> they<00:05:44.190> also<00:05:44.599> retextured<00:05:45.599> this<00:05:45.780> made

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
the wing they also retextured this made

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.749 
the wing they also retextured this made
a<00:05:46.050> different<00:05:46.409> color<00:05:46.620> some<00:05:47.310> of<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.460> textures

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
a different color some of the textures

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.339 
a different color some of the textures
are<00:05:47.909> still<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.539> same<00:05:48.780> it's<00:05:49.020> just<00:05:49.080> different

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
are still the same it's just different

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.999 
are still the same it's just different
colors<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:50.130> shading<00:05:51.229> what<00:05:52.229> pretty<00:05:52.680> pretty

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
colors and shading what pretty pretty

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.399 
colors and shading what pretty pretty
cool<00:05:53.250> I'm<00:05:53.430> really<00:05:54.270> happy<00:05:54.509> for<00:05:54.659> this<00:05:54.900> skin<00:05:55.169> I

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
cool I'm really happy for this skin I

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.209 
cool I'm really happy for this skin I
think<00:05:56.130> they<00:05:56.250> did<00:05:56.400> really<00:05:56.430> well<00:05:57.050> they<00:05:58.050> it<00:05:58.889> even

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
think they did really well they it even

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:01.330 
think they did really well they it even
looks<00:05:59.520> like<00:05:59.639> the<00:06:00.150> shadow<00:06:00.659> on<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.020> ground

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
looks like the shadow on the ground

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.540 
looks like the shadow on the ground
looks<00:06:02.340> less<00:06:02.729> pixelated<00:06:03.570> in<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:03.900> new<00:06:04.050> one<00:06:04.550> now

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
looks less pixelated in the new one now

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.850 
looks less pixelated in the new one now
i'm<00:06:05.729> curious<00:06:06.000> is<00:06:06.539> that<00:06:06.630> in<00:06:06.930> each<00:06:07.080> of<00:06:07.259> them<00:06:07.440> it

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
i'm curious is that in each of them it

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.279 
i'm curious is that in each of them it
is<00:06:08.340> like<00:06:08.880> this<00:06:09.090> is<00:06:09.270> really<00:06:09.419> pixelated<00:06:09.870> this

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
is like this is really pixelated this

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.310 
is like this is really pixelated this
one<00:06:10.469> isn't<00:06:10.849> not<00:06:11.849> a<00:06:11.880> big<00:06:12.120> difference<00:06:12.570> but<00:06:12.930> it's

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
one isn't not a big difference but it's

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.770 
one isn't not a big difference but it's
a<00:06:13.440> thing<00:06:14.120> pixelated<00:06:15.120> less<00:06:15.389> pixelated<00:06:16.080> and

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
a thing pixelated less pixelated and

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.810 
a thing pixelated less pixelated and
less<00:06:18.780> pixelated<00:06:19.729> again<00:06:20.729> and<00:06:21.530> oh<00:06:22.820> let's

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
less pixelated again and oh let's
