00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.130
 fourth day mass of my opponent on 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.849
 it starts at twelve weeks 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.849
 In any case, continue 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.460
 today again i would hear the sz 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.220
 stones selected murat is weight around 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.070
 just the elbow and 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.610
 accordingly the rotator cuff 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.610
 to acquire massively 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.949
 because of this simply because the 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.699
 Wrists are stabilized there and 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:50.780
 we really ne ne nation we receive 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.780
 go straight to anticipation 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.540
 the companies are 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:03.050
 recipe is 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:05.830
 maximum lesson exclusive so 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.410
 work accordingly upwards 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.160
 eccentric the movement down for 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.170
 slower than accordingly 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.060
 counteract 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.960
 that would be dumbbell to this exercise 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.960
 Here you can see the variation szk 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.470
 next exercise directly hammer curls me 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.960
 I chose it 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.759
 Short had variations to take 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.509
 just as many degrees of freedom as possible 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.310
 to have 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.950
 important here is because we then firm 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.250
 if possible, take the correction with you 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.330
 mirrors have to test simply test 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.520
 already to have 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.640
 has by ordinary motion affects 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.020
 here with neutral handle for the cork 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.869
 brachial slow motion 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.179
 controlled work clean work 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.850
 only then can we be among all 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.850
 train and flexibility 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.680
 working properly again when dropping 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.310
 You can also weight down 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.110
 down 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.170
 In this sense, it goes on a lot 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.170
 success 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.730
 design is definitely got names 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.670
 already two three sets in which load 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.400
 worked up to performance peak and 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.670
 That's why we're going to do this again 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.650
 a final exercise for the biceps 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.299
 to full tension in the biceps 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.670
 I have myself accordingly 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.560
 decided that we have the 45 degrees 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.390
 We just have a bit weird 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.109
 The whole thing can also be worked on 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.450
 make device 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.269
 but I have the advantage here again 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.239
 said that I will be back if possible 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.849
 Musculature conflict with exercise 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:58.159
 completely not out remains below the 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.159
 Prevented full movement 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.510
 working again on the warming continued 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.510
 respect, think highly of 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.850
 Full tension in the biceps 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.850
 turn back to the front 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.630
 it continues with triceps and indeed 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.920
 triceps now in the form that they 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.870
 really normal again 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.120
 currency rates make share is 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.830
 Of course, two-thirds triceps 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.200
 That's why it will be the third bicep 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.370
 Much easier is more weight 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.870
 to decrease 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.239
 I have decided for it now 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:47.170
 to make french press that is about 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:47.170
 head to earn a decent job 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.769
 Relatively in the grip now here around 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.730
 simply the stabilization of the 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.730
 to have wrists 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.160
 I have the seat up so far 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.010
 inclined to simply allow 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.769
 the ending to work properly because 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.819
 of course, in a block in one 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.819
 remain neutral group 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:17.060
 who has pain in the elbow joint 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.180
 Of course, this can end up with data 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.070
 use 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.049
 otherwise with a judicial too 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.550
 go up high that he is 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.680
 really the proper move in the 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.100
 have drawn elbow variation of 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.100
 Handle 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.889
 and 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.479
 of course he should have pain too 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.630
 let's pay attention to the ending 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.910
 behave so if they are more neutral in 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.790
 Vienna, whether they are rotating outwards and 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.919
 then please stay where yours 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.139
 daily pleasant one possible 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.139
 pleasant life has success 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.930
 continue to press the head 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.880
 Be careful that you are really one 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.500
 Lightweight really a lightweight line 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.220
 have backwards so that nevertheless the 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.539
 lumbar the lumbar spine embedded 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.780
 stabilized - again moderately into 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:16.470
 face around the movement neatly too 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.910
 just make the whole thing look out in isolation 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.509
 on the messy problems that 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.190
 dish up lead us upright 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:27.090
 stabilization of the lws also made now 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:31.949
 the natural course of the back 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:34.740
 Everything at the head over 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:37.740
 always bodies work that we do not 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.229
 if possible, have movement 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.669
 Of course, now difficult with heavy 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.880
 weight to do it all right 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:48.300
 but the technology as before weight 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:52.039
 definitely long term spaces 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.590
 so there are no joint problems 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:57.440
 accordingly falls problems have me 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.949
 either with the weight down 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.550
 We use wrist and otherwise 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.270
 really also lie 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.270
 completely replace 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.949
 it goes on the eighth with dips we 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.230
 that really as solid as possible 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:17.910
 handle the wrists and have 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.240
 of course the maximum train or the 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:25.229
 say important I want to take over 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.979
 which the hoppers part of me does not it 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:28.020
 do not give 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:31.500
 to be simple when lead 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.150
 the losses will be what we want 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.760
 Of course, as much share comes 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.699
 even try that means the poor 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:44.210
 are relatively close to the body looking around 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:46.650
 Grand Prix's action of the shoulder joints 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:53.360
 So far, just go forward to the easy 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:58.290
 focus on full movement 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.040
 supervised work pays attention to the 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:04.660
 idea 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.660
 on poor in the concentric warning 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:12.480
 dynamic movement history this 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.480
 Many people continue
