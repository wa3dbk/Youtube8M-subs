00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.170 
sense but it's not gonna be too crazy in
death<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:45.980> that's<00:02:46.159> always<00:02:46.340> good<00:02:46.549> to<00:02:46.760> know<00:02:46.939> I

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
death so that's always good to know I

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.940 
death so that's always good to know I
think<00:02:47.900> it's<00:02:48.049> personally<00:02:48.379> gonna<00:02:48.530> be<00:02:48.650> something

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
think it's personally gonna be something

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.589 
think it's personally gonna be something
like<00:02:49.069> it's<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.430> training<00:02:49.760> ground<00:02:50.120> for<00:02:50.329> the

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
like it's a training ground for the

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.690 
like it's a training ground for the
Spartans<00:02:50.900> or<00:02:51.290> something<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:51.709> that<00:02:51.769> or<00:02:52.159> you

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
know something similar to that or maybe

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.440 
know something similar to that or maybe
they're<00:02:54.469> gonna<00:02:54.560> add<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.280> red<00:02:55.489> vs.<00:02:55.849> blue<00:02:55.879> story

probably<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:07.010> worst<00:03:07.280> news<00:03:07.549> that<00:03:07.819> you're

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
probably the worst news that you're

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.670 
probably the worst news that you're
going<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.120> be<00:03:08.180> hearing<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:09.079> video<00:03:09.409> and

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
going to be hearing in this video and

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.349 
going to be hearing in this video and
we're<00:03:10.189> not<00:03:10.340> actually<00:03:10.549> going<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.909> have<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.060> halo

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
we're not actually going to have a halo

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.080 
we're not actually going to have a halo
4<00:03:11.780> beta<00:03:12.189> instead<00:03:13.189> I<00:03:13.400> think<00:03:13.459> what<00:03:13.939> they're

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
4 beta instead I think what they're

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.490 
4 beta instead I think what they're
actually<00:03:14.209> gonna<00:03:14.510> do<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:14.750> they're<00:03:15.169> actually

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
actually gonna do it they're actually

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.780 
actually gonna do it they're actually
planning<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.859> you<00:03:16.069> know<00:03:16.189> sort<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.489> keep<00:03:16.700> it

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
planning to you know sort of keep it

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.869 
planning to you know sort of keep it
in-house<00:03:17.299> as<00:03:17.629> far<00:03:17.930> as<00:03:17.959> beta<00:03:18.260> wise<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.879> really

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
in-house as far as beta wise and really

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.309 
in-house as far as beta wise and really
when<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.120> think<00:03:20.150> about<00:03:20.389> it<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.659> is<00:03:20.870> actually

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
when you think about it that is actually

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.500 
when you think about it that is actually
a<00:03:21.379> very<00:03:21.620> good<00:03:21.950> thing<00:03:22.159> as<00:03:22.370> if<00:03:23.000> they<00:03:23.150> keep<00:03:23.329> it

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
a very good thing as if they keep it

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.899 
a very good thing as if they keep it
in-house<00:03:24.169> wise<00:03:24.530> they<00:03:24.859> can<00:03:25.069> work<00:03:25.310> on<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.639> game

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
in-house wise they can work on the game

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.069 
in-house wise they can work on the game
more<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.389> I'm<00:03:26.480> sure<00:03:26.689> they're<00:03:26.810> gonna<00:03:26.930> have

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
more and I'm sure they're gonna have

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.839 
more and I'm sure they're gonna have
like<00:03:27.290> stuff<00:03:27.500> like<00:03:27.590> private<00:03:28.159> beta<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.609> stuff

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
like stuff like private beta and stuff

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.000 
like stuff like private beta and stuff
but<00:03:29.030> when<00:03:29.209> you<00:03:29.329> have<00:03:29.479> a<00:03:29.510> public<00:03:29.930> beta<00:03:30.139> that's

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
but when you have a public beta that's

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.500 
but when you have a public beta that's
going<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.340> take<00:03:31.519> over<00:03:31.729> basically<00:03:32.359> your<00:03:32.479> whole

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
going to take over basically your whole

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.659 
going to take over basically your whole
studio<00:03:33.079> time<00:03:33.409> making<00:03:33.889> sure<00:03:34.069> that<00:03:34.220> thing<00:03:34.400> runs

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
studio time making sure that thing runs

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.430 
studio time making sure that thing runs
correctly<00:03:35.000> making<00:03:35.540> sure<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:35.900> always<00:03:36.109> have

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
correctly making sure you always have

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.409 
correctly making sure you always have
those<00:03:36.560> patches<00:03:36.859> up<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.400> date<00:03:37.579> on<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.909> beta

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
those patches up to date on the beta

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.259 
those patches up to date on the beta
making<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.260> most<00:03:39.370> enjoyable<00:03:40.370> experience

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
making it the most enjoyable experience

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.300 
making it the most enjoyable experience
I<00:03:41.449> think<00:03:42.019> a<00:03:42.139> lot<00:03:42.319> of<00:03:42.349> people<00:03:42.440> got<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.949> doll<00:03:43.190> from

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
I think a lot of people got to doll from

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.920 
I think a lot of people got to doll from
battlefield<00:03:43.879> from<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.209> beta<00:03:44.389> and<00:03:44.629> stuff<00:03:44.810> like

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
battlefield from the beta and stuff like

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.770 
battlefield from the beta and stuff like
that<00:03:45.040> when<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.280> actually<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.060> battlefield<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:47.690> a

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
that when in actually a battlefield is a

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.349 
that when in actually a battlefield is a
completely<00:03:48.199> different<00:03:48.650> game<00:03:48.680> from<00:03:49.010> the

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
completely different game from the

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.030 
completely different game from the
operation<00:03:50.359> Metro<00:03:50.720> gameplay<00:03:51.139> so<00:03:51.709> you<00:03:51.769> know

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
operation Metro gameplay so you know

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.979 
operation Metro gameplay so you know
that<00:03:52.069> is<00:03:52.400> very<00:03:52.790> important<00:03:53.359> and<00:03:53.510> I<00:03:53.599> think<00:03:53.629> it's

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
that is very important and I think it's

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.420 
that is very important and I think it's
actually<00:03:54.169> a<00:03:54.349> good<00:03:54.530> thing<00:03:54.590> that<00:03:54.889> didn't<00:03:55.190> add

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
actually a good thing that didn't add

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.490 
actually a good thing that didn't add
the<00:03:55.459> beta<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:56.030> so<00:03:56.810> let's<00:03:56.989> go<00:03:57.079> ahead<00:03:57.109> and<00:03:57.290> talk

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
the beta in so let's go ahead and talk

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.309 
the beta in so let's go ahead and talk
about<00:03:57.739> armor<00:03:58.099> abilities<00:03:58.549> so<00:03:59.540> armor<00:03:59.870> abilities

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
about armor abilities so armor abilities

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.289 
about armor abilities so armor abilities
were<00:04:00.799> in<00:04:00.949> the<00:04:01.040> last<00:04:01.250> game<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.609> Halo<00:04:01.819> Reach<00:04:01.940> but

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
were in the last game in Halo Reach but

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.969 
were in the last game in Halo Reach but
for<00:04:02.479> those<00:04:02.569> you<00:04:02.750> guys<00:04:02.870> who<00:04:03.049> didn't<00:04:03.440> know<00:04:03.500> halo

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:03.979 
for those you guys who didn't know halo

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.250 
for those you guys who didn't know halo
3<00:04:04.220> actually<00:04:04.609> had<00:04:04.790> armor<00:04:05.389> pickups<00:04:05.900> where<00:04:06.139> you

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
3 actually had armor pickups where you

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.960 
3 actually had armor pickups where you
can<00:04:06.409> add<00:04:06.560> stuff<00:04:06.769> like<00:04:06.949> over<00:04:07.310> shield<00:04:07.639> stuff

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
can add stuff like over shield stuff

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.969 
can add stuff like over shield stuff
like<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.150> if<00:04:08.479> you<00:04:08.569> guys<00:04:08.689> play<00:04:08.930> CA<00:04:09.169> you<00:04:09.829> guys

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:09.979 
like that if you guys play CA you guys

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.069 
like that if you guys play CA you guys
are<00:04:10.159> probably<00:04:10.310> familiar<00:04:10.609> with<00:04:10.970> that<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.510> so

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
are probably familiar with that and so

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.599 
are probably familiar with that and so
somebody<00:04:12.409> asks<00:04:12.799> you<00:04:12.919> know<00:04:13.099> are<00:04:13.220> we<00:04:13.250> gonna<00:04:13.400> have

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
somebody asks you know are we gonna have

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.420 
somebody asks you know are we gonna have
armor<00:04:13.970> abilities<00:04:14.389> in<00:04:14.569> here<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.019> actually<00:04:15.680> he

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
armor abilities in here and actually he

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.800 
armor abilities in here and actually he
said<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:16.760> know<00:04:16.880> we're<00:04:17.060> gonna<00:04:17.180> make<00:04:17.389> the<00:04:17.570> next

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
said you know we're gonna make the next

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.779 
said you know we're gonna make the next
sensible<00:04:18.470> upgrade<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:19.070> know<00:04:19.159> we<00:04:19.280> had<00:04:19.489> power

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
sensible upgrade you know we had power

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.149 
sensible upgrade you know we had power
ups<00:04:20.060> before<00:04:20.299> we<00:04:20.690> had<00:04:20.810> pickups<00:04:21.289> and<00:04:21.560> now<00:04:21.680> and

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
ups before we had pickups and now and

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.800 
ups before we had pickups and now and
then<00:04:22.430> we<00:04:22.580> had<00:04:22.729> armor<00:04:23.090> abilities<00:04:23.509> so<00:04:23.690> we're

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
then we had armor abilities so we're

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.839 
then we had armor abilities so we're
gonna<00:04:23.900> have<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.320> next<00:04:24.620> best<00:04:24.680> thing<00:04:25.099> so<00:04:25.729> I'm

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
gonna have the next best thing so I'm

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.399 
gonna have the next best thing so I'm
thinking<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:26.449> you<00:04:26.630> know<00:04:26.659> we're<00:04:26.960> gonna<00:04:27.139> have

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:27.409 
thinking that you know we're gonna have

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:29.110 
thinking that you know we're gonna have
sprint<00:04:27.919> I<00:04:28.159> think<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.460> is<00:04:28.550> confirmed<00:04:28.970> that

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
sprint I think it is confirmed that

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.700 
sprint I think it is confirmed that
we're<00:04:29.270> going<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.419> have<00:04:29.570> sprint<00:04:29.960> already<00:04:30.380> added

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
we're going to have sprint already added

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.950 
we're going to have sprint already added
into<00:04:30.979> that<00:04:31.130> so<00:04:31.729> i<00:04:31.760> think<00:04:31.969> you<00:04:32.419> know<00:04:32.539> i<00:04:32.840> don't

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
into that so i think you know i don't

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.959 
into that so i think you know i don't
know<00:04:33.229> maybe<00:04:34.010> that's<00:04:34.370> going<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.700> be<00:04:34.820> the
