 the right eye and the left or rather, that is possible again 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.229
 differences and yet a relationship between people who do not 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.229

 he decided brazil 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.740
 I understand that is in the left hand 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.050
 after months 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.820
 What you always have is a piece of music that is inside those doors 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.920
 the guidance can respond 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.920
 when the time comes you can hang out a bit 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.180
 well yes 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.490
 9 but 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.000
 the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:15.769
 leave it 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.549
 the 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.549
 in a 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.160
 juventus has been going to be arranged 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.609
 this is an advantage 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.969
 get started i do we want the right hand there they are competition 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.999
 the left hand is also there for a while 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:41.469
 what more challenge he has not only the ndr that in 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.839
 but is this actually all the extra support in the back to hear 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.939
 this one 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.979

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:53.639
 no, it is not 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.639
 and 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.589
 the device this site 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:07.589
 and ensures that if your left hand 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.329
 supports you there is also the outcomes are soft 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.059

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.349
 Muslims 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.750
 then you have the device suitable 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.730
 and then you go and merge this left hand and right hand and make sure 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.079
 that your right hand showing the medical service 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.079
 6 was the fastest

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.769
 to become 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.029
 but we 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:04.659
 so also a piece 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.249
 and if you have to watch in hand the sound 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:09.059

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.680
 how much this approach is 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.590
 to live there 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.590

 I don't want to go first 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.159
