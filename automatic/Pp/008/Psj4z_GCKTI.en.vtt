it out it's coming out okay there you go
this<00:05:03.990> is<00:05:04.320> what<00:05:04.800> your<00:05:05.070> actuator<00:05:05.730> looks<00:05:06.150> like<00:05:06.360> in

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
this is what your actuator looks like in

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.700 
this is what your actuator looks like in
fact<00:05:07.050> this<00:05:07.860> is<00:05:08.040> your<00:05:08.190> lock<00:05:08.430> mechanism<00:05:09.300> and

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
fact this is your lock mechanism and

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.730 
fact this is your lock mechanism and
inside<00:05:10.710> there's<00:05:10.980> a<00:05:11.040> built<00:05:11.340> in<00:05:12.470> actuator<00:05:13.470> and

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
inside there's a built in actuator and

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.580 
inside there's a built in actuator and
that<00:05:14.430> actuator<00:05:15.000> is<00:05:15.240> responsible<00:05:16.020> for<00:05:16.050> popping

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
that actuator is responsible for popping

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.420 
that actuator is responsible for popping
the<00:05:17.120> locking<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.300> unlocking<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:19.470> locking

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
the locking and unlocking the locking

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.960 
the locking and unlocking the locking
mechanism<00:05:21.000> with<00:05:21.420> your<00:05:21.600> key<00:05:21.840> fob<00:05:22.490> so<00:05:23.490> this<00:05:23.670> how

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
mechanism with your key fob so this how

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.290 
mechanism with your key fob so this how
it<00:05:24.120> looks<00:05:24.590> very<00:05:25.590> easy<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:26.250> remove<00:05:26.550> but<00:05:27.030> again

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
it looks very easy to remove but again

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.960 
it looks very easy to remove but again
if<00:05:27.510> this<00:05:27.720> item<00:05:27.990> fails<00:05:28.560> to<00:05:28.830> work<00:05:29.070> while<00:05:29.760> it's

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
if this item fails to work while it's

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.180 
if this item fails to work while it's
still<00:05:30.210> in<00:05:30.330> your<00:05:30.450> door<00:05:30.770> it's<00:05:31.770> going<00:05:31.980> to<00:05:32.040> be

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
still in your door it's going to be

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.070 
still in your door it's going to be
nearly<00:05:32.460> impossible<00:05:32.850> to<00:05:33.420> remove<00:05:33.780> it<00:05:33.960> without

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
nearly impossible to remove it without

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.310 
nearly impossible to remove it without
actually<00:05:34.770> tearing<00:05:35.730> the<00:05:35.850> whole<00:05:36.090> door<00:05:36.900> panel

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
actually tearing the whole door panel

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.690 
actually tearing the whole door panel
off<00:05:37.410> and<00:05:37.710> of<00:05:37.770> course<00:05:38.010> that's<00:05:38.130> gonna<00:05:38.280> cost<00:05:38.550> you

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
off and of course that's gonna cost you

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.200 
off and of course that's gonna cost you
more<00:05:38.880> money

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
more money

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.960 
more money
so<00:05:39.960> again<00:05:40.200> just<00:05:40.230> preventive<00:05:40.860> maintenance<00:05:40.970> ok

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
so again just preventive maintenance ok

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.050 
so again just preventive maintenance ok
