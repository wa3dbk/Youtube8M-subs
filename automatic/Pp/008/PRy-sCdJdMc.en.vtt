00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.280
 when we dive in the year 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.920
 we use 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.330
 these are the devices 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.600
 which are called vest compensation 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.129
 worn on themselves 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.609
 and fasten at the back 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.869
 balloon mistakenly think what years 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.059
 a compensator is needed in order 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.059
 to inflate it fulfill it 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.769
 you can really cheat out of help 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.509
 you can really argue here even 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:20.980
 hose and special which 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.239
 screwed to a certain 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.090
 devices continue to use these 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.289
 savers can 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.849
 percentage pump out the water already years or 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.550
 shed air and vest 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.509
 the same compensator is needed in order to 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:32.750
 moment of time 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.150
 during the dive 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.340
 our buoyancy was zero that is 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.880
 so that we neither drown nor surface 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.820
 the slightest movement could change their 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.500
 the blame 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.020
 this compensators is different here 1 of 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.010
 most common 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.880
 Types of what is called 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.740
 classic vest compensator 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.270
 which is so buoyancy chamber I 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.430
 right now, fill it with air 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.430
 clearer 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.160
 and it is located on the back 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.590
 and in front of the vest 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.260
 this kind of housing can still be 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.390
 cargo pocket 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.240
 they are located here 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.710
 The fact is that 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.670
 when we immerse it back in 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.700
 wetsuits our floating heavily 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.650
 positively 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.240
 and it was very difficult for us 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.670
 dive in 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.710
 we will need to take extra 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.500
 ballast 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.370
 extra balasco brake yourself 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.000
 take must be fixed on 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.250
 equipment and on the body so that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.250
 any moment it was possible 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.140
 there are more difficult vests 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.140
 for example such 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.270
 whose camera is buoyancy 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.100
 already located behind their backs and they 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.230
 wings are called here such vests 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.970
 usually overwhelming 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.840
 most cases too 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.730
 cargo pockets 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.910
 vested they are large enough 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.910
 size 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.270
 Here such vests can be 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.280
 powerful steel 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.280
 stainless rings so that you can 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.209
 it was safe to fasten what color 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.469
 then additional equipment 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.609
 photo or video 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.869
 as we already know exists 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.219
 special 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.659
 thoughts of engineers 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.499
 over how to make equipment comfortable 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.039
 for our beautiful ladies 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.159
 That's typical, but I would probably say 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.399
 best 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:30.069
 women jacket 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.939
 percent 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.749
 female vests are designed so 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:34.379
 way to 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.889
 minimize pressure 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.369
 chest strap 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:40.949
 practiced as if he 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:43.749
 such solutions as maximum 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.049
 decrease 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.119
 width and back 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.769
 besides, is it already women's taste always 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.339
 the dimension bar is shifted strongly in 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.569
 downward 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.569
 not to mention what we show 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.590
 such elements of the vest as explained 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.419
 member emphasis 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.339
 the designer fits with the greatest 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:06.429
 meticulousness 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.589
 and if the vest is well matched in size 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.079
 it is comfortable to swim in it 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.619
 with a small balloon with a medium balloon with 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:15.739
 large balloon 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:16.859
 so otherwise you stop 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.039
 feel the gear 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:20.589
 and your dives really 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:21.189
 gives you pleasure
