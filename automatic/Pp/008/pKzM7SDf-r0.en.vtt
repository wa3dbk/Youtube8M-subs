00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.719
 Hello everyone, we will experience today 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.979
 the dishes that came to me from China 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.149
 then this is a teapot screenshots or photo 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:07.310
 leave the boxes at home 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:09.080
 video under the video set that's what it means to 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.390
 Unfortunately, I have no opportunity today 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.310
 to experience 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:19.960
 pan I will correct to say about her 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.890
 even forgot, but today I will experience 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.350
 this is a saucepan 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.720
 Well, that's what I think is not necessary to experience 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.479
 this is so clear what it means I 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.509
 I will test the pot I brew in it 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.190
 rollton and i will try on the teapot lights i 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.610
 already did a test the other day of this 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.500
 kettle and on the burner it warmed means 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.380
 today, too , somewhere minus 57 degrees 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.939
 so here is not very cold but 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.000
 frost still present well means 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.000
 I'll fill up and some coffee 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:11.810
 as seen as it should be seen 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:21.400
 things let's go to the managers can still 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:21.400
 need to be closed with a cap and set 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.840
 By the way, there was talk that the pen 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.239
 at the kettle or in pans can be caught 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.519
 Well firstly if you pay attention 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:48.709
 then the pot handle I removed for you do 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:50.480
 the heat that is it like a barrel a little bit it 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.690
 here you do not know that there is such a tube 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.340
 cambric dressed he used to spin now 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.730
 spinning well, what are we waiting for ? 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.730
 boils 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.160
 well, the water is already boiling 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.650
 All in the game you can shoot from the fire let 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.380
 infuse swell 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.430
 right here you have to be boiled on 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:28.540
 until the side of the teapot just a little 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.540
 we are not boiling 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.600
 I just can't see the customer because of the smoke 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.500
 great boils 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.930
 that is, pay attention to the kettle 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.020
 just took it off the fire 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.390
 in the hands of the cambric did not pay the kettle 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.770
 really boils 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.250
 that's what I do right now brew 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.480
 my soup will be my coffee 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.700
 these are the remnants of dishes pan 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.590
 bast all this bowls will experience 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.380
 other videos well unfortunately just 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.160
 understand forgot forgot cooked lard there 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.280
 sausage yourself 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.600
 spider and left at home means want 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.880
 say add this saucepan which 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.340
 I've been about 10 minutes ago already as 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.500
 put it on but closed the lid 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.260
 put and brew roll there 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.180
 set on snow we will see us 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.150
 a bit but still snow and snow still 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.670
 covered with a given crust that's because 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.800
 that is 100 frost all day in the cold 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.940
 the day is warm but today is so little 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.560
 frosty but nonetheless for some reason everyone 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.960
 it is still very hot maybe 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.460
 just because it's freezing here but 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.380
 Honestly, I've already made coffee 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.510
 coffee I have already boiled the night brain 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.970
 cool i even sipped him a little 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.860
 Well, as a saucepan for some reason, this 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.420
 keeps very warm in those seconds 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.140
 while I shot the previous story 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:04.260
 and the lid was open horror soup here 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:07.710
 That is, there really is such a way 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.720
 dishes effect is that while the lid is closed on 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.790
 long keeps the heat on at home will still 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.650
 experience and if this is really so 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.410
 actually sinful chitaka but there is 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:20.600
 about smoked dishes only 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:24.840
 turned on the camera went smoke well here we see 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:27.030
 but I think it will be erased quickly and well 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.760
 teapot the most important thing is that the teapot 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.100
 that the pan did not bend that 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.290
 pan's not necessary to be bent more 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.390
 do not pan test 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.700
 dishes show me very much and most 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.830
 most importantly when I ask for tea he does not enter 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.690
 almost come in if some more of these 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.610
 Rivets to remove it is likely to be 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.110
 such cool 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.310
 here, well, grief is everything to everyone 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.699
 Thank you for your attention and see you in 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.699
