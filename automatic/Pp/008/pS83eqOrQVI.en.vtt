00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.520
 hello how are you all I'm nico Ã¡lvarez and 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.520
 welcome to a new video 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.710
 there are two types of aerosols which is the 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.410
 female and the male differentiated very 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.640
 simple because the female see that 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.100
 hole does not bring anything 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.720
 instead the male usually observe that 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.150
 Bring a protruding stick 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.140
 the male spray is more focused towards 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:36.050
 the home use is to paint furniture 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.050
 and others as you can see here 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.920
 his painting is not so resistant to 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.489
 uvb rays 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.350
 although these aerosols are very good 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.320
 they are made of paint and tim and gas what 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.020
 which makes it not so good for the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.480
 graffiti 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.460
 this unlike the previous one is 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.730
 much better for graffiti since the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.120
 companies or industries have dedicated 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.770
 certain part in doing spray paint 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.210
 specifically for graffiti because 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.010
 is different from this one because his painting 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.170
 acrylic one the best paintings for 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.229
 use in graffiti is also high 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.600
 performance and resists uvb rays but 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.210
 which of the two to use then the times 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.240
 we can separate make graffiti can be 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.700
 combine acrylic paints and paintings 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.560
 normal, what I do recommend is that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.840
 if you're going to start, you start using 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.790
 these since they are much cheaper and 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.280
 as you go forward in a 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.770
 graffiti you can use of these as they are 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.040
 a little more expensive thanks to that a 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.820
 better quality but for my part I start 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.729
 to do using lists that are good 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.860
 economic and have a quality of 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.600
 very good job now let's talk 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.600
 of the nozzles there are two types of 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.810
 nozzles the fat and the corner good the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.959
 Fat as the name implies is fat or 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.690
 thick these nozzles are used more 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:08.690
 everything to fill spaces for 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.610
 make thick strokes or thick tags and the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.920
 corner and as its name indicates it then 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.860
 it is thin this helps us to give 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.590
 delicate strokes delicate defects that 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.100
 do not notice much but help to be 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.940
 see a better work of art but also 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:29.240
 there are derivations like this one that has 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.209
 adapted a small stick which helps 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.580
 to make the paint go much dirtier 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.490
 so to speak and it gives a different effect 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.250
 but there is an adapter 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.030
 nozzle which is simple to 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.730
 use 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.209
 that works in this way 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.440
 the big part we will put it in the 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.830
 little stick 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.410
 we will put some pressure and we will put 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.350
 the mouthpiece 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.520
 they can not put the mouthpiece at the same time and 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.010
 put it this makes that we can already use the 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.550
 wide range of males with a spray 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.550
 male 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.420
 and that was the first lesson of this 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.730
 course I hope you liked it, do not forget 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.810
 subscribe you like to comment what you 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.810
 ciao found
