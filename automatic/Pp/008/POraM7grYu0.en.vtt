private<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:09.360> she<00:02:10.259> says

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
private but she says

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.640 
private but she says
just<00:02:12.000> because<00:02:12.300> there's<00:02:12.510> snow<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.470> role

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
just because there's snow and the role

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.440 
just because there's snow and the role
of<00:02:13.680> Ghani<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.640> doesn't<00:02:15.000> mean<00:02:15.150> there<00:02:15.420> isn't

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
of Ghani it doesn't mean there isn't

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.650 
of Ghani it doesn't mean there isn't
fire<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.500> furnace<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.130> on<00:02:17.400> fire<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.090> wanted

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
fire in the furnace and on fire I wanted

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.900 
fire in the furnace and on fire I wanted
those<00:02:18.840> hips<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.710> like<00:02:20.220> kick<00:02:20.520> over<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.760> other

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
those hips to like kick over the other

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.780 
those hips to like kick over the other
way<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.360> isn't<00:02:21.900> fire<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.160> was<00:02:23.400> do<00:02:23.580> this

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
way that isn't fire so I was do this

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.780 
way that isn't fire so I was do this
over<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.630> over<00:02:24.690> again<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.070> furnace<00:02:26.460> I

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
over and over again in the furnace I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.640 
over and over again in the furnace I
probably<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.600> on<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.780> character<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.410> about

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
probably be on the character for about

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.410 
probably be on the character for about
two<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.010> half<00:02:29.190> years<00:02:29.580> something<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.209> that
