00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.619
 a witness tells of yesterday there is a mysterious bilderberg conference 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.859
 one started as the four years will come 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.699
 Great world leaders see kings and queens gathered and then head their heads 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.140
 to cross each other and talk about all the important things 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.900
 the annual bilderberg conference is the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of the 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.900
 a good world to talk about 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.770
 actually about that the future is a mysterious because she is 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.700
 never tell what they have what they do there during the conference 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.350
 tell what has been discussed 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.340
 things are being discussed that are now current, so at the conference now 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.170
 go over myself let me guess the mexican flu and 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:00.970
 the international crisis and the economic crisis 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.970
 With that, the mysterious midi will turn into an episode of Comedy For 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.329
 It is therefore not surprising that the bastard people with the most bizarre 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.030
 the boy who comes up only people who advanced that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.650
 think of those systems 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.080
 Sjoerd Heijnes world government are all taking decisions and 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.830
 I no longer live in civil wars planned a ticket to the two days 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.840
 preacher usually means a huge jump on the 5 kilometers 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.830
 already 4 bailly who this year the beatrix blanket is hanging on the same 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.370
 I place that I am right that it is kind of a gift that has had 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.130
 the few that are the bildeberg so typical there are people in it 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.440
 He is doing a good job but I guess that sometimes scares me 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.770
 The case was Bill Clinton just before the president became America 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.740
 pass at the bilderberg conference 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.180
 tony blair 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.770
 that I became in the Netherlands 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.580
 if your at the bilderberg conference but with fresh 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.880
 it is said of sarkozy our own prince bernhard was once laying the ground 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.470
 for the elitist event 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.230
 and he is not the only one who likes a politician who pressures him 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.750
 by and are actually the most common thread say the most constant factor 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.819
 throughout the Wildeberg conference 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.519
 why know i saw a conference about that being drawn also because of her father 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.370
 being the president of the event 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.220
 but it remains strange that she is our queen an unelected head of state 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.360
 in there secretly because that says the sit all very mysterious 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.230
 the better with other world business people also gives its opinion there 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.510
 and that all of us may not know what exactly they are, but that remains one 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.580
 bit weird harry van bommel van de sp has again questions about this time 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.780
 but also to those questions, balkenende never answers 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.120
 only people who really care about people who are on windows 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.490
 there is even editor in chief of the big one 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.230
 American newspapers and they have to promise that they don't speak a word 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.770
 about what is being discussed there 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.010
 you can say yes it is a nice debate club and they are talking about the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.850
 problems in the world it has shown in the past that a number 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.420
 things really have a basis there or as we are the european union 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.060
 in fact put together the euro was first discussed during one 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.240
 Bilderberg Conference on the IJsselmeer will affect families like it 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.850
 Opta's idea expecting that would be nice if we become the plans for the future 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.040
 part of it is actually written for that jade now becomes itself 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.580
 said but then you start to think completely and that is all 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.760
 people who are fantastic in the making that the economic crisis even there 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.980
 and the dead tree to make money on a counter and raid it 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.320
 unclear what happened in itself nice that people are important 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.660
 the world sit together and think of had already Gaddafi and 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.890
 others that he of the best will be the Harry van Bommel after which one or more 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.670
 though parliamentary questions also ask only you have to ask yourself about housing 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.790
 sit because they are world leaders not opted for a cigar in the mouth 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.389
 I don't think so 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.099
 I have said that they are fat here are possibly again also fine 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.589
 as the politicians and of course go from trudy who can gain knowledge but can 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.049
 It may not be possible because she is now a queen 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.139
 Representatives no longer welcome the Queen is a member of the Bush administration 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.749
 for the journey the symbol of the netherlands is not chosen lee was but 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:58.799
 where does is bolt runs he underwent the year and a half 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:11.089
 sies
