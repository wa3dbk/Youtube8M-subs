60 frames per second television which is

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.230 
60 frames per second television which is
pretty<00:00:19.439> much<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.980> extent<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.850> you're<00:00:21.090> going

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
to get out of ps4 or Xbox one even

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.269 
to get out of ps4 or Xbox one even
though<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.350> could<00:00:25.529> do<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> little<00:00:25.859> bit<00:00:26.070> better

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
though you could do a little bit better

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.370 
though you could do a little bit better
if<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> computer<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.660> has<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.900> good

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
if you have a computer that has a good

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.689 
if you have a computer that has a good
amount<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.740> power<00:00:28.949> like<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.340> do

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
amount of power like I do

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.690 
amount of power like I do
but<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.689> prefer<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.199> play<00:00:31.289> my<00:00:31.529> games<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:32.160> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
but I prefer to play my games on a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.060 
but I prefer to play my games on a
console<00:00:33.600> simply<00:00:34.020> because<00:00:34.350> everybody's

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
console simply because everybody's

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.100 
console simply because everybody's
pretty<00:00:35.280> much<00:00:35.399> evenly<00:00:35.969> matched<00:00:36.180> when<00:00:36.930> you're

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
pretty much evenly matched when you're

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.889 
pretty much evenly matched when you're
using<00:00:37.380> remotes<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.059> consoles<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
using remotes for the consoles like the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.770 
using remotes for the consoles like the
Xbox<00:00:40.260> one<00:00:40.469> controller<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:41.129> ps4<00:00:41.399> controller

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
Xbox one controller the ps4 controller

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.369 
Xbox one controller the ps4 controller
but<00:00:42.780> anyway<00:00:43.610> far<00:00:44.610> cry<00:00:44.820> 4<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.239> exactly<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:46.050> Far

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
but anyway far cry 4 is exactly like Far

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.639 
but anyway far cry 4 is exactly like Far
Cry<00:00:46.530> 3<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:47.160> really<00:00:47.190> couldn't<00:00:48.149> find<00:00:48.410> anything<00:00:49.410> in

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649

this<00:00:49.860> game<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.489> was<00:00:50.700> very<00:00:50.789> different<00:00:51.329> from

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
this game that was very different from

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.860

towers by hacking and it's all done in

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.670 
towers by hacking and it's all done in
pretty<00:01:02.609> much<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> exact<00:01:03.180> same<00:01:03.420> way<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.870> far

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
pretty much the exact same way as far

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.570 
pretty much the exact same way as far
cry<00:01:04.920> 3<00:01:05.600> in<00:01:06.600> addition<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.619> hacking<00:01:08.010> towers<00:01:08.460> in

cry 3 in addition to hacking towers in

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.010 
cry 3 in addition to hacking towers in
order<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> map<00:01:09.420> they<00:01:09.840> have

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
order to see more of the map they have

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.890 
order to see more of the map they have
the<00:01:10.229> guard<00:01:10.590> posts<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.820> guard<00:01:12.090> posts<00:01:12.659> are

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the guard posts the guard posts are

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.289 
the guard posts the guard posts are
basically<00:01:13.890> mini<00:01:14.310> games<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
basically mini games just like the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.179 
basically mini games just like the
towers<00:01:15.689> are<00:01:15.869> but<00:01:16.110> those<00:01:16.320> minigames<00:01:16.920> are

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
towers are but those minigames are

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.990 
towers are but those minigames are
heavily<00:01:17.909> guarded<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:19.100> very<00:01:20.100> simply<00:01:20.640> anybody

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
heavily guarded and very simply anybody

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.580 
heavily guarded and very simply anybody
who<00:01:21.090> played<00:01:21.299> Far<00:01:21.509> Cry<00:01:21.659> 3<00:01:21.750> would<00:01:22.110> know<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
who played Far Cry 3 would know that the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
who played Far Cry 3 would know that the
easiest<00:01:22.979> way<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.130> beat<00:01:23.490> those<00:01:23.700> guard<00:01:24.060> posts<00:01:24.450> is

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
easiest way to beat those guard posts is

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.859 
easiest way to beat those guard posts is
to<00:01:25.229> take<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> sniper<00:01:25.979> rifle<00:01:26.280> shoot<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.479> alarm

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
to take a sniper rifle shoot the alarm

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.050 
to take a sniper rifle shoot the alarm
so<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.409> they<00:01:28.619> can't<00:01:28.950> call<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.610> help<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
so that they can't call for help and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.140 
so that they can't call for help and
then<00:01:30.659> after<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.259> shoot<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> alarm<00:01:32.070> or<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
then after you shoot the alarm or the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.210 
then after you shoot the alarm or the
alarms<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.810> there's<00:01:34.049> more<00:01:34.200> than<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.409> then<00:01:35.070> you

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
alarms if there's more than one then you

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.039 
alarms if there's more than one then you
just<00:01:35.490> proceed<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.090> go<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.570> kill<00:01:36.780> everybody

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
just proceed to go in and kill everybody

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.560 
just proceed to go in and kill everybody
there's<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.040> lot<00:01:38.280> more<00:01:38.579> ways<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.360> that

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
there's a lot more ways to do that

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.560 
there's a lot more ways to do that
though<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:40.530> for<00:01:40.560> instance<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.729> Far<00:01:42.329> Cry<00:01:42.479> 3

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570

Far Cry 4 that I've really seen is that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.190 
Far Cry 4 that I've really seen is that
there's<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.899> co-op<00:02:07.350> multiplayer<00:02:07.979> where

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.750 
you can play co-op and that's actually
pretty<00:02:14.810> good<00:02:15.019> I<00:02:15.319> was<00:02:16.010> playing<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.489> game<00:02:16.580> on

machine guns silenced weapons make the
game<00:02:37.910> very<00:02:38.180> easy<00:02:38.569> I<00:02:39.099> also<00:02:40.099> figured<00:02:40.610> out<00:02:40.879> that

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
game very easy I also figured out that

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.660 
game very easy I also figured out that
you<00:02:41.299> could<00:02:41.330> take<00:02:41.780> their<00:02:42.680> small<00:02:43.010> autogyro

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
you could take their small autogyro

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.699 
you could take their small autogyro
helicopters<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:44.750> can<00:02:44.930> take<00:02:45.170> those<00:02:45.440> and

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
helicopters and you can take those and

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.280 
helicopters and you can take those and
you<00:02:45.739> can<00:02:46.220> start<00:02:47.090> clearing<00:02:47.569> out<00:02:47.660> outposts<00:02:48.230> that

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
you can start clearing out outposts that

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.020 
you can start clearing out outposts that
you're<00:02:48.470> not<00:02:48.620> supposed<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.220> have<00:02:49.400> reached<00:02:49.670> yet

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
you're not supposed to have reached yet

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.270 
you're not supposed to have reached yet
even<00:02:50.810> though<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.140> difficulty<00:02:51.799> goes<00:02:52.010> up

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
even though the difficulty goes up

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.640 
even though the difficulty goes up
considerably<00:02:52.819> it's<00:02:53.540> actually<00:02:54.079> fun<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.470> do

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
considerably it's actually fun to do

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.710 
considerably it's actually fun to do
that<00:02:54.890> because<00:02:55.340> you're<00:02:55.519> reaching<00:02:55.970> portions<00:02:56.599> of

game that you normally wouldn't have

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.960

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
well just buy it upfront so that the

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.820
