00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
doing these unison things so it starts

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.750 
doing these unison things so it starts

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.490 

you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.240> use<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> lot<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.720> bar<00:01:31.020> movement<00:01:31.409> here

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
you can use a lot of bar movement here

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.399 
you can use a lot of bar movement here
because<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.799> sounds<00:01:32.070> pretty<00:01:33.079> now<00:01:34.079> let<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
because it sounds pretty now let the

hit it again now go to the D position an

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.240 
hit it again now go to the D position an
F<00:01:46.040> so<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:48.439> that's<00:01:49.439> five<00:01:49.799> five<00:01:50.520> four<00:01:51.000> and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.940 

5<00:02:33.060> 4<00:02:34.060> 5<00:02:34.330> 6<00:02:34.840> at<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.320> powder

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.610 

slide<00:02:38.760> back<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.150> three

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.360 

ok<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.830> eight<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.010> five<00:02:43.690> eight<00:02:44.690> petals

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.460 

we<00:02:49.180> did<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:49.450> before<00:02:49.629> we're<00:02:50.019> going<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.230> slide

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
we did this before we're going to slide

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.800 
we did this before we're going to slide
back<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:51.040> put<00:02:51.220> let<00:02:51.640> off<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.330> hit<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.629> F

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
back and put let off the a and hit the F

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.720 
back and put let off the a and hit the F
over

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.920 

so<00:02:58.730> we<00:02:58.849> just<00:02:59.000> went<00:02:59.120> up<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.420> six<00:03:00.849> then<00:03:01.849> 25<00:03:02.299> let<00:03:02.810> it

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
so we just went up to six then 25 let it

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:16.709 
so we just went up to six then 25 let it
off<00:03:04.659> six<00:03:05.659> be<00:03:08.530> back<00:03:09.530> before<00:03:11.709> five<00:03:12.709> peddling<00:03:13.370> on

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:16.719 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:25.069 

you<00:03:17.719> can<00:03:17.870> let<00:03:18.019> them<00:03:18.109> already<00:03:18.500> together

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.890 

and<00:03:26.079> then<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.379> can<00:03:26.530> either<00:03:26.709> just<00:03:27.159> start<00:03:27.489> on

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
and then you can either just start on

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.640 
and then you can either just start on
four<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.049> five<00:03:30.569> lot<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.719> vibrato<00:03:32.139> or<00:03:32.379> even

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
four and five lot of vibrato or even

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.190 
four and five lot of vibrato or even
slide<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.069> back<00:03:33.219> a<00:03:33.280> friend

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.729 

so<00:03:40.160> he<00:03:40.310> went<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:40.849> is<00:03:41.030> 3<00:03:41.300> and<00:03:41.450> 5<00:03:41.690> 45<00:03:44.560> back<00:03:45.560> two

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
so he went this is 3 and 5 45 back two

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.220 
so he went this is 3 and 5 45 back two

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
string so there we go A&amp;F all the way to

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.050 
string so there we go A&amp;F all the way to
a<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:06.850> B<00:04:07.180> at<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.050> test
