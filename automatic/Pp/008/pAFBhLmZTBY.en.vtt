clicks and after the second click it's a
chippy<00:02:35.139> louder<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:35.560> should<00:02:35.829> stay<00:02:36.129> in<00:02:36.250> place

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
was that the trigger guard is plastic

a<00:04:21.810> quick<00:04:22.710> thing<00:04:22.920> I<00:04:23.100> think<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.790> might<00:04:23.970> have

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
a quick thing I think I might have

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.760 
a quick thing I think I might have
gotten<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.330> lemon<00:04:24.600> with<00:04:24.750> this<00:04:24.900> one<00:04:25.080> only

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
gotten a lemon with this one only

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.160 
gotten a lemon with this one only
because<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.630> after<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:27.660> while<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:27.990> might

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
because the after a while this might

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.110 
because the after a while this might
happen<00:04:28.380> with<00:04:28.650> some<00:04:28.890> but<00:04:29.100> I<00:04:29.130> have<00:04:29.370> fixed<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:29.820> by

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
happen with some but I have fixed it by

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.600 
happen with some but I have fixed it by
tightening<00:04:30.390> screws<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:31.110> I'll<00:04:31.370> show<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.400> that

tightening screws and I'll show you that
on<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.850> disassembly<00:04:33.480> and<00:04:33.510> assembly<00:04:33.750> review

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
on the disassembly and assembly review

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.490 
on the disassembly and assembly review
and<00:04:34.910> what<00:04:35.910> happened<00:04:36.270> was<00:04:36.420> is<00:04:36.720> that<00:04:36.780> when<00:04:37.470> the

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
and what happened was is that when the

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.830 
and what happened was is that when the
boat<00:04:37.710> would<00:04:37.860> go<00:04:38.010> all<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.250> way<00:04:38.310> back<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:39.750> would

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
boat would go all the way back it would

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.390 
boat would go all the way back it would
stop<00:04:40.170> but<00:04:40.590> you<00:04:40.710> can<00:04:40.830> start<00:04:40.980> to<00:04:41.040> push<00:04:41.280> it

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
stop but you can start to push it

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.610 
stop but you can start to push it
forward<00:04:41.550> it<00:04:42.480> would<00:04:42.570> be<00:04:42.690> extremely<00:04:42.990> hard<00:04:43.500> to

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
forward it would be extremely hard to

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.140 
forward it would be extremely hard to
push<00:04:43.770> forward<00:04:44.070> and<00:04:44.190> also<00:04:44.460> know<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.700> slam

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
push forward and also know it a slam

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.720 
push forward and also know it a slam
back<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:46.590> boat<00:04:46.770> pull<00:04:46.980> is<00:04:47.190> not<00:04:47.430> very

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
back the boat pull is not very

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.610 
back the boat pull is not very
treacherous<00:04:48.150> on<00:04:48.480> this<00:04:48.600> it's<00:04:48.990> pretty<00:04:49.200> smooth<00:04:49.500> I

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
treacherous on this it's pretty smooth I

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.070 
treacherous on this it's pretty smooth I
can<00:04:49.770> do<00:04:49.830> it<00:04:49.890> with<00:04:49.980> one<00:04:50.010> finger<00:04:50.180> but<00:04:51.180> I'm<00:04:51.810> used

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
can do it with one finger but I'm used

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.950 
can do it with one finger but I'm used
to<00:04:52.140> that<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:53.130> now<00:04:53.940> there's<00:04:54.300> only<00:04:54.450> one<00:04:54.780> problem

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
to that and now there's only one problem

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.170 
to that and now there's only one problem
that<00:04:55.200> I<00:04:55.290> have<00:04:55.470> with<00:04:55.500> this<00:04:55.740> gun<00:04:56.010> which<00:04:56.850> would<00:04:57.060> be

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
that I have with this gun which would be

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.620 
that I have with this gun which would be
the<00:04:57.360> fact<00:04:57.570> that<00:04:59.000> when<00:05:00.000> you<00:05:00.090> push<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.450> forward

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
the fact that when you push it forward

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.280 
the fact that when you push it forward
it<00:05:01.560> takes<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:01.980> whole<00:05:02.310> bunch<00:05:02.640> of<00:05:02.730> effort<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.330> push

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
it takes a whole bunch of effort to push

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.400 
it takes a whole bunch of effort to push
it<00:05:04.410> back<00:05:04.620> in<00:05:05.210> I'm<00:05:06.210> not<00:05:06.360> sure<00:05:06.420> why<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:06.780> is<00:05:07.020> I'm

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
it back in I'm not sure why that is I'm

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.880 
it back in I'm not sure why that is I'm
going<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.650> relive<00:05:08.010> it<00:05:08.130> again<00:05:09.680> it<00:05:10.680> could<00:05:10.860> just

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
going to relive it again it could just

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.410 
going to relive it again it could just
be<00:05:11.010> some<00:05:11.190> screws<00:05:11.550> or<00:05:11.790> something<00:05:12.060> when<00:05:12.180> I<00:05:12.240> take

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
be some screws or something when I take

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.600 
be some screws or something when I take
it<00:05:12.510> apart<00:05:12.810> again<00:05:13.230> I<00:05:13.500> will<00:05:13.710> try<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.250> fix<00:05:14.460> that

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
it apart again I will try to fix that

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.450 
it apart again I will try to fix that
problem<00:05:14.760> but<00:05:15.210> it's<00:05:15.450> nothing<00:05:15.780> too<00:05:15.930> bad<00:05:16.080> because

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
problem but it's nothing too bad because

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
problem but it's nothing too bad because
when<00:05:17.460> you<00:05:17.550> get<00:05:17.640> used<00:05:17.820> to<00:05:17.880> in<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.030> time<00:05:18.210> too

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
when you get used to in the time too

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.760 
when you get used to in the time too
horrible<00:05:18.919> it'll<00:05:19.919> give<00:05:20.040> your<00:05:20.160> arm<00:05:20.280> strength

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770

rail under here is loose I have both
screws<00:06:34.680> in<00:06:34.860> here<00:06:35.069> and<00:06:35.160> it's<00:06:35.310> still<00:06:35.819> just<00:06:35.940> a<00:06:36.090> wee

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
screws in here and it's still just a wee

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.480 
screws in here and it's still just a wee
bit<00:06:36.270> loose<00:06:36.629> but<00:06:37.009> it's<00:06:38.009> nothing<00:06:38.159> to<00:06:38.310> really

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
bit loose but it's nothing to really

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.909 
bit loose but it's nothing to really
worry<00:06:38.580> about<00:06:39.440> something<00:06:40.440> about<00:06:40.530> the<00:06:40.680> scope

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 
worry about something about the scope

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:43.399 
worry about something about the scope
also<00:06:41.370> is<00:06:41.580> that<00:06:41.940> it<00:06:42.210> is<00:06:42.360> illuminated<00:06:42.870> for<00:06:43.139> only

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:43.409 
also is that it is illuminated for only

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:45.800 
also is that it is illuminated for only
read<00:06:43.830> there<00:06:44.220> is<00:06:44.370> no<00:06:44.520> green<00:06:44.759> setting<00:06:45.120> but

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
view of it in a second but it's very

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.300 
view of it in a second but it's very
bright<00:06:56.909> so<00:06:57.599> he's<00:06:57.870> at<00:06:58.020> day<00:06:58.289> or<00:06:58.530> five<00:06:59.009> me<00:06:59.099> twenty

might<00:07:01.740> not<00:07:01.830> be<00:07:01.949> able<00:07:02.009> to<00:07:02.130> see<00:07:02.280> it<00:07:02.310> I<00:07:02.460> doubt<00:07:02.639> you

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 
might not be able to see it I doubt you

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:06.559 
might not be able to see it I doubt you
can<00:07:02.940> either<00:07:03.090> but<00:07:04.699> it's<00:07:05.699> it's<00:07:06.000> pretty<00:07:06.210> low<00:07:06.389> I

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:06.569 
can either but it's it's pretty low I

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:08.540 
can either but it's it's pretty low I
mean<00:07:06.720> it's<00:07:06.840> great<00:07:07.169> for<00:07:07.470> dark<00:07:07.710> tonight<00:07:07.919> I'm

mean it's great for dark tonight I'm

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.890 
mean it's great for dark tonight I'm
when<00:07:08.789> you<00:07:08.909> can't<00:07:09.120> see<00:07:09.240> the<00:07:09.330> black<00:07:09.539> but<00:07:09.810> you

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
when you can't see the black but you

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.570 
when you can't see the black but you
need<00:07:10.050> something<00:07:10.470> so<00:07:10.620> you<00:07:10.710> can<00:07:10.740> see<00:07:11.479> the<00:07:13.580> range

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 
need something so you can see the range

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.050 
need something so you can see the range
from<00:07:14.789> your<00:07:15.030> eye<00:07:15.060> is<00:07:15.680> about<00:07:16.680> three<00:07:17.280> inches<00:07:17.580> this

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 
from your eye is about three inches this

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.270 
from your eye is about three inches this
about<00:07:18.240> as<00:07:18.389> far<00:07:18.539> as<00:07:18.599> you<00:07:18.750> have<00:07:18.840> to<00:07:18.930> go<00:07:19.280> any

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 
about as far as you have to go any

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.830 
about as far as you have to go any
closer<00:07:20.669> than<00:07:20.819> that<00:07:20.940> and<00:07:21.300> it'll<00:07:21.569> start<00:07:21.810> to

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 
closer than that and it'll start to

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.129 
closer than that and it'll start to
ghost<00:07:22.819> another<00:07:23.819> thing<00:07:24.000> about<00:07:24.180> this<00:07:24.360> is<00:07:24.419> that<00:07:24.630> I

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:25.139 
ghost another thing about this is that I

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:27.740 
ghost another thing about this is that I
know<00:07:26.039> you<00:07:26.159> can't<00:07:26.370> see<00:07:26.430> this<00:07:26.610> possible<00:07:27.240> but

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:27.750 
know you can't see this possible but

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.709 
know you can't see this possible but
inside<00:07:28.469> the<00:07:28.800> crosshairs<00:07:29.009> you<00:07:29.759> have<00:07:30.000> regular

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:30.719 
inside the crosshairs you have regular

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:33.320 
inside the crosshairs you have regular
crosshairs<00:07:31.199> with<00:07:31.500> a<00:07:32.060> bullet<00:07:33.060> drop

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.330 
crosshairs with a bullet drop

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.300 
crosshairs with a bullet drop
compensator<00:07:33.840> and<00:07:34.050> then<00:07:34.469> below<00:07:34.800> that<00:07:34.830> you<00:07:35.190> have

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.310 
compensator and then below that you have

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.040 
compensator and then below that you have
an<00:07:35.400> even<00:07:35.639> bigger<00:07:35.940> bowl<00:07:36.180> about<00:07:36.449> compensator

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.050 
an even bigger bowl about compensator

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.939 
an even bigger bowl about compensator
which<00:07:37.289> I<00:07:38.009> find<00:07:38.250> very<00:07:38.900> useful<00:07:39.900> it's<00:07:40.560> very<00:07:40.770> nice

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:40.949 
which I find very useful it's very nice

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:44.990 
which I find very useful it's very nice
a<00:07:41.250> good<00:07:41.639> addition<00:07:41.789> to<00:07:41.940> the<00:07:42.060> scope<00:07:42.270> and<00:07:42.479> I<00:07:44.000> had

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 
a good addition to the scope and I had

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.459 
a good addition to the scope and I had
sent<00:07:45.150> out<00:07:45.300> was<00:07:45.419> a<00:07:45.479> great<00:07:45.630> idea<00:07:45.659> by<00:07:46.080> whoever

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:46.469
