the different phases here which I might

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.720 
the different phases here which I might
go<00:00:37.230> through<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.620> show<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.770> step-by-step<00:00:38.190> how

go through and show you step-by-step how
to<00:00:38.760> do<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.469> first<00:00:40.469> thing<00:00:40.649> we're<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> do

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to do it first thing we're going to do

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.250 
to do it first thing we're going to do
is<00:00:41.250> we're<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> take<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.940> regular<00:00:42.870> type<00:00:43.079> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
is we're going to take a regular type of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.840 
is we're going to take a regular type of
treat<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.770> case<00:00:44.010> I'm<00:00:44.219> using<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.610> round

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
treat in this case I'm using a round

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.959 
treat in this case I'm using a round
type<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.510> tree<00:00:46.039> then<00:00:47.039> we're<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.460> mix<00:00:47.789> up

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
type of tree then we're going to mix up

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.510 
type of tree then we're going to mix up
the<00:00:48.239> royal<00:00:48.660> icing<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.739> case<00:00:49.980> I'm<00:00:50.250> using

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the royal icing in this case I'm using

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.400 
the royal icing in this case I'm using
white<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.360> use<00:00:51.600> whatever<00:00:51.809> color<00:00:52.199> you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
white but you can use whatever color you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.840 
white but you can use whatever color you
want<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:54.270> simply<00:00:54.510> spoon<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.670> top

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
want and we simply spoon it on to on top

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.189 
want and we simply spoon it on to on top
of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.090> tree<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:59.359> spread<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> around<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.960> that

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
of the tree and spread it around so that

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.080 
of the tree and spread it around so that
we<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> nice<00:01:01.710> even<00:01:01.980> coating

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.539 

as<00:01:09.049> you<00:01:09.229> can<00:01:09.320> see<00:01:09.530> it's<00:01:09.649> very<00:01:09.740> easy<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.460> work

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
as you can see it's very easy to work

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.349 
as you can see it's very easy to work
with<00:01:10.609> and<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.689> royal<00:01:11.929> icing<00:01:12.079> will<00:01:12.920> pool<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.240> it

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359 
with and the royal icing will pool so it

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.380 
with and the royal icing will pool so it
gives<00:01:14.509> you<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.630> nice<00:01:14.869> smooth<00:01:15.679> coating<00:01:16.490> as<00:01:16.819> it

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
gives you a nice smooth coating as it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.950 
gives you a nice smooth coating as it
sits<00:01:18.159> now<00:01:19.159> we've<00:01:19.340> got<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.670> base<00:01:19.880> imagine<00:01:20.840> if

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
sits now we've got the base imagine if

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.690 
sits now we've got the base imagine if
you<00:01:21.049> wanted<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.409> do<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.530> pumpkin<00:01:21.920> for<00:01:22.189> example

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
you wanted to do a pumpkin for example

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.850 
you wanted to do a pumpkin for example
you<00:01:22.880> might<00:01:23.060> use<00:01:23.119> an<00:01:23.479> orange<00:01:23.899> color<00:01:24.170> base<00:01:24.500> and

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
you might use an orange color base and

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.219 
you might use an orange color base and
then<00:01:25.459> a<00:01:25.700> black<00:01:26.209> color

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
then a black color

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.830 
then a black color
web<00:01:27.469> design<00:01:27.950> in<00:01:28.219> this<00:01:28.700> case<00:01:28.969> we<00:01:29.299> use<00:01:29.509> blue

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
web design in this case we use blue

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.169 
web design in this case we use blue
because<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.500> shows<00:01:30.740> up<00:01:30.979> better<00:01:31.250> on<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.909> video

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
because it shows up better on the video

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.050 
because it shows up better on the video
we<00:01:32.479> wanted<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:32.869> to<00:01:32.899> see<00:01:33.170> how<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.439> worked<00:01:33.740> I

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
we wanted you to see how it worked I

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.449 
we wanted you to see how it worked I
mixed<00:01:35.060> up<00:01:35.179> some<00:01:35.240> additional<00:01:36.049> royal<00:01:36.799> icing<00:01:37.009> I

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
mixed up some additional royal icing I

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.849 
mixed up some additional royal icing I
added<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.850> blue<00:01:38.030> color<00:01:38.299> to<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:38.959> put<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.649> in<00:01:39.770> a

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
added the blue color to it I put it in a

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.339 
added the blue color to it I put it in a
ziplock<00:01:40.280> bag<00:01:40.610> I<00:01:40.939> cut<00:01:41.209> the<00:01:41.329> corner<00:01:41.689> I<00:01:41.720> put<00:01:42.140> a

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:46.539 
ziplock bag I cut the corner I put a
small<00:01:42.950> piping<00:01:43.459> tip<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.950> all<00:01:45.950> I'm<00:01:46.159> gonna<00:01:46.310> do

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:09.969 
you can see how easy this comes out and
then<00:02:09.049> in<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.229> middle<00:02:09.410> I'm<00:02:09.530> gonna<00:02:09.679> give<00:02:09.829> it<00:02:09.860> a

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
then in the middle I'm gonna give it a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.150 
then in the middle I'm gonna give it a
nice<00:02:10.160> little<00:02:10.700> dab<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:12.560> now<00:02:12.680> we've<00:02:12.829> got<00:02:13.010> what

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
nice little dab so now we've got what

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.039 
nice little dab so now we've got what
looks<00:02:13.280> like<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.519> target<00:02:13.970> design<00:02:14.329> which<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:15.019> a

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
looks like a target design which is a

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.470 
looks like a target design which is a
design<00:02:15.380> in<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.799> of<00:02:15.889> itself<00:02:16.190> but<00:02:17.090> we<00:02:17.209> want<00:02:17.389> to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
design in and of itself but we want to

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.599 
design in and of itself but we want to
take<00:02:17.630> this<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:18.709> want<00:02:18.889> to<00:02:18.980> transform<00:02:19.400> it

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:19.609 
take this and we want to transform it

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.050 
take this and we want to transform it
into<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:20.329> web<00:02:20.540> as<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.109> see<00:02:21.319> here<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.730> all<00:02:22.910> we

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
into the web as you see here so all we

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.870 
into the web as you see here so all we
do<00:02:23.209> is<00:02:23.660> we<00:02:23.870> take<00:02:24.049> a<00:02:24.109> toothpick<00:02:24.880> basic

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
do is we take a toothpick basic

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.240 
do is we take a toothpick basic
household<00:02:26.299> toothpick<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.739> you're<00:02:28.010> going<00:02:28.190> to

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
household toothpick and you're going to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.009 
household toothpick and you're going to
put<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.549> right<00:02:28.700> down<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.359> middle<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.870> the

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
put it right down in the middle of the

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.099 
put it right down in the middle of the
center<00:02:30.440> dot<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:32.269> then<00:02:32.480> you're<00:02:32.599> gonna<00:02:32.690> drag

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
center dot and then you're gonna drag

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.069 
center dot and then you're gonna drag
outwards<00:02:33.530> all<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.549> way<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:35.090> edge<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.930> the

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
outwards all the way to the edge of the

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.650 
outwards all the way to the edge of the
treat<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.760> you're<00:02:37.910> simply<00:02:38.239> going<00:02:38.389> to<00:02:38.450> repeat

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
treat and you're simply going to repeat

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:47.070 
treat and you're simply going to repeat
that<00:02:39.609> as<00:02:40.609> you<00:02:40.790> go<00:02:40.910> around<00:02:42.609> and<00:02:43.609> around

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.570 

you<00:02:48.080> can<00:02:48.260> see<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.530> design<00:02:48.800> starting<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.400> take

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
you can see the design starting to take

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.720 
you can see the design starting to take
shape<00:02:49.610> now

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.589 

and<00:02:56.239> one<00:02:56.569> last<00:02:56.870> one<00:02:57.849> take<00:02:58.849> a<00:02:58.910> look<00:02:58.970> at<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.360> if

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
and one last one take a look at that if

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.150 
and one last one take a look at that if
that<00:02:59.750> doesn't<00:03:00.140> look<00:03:00.230> like<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.470> web<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:00.980> don't

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
that doesn't look like a web I don't

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.610 
that doesn't look like a web I don't
know<00:03:01.280> what<00:03:01.489> does<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:02.660> saw<00:03:02.900> how<00:03:03.110> simple<00:03:03.140> that

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
probably a maximum of maybe 20 seconds

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.690 
probably a maximum of maybe 20 seconds
