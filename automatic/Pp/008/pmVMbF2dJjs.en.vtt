00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:10.530

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.050
 applications such and such here not here 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.050
 it's a little bit different 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.870
 installing applications are the games 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:47.480

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:51.030

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.260

 Sorry guys, let's show you how. 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:12.450
 It was the device after after 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.070
 what I was doing if I had to do it 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.090
 another restoration afterwards to 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:23.240
 person but it's to show you 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:23.240
 Do you have a google account, no? 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:34.510
 Let's show you just how to see. 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:37.050
 as I stay here I do not recommend that 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:44.080
 You do it here, it's okay. 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:46.750
 read configure promptly restored from 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:51.670
 factory , the unit time is wrong 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:54.880
 It's not midnight now It's now it's 10 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:58.650
 By ten at night it's wrong because 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.430
 it does not have the network timing 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.680
 cell phone 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.150
 the clear synchronization that is automatic 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:09.220
 so he comes 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:10.870
 that way if a lot is with many 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.870
 applications 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.120
 so that's it he did not have anything else 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:19.180
 the memory already had memory impact 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.170
 but it 's always good to take the chip off and a 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.300
 micro usb 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.990
 I was going to end up live without showing and 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.760
