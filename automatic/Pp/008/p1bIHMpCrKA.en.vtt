over the years I pretty much changed the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.279 
over the years I pretty much changed the
way<00:00:22.289> however<00:00:22.560> happened<00:00:23.279> um<00:00:24.109> usually<00:00:25.109> I'll

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
way however happened um usually I'll

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.279 
way however happened um usually I'll
wrap<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> right<00:00:26.090> okay<00:00:27.090> sometimes<00:00:27.599> I'll

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
wrap to the right okay sometimes I'll

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.080 
wrap to the right okay sometimes I'll
wrap<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> left<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.670> know<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.060> just

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090

depends<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.560> pretty<00:00:31.920> much<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.520> keep

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
depends so you pretty much have to keep

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.080 
depends so you pretty much have to keep
doing<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.390> until<00:00:33.649> you<00:00:34.649> feel<00:00:34.980> comfortable<00:00:35.090> and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
just until you perfect it so i usually

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.920 
just until you perfect it so i usually
use<00:00:39.660> my<00:00:40.170> big<00:00:40.530> tooth<00:00:40.890> broken<00:00:41.340> comb<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.809> i

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.190 

just<00:01:27.070> like<00:01:27.280> this<00:01:30.180> making<00:01:31.180> short<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.689> I<00:01:31.750> use<00:01:31.960> my

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
just like this making short and I use my

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.289 
just like this making short and I use my
hand<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:32.680> keep<00:01:32.979> pushing<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.119> this<00:01:34.420> way<00:01:34.979> okay

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
hand to keep pushing it this way okay

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.539 
hand to keep pushing it this way okay
I'd<00:01:37.299> use<00:01:37.540> my<00:01:37.570> hands<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.440> keep<00:01:38.680> pushing<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.369> and

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
I'd use my hands to keep pushing it and

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.859 
I'd use my hands to keep pushing it and
then<00:01:39.729> I<00:01:39.850> just<00:01:40.060> go<00:01:40.270> like<00:01:40.299> this<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:43.420> hold<00:01:43.720> the

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.300 
then I just go like this and I hold the
top<00:01:44.140> because<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.500> top<00:01:44.740> might<00:01:44.950> get<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.159> little

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
top because the top might get a little

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.210 
top because the top might get a little
puffy<00:01:45.580> so<00:01:45.970> I'll<00:01:46.060> hold<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.420> top<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:47.049> then<00:01:47.770> I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
puffy so I'll hold the top and then I

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.249 
puffy so I'll hold the top and then I
just<00:01:48.549> keep<00:01:48.789> going<00:01:49.330> around<00:01:49.630> in<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.229> circle
