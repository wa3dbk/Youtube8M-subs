00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.330
 today's topic is going to be packaging and 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.330
 packaging 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.510
 we have constantly seen that in the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.750
 Foreign trade involves a series 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.970
 of activities of equal importance 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.789
 than the others because they all lead to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.099
 the commercial export activity the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.859
 correct choice of containers and packaging 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:30.439
 for product export do 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.439
 of international buying and selling 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.570
 a very important tool 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.540
 what are the functions of my containers 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.150
 and packaging the container the container 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.640
 example is the material that contains the 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.550
 product and that is in direct contact 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.980
 with him keeping protecting him from 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.620
 the merchandise and distinguishing that of the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.990
 In addition, the function of the container is 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.690
 communication between the point of sale and 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.400
 the clients becoming that in the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.530
 best cover letter of the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.070
 company what are the characteristics 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.410
 of the package the characteristics are 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.479
 avoid the acquisition of moisture 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.000
 outdoors the longest duration 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.660
 on the shelves avoid contamination 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.610
 external improve the duration time of 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.800
 The characteristics of the product between 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.260
 many others but these are the most 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.490
 essentials and the functions of 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.440
 packaging the container contains the product 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.900
 communicate because also 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.550
 provides the necessary information so that 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.190
 can be transported in the trade 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.090
 international provides comfort because 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.480
 Makes my product in good condition 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.820
 it protects him also for this very reason 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 because it makes my product can not be 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:57.970
 altered by the air or by the things of 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.800
 the climatology provides security for 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.790
 that my product is not damaged and 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.790
 dose too 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.819
 the functions of containers and packaging 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.380
 a packaging in this case we are also going to 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.230
 say that it is used for 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.780
 preservation of packaging therefore 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.850
 my product as well as also 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.260
 allows to facilitate the manipulation 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.190
 during the physical distribution 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.190
 international 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.720
 the characteristics are the manipulated 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.470
 during loading and unloading the best 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.600
 Stacking 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.680
 the best impact capability and the 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.680
 vibration of the merchandise 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.050
 what are the functions of my containers 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.050
 and packaging 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.250
 actually from my packaging that are going to 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.300
 facilitate the physical distribution of 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.900
 international the chain d 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.250
 the unit ariza tion that they are going to do 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.130
 individualize them in containers and in 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.080
 paddles protection against impact 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.080
 with vertical pressure vibration 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.430
 dust rain temperature insects 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.110
 rodents and thieves and makes you can 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.630
 perform the chain very well 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.490
 international physical distribution my 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.500
 transport my manipulation and my 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.000
 storage as well as the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.800
 Proper display of my product 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.310
 what are the types of masses and 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.310
 packaging 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.599
 cardboard containers wooden containers 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.799
 glass containers metal wicker cans 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.799
 plastics and rolls 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.390
 We have three levels of packing them 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.180
 are the primary the secondary and the 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.210
 tertiary the primary is the one that is 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.600
 in direct contact with the product 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.390
 it is very intrinsic 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.390
 many times it is also called a container 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.090
 primary the secondary that protects the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.310
 primary packaging and usually 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.890
 discharge is discarded at the time of 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.890
 use that is to say it does not fulfill a linked function 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.710
 directly with the use can be the 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.380
 packing that covers 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.450
 in tertiary is one that protects the 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.340
 product for transportation and 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.280
 It generally contains several units 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.870
 of the individual product for many this 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.720
 level is the one that gets the name 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.450
 specific packing 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.450
 in this case this is the photo that is 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.880
 to see the three types of photos from the 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.880
 first container 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.600
 the optimal optical design of a packaging 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.610
 when that design packing 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.010
 a first aspect is to consider that the 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.170
 type of product pack so it is 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.810
 must have clear aspects such as 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.270
 product characteristics costs 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.220
 Packing national regulations 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.500
 and international 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.950
 Loading capacity conditions 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.630
 climatological the shape of me or the type 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.330
 of container used by your 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.100
 transport and type of warehouse use and 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.900
 the time and transport route 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.710
 these are some of the types of 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.180
 marking or pictorial symbols that 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.950
 represent in those in the packaging and 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.470
 that should be indicated according to the type 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.849
 of product that I am going to export 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.159
 in this case 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.479
 the arrows up mean 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:35.009
 that the product has to be 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.009
 oriented towards the upper hand 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.600
 Do not use hooks because they can alter the 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.520
 product or keep dry 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.130
 because contact with moisture can 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.530
 make the product deteriorates to 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.360
 just keep it cool do not roll what 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.560
 because you can make that from that 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.110
 I can spill 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.700
 any type of liquid 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.170
 do not put the truck in a place this 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.020
 in a place that can alter the 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.870
 product 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.490
 do not use clamps by the sides 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.490
 because they can alter it too 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.990
 that's grace 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.270
 packaging 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.320
 thanks to the packing we can get a 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.320
 customer satisfaction
