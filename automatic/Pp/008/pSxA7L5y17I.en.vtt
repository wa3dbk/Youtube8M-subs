00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
DM 5 it's very easy to get around we've

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.689 
DM 5 it's very easy to get around we've
added<00:01:03.049> a<00:01:03.199> much<00:01:03.350> larger<00:01:03.830> screen<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:04.489> you<00:01:04.580> can

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
see much more information on it but it's

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.350 
see much more information on it but it's
not<00:01:06.920> just<00:01:07.189> about<00:01:07.310> getting<00:01:07.610> around<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.119> using

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
not just about getting around and using

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.609 
not just about getting around and using
the<00:01:08.450> functions<00:01:08.840> it's<00:01:08.960> also<00:01:09.110> about<00:01:09.350> how<00:01:09.500> it

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
the functions it's also about how it

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.109 
the functions it's also about how it
sounds<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.130> what<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:10.310> can<00:01:10.460> do<00:01:10.640> with<00:01:10.820> it<00:01:10.970> but

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
sounds and what you can do with it but

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.910 
sounds and what you can do with it but
one<00:01:11.630> of<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:11.780> most<00:01:11.930> important<00:01:12.470> parts<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.799> the

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
one of the most important parts of the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.370 
one of the most important parts of the
DM<00:01:13.130> 10<00:01:13.369> is<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.579> we<00:01:13.729> actually<00:01:14.060> sampled<00:01:14.380> more

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
DM 10 is that we actually sampled more

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.140 
DM 10 is that we actually sampled more
than<00:01:15.500> a<00:01:15.560> thousand<00:01:16.070> real<00:01:16.549> drums<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.030> real

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
than a thousand real drums and real

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.910 
than a thousand real drums and real
cymbals<00:01:17.509> into<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.840> DM<00:01:18.079> 10<00:01:18.290> ourselves<00:01:18.799> they're

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
cymbals into the DM 10 ourselves they're

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.740 
cymbals into the DM 10 ourselves they're
all<00:01:19.009> multi<00:01:19.369> sampled<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.270> get<00:01:20.390> incredible

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
all multi sampled so you get incredible

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.440 
all multi sampled so you get incredible
realism<00:01:21.470> as<00:01:22.189> you<00:01:22.430> hit<00:01:22.579> the<00:01:22.610> drum<00:01:22.909> harder<00:01:23.270> or

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
realism as you hit the drum harder or

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.630 
realism as you hit the drum harder or
softer<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.930> get<00:01:24.079> changes<00:01:24.500> in<00:01:24.650> in<00:01:24.920> Tambor<00:01:25.490> and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
softer you get changes in in Tambor and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.190 
softer you get changes in in Tambor and
color<00:01:25.820> just<00:01:26.090> like<00:01:26.270> an<00:01:26.390> acoustic<00:01:26.780> drum<00:01:26.899> does

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
color just like an acoustic drum does

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.109 
color just like an acoustic drum does
and<00:01:27.439> we<00:01:27.499> used<00:01:27.679> really<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.100> highest<00:01:28.310> first

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
and we used really the highest first

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.599

drum heads they're all dual zone as I
mentioned<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.670> then<00:02:45.000> our<00:02:45.120> cymbals<00:02:45.600> these<00:02:45.750> are

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
mentioned and then our cymbals these are

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.890 
mentioned and then our cymbals these are
our<00:02:45.930> new<00:02:46.050> DM<00:02:46.410> pad<00:02:46.769> cymbals<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:48.030> year<00:02:48.540> ago<00:02:48.750> we

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
our new DM pad cymbals a year ago we

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.630 
our new DM pad cymbals a year ago we
introduced<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> surge<00:02:49.680> cymbals<00:02:50.190> are<00:02:50.340> premium

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
introduced the surge cymbals are premium

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.309 
introduced the surge cymbals are premium
Cymbeline<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.360> are<00:02:51.450> made<00:02:51.569> from<00:02:51.720> real<00:02:51.930> cymbal

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
Cymbeline that are made from real cymbal

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.050 
Cymbeline that are made from real cymbal
alloy<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:52.890> what<00:02:53.190> people<00:02:53.280> find<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.850> for

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
alloy but what people find is for

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.309 
alloy but what people find is for
studios<00:02:54.450> they<00:02:54.630> can<00:02:54.750> be<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.870> little<00:02:54.959> bit<00:02:55.170> noisy

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
studios they can be a little bit noisy

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.920 
studios they can be a little bit noisy
so<00:02:56.130> we<00:02:56.370> came<00:02:56.549> out<00:02:56.670> with<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.880> DM<00:02:57.209> pad<00:02:57.480> cymbals

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
so we came out with the DM pad cymbals

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.630 
so we came out with the DM pad cymbals
is<00:02:58.080> an<00:02:58.230> alternative<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.950> search<00:02:59.190> cymbals

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
is an alternative to the search cymbals

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.030 
is an alternative to the search cymbals
they're<00:03:00.239> rubber<00:03:01.080> playing<00:03:01.500> surface<00:03:01.920> so

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
they're rubber playing surface so

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.400 
they're rubber playing surface so
they're<00:03:02.160> much<00:03:02.340> quieter<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.299> terms<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:04.019> keeping

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
they're much quieter in terms of keeping

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.840 
they're much quieter in terms of keeping
noise<00:03:04.739> down<00:03:05.010> they<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:05.400> all<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.670> same

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
noise down they have all the same

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.640 
noise down they have all the same
functionality<00:03:06.000> as<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:07.049> search<00:03:07.230> symbol<00:03:07.560> so

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
functionality as the search symbol so

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.140 
functionality as the search symbol so
you<00:03:07.739> have<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:07.860> triple<00:03:08.130> zone<00:03:08.400> ride<00:03:08.640> with<00:03:08.910> Bell

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
you have a triple zone ride with Bell

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.600 
you have a triple zone ride with Bell
face<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.810> edge<00:03:10.350> give<00:03:10.769> choke<00:03:11.100> on<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.370> crash
