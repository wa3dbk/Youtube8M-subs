00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
 Our task is to find 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.210
 how much is 10 in fifth grade. 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.190
 10 at fifth degree means picking up a unit 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.860
 and multiply it by 10 times. 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.180
 So let's do it. 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.600
 That's three, four and five. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.420
 We have 1, multiplied by 10, by 10, by 10, by 10, by 10. 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.240
 Note: one, two, three, four, five. 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.730
 How will this be equal? 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.670
 1, multiplied by 10, is 10. 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.081
 10 by 10 is 100. 

00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.800
 100 by 10 is 1000. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.070
 1000 in 10 is 10,000. 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.450
 10,000 per 10 is 100,000. 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.060
 So the result here will be 100,000. 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.810
 So, maybe he noticed that every time we multiply by 10, 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.790
 add one to the result. 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.930
 So if we multiply 10 times, 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.920
 we will add five zeros to the work. 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.110
 And here we literally have 1, followed by 5 zeros - 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.360
 one, two, three, four, five. 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.900
 10 per fifth is equal to 100,000. 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.300
 Let us deal with another similar example. 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.460
 How many zeros contain the work 67 at (10th degree)? 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.000
 We can look at this in several ways. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.430
 67, multiplied by 10 by fifth degree, 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.805
 gives exactly the same as 67 on ... 

00:01:33.805 --> 00:01:36.130
 We can use exactly the same logic, 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.900
 which we saw in the previous task. 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.470
 Thus, 67, multiplied by 1, by 10, by 10, by 10, by 10, by 10. 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.680
 We have already found exactly how much he does. 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.050
 If we have 1 multiplied by 10 times five times, 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.720
 this here will give 1 with five zeros thereafter. 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.710
 One, two, three, four, five. 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.309
 Or it would be 100,000. 

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:02.100
 So two are the ways we can think. 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.391
 If we only look at this work here, 

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:07.126
 we can say, "Well, 67, multiplied by 1, will be equal to 67." 

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.750
 And then every time we multiply by 10, 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.000
 we will add a zero. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.860
 So we can say that this will be equal to 67, 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.800
 and multiply by ten times five times, 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.440
 so here we will add 5 zeros. 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.440
 One, two, three, four, five. 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.487
 That's how we get to 6,700,000. 

00:02:24.487 --> 00:02:26.070
 Another way we can think - 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.830
 this is exactly the same as 67, multiplied by 100,000. 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.660
 And we get 67, and then we have five zeros. 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.300
 Again, one, two, three, four, five. 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.840
 We get exactly the same value. 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.670
 Let's see another example. 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:48.060
 How many zeros have 5,700,000 divided by 10th at third grade? 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.550
 10 at third grade already know it. 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.130
 10 at third degree - this is the same as 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.140
 1, multiplied by 10 by 10 by 10, which is 1000. 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.194
 So if we separate this, we get the same. 

00:03:03.194 --> 00:03:05.310
 There is another way we can write this expression. 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.740
 5 700 000, divided by 10 in third grade, 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.720
 is equal to - I can write it this way: 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.711
 5 700 000 divided by 10 in 10 by 10. 

00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:27.230
 Here we can write 1, but that will not change the value. 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.545
 And this is equivalent to 5,700,000, 

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.634
 divided by 1000. 

00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:37.210
 Whichever way to choose, 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.660
 every time you divide by 10, 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.850
 you will get one of those zeros. 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.130
 So if you divide 10 times three times - 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.897
 if we divide at 10 once, we get a 0; 

00:03:46.897 --> 00:03:49.230
 divide to 10 again and remove another 0; 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.780
 Again divide by 10 and remove 0 more. 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.350
 And we have 5700. 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.210
 Another way to think: 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.860
 if I divide into something that has three zeros, 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.530
 I will remove three zeros. 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.122
 And if I remove three zeros, I will stay with 5700. 

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:09.700
 So, to be clear, I can do this, 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.170
 because here we had 1,000. 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.170
 If it was 3000 or similar, 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.680
 I could represent it as 3 times a thousand. 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.860
 And then I will cut only 1000 with those zeros. 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.600
 But at 3 I will have to split extra. 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.570
 I'm dividing 1000 - 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.890
 I'm doing a 10th grade division. 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.500
 Here I have three zeros. 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.120
 I can cut three zeros out there. 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.220
 Let's take another example. 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.890
 In fact, we have several examples. 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.470
 And these are the kind of questions, 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.350
 which you can see in the exercises. 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.780
 When 72.1 multiplied by 10 in the third degree, 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.410
 the decimal point moves [empty space] positions to [empty space]. 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.280
 In the exercise you can see a little arrow here. 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.480
 So remember: if we multiply more, 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.347
 here we have essentially 10 degrees three, 

00:04:55.347 --> 00:04:56.700
 so we multiply by 1000, 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.030
 then we will get a larger number. 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.550
 We will not get a smaller number. 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.770
 And every time we multiply by 10, 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.070
 our decimal comma will move to the right, 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.490
 because we increase the number. 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.450
 We will move the decimal point ... 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.827
 At 72.1, if we multiply by 10 once, 

00:05:12.827 --> 00:05:14.895
 we will move the decimal point once. 

00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:17.820
 And we'll get 721, which is logical. 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.080
 72, multiplied by 10, is 720. 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.810
 72.1, multiplied by 10, must be 721. 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.094
 But if we want to multiply by ten times, 

00:05:25.094 --> 00:05:27.010
 we will move the decimal point 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.122
 not just once, but twice and three times. 

00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:31.180
 Now you must say, "Wait a minute. 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.760
 How can I move her? There is nothing here. " 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.997
 Well, we insert a 0 inside. 

00:05:33.997 --> 00:05:39.750
 And so - will be equal to 72,100. 

00:05:39.757 --> 00:05:41.090
 But now they do not ask us that. 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.850
 They ask us how we will. 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.230
 And we saw that the decimal point moves 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.420
 Three positions RIGHT. 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.280
 And the main thing here is that we get a bigger number, 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.490
 when we multiply by 10 times three times, 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.420
 or when we multiply by 1000. 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.790
 Let us solve this example. 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.315
 When we divide 56 to 10 in third grade, 

00:05:57.315 --> 00:06:00.920
 the decimal point moves [empty space] positions to [empty space]. 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.840
 That we divide to 10th at third degree 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.440
 means the same as dividing 10 times three times. 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.129
 And every time we divide to 10, 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:08.820
 we will have a smaller number as a result. 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.364
 So at 56, you might ask yourself where the decimal point is. 

00:06:11.364 --> 00:06:14.070
 There is a hidden decimal place there. 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.590
 Once we divide by 10 and get a smaller number. 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.270
 56 will be 5 and something will be 5.6. 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.780
 Again divide by 10 and becomes 0.56. 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.770
 We divide again to 10, and it gets ... Wait a minute. 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.430
 If I continue to move the decimal point to the left, 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.382
 to the left of what do I move it? 

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:33.330
 Well here we can insert a 0. 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.940
 And if we move the decimal point three places to the left, 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.890
 the result remains 0.056. 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.910
 And we can put a 0 here for clarity. 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.190
 We just moved the decimal point 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.630
 THREE LEFT positions in this situation. 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.120
 We received less value.
