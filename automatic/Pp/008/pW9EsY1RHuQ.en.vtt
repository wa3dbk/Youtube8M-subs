00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
which way I'm going to turn so I use

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.830 
which way I'm going to turn so I use
hand<00:01:19.979> signals<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.640> drivers<00:01:21.060> know<00:01:21.240> exactly

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
hand signals so drivers know exactly

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.469 
hand signals so drivers know exactly
what<00:01:22.080> I'm<00:01:22.200> doing<00:01:22.850> right<00:01:23.929> left<00:01:24.929> and<00:01:25.289> stop<00:01:26.479> more

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
what I'm doing right left and stop more

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.690 
what I'm doing right left and stop more
than<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> signals<00:01:28.229> making<00:01:28.770> eye<00:01:28.979> contact<00:01:29.009> is

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
than the signals making eye contact is

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.870 
than the signals making eye contact is
key<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.929> can<00:01:31.050> actually<00:01:31.409> see<00:01:31.740> when<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.520> if<00:01:32.670> a
