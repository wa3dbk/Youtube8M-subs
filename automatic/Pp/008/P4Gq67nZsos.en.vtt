00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.899
 hello youtube friends how are you waiting 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.900
 well and I hope you have spent a happy 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:13.210
 Christmas this video as it says by the 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.730
 title is to give you some notices and 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.590
 Detail some things I want 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.890
 inform them that it is very possible that 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.600
 arachnid conquest return as 78% 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.880
 of probabilities of it but 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.400
 Unfortunately, it will only be the story 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.470
 the campaign so that they understand me 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.680
 it will only be a story, not a campaign 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.660
 new now they remember that they had 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.609
 said that it was canceled because of problems with 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.429
 the group so I'll tell you what they were 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:41.409
 those problems to start I want 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:44.079
 tell them that the scenarios do not make them 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:46.210
 to pendejo not the first thing I think of a 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.069
 father idea once I think I do the 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.710
 history or I write it all down in the 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:53.409
 notebook the dialogs trigger is and 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.989
 all of that or maybe they thought I did what 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.209
 I think so bad but good once 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.100
 done this I pass it to lynch I admit what 

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:02.469
 I saw but that part is the one that gives more 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.049
 laziness do it almost almost you part a 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.810
 egg in two just to do that but 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.000
 good because I told them this because they will see me 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.370
 together with three other friends we made 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.920
 of the arachnid conquest and as you know 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.720
 the arachnid conquest is not my idea not 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.330
 It was one of my stories that I do 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.210
 but pitbull he was the creator of the 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.340
 story and like I thought everything 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.229
 he wrote the story in a notebook and 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.720
 he showed us that story a great 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.020
 story a fantastic story and I 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.610
 I think you also think so 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.860
 good as it was a great story 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.050
 we started to do it but we wanted to 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.880
 first show as a movie guy 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.190
 with all the cinematics that I was going to 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.869
 have the campaign in that we do the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.880
 chapter 1 2 and 3 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.560
 everything was going well until what happened 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.350
 most feared one when working in 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.990
 team what happened was that because of 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.030
 bad organization on our part 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.649
 we perform unassigned work or 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.050
 we repeated everything and there was a 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.300
 total catastrophe we have a 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.520
 server type where we upload the file 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.649
 main where we made the scenes 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.990
 of the arachnid conquest in that file 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.640
 one worked per day I started the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.770
 pitbull monday on tuesday 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.110
 efe that month on Wednesday and finally 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.410
 Thursdays on Friday, Saturday and Sunday 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.170
 they were to rest and go to relax 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.570
 because a day fsm is something he did 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.400
 he played pit bull and that's where he started 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.860
 the shit of conflict more shit than 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.020
 all since fs mex had done the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.360
 pitbull he did not want to do anything in his 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.250
 day after a summary of the file this 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.990
 It was damaged and was made a shit 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.300
 most things had been erased 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.790
 only the city was shits that there was 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.150
 made pitbull to give an example 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.210
 Look , this file was supposed to be 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.110
 Part 1 contain 2 and 3 but is only 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.110
 the city of shit 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.150
 here was the swamp part 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.650
 here the forest 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.390
 here the war chin gain and more 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.880
 here the tarantula burrow but 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.710
 everything was erased it was a big shit because 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.360
 to this the group was discouraged and not 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.400
 We wanted to do it again because 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.880
 it really is a can of shit to do 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.660
 all that after that we no longer 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.150
 we did nothing 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.190
 shortly after fs mex told us it was a 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.320
 great waste of time and that no longer 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.970
 I wanted to continue with these boludeces it 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.310
 He thought the same and he did not want either 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.440
 continue here was when we no longer talk 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.780
 more about the game of the age of myth I saw it 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.580
 however I kept uploading things already 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.800
 that I really like this game 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.620
 some do not know how old I am 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.590
 but my age is 16 years old so I have 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.410
 16 years some thought he had 12 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.690
 but not in addition I'm almost 17 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.940
 but that's why I can barely 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.370
 go up and do scenarios since I have 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.290
 family members to visit I have friends with 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.270
 those who go out and do bullshit out there 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.820
 and a girlfriend that I have to be with 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.100
 romanticón hahaha xd in addition to my 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.990
 studies and the social service shit 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.120
 and professional practices with 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.710
 what I have to accomplish is why I'm almost there 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.270
 I do not have time 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.220
 so excuse me for doing nothing 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.140
 fast but like you I 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.270
 I have a life to live or maybe I 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.550
 They believed a geek shit that I spend 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:22.060
 all fucking day on the computer then 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:24.880
 not not very bad said that I have 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.800
 eight years playing hornito I saw it yes eight 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.260
 years and I still have not got bored of this 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.480
 game when I was ten years old I started to 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.790
 move and search and that's when I learned 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.740
 to make very shitty scenarios but something 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.540
 it was something and with time it improves well 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.700
 chingón hahaha xd xd xd xddddd but as 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.550
 apologize for leaving the topic oh ah 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.220
 haha xd six months ago good the truth 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.990
 I do not remember if it was six or five months 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.850
 pitbull men sends a message so that 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.190
 check the server that we used to 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.230
 that shit and surprise I saw a file 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.440
 called arachnid conquest 2 with 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.780
 chetumal that was my reaction hehe what 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.600
 check and I started doing it and that's where 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.640
 where part 4 came out this is the 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.130
 scenario called arachnid conquest 2 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:14.010
 this is where part 4 is like 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.010
 you can see this is the starting part 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.349
 here we have the scene where the robot 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.349
 titan appears 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.860
 here where what is persecuted and here 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.500
 where he is dead beyond is fsm yes 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.020
 pit bull and the whole city made shit 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.270
 by the tarantulas but hey here I 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.060
 missing some scenes that do not complete 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.040
 for lack of shit time makes a 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.170
 week of the present day that I went up this 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.360
 pitbull video sent me conquest to the 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.250
 unit 3 and as you can see is this 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.890
 file which already contains the latest 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.590
 scenes of the arachnid conquest this is 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.900
 the good ending to see this may the 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.910
 story continue but as I said before 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.910
 be patient since my time is 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.580
 extremely limited good changing 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.480
 of topic I'm working on a new 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.670
 Bell 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.800
 that's how it is on this vacation if I had 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.590
 time to do something I will tell you that this 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.660
 campaign just has its 30% completed 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.580
 but I'm moving faster than 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.830
 that I thought so guys there was this 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.800
 campaign in one or two weeks so 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.360
 be patient please now I want 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.640
 tell them that dead man's beats is going to 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.620
 continue I have the writing of the two 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.680
 sequels of dead moon sets like who 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.120
 says 1 2 and 3 the dead moon sets 1 is the 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.100
 history with are songs 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.430
 but that I'll leave it pending for now 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.500
 then it 's piled up 03 which is the 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.600
 sequel to dead mons bits good in this 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.820
 you are not to the songs you are a soldier 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.010
 any but the difference from 1 to 2 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.110
 is that in this you can improve your 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.990
 attack defense and buy weapons well 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.910
 ostias xd I also have planned 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.400
 finish the campaign the adventure of are 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.800
 songs is already I have the entire written 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.960
 its history and I even started doing it 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.180
 fact I stayed in chapter 4 since 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.340
 this is by chapters but because of the 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.190
 reason already known to my lack of time 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.620
 I could not finish it anyway since this is 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.360
 rpg style is more complicated than 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.400
 any other because this one 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.889
 you need too many trigger is 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.860
 like that of the statues automatons and the 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:18.900
 good puzzle summarizing everything I'm 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.300
 making a new campaign that is going to 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.490
 like I'll continue with the story 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.500
 of the arachnid conquest but it will only be 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.720
 a non-playable story I'll finish 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.330
 the adventure of are songs and I will do 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.939
 dead man's beatz 1 2 and 3 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.009
 now I'm not going to campaign anymore 

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:36.840
 it's very difficult because there are so many 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:39.449
 scenarios but I'll change it for 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.250
 scenarios a simple scenario since it 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:44.810
 I've had enough ideas from 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:47.340
 normal scenarios rpg rpg adventure 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.710
 well, this has been all in this 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:54.090
 video I hope you wait for me hahaha hahaha xd 

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:56.870
 xd xx from xddddd I say goodbye to you 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.870
 salt acz
