Hello everyone. 
My name is Nastya.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.000
In this video I'll show you how to do makeup

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.760
of Elizabeth Olsen and Scarlet Witch 
from new Avengers

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.960
Stay with me and 
thank you guys for watching!

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.560
Let's do Lizzy's makeup at first.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.200
I have already applied foundation

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.320
so let's go straight to the brows.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.480
Lizzy has beautiful natural-looking eyebrows

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.400
so I apply a bit of browpencil 
with a skew brush

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.480
Now I apply taupe eyeshadow 
on wings of my nose

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.480
to make it look smaller.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.200
Let's move onto the eyes.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.240
I lift my upper lash line with 
dark brown eyeshadow

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.400
As well I use it on my lower lash line.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.000
Then I apply light brown eyeshadow 
on my crease.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.200
Carefully curl my lashes and apply
mascara, pulling them up.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.160
Then I emphasize my cheekbones 
to match Elizabeth's.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.320
To make my eyes look rounder
I add taupe eyeshadow under them.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.960
Slightly change the lip contour

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.080
lowering the edges of my upper lip
and lifting up the corners

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.920
The first look is done!

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.520
Moving to the Scarlet Witch's look~

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.440
First of all let's do smoky eyes.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.200
As a base I use black eyepencil.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.920
In this makeup make sure to line your 
waterline with black kohl pencil.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.840
Once again we emphasize the cheekbones,
this time a bit more.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.640
Now darken the eyebrows.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.400
Now I apply dark red lip pencil
upon my new lip contour.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.480
Apply scarlet lipstick or lip lacquer.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.520
If you have dark purple lipstick,
use it on the edges and corners

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.520
to darken your lips.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.600
Now remove the gloss and soften
the colour using a napkin.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.640
At last I put on the wig and

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.640
leather jacket!

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.480
The look of Scarlet Witch is ready!

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.200
