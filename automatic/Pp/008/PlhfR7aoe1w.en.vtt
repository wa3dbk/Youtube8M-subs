00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello everyone today, a comparison video 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.400
 among the thermal enamels my possession 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.360
 I have four of these four here 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.699
 see two are equal to each other and immediately 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.340
 I'll explain why this number then 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.160
 one is what I bought on cosmetic 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.039
 for less e Ã¨ della ss in limited 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.490
 edition and producer I put it here 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.679
 this is the first thermal enamel that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.390
 I have had absolutely and it has always been 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.610
 of the essence of an old limited 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.660
 edition that was called super heroes not 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.440
 has arrived in Italy 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.360
 I bought it on the site of thousands and vi 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.100
 I also made a video dedicated only 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.120
 this polish this here and the live is 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.829
 the number 3 is this here as a 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.309
 couple of you told me about that 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.309
 you the thermal effect of this 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.899
 glaze you could see it was seen I said 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.969
 okay number two 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.400
 I bought it from shoes shoes then in 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.049
 a physical store because I wanted to give it 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.570
 a second chance you never want 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.340
 that I found a bottle 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.950
 loser then as you see this is the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.860
 warm color I now hand the calle 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.070
 I just passed over under the water at 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.210
 precisely now my step by step 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.579
 nails under cold water and you will see 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.860
 that for these two fingers there will not be 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.400
 absolutely no change of 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.439
 color 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.740
 now I run the water a little 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.740
 cold 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.570
 as you see the one of the laila is 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.070
 become an intense and beautiful orange 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.330
 now it's doing a bit of an effect 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:04.380
 french as the part warms up 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.119
 closer to the finger and the part here in 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.179
 nail tip clearly remains longer 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.130
 cold this has become of a violet 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.870
 slightly darker but actually 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.200
 when I had the video just done 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.660
 bought and the purple in the cold effect 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.340
 we say it was much more purple than it is 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.170
 changed little 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.870
 so obviously he is losing a little 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.640
 the thermal effect these two that are i 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.140
 two road trips, that's what I got 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.750
 from cosmetic for less than what I have 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.940
 got the store they have no way 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.180
 changed their color now there 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.800
 I do revise so now you have 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.600
 lengths again a little warmed up 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.600
 in which already returned yellow 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.890
 this is a thermal enamel that works 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.930
 how it should work and that is this is 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.390
 also the one that costs the most among all 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.810
 how many this just bought here again 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.360
 it worked well in the sense that it was seen 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.380
 precisely the transition from pink 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.600
 to deep violet, and now we see short 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.580
 these are much less absent 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.840
 two you can't tell me here 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.760
 thermal because they have not the least 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.590
 changed their color and I assure you 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.180
 that the water is pretty cool ok then 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.030
 for me this is the road trip here 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.000
 continues to be a thermal enamel 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.500
 rejected because it is absolutely not 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.320
 has absolutely a thermal effect 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.930
 enough so I had to this was the 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.520
 road test and stand for vi 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.520
 greetings see you at the next video
