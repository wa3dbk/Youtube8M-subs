embroidery<00:03:33.690> all<00:03:34.110> of<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.549> satin<00:03:35.970> stitch

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
embroidery all of the the satin stitch

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.259 
embroidery all of the the satin stitch
here<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.660> make<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:37.049> pop<00:03:37.410> then<00:03:38.400> I<00:03:38.610> went<00:03:38.850> in<00:03:39.030> and

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
here to make that pop then I went in and

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.240 
here to make that pop then I went in and
then<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.390> added<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.840> feathering<00:03:40.380> though

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
then I added the feathering though

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.520 
then I added the feathering though
quilting<00:03:41.850> in<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.180> leaves<00:03:42.420> was<00:03:42.870> really<00:03:43.290> hard

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
quilting in the leaves was really hard

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.620 
quilting in the leaves was really hard
because<00:03:43.739> each<00:03:44.160> leaf<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.760> different<00:03:45.269> shape

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
because each leaf is a different shape

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.569 
because each leaf is a different shape
and<00:03:45.810> it's<00:03:46.019> odd<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.799> it's<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.100> most<00:03:47.220> elegant

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
and it's odd and it's the most elegant

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.729 
and it's odd and it's the most elegant
part<00:03:47.910> of<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.090> quilt<00:03:48.390> so<00:03:49.049> there<00:03:49.260> was<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.410> lot<00:03:49.709> of

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
part of the quilt so there was a lot of

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.979 
part of the quilt so there was a lot of
struggles<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.640> sketching<00:03:51.209> until<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.540> finally

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
struggles and sketching until I finally

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.319 
struggles and sketching until I finally
figured<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.590> out<00:03:52.829> then<00:03:53.519> I<00:03:53.640> added<00:03:53.820> real<00:03:54.090> dense

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
figured it out then I added real dense

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.390 
figured it out then I added real dense
scribbling<00:03:55.200> behind<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:55.920> kind<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.220> pop

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
scribbling behind that to kind of pop

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.850 
scribbling behind that to kind of pop
the<00:03:56.610> feathers<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.750> make<00:03:58.049> them<00:03:58.230> look<00:03:58.410> good<00:03:58.560> but

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
the feathers and make them look good but

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.180 
the feathers and make them look good but
it<00:03:59.100> took<00:03:59.370> me<00:03:59.670> a<00:04:00.000> full<00:04:00.660> year<00:04:01.019> from<00:04:01.739> Christmas

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
it took me a full year from Christmas

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.370 
it took me a full year from Christmas
Eve<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.549> Christmas<00:04:02.940> Eve<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.510> complete<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.110> and

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
Eve to Christmas Eve to complete it and

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.120 
Eve to Christmas Eve to complete it and
I<00:04:04.530> think<00:04:04.739> between<00:04:05.269> 800<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.360> a<00:04:06.390> thousand<00:04:06.840> hours

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
I think between 800 and a thousand hours

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.310 
I think between 800 and a thousand hours
easy<00:04:08.130> between<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.030> quilting<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.810> uncoil

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
easy between the quilting the uncoil

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.880 
easy between the quilting the uncoil
team<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:12.450> beading<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.870> unbeaten<00:04:13.650> and

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
team the beading the unbeaten and

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.890 
team the beading the unbeaten and
everything<00:04:14.640> but<00:04:14.790> it's<00:04:14.940> it's<00:04:15.360> one<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.630> my<00:04:15.720> most

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
everything but it's it's one of my most

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.840 
everything but it's it's one of my most
special<00:04:16.019> pieces<00:04:16.530> do<00:04:16.979> you<00:04:17.010> know<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.250> just<00:04:17.579> said

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
special pieces do you know you just said

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.460 
special pieces do you know you just said
something<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.479> think<00:04:18.630> people<00:04:19.200> may<00:04:19.410> be

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
something that I think people may be

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.279 
something that I think people may be
interested<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.579> that<00:04:20.640> is<00:04:21.359> that<00:04:21.810> you

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
interested in and that is that you

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.640 
interested in and that is that you
unquoted<00:04:23.280> weren't<00:04:24.180> happy<00:04:24.720> with<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.440> took

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
unquoted weren't happy with it you took

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.960 
unquoted weren't happy with it you took
the<00:04:25.830> stitches<00:04:26.070> out

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
the stitches out

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.970 
the stitches out
again<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.660> again<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.990> then<00:04:31.170> it's<00:04:31.680> almost

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
again and again and then it's almost

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.160 
again and again and then it's almost
illegal<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.730> take<00:04:32.910> beating<00:04:33.420> out<00:04:33.600> but<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:33.990> got

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
illegal to take beating out but I got

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.480 
illegal to take beating out but I got
three-quarters<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.010> way<00:04:35.100> through<00:04:35.310> the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
three-quarters of the way through the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.290 
three-quarters of the way through the
beadwork<00:04:35.700> and<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.240> ran<00:04:36.480> out<00:04:36.690> of<00:04:36.750> beads<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:38.300> we

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
beadwork and I ran out of beads and we

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.450 
beadwork and I ran out of beads and we
couldn't<00:04:39.600> find<00:04:39.840> them<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.860> had<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.100> take<00:04:41.280> all

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
couldn't find them and I had to take all

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.400 
couldn't find them and I had to take all
the<00:04:41.580> beads<00:04:41.790> out<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.300> I<00:04:42.450> had<00:04:42.600> to<00:04:42.750> start<00:04:42.990> over

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
the beads out and I had to start over

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.330 
the beads out and I had to start over
that's<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.070> part<00:04:44.280> people<00:04:44.430> don't<00:04:45.830> well<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.190> so

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
that's the part people don't well and so

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.370 
that's the part people don't well and so
let's<00:04:47.580> talk<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.880> little<00:04:48.060> bit<00:04:48.390> about<00:04:48.510> some<00:04:49.260> of

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
let's talk a little bit about some of

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.140 
let's talk a little bit about some of
the<00:04:49.470> other<00:04:49.620> embellishments<00:04:50.490> because<00:04:50.820> you<00:04:50.970> do

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
the other embellishments because you do

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
close up here okay it is very tiny bead

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.200 
close up here okay it is very tiny bead
little<00:05:02.070> beads<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.550> those<00:05:02.700> are<00:05:02.850> actually

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
little beads and those are actually

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.870 
little beads and those are actually
bigger<00:05:03.450> than<00:05:03.660> what<00:05:03.810> I<00:05:03.840> usually<00:05:04.080> use<00:05:04.380> Wow<00:05:05.280> and

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
bigger than what I usually use Wow and

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.940 
bigger than what I usually use Wow and
then<00:05:06.180> so<00:05:06.480> then<00:05:06.690> you<00:05:06.810> beat<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.230> in<00:05:07.440> some<00:05:07.740> of<00:05:07.770> the

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
then so then you beat it in some of the

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.550 
then so then you beat it in some of the
openwork<00:05:08.520> yes<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.360> actually<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:10.020> powers

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
openwork yes and actually the powers

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.890 
openwork yes and actually the powers
these<00:05:10.800> are<00:05:11.010> metal<00:05:11.340> beads<00:05:11.580> that<00:05:12.270> came<00:05:12.600> from

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
these are metal beads that came from

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.650 
these are metal beads that came from
Africa<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:14.070> those<00:05:15.060> are<00:05:15.210> part<00:05:15.390> of<00:05:15.450> the<00:05:15.510> ones

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
Africa and those are part of the ones

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.780 
Africa and those are part of the ones
that<00:05:15.780> had<00:05:15.930> to<00:05:15.960> be<00:05:16.200> redone<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.620> I<00:05:16.950> ran<00:05:17.250> out<00:05:17.490> of

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
that had to be redone that I ran out of

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.290 
that had to be redone that I ran out of
well<00:05:18.630> so<00:05:19.169> we<00:05:19.290> had<00:05:19.380> to<00:05:19.470> do<00:05:19.590> that<00:05:19.740> all<00:05:19.919> over<00:05:19.950> again

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
well so we had to do that all over again

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.909 
well so we had to do that all over again
alright<00:05:21.300> well<00:05:21.630> so<00:05:21.810> is<00:05:22.110> there<00:05:22.350> anything<00:05:22.590> else

about entering your quilts because I

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.890

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
know sometimes people are a little

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.320 
know sometimes people are a little
intimidated<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:10.830> enter<00:06:11.130> their<00:06:11.310> quilts<00:06:11.580> mm-hmm

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
and then it is I entered a Q s quilt

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.690 
and then it is I entered a Q s quilt
show<00:06:17.070> in<00:06:17.250> 1986<00:06:18.210> and<00:06:18.690> I<00:06:19.440> didn't<00:06:20.100> tell<00:06:20.280> a<00:06:20.310> soul

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
show in 1986 and I didn't tell a soul

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.520

that<00:06:21.150> I<00:06:21.180> entered<00:06:21.540> until<00:06:21.900> I<00:06:22.080> got<00:06:22.380> the

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
that I entered until I got the

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.590 
that I entered until I got the
acceptance<00:06:23.100> number<00:06:23.550> there<00:06:23.790> the<00:06:23.940> letter<00:06:24.180> M<00:06:24.450> hmm

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
acceptance number there the letter M hmm

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.010 
acceptance number there the letter M hmm
and<00:06:24.900> I<00:06:25.400> think<00:06:26.400> everybody<00:06:26.970> is<00:06:27.210> a<00:06:27.240> little<00:06:27.780> bit

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
and I think everybody is a little bit

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.159 
and I think everybody is a little bit
afraid<00:06:28.320> of<00:06:28.470> failure<00:06:28.979> when<00:06:29.490> you<00:06:29.669> enter<00:06:30.120> huh<00:06:30.630> but

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
afraid of failure when you enter huh but

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.840 
afraid of failure when you enter huh but
you<00:06:31.290> know<00:06:31.440> you<00:06:31.500> can't<00:06:31.890> succeed<00:06:32.370> if<00:06:32.430> you<00:06:32.700> don't

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
you know you can't succeed if you don't

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.120 
you know you can't succeed if you don't
stick<00:06:33.150> your<00:06:33.300> neck<00:06:33.510> out<00:06:33.720> a<00:06:33.780> little<00:06:34.110> bit<00:06:34.350> exactly

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
stick your neck out a little bit exactly

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.310 
stick your neck out a little bit exactly
and<00:06:35.400> so<00:06:35.580> I<00:06:35.970> would<00:06:36.510> Curie<00:06:36.810> encourage<00:06:37.440> everybody

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320
