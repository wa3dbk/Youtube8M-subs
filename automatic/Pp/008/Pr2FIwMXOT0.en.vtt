there<00:00:00.299> is<00:00:00.450> a<00:00:00.480> lot<00:00:00.690> of<00:00:00.719> research<00:00:01.079> going<00:00:01.110> on

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
there is a lot of research going on

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.980 
there is a lot of research going on
looking<00:00:01.949> at<00:00:02.100> ketogenic<00:00:02.730> diets<00:00:03.389> which<00:00:03.600> which

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
looking at ketogenic diets which which

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.110 
looking at ketogenic diets which which
are<00:00:04.200> going<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.380> be<00:00:04.470> low<00:00:04.620> in<00:00:04.650> carbs<00:00:05.130> related<00:00:05.970> to

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
are going to be low in carbs related to

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.059 
are going to be low in carbs related to
other<00:00:06.359> neurologic<00:00:07.109> conditions<00:00:07.589> including

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
other neurologic conditions including

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.980 
other neurologic conditions including
Alzheimer's<00:00:08.639> Parkinson's<00:00:09.650> ALS<00:00:11.719> and<00:00:12.719> some

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
Alzheimer's Parkinson's ALS and some

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.900 
Alzheimer's Parkinson's ALS and some
others<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.309> think<00:00:14.370> we're<00:00:14.670> going<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.849> find

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
others so I think we're going to find

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.490 
others so I think we're going to find
out<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.420> low<00:00:15.570> carb<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.990> actually<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.440> to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
out that low carb is actually going to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.230 
out that low carb is actually going to
do<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.650> lot<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.859> good<00:00:17.070> things<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.460> wrote<00:00:18.090> an

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
mistake a lot of smokers make we just

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.340 
mistake a lot of smokers make we just
said<00:00:59.940> I<00:00:59.969> used<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> work<00:01:00.539> with<00:01:00.719> patients<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
said I used to work with patients in the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.319 
said I used to work with patients in the
center<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.980> quit<00:01:02.219> smoking<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.969> course<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
center to quit smoking and of course the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.000 
center to quit smoking and of course the
one<00:01:03.510> thing<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.930> having<00:01:04.260> been<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.500> smoker

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
one thing and having been a smoker

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.990 
one thing and having been a smoker
myself<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.909> kind<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.240> knew<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> pitfalls<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
myself I kind of knew the pitfalls and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.789 
myself I kind of knew the pitfalls and
what<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.150> always<00:01:09.450> did<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.229> put<00:01:10.500> them<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
what we always did was put them on a

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.280 
what we always did was put them on a
very<00:01:11.130> low<00:01:11.369> carbohydrate<00:01:12.090> diet<00:01:12.140> regardless<00:01:13.140> of

very low carbohydrate diet regardless of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.190 
very low carbohydrate diet regardless of
their<00:01:13.380> way<00:01:14.090> because<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.450> didn't<00:01:15.900> what

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
their way because if you didn't what

their way because if you didn't what
they<00:01:16.320> were<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.130> go<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> their

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
they were going to do is go to their

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.070 
they were going to do is go to their
other<00:01:17.729> addiction<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.509> their<00:01:18.630> people<00:01:18.810> are

30<00:01:22.200> pounds<00:01:22.680> research<00:01:23.520> has<00:01:23.670> shown<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:24.060> people

30 pounds research has shown in people

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.359 
30 pounds research has shown in people
who<00:01:24.540> quit<00:01:24.780> smoking<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.470> don't<00:01:25.740> change<00:01:26.130> their

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
who quit smoking and don't change their

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.880 
who quit smoking and don't change their
eating<00:01:26.580> only<00:01:27.150> gained<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.229> four<00:01:28.650> pounds

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
eating only gained about four pounds

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.030 
eating only gained about four pounds
which<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.700> temporary<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:31.860> their

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
which is temporary and then their

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.249 
which is temporary and then their
metabolism<00:01:32.759> straightens<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.630> that's<00:01:33.960> it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
metabolism straightens out and that's it

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.130 
metabolism straightens out and that's it
so<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.850> usual<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> should<00:01:37.049> be

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
so it's not usual that you should be

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.690 
so it's not usual that you should be
gaining<00:01:37.350> you've<00:01:37.619> actually<00:01:37.950> changed<00:01:38.579> your

reading<00:01:38.970> yet<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.979> worked<00:01:40.979> with<00:01:41.220> someone<00:01:41.640> who

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
reading yet I worked with someone who

reading yet I worked with someone who
created<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.810> quitting<00:01:43.619> smoking<00:01:43.740> program

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
created a quitting smoking program

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.760 
created a quitting smoking program
before<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.820> ever<00:01:45.030> met<00:01:45.149> her<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.350> when<00:01:46.530> someone
