00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.499
 I think there is the difference between us and Mexico compared to yesterday 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.499
 after 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.359
 mexico is to a collective and% and we will say that we were in power 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:26.650
 and percent 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.490
 I think that's what we missed because years in the army of players 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.130
 that's all he commanded 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.790
 in big clubs 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.910
 and for 100 m and that's it I think what we missed is a man 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.080
 it's about being politically together 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080
 on the sector 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.020
 a team with% 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.530
 with victories because we have been pretty good in the clique of 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.069
 tours without m 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:54.930
 and it's true that as you go 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.330
 we lose a little more confidence 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:05.230
 and for 100 m and that's what makes it come back we had 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.230
 as for him has difficulties so 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.700
 compared to the results I can not tell you the opposite 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.030
 that's for sure 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.290
 after again like I said 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.399
 the most task the internship in tignes we did really good preparation p 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.060
 the om these 10 th some things 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.110
 m 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.110
 I think that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.110
 it would be better 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.000
 here is the pressure is not relaxing on the ground because 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.740
 because apart from the always said and it's true that 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.800
 the more we get on well with mike 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.410
 I preferred that we know everything about the mouth 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.610
 he was on the pitch tonight 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.940
 is 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.940
 politically beefy 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.050
 if we did not succeed in Winnipeg 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.490
 because I think that compared to the qualities of 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.490
 quality of the players 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.010
 we are inevitably it's football is a mess 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.739
 but everyone for its part of responsibility why% 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.899
 even though the text base 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.799
 m again it's the players who are on the ground 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.370
 the peugeot sport can not do much against but on the ground 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.599
 so case everyone has his share of responsibility but mentally
