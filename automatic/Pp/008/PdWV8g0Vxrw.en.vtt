here okay when you first enter OHS a sec
all<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.520> when<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.850> first<00:01:36.210> enter<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.660> see

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
there's a ton of course but students

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.210 
there's a ton of course but students
going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> divide<00:01:39.000> up<00:01:39.179> ahead<00:01:39.500> it<00:01:40.500> goes<00:01:40.770> left<00:01:40.950> or

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
going to divide up ahead it goes left or

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.800 
going to divide up ahead it goes left or
right<00:01:41.429> and<00:01:41.670> depending<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.330> which<00:01:42.450> rather<00:01:42.630> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
right and depending on which rather you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.870 
right and depending on which rather you
take<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.380> need<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:43.920> more<00:01:44.190> power-ups<00:01:44.580> or

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
take you need to get more power-ups or

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.550 
take you need to get more power-ups or
less<00:01:45.149> power<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.539> so<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> will<00:01:46.080> be<00:01:46.170> shorter<00:01:46.530> or

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
less power up so I will be shorter or

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.320 
less power up so I will be shorter or
the<00:01:46.770> route<00:01:46.920> will<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.190> longer<00:01:47.460> usually<00:01:48.060> want<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
the route will be longer usually want to

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.080 
the route will be longer usually want to
get<00:01:48.450> wrong<00:01:48.690> go<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.560> more<00:01:49.740> power-ups<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:51.060> I

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
get wrong go out for more power-ups so I

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.520 
get wrong go out for more power-ups so I
think<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.420> made<00:01:51.539> a<00:01:51.569> good<00:01:51.750> decision<00:01:51.929> we<00:01:52.259> going

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
think I made a good decision we going

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.520 
think I made a good decision we going
perhaps<00:01:52.800> let's<00:01:53.069> go<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:56.960> boy<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.259> don't<00:01:58.440> know

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
perhaps let's go right boy I don't know

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.080 
perhaps let's go right boy I don't know
actually<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.039> combinations<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.910> best

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
actually what combinations the best

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.020 
actually what combinations the best
route<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.509> take<00:02:00.539> I<00:02:01.459> remember<00:02:02.459> once<00:02:02.700> getting
