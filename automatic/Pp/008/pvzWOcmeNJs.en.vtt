00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
the male and I've also read in some

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.809 
the male and I've also read in some
parts<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.629> the<00:03:59.720> world<00:03:59.750> that<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:01.250> female<00:04:01.610> is

parts of the world that the female is
considered<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:03.040> think<00:04:04.040> some<00:04:04.220> of<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.400> Orient

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849

anyway there's a male the female the

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.539 
anyway there's a male the female the
ones<00:04:16.070> you<00:04:16.459> heard<00:04:16.729> singing<00:04:17.359> there<00:04:17.630> are<00:04:18.549> the

from<00:04:29.990> what<00:04:30.139> I've<00:04:30.260> read<00:04:30.440> also<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.919> cricket<00:04:31.790> or

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
from what I've read also a cricket or

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.090 
from what I've read also a cricket or
something<00:04:32.630> like<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:32.960> makes<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.470> similar

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
something like that makes a similar

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.000 
something like that makes a similar
sound<00:04:34.370> by<00:04:34.820> rubbing<00:04:35.500> parts<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.650> their<00:04:36.770> body

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
sound by rubbing parts of their body

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.820 
sound by rubbing parts of their body
together<00:04:37.340> to<00:04:37.760> make<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.060> sound<00:04:38.650> but<00:04:39.650> this

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
together to make the sound but this

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.590 
together to make the sound but this
insect<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.430> think<00:04:40.729> it's<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.060> only<00:04:41.180> one<00:04:41.419> that

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
insect I think it's the only one that

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.400 
insect I think it's the only one that
does<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:42.080> has<00:04:42.380> a<00:04:42.410> built-in<00:04:43.479> speaker<00:04:44.479> I<00:04:45.020> guess

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
does that has a built-in speaker I guess

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.710 
does that has a built-in speaker I guess
you<00:04:45.530> would<00:04:45.680> say<00:04:45.889> a<00:04:46.190> built-in<00:04:46.669> membrane<00:04:47.330> on<00:04:47.540> his

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
you would say a built-in membrane on his

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.010 
you would say a built-in membrane on his
body<00:04:47.990> that<00:04:48.290> he<00:04:49.070> can<00:04:49.280> use<00:04:49.669> muscles<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.540> vibrate

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
body that he can use muscles to vibrate

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.530 
body that he can use muscles to vibrate
then<00:04:51.290> they<00:04:51.470> can<00:04:51.680> vary<00:04:51.950> this<00:04:52.220> sound<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.910> as<00:04:53.389> you

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
then they can vary this sound and as you

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.469 
then they can vary this sound and as you
hear<00:04:54.290> in<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.919> video<00:04:55.040> it<00:04:55.880> can<00:04:56.000> be<00:04:56.150> a<00:04:56.180> very

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
hear in the the video it can be a very

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.469 
hear in the the video it can be a very
very<00:04:56.600> loud<00:04:56.840> sound<00:04:57.340> these<00:04:58.340> things<00:04:58.700> get<00:04:59.180> in

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
very loud sound these things get in

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.560 
very loud sound these things get in
rhythm<00:05:00.370> you'll<00:05:01.370> hear<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.729> sound<00:05:01.910> go<00:05:02.210> up<00:05:02.389> and

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
rhythm you'll hear the sound go up and

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.469 
rhythm you'll hear the sound go up and
down<00:05:02.750> as<00:05:03.050> more<00:05:03.410> and<00:05:03.620> more<00:05:03.680> join<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.760> singing

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
down as more and more join the singing

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.779 
down as more and more join the singing
but<00:05:06.169> these<00:05:06.350> males<00:05:06.680> get<00:05:07.039> in<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.310> rhythm<00:05:07.460> and

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
but these males get in the rhythm and

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.310 
but these males get in the rhythm and
they<00:05:08.740> know<00:05:09.740> if<00:05:10.639> an<00:05:10.789> insect<00:05:11.180> can<00:05:11.419> know<00:05:11.630> they

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
they know if an insect can know they

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.700 
they know if an insect can know they
know<00:05:12.590> that<00:05:12.760> by<00:05:13.760> having<00:05:14.690> more<00:05:14.900> together<00:05:15.380> you

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
know that by having more together you

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.800 
know that by having more together you
make<00:05:15.889> a<00:05:15.919> louder<00:05:16.280> sound<00:05:16.430> so<00:05:17.030> in<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.270> video<00:05:17.389> when

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
make a louder sound so in the video when

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.450 
make a louder sound so in the video when
you<00:05:17.930> hear<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.169> sound<00:05:18.470> go<00:05:18.710> up<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.100> down<00:05:19.220> that

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
you hear the sound go up and down that

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.760 
you hear the sound go up and down that
means<00:05:19.700> it's<00:05:19.880> more<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.389> more<00:05:20.600> of<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:21.530> males

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
means it's more and more of the males

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.700 
means it's more and more of the males
have<00:05:22.250> joined<00:05:23.150> in<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.450> chorus<00:05:23.600> if<00:05:24.320> you<00:05:24.440> want<00:05:24.650> to

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
see if I look at it that way now I've

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.120 
see if I look at it that way now I've
done<00:05:27.680> a<00:05:27.740> little<00:05:28.150> little<00:05:29.229> technology<00:05:30.229> work<00:05:30.770> on

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
done a little little technology work on

that<00:05:38.720> in<00:05:39.080> ditch<00:05:39.380> that<00:05:39.410> I<00:05:39.800> digitized<00:05:40.460> that

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
that in ditch that I digitized that

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.719 
that in ditch that I digitized that
sound<00:05:41.120> and<00:05:41.479> slowed<00:05:41.810> it<00:05:41.960> down<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.740> try<00:05:43.610> to

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
sound and slowed it down and try to

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.500 
sound and slowed it down and try to
bring<00:05:44.090> out<00:05:44.300> what<00:05:44.960> that<00:05:45.500> sound<00:05:46.099> really<00:05:46.639> is<00:05:46.910> so

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
digital analysis of the cicada sound you

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.409 
digital analysis of the cicada sound you
can<00:05:56.479> make<00:05:57.289> out<00:05:57.500> what<00:05:58.099> is<00:05:58.250> being<00:05:58.460> said<00:05:58.970> when<00:05:59.389> all

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
think in some of the jungles these

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.800 
think in some of the jungles these
things<00:06:26.260> grow<00:06:26.530> up<00:06:26.650> to<00:06:26.800> about<00:06:26.949> six<00:06:27.280> inches<00:06:27.580> long

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
things grow up to about six inches long

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.150 
things grow up to about six inches long
and<00:06:28.810> from<00:06:29.139> what<00:06:29.320> I've<00:06:29.440> read<00:06:29.620> they're<00:06:29.830> all<00:06:29.949> over
