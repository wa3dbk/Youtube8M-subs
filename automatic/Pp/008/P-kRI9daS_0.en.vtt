00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.020 
it's pretty heavy goes all the way
across<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:49.040> that's<00:01:50.040> pretty<00:01:50.280> much<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> reason

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
across and that's pretty much the reason

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.109 
across and that's pretty much the reason
why<00:01:51.119> they'll<00:01:51.360> always<00:01:51.540> say<00:01:52.520> if<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.970> buy

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
why they'll always say if you buy

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.490 
why they'll always say if you buy
something<00:01:54.360> from<00:01:54.600> map<00:01:54.810> it'll<00:01:55.020> say<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.320> don't

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
something from map it'll say like don't

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.469 
something from map it'll say like don't
use<00:01:55.799> around<00:01:56.070> your<00:01:56.189> eye<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.820> because<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.690 

the<00:02:00.829> allergy<00:02:01.829> reaction<00:02:02.610> factor<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.579> is

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
the allergy reaction factor so this is

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.150 
the allergy reaction factor so this is
we're<00:02:06.240> gonna<00:02:06.390> cut<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.719> up<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.590> sharp<00:02:07.829> wing

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
we're gonna cut it up in a sharp wing

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.210 
we're gonna cut it up in a sharp wing
look<00:02:08.459> right<00:02:08.700> there

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.030 

and<00:02:13.060> then<00:02:13.210> just<00:02:13.480> draw<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:14.140> guy<00:02:14.440> down<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.920> the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
and then just draw this guy down to the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.390 
and then just draw this guy down to the
corner<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.690> I've<00:02:17.230> never<00:02:17.410> had<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.740> reaction<00:02:17.980> I

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
corner and I've never had a reaction I

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.190 
corner and I've never had a reaction I
hope<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.700> don't<00:02:18.760> have<00:02:19.030> one<00:02:19.180> did<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:19.570> not<00:02:20.050> good

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
hope I don't have one did this not good

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.560 
hope I don't have one did this not good
not<00:02:20.350> not<00:02:21.190> be<00:02:21.340> very<00:02:21.520> good<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.210> red<00:02:22.390> looks

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
not not be very good so the red looks

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.300 
not not be very good so the red looks
really<00:02:22.840> cool<00:02:22.990> as<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.230> can<00:02:23.380> see<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.740> mean<00:02:24.190> I'm

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
really cool as you can see I mean I'm

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.220 
really cool as you can see I mean I'm
gonna<00:02:24.580> go<00:02:24.730> down<00:02:24.940> farther<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.840> corner<00:02:26.140> of

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
gonna go down farther to the corner of

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.070 
gonna go down farther to the corner of
my<00:02:26.350> eye<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:27.280> make<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.090> wing<00:02:28.330> go<00:02:28.660> up<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.960> little

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
my eye and make this wing go up a little

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.920 
my eye and make this wing go up a little
more<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.550> start<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.000> point<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.450> draw<00:02:31.690> in

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
more so I start the point and I draw in

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.540 
more so I start the point and I draw in
towards<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.380> eye<00:02:32.440> sometimes<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.250> helps<00:02:33.310> give

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
towards the eye sometimes it helps give

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.320 
towards the eye sometimes it helps give
you<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.700> straight<00:02:34.090> line<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.970> just<00:02:37.000> want<00:02:37.270> to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330
