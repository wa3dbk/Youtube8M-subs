00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
if you do want to use a sort of a

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.679 
if you do want to use a sort of a
stencil<00:02:55.079> I<00:02:55.829> highly<00:02:56.669> recommend<00:02:56.790> using<00:02:57.419> the

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
stencil I highly recommend using the

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.470 
stencil I highly recommend using the
curved<00:02:57.989> line<00:02:58.489> putting<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.669> as<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.819> stencil<00:03:00.120> over

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
curved line putting it as a stencil over

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.879 
curved line putting it as a stencil over
it<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:00.870> then<00:03:00.959> going<00:03:01.109> back<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.379> deleting<00:03:01.739> it

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
it and then going back and deleting it

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.470 
it and then going back and deleting it
and<00:03:02.099> then<00:03:02.280> moving<00:03:02.459> everything<00:03:02.819> across<00:03:03.150> and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
and then moving everything across and

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.449 
and then moving everything across and
that<00:03:03.900> way<00:03:04.019> then<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.319> can<00:03:04.469> go<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.769> make<00:03:05.340> sure

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
that way then you can go and make sure

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.470 
that way then you can go and make sure
you<00:03:05.549> don't<00:03:05.700> go<00:03:05.879> back<00:03:05.909> through<00:03:06.209> your<00:03:06.269> all<00:03:06.450> your

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
you don't go back through your all your

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.119 
you don't go back through your all your
layers<00:03:06.689> and<00:03:06.840> make<00:03:06.959> sure<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.169> have<00:03:07.530> some<00:03:07.769> empty

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
layers and make sure you have some empty

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.149 
layers and make sure you have some empty
layers<00:03:09.019> otherwise<00:03:10.019> if<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.290> do<00:03:10.650> over<00:03:11.010> use

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
layers otherwise if you do over use

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.619 
layers otherwise if you do over use
layers<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.579> you'll<00:03:11.700> find<00:03:11.969> a<00:03:12.090> big<00:03:12.269> problem

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
layers and you'll find a big problem

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.899 
layers and you'll find a big problem
when<00:03:12.859> creating<00:03:13.859> your<00:03:13.980> emblems<00:03:14.370> but<00:03:14.579> hopefully

when creating your emblems but hopefully

and try every sort of emblem you guys

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.170 
and try every sort of emblem you guys
try<00:03:45.959> asking<00:03:46.470> for<00:03:46.799> for<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:47.459> bit<00:03:47.699> here<00:03:47.729> i<00:03:47.909> was

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
try asking for for this bit here i was

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.449 
try asking for for this bit here i was
sort<00:03:48.359> of<00:03:48.389> thinking<00:03:48.629> about<00:03:48.989> using<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.439> i<00:03:49.979> think

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
sort of thinking about using the i think

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.979 
sort of thinking about using the i think
it's<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.669> first<00:03:50.970> thing<00:03:51.239> when<00:03:51.659> you<00:03:51.750> get<00:03:51.870> when

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
it's the first thing when you get when

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.199 
it's the first thing when you get when
your<00:03:52.079> rank<00:03:52.259> up<00:03:52.439> but<00:03:53.159> if<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.609> can't<00:03:53.849> really<00:03:54.090> use

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
your rank up but if you can't really use

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.080 
your rank up but if you can't really use
that<00:03:54.239> then<00:03:55.220> because<00:03:56.220> i<00:03:56.310> think<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.609> thickness

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
that then because i think the thickness

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.050 
that then because i think the thickness
was<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.359> issue<00:03:57.449> that's<00:03:58.290> why<00:03:58.439> i<00:03:58.470> went<00:03:58.650> for<00:03:58.829> the

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
was the issue that's why i went for the

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.599 
was the issue that's why i went for the
plane<00:04:00.060> bars<00:04:00.359> so<00:04:01.019> this<00:04:01.979> is<00:04:02.099> sort<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.400> how<00:04:02.549> the

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
plane bars so this is sort of how the

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.999 
plane bars so this is sort of how the
badge<00:04:02.909> looks<00:04:03.180> slight<00:04:03.900> probably<00:04:04.680> different

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:05.009 
badge looks slight probably different

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:07.309 
badge looks slight probably different
let's<00:04:05.220> say<00:04:05.370> with<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.840> with<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.870> top<00:04:07.109> bit<00:04:07.259> of

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
let's say with the with the top bit of

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.839 
let's say with the with the top bit of
the<00:04:07.439> M<00:04:07.560> here<00:04:07.889> at<00:04:07.949> the<00:04:08.040> main<00:04:08.189> em<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.609> middle

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
the M here at the main em in the middle

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.119 
the M here at the main em in the middle
but<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:10.109> badge<00:04:10.259> looks<00:04:10.439> so<00:04:10.650> like<00:04:10.829> that<00:04:10.979> that's

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
but the badge looks so like that that's

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.770 
but the badge looks so like that that's
how<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.280> could<00:04:11.639> get<00:04:11.790> in<00:04:11.909> there<00:04:12.120> mount<00:04:12.509> of<00:04:12.569> layers

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
how I could get in there mount of layers

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.599 
how I could get in there mount of layers
i<00:04:12.870> had<00:04:13.049> available<00:04:13.470> so<00:04:14.220> hopefully<00:04:14.489> you<00:04:14.549> guys
