up<00:01:20.400> your<00:01:20.850> resources<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:22.189> let's<00:01:23.189> talk<00:01:23.280> about

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
up your resources now let's talk about

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
up your resources now let's talk about
the<00:01:23.549> specs<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:23.970> thing<00:01:24.150> because<00:01:24.299> they're

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the specs on this thing because they're

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.300 
the specs on this thing because they're
very<00:01:24.750> impressive<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.409> thing<00:01:25.680> has<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> tee

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
very impressive this thing has a tee

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.060 
very impressive this thing has a tee
8300<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.119> that's<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> 2.4<00:01:28.110> gigahertz<00:01:28.170> core<00:01:28.890> 2

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
8300 so that's the 2.4 gigahertz core 2

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.130 
8300 so that's the 2.4 gigahertz core 2
duo<00:01:29.100> from<00:01:29.430> Intel<00:01:29.850> very<00:01:30.090> fast<00:01:30.360> very<00:01:30.479> efficient

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
duo from Intel very fast very efficient

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350 
duo from Intel very fast very efficient
it<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.530> 45<00:01:32.189> nm<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.909> your<00:01:33.000> pen<00:01:33.210> ryn

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
it is 45 nm so it's one of your pen ryn

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.240 
it is 45 nm so it's one of your pen ryn
so<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.900> run<00:01:34.049> cool<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.560> efficient

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
so it's going to run cool and efficient

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.620 
so it's going to run cool and efficient
this<00:01:35.340> laptop<00:01:35.490> actually<00:01:35.729> doesn't<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.299> hot<00:01:36.479> at

their<00:03:05.130> fingerprint<00:03:05.640> you're<00:03:05.850> not<00:03:06.180> going<00:03:06.750> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
their fingerprint you're not going to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.260 
their fingerprint you're not going to
reproduce<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:08.460> let<00:03:08.580> me<00:03:08.640> go<00:03:08.730> ahead<00:03:08.760> go<00:03:09.000> over

per second of throughput so very fast
just<00:04:05.040> as<00:04:05.130> it<00:04:05.250> fills<00:04:05.400> inside<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.820> computer<00:04:06.060> got

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
just as it fills inside the computer got

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.690 
just as it fills inside the computer got
a<00:04:06.990> nice<00:04:07.230> little<00:04:07.410> vga<00:04:07.950> out<00:04:08.190> here<00:04:08.400> if<00:04:08.459> you<00:04:08.550> want
