00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
lot it it it's a different quality of

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.890

bacon<00:04:52.159> I<00:04:52.250> mean<00:04:52.430> there's<00:04:52.639> a<00:04:52.729> lot<00:04:52.880> easier<00:04:53.330> in<00:04:53.570> the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
bacon I mean there's a lot easier in the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.680 
bacon I mean there's a lot easier in the
micron<00:04:54.889> pan<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:56.510> it's<00:04:58.330> it's<00:04:59.330> just<00:04:59.449> a

it<00:05:01.280> now<00:05:01.940> I<00:05:01.970> can't<00:05:02.210> imagine<00:05:02.599> but<00:05:02.690> it<00:05:02.810> depends<00:05:03.080> on

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
it now I can't imagine but it depends on

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.379 
it now I can't imagine but it depends on
the<00:05:03.199> type<00:05:03.380> of<00:05:03.409> bacon<00:05:03.620> because<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.820> two<00:05:05.180> types

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
the type of bacon because the two types

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.820 
the type of bacon because the two types
of<00:05:05.510> bacon<00:05:05.630> that<00:05:05.900> I<00:05:05.930> bought<00:05:06.169> not<00:05:06.380> only<00:05:06.650> did<00:05:06.800> I

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
of bacon that I bought not only did I

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.710 
of bacon that I bought not only did I
buy<00:05:07.190> two<00:05:07.250> types<00:05:07.610> of<00:05:07.729> bacon<00:05:08.000> but<00:05:08.090> I<00:05:08.150> cooked<00:05:08.479> half

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
buy two types of bacon but I cooked half

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.120 
buy two types of bacon but I cooked half
of<00:05:08.990> it<00:05:09.169> in<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.320> microwave<00:05:09.590> and<00:05:09.740> half<00:05:09.919> on<00:05:10.039> the

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
of it in the microwave and half on the

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.790 
of it in the microwave and half on the
skillet<00:05:10.430> just<00:05:10.460> because<00:05:10.880> of<00:05:11.090> capacity<00:05:11.590> hmm<00:05:12.650> so

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
skillet just because of capacity hmm so

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.820 
skillet just because of capacity hmm so
I<00:05:12.830> was<00:05:12.949> like<00:05:13.039> not<00:05:13.250> only<00:05:13.340> has<00:05:14.090> four<00:05:14.599> types<00:05:15.590> of

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
I was like not only has four types of

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.129 
I was like not only has four types of
bacon<00:05:16.370> in<00:05:16.490> our<00:05:16.610> experiment<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:17.389> I<00:05:17.870> got<00:05:18.050> the

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
bacon in our experiment and I got the

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.620 
bacon in our experiment and I got the
black<00:05:18.380> forest<00:05:18.680> ham<00:05:18.860> Black<00:05:19.490> Forest<00:05:19.699> bacon

fat<00:05:22.610> in<00:05:22.760> it<00:05:22.909> mm-hmm

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
fat in it mm-hmm

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.760 
fat in it mm-hmm
I<00:05:23.539> gotta<00:05:23.900> admit<00:05:23.990> that<00:05:24.320> didn't<00:05:24.500> hold<00:05:24.590> up<00:05:24.710> very

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
I gotta admit that didn't hold up very

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.070 
I gotta admit that didn't hold up very
well<00:05:24.949> in<00:05:25.159> the<00:05:25.220> microwave<00:05:25.610> it<00:05:25.849> got<00:05:26.060> too<00:05:26.479> too

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
well in the microwave it got too too

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.050 
well in the microwave it got too too
short<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:27.949> was<00:05:28.070> just<00:05:28.250> like<00:05:28.400> what<00:05:28.729> happened

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
short and it was just like what happened
