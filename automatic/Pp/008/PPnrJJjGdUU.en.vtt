00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
show you the fan filter I think it's

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.700 
show you the fan filter I think it's
called<00:06:07.300> a<00:06:07.390> fan<00:06:07.570> filter<00:06:07.930> check<00:06:08.170> our<00:06:08.320> program

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
called a fan filter check our program

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.280 
called a fan filter check our program
and<00:06:08.950> I'll<00:06:09.430> show<00:06:09.610> you<00:06:09.670> how<00:06:09.940> many<00:06:10.480> hours<00:06:10.900> in<00:06:11.080> use
