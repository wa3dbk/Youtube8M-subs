something<00:01:59.950> coming<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.370> or<00:02:00.580> whatnot<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:01.240> it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
something coming in or whatnot so it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.460 
something coming in or whatnot so it
actually<00:02:02.760> works<00:02:03.760> pretty<00:02:03.850> well<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.260> side

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
actually works pretty well on the side

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.460 
actually works pretty well on the side
we<00:02:05.680> have<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.370> volume<00:02:06.870> markers<00:02:07.870> and<00:02:08.289> the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
we have the volume markers and the

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.070 
we have the volume markers and the
play/pause<00:02:08.649> button<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:10.149> is<00:02:10.270> typical<00:02:10.750> on<00:02:10.899> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
play/pause button this is typical on the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.500 
play/pause button this is typical on the
BlackBerry<00:02:11.590> 10<00:02:11.770> devices<00:02:11.830> so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
BlackBerry 10 devices so

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.990 
BlackBerry 10 devices so
it<00:02:13.659> makes<00:02:13.840> sense<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.200> have<00:02:14.319> it<00:02:14.379> come<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:15.000> this

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
it makes sense to have it come on this

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.690 
it makes sense to have it come on this
mini<00:02:16.510> stereo<00:02:16.840> speaker<00:02:17.140> as<00:02:17.230> well<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:18.430> left

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
in the review we'll be testing out how

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
functions this is actually a it looks

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.449 
functions this is actually a it looks
like<00:02:52.359> a<00:02:52.389> clip<00:02:52.810> because<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.950> idea<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.430> that

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
like a clip because the idea is that

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.979 
like a clip because the idea is that
you'll<00:02:54.760> be<00:02:54.909> able<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.239> not<00:02:55.359> only<00:02:55.389> have<00:02:55.810> it

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
you'll be able to not only have it

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.710 
you'll be able to not only have it
sitting<00:02:56.470> on<00:02:56.590> your<00:02:56.769> desk<00:02:57.099> or<00:02:57.519> wherever<00:02:58.450> you

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
want it but you'll actually be able to

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.610 
want it but you'll actually be able to
clip<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:00.819> onto<00:03:01.060> your<00:03:01.299> seat<00:03:01.599> belt<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.530> if

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
as well so that's that's a look at the

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.830 
as well so that's that's a look at the
I'll<00:03:30.280> see<00:03:30.459> if<00:03:30.579> there's<00:03:30.730> anything<00:03:31.090> else<00:03:31.329> here<00:03:31.690> I

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
I'll see if there's anything else here I

think<00:03:32.109> this<00:03:32.230> just<00:03:32.379> pretty<00:03:32.680> much<00:03:32.829> manuals<00:03:33.810> of

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
think this just pretty much manuals of

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.860 
think this just pretty much manuals of
course<00:03:35.049> we<00:03:35.199> have<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.730> USB<00:03:36.730> cable<00:03:37.150> that's

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
course we have the USB cable that's

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.780 
course we have the USB cable that's
pretty<00:03:38.139> much<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.500> that's<00:03:39.160> pretty<00:03:39.400> much<00:03:39.639> all

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
pretty much it that's pretty much all

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.140 
pretty much it that's pretty much all
that<00:03:39.819> comes<00:03:40.090> inside<00:03:40.599> the<00:03:40.660> box<00:03:40.859> nothing<00:03:41.859> else

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
that comes inside the box nothing else

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.050 
that comes inside the box nothing else
so<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.959> is<00:03:44.079> your<00:03:44.230> first<00:03:44.620> look<00:03:44.769> at<00:03:44.919> the
