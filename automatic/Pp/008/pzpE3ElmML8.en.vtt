oh<00:00:05.779> and<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:06.990> drone<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:07.560> just<00:00:07.710> made<00:00:07.859> it

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
oh and this drone that just made it

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.610 
oh and this drone that just made it
across<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.370> map<00:00:08.550> it's<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.849> like<00:00:09.059> huh<00:00:09.300> oh<00:00:09.620> the

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
across the map it's is like huh oh the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.759 
across the map it's is like huh oh the
stork<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:10.980> putting<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.309> hug<00:00:11.460> oh<00:00:12.259> man<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.740> know

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
stork is putting a hug oh man you know

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.589 
stork is putting a hug oh man you know
someone<00:00:14.219> actually<00:00:14.400> calculated<00:00:15.299> there<00:00:15.480> was

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
someone actually calculated there was

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.750 
someone actually calculated there was
that<00:00:15.719> guy<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:16.170> red<00:00:16.350> that's<00:00:16.590> like<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.220> the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
that guy on red that's like this is the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.490 
that guy on red that's like this is the
exact<00:00:18.270> number<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.630> probes<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.020> need<00:00:19.170> has<00:00:19.380> he

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
exact number of probes you need has he

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.130 
exact number of probes you need has he
pulled<00:00:19.680> enough<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.640> pulled<00:00:21.210> eight<00:00:21.660> eight

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
pulled enough you pulled eight eight

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.710 
pulled enough you pulled eight eight
wasn't<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.769> ten<00:00:22.949> yeah<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.970> lose<00:00:24.240> my<00:00:24.330> probes

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
wasn't it ten yeah and I lose my probes

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.420 
wasn't it ten yeah and I lose my probes
and<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.439> can<00:00:25.590> see<00:00:25.800> here<00:00:26.039> right<00:00:26.189> now

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and you can you can see here right now

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.660 
and you can you can see here right now
it's<00:00:27.300> losing<00:00:27.900> HP<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.130> hatch<00:00:29.310> will<00:00:29.550> die

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
it's losing HP so this hatch will die

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.339 
it's losing HP so this hatch will die
but<00:00:29.939> there<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> chance<00:00:30.539> if<00:00:30.720> true<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.050> very

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
but there is a chance if true is very

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.110 
but there is a chance if true is very
fast<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:32.130> he<00:00:32.219> more<00:00:32.369> Symington<00:00:32.730> evolution

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
fast that he more Symington evolution

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.069 
fast that he more Symington evolution
jammer<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.660> um<00:00:33.840> um<00:00:34.559> boom<00:00:35.309> boom<00:00:35.820> fast<00:00:36.780> that's

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
jammer but um um boom boom fast that's

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.569 
jammer but um um boom boom fast that's
how<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.380> reload<00:00:37.890> proxy<00:00:38.879> hatch<00:00:40.309> he<00:00:41.309> could<00:00:41.460> have

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
how you reload proxy hatch he could have

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.740 
how you reload proxy hatch he could have
actually<00:00:41.700> accepted<00:00:42.329> life<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> little

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
actually accepted life for a little

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.190 
actually accepted life for a little
longer

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
longer

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.170 
longer
evolution<00:00:43.770> chambers<00:00:44.070> gain<00:00:44.250> HP<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.789> quickly

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
evolution chambers gain HP so quickly

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.340 
evolution chambers gain HP so quickly
that<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.420> think<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:45.719> was<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> chance<00:00:45.930> that

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
that I think there was a chance that

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.569 
that I think there was a chance that
this<00:00:46.440> might<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:46.800> been<00:00:47.070> enough<00:00:47.280> probes

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
this might have not been enough probes

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.110 
this might have not been enough probes
oh<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:48.629> god<00:00:48.960> no<00:00:49.230> no<00:00:49.469> no<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.340> don't<00:00:50.550> believe<00:00:50.789> it

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
oh my god no no no I don't believe it

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.439 
oh my god no no no I don't believe it
this<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> really<00:00:51.750> smart<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.699> mean<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:54.270> look<00:00:54.390> at

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
this is really smart I mean just look at

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.760 
this is really smart I mean just look at
the<00:00:54.570> nut<00:00:54.719> look<00:00:54.899> at<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> income<00:00:55.320> right<00:00:55.530> like

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the nut look at the income right like

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.500 
the nut look at the income right like
this<00:00:55.920> has<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.280> racking<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> income<00:00:57.329> yeah

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
this has to be racking the income yeah

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.639 
this has to be racking the income yeah
and<00:00:57.870> what<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.140> think<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.440> gonna<00:00:58.559> happen

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and what do you think is gonna happen

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.049 
and what do you think is gonna happen
now<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.129> most<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.460> into<00:00:59.640> an<00:00:59.699> evolution

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
now if you most it into an evolution

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.450 
now if you most it into an evolution
chamber<00:01:00.210> again<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:00.930> ignore<00:01:01.230> it

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
chamber again then I can just ignore it

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.280 
chamber again then I can just ignore it
hmm<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.120> point<00:01:03.420> he<00:01:03.600> could<00:01:03.750> almost<00:01:03.870> morph

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
hmm at that point he could almost morph

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.899 
hmm at that point he could almost morph
it<00:01:04.439> into<00:01:04.470> us<00:01:04.739> hey<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> spawning<00:01:05.580> poo<00:01:05.790> is

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
it into us hey but the spawning poo is

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.340 
it into us hey but the spawning poo is
more<00:01:06.090> than<00:01:06.180> halfway<00:01:06.450> done<00:01:06.780> by<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> way<00:01:07.170> if

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
more than halfway done by the way if

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.039 
more than halfway done by the way if
circlings<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.189> oh<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.939> oh<00:01:08.970> my<00:01:09.119> god

now<00:01:14.700> he's<00:01:14.909> forced<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.659> no<00:01:15.840> he's<00:01:15.930> gonna

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
now he's forced to do this no he's gonna

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.280 
now he's forced to do this no he's gonna
force<00:01:16.290> Proust<00:01:16.650> back<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.610> probes<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.420> okay

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
force Proust back in the probes out okay

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.749 
force Proust back in the probes out okay
he<00:01:19.500> has<00:01:19.619> been<00:01:19.799> building<00:01:20.070> probes<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.490> along

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
he has been building probes all along

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.370 
he has been building probes all along
here<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> 11<00:01:21.450> probes<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.840> main<00:01:21.990> base<00:01:22.140> now

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
here the 11 probes in the main base now

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.620 
here the 11 probes in the main base now
however<00:01:23.130> there<00:01:23.340> are<00:01:23.430> zerglings<00:01:24.030> already<00:01:24.450> out

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
thing on the other side of the map I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600 
thing on the other side of the map I
can't<00:01:27.869> believe<00:01:28.170> how<00:01:28.380> many<00:01:28.439> factories<00:01:29.220> he's

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
can't believe how many factories he's

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.280 
can't believe how many factories he's
starting<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.210> cancelled<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.840> would<00:01:31.049> love<00:01:31.200> to

starting and cancelled I would love to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.240 
starting and cancelled I would love to

see the builder to history oh look at

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.800 
see the builder to history oh look at
the<00:01:35.340> HP<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.909> evolution<00:01:36.299> shame<00:01:36.450> okay<00:01:36.689> he's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the HP of this evolution shame okay he's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.450 
the HP of this evolution shame okay he's
losing<00:01:37.140> HP<00:01:37.500> but<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.490> us<00:01:38.820> yeah<00:01:39.150> oh<00:01:40.009> my<00:01:41.009> god<00:01:41.220> this

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
losing HP but for us yeah oh my god this

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.840 
losing HP but for us yeah oh my god this
drone<00:01:41.820> he's<00:01:42.150> seen<00:01:42.479> things<00:01:42.840> yeah<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.490> drone
