00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.099
 hello to all and all 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.560
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.320
 recipe of the waffle dough so for 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.250
 you will need 250 g of 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.000
 flour 125 g white sugar 50 g 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.279
 melted butter 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.800
 a pinch of salt 20 centimes liter of 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.750
 milk and 2 so for milk one can 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.000
 replace speaking centilitres of beer 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.800
 or 20 centilitres of water so we'll 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.190
 start with the boot we will mix 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:52.660
 both ways yesterday family content 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:54.970
 with sugar some butter 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:12.219
 fear of melted butter and we're going 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:14.770
 add your shit we walk 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:18.899
 nights what's waiting in front of the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.899
 consistency of thierry 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:30.759
 we will have to add little by little 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.759
 20 centilitres from the east 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.330
 we're going to add re wants this concept a 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:02:00.900
 little dry to dilute to be able to incorporate 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:02:00.900
 just like the flour to the mix a little 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:11.160
 here goes continue incorporating the flour 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.629
 and we will add the rest of the milk 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:53.300
 so we get a 12 point dough 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.300
 quite fluid 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.470
 it's very easy to do it takes 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.650
 a lot of time and it's very far 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.340
 explains to his line pat so I remember 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:12.680
 with a pinch of salt that we will do 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:18.020
 immediately op 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:22.310
 we know the pastry not important and mix 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.640
 one last time so you can 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.050
 flavor it your waffle dough with 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.900
 a spoon of rome of the flower 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.180
 orange or less what you desire 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.560
 here is your patagon is ready it does not 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.019
 remains more than at the piano we are going 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.510
 now to go to cooking the 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.730
 waffles or obviously uses a 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.489
 waffle maker we talk about and the left we 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:49.010
 will take peace is not fat louche 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:52.220
 blow fill them with waffle irons 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.720
 advised to match my post 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:59.360
 second a little more than a big ladle 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.610
 to fill both well and sinkhole 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.970
 after that obviously depends on your word 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.970
 frier 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.310

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.799
 offers regular good and here we close 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.299
 we cook and we end up 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.010
 point the cus have so more or less 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.410
 two minutes depending on the devices to 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.430
 left so here I think our 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.310

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.369
 jam everything you want from 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.709
