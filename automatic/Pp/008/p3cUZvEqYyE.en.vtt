00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
before I did this trick so what you need

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.889 
before I did this trick so what you need
to<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.250> before<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:38.430> start<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:39.120> need<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.390> make

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
to do before we start you need to make

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.500 
to do before we start you need to make
sure<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.590> all<00:00:40.680> obviously<00:00:41.040> signed<00:00:41.280> out<00:00:41.510> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
sure you all obviously signed out you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.979 
sure you all obviously signed out you
want<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.750> go<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> network<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:45.660> then<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.840> want

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
want to go to network and then you want

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.600 
want to go to network and then you want
to<00:00:46.110> set<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.590> internet<00:00:47.010> connection<00:00:47.460> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
to set up internet connection and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.000 
to set up internet connection and
obviously<00:00:48.300> even<00:00:48.600> using<00:00:48.960> wireless<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.590> land<00:00:49.890> of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
obviously even using wireless or land of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.729 
obviously even using wireless or land of
CL<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.730> cable<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.539> faster<00:00:51.870> way<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.590> your

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
CL and cable is the faster way so your

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.939 
CL and cable is the faster way so your
LAN<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.430> want<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.579> custom<00:00:54.239> custom<00:00:55.140> then

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
LAN then you want to custom custom then

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.709 
LAN then you want to custom custom then
your<00:00:56.100> automatic<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.969> then<00:00:57.239> when<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.449> get<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
your automatic and then when you get to

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.619 
your automatic and then when you get to
something<00:00:57.899> called<00:00:58.879> empty<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.180> settings

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
