00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.280
 How about friends we are now in 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.530
 santa monica california testing the 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.639
 new and 8 of the brand bmw a vehicle 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.189
 that we had the opportunity to meet 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.960
 three years ago already a vehicle that is already 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.150
 of production and that the truth keeps 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.860
 a lot of the design elements that 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.210
 we had been able to observe when 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.279
 we first met as a 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.790
 vehicle concept a hybrid vehicle 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.020
 which has two engines engine 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.970
 electrical technology that is placed in 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.470
 the front and that moves just 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.750
 the front axle and a motor 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.820
 internal combustion 1.5 liters three 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.530
 cylinders that is placed in the part 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.690
 later and that somehow moves 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.190
 the rear axle a vehicle that is 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.019
 front- wheel drive in most of the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.850
 time but when we started to use 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.160
 the internal combustion engine is 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.769
 becomes a traction 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.710
 Integrates the range that has autonomy 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.989
 this vehicle is 35 kilometers more or 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.910
 less at 120 kilometers per hour in the 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.489
 electric mode and from there we can go 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.440
 up to an autonomy of almost 440 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.210
 kilometers when we are using 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.710
 both technologies and also something very 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.320
 important is that the top speed of 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.030
 this vehicle is 250 kilometers 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.710
 time something also very important is that 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.170
 all the elements that we see in it 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.490
 outside are functional nothing of what 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.200
 is placed in this vehicle is 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.330
 only of ornament only 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.770
 aesthetic but really are functional 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.810
 as we can see in the back 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.340
 something also very important to emphasize 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.530
 this vehicle is that it will reach 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.720
 our market to the Mexican market to 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.630
 late this year and here in the usa 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.909
 more or less oscillates around 135 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.800
 thousand dollars in mexico we will still have 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.210
 to make some adjustments something 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.100
 also to stand out from this vehicle is 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.780
 which is a hybrid plug-in vehicle a 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.520
 vehicle that we can load in 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.649
 our house we can load directly 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.360
 in a fast current charger and 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.270
 this obviously favors being able to have 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.979
 a better one better performance thanks 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.050
 that we can have a capacity 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.700
 complete of the same batteries that 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.200
 they are also recharged through the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.570
 regeneration that can be done 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.550
 embassies or also the cargo that 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.800
 can get directly from the engine of 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.360
 internal combustion this is the new and 8 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.890
 of the bmw brand that we are testing 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.890
 from here from santa m√≥nica california
