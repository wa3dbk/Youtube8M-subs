00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.180
 hello to all of us who are in the tactical era with the visual waist and 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.200
 plastic is an authentic census taker 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.969
 using lead penalty cartoonist idea is that students write their name in 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.700
 the sheet with the tool detected that find the bottom of the 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.699
 screen 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.210
 and the idea is to use a typography he sent that possible by female 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.539
 that windows phone kill in this one the lic 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.099
 typography been state 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.920
 that the written word we are going to go to the modify menu if we choose the option 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.579
 convert in course 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.009
 why do we do this 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.949
 in order to have both 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.760
 of each of the letters are not the control points that is why it has already passed 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.500
 for reform to law 30 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.550
 this case the first thing I'm doing is for a bit the word but 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.690
 we work how he could also work with his 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.800
 and well then simply by double clicking on each of the letters 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.200
 I'm going to disappoint 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.850
 as you see country I can still avoid the letter in your CV press the right button 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.400
 they go from buitrón to eta 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.400
 for without modifying points in action modify points 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.920
 this activity playing with the novillitos 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 to deform to taste 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.330
 the letter 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
 really this way they ask us for a taste for books 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.170
 one can make the modification that he wants 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.570
 both the currency 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.080
 he did not play in the b 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.300
 modified it 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.300
 if I did not want to climb the letter again 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.140
 one returns a fact will eliminate 8 modify points and there what you do 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 silence each of the goals 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.730
 and so on until you work with everyone 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.530
 banorte is very funny that they are not a driven 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.170
 and that has a vázquez footprint 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.560
 once I have 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.490
 I have written 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.610
 issues such as equity sources 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.920
 you can start working with neighbors 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.740
 they will never be able anymore in the toolbar 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.709
 I must work with authenticity professional huseman plot 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.299
 they concretized 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.010
 samán gradient with the obstacles that exist ways for girls 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.359
 or as a country even the opinion does not respect even also with the 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.549
 own 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.549
 with which they come by default 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.480
 berlocq very interesting things are achieved 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.649
 Fukuda mentioned 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:34.929
 how could they 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.659
 an edge 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.659
 also could with that 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.599
 and in the end they manage to have an effect that the wave is worth 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.979
 at work 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:50.379
 for the promises of Panama, which does not allow the tribute paid 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.619
 find available I want to give 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:55.619
 the machine has also highlighted giving it was wanted so it's a good 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.720
 a good practice for that date there is nothing of what it is
