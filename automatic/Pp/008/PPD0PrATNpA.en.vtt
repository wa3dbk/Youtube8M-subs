00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
remember being backstage and seeing des

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.319

getting<00:00:58.739> ready<00:00:58.920> pumping<00:00:59.370> up<00:00:59.460> backstage<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
getting ready pumping up backstage and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.770 
getting ready pumping up backstage and
my<00:01:01.260> jaw<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:01.590> hit<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> floor<00:01:02.780> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
my jaw just hit the floor the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.530 
my jaw just hit the floor the
conditioning<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> size<00:01:04.939> it<00:01:05.939> was<00:01:06.119> all<00:01:06.270> there

conditioning the size it was all there
and<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.049> think<00:01:07.320> had<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.590> not<00:01:07.740> been<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and I think had it not been for the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.700 
and I think had it not been for the
hernia<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.869> des<00:01:10.080> would<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.470> sitting

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
hernia I think des would be sitting

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.250 
hernia I think des would be sitting
there<00:01:10.890> now's<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.250> its<00:01:11.400> champion<00:01:11.900> because<00:01:12.900> he

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
there now's of its champion because he

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.249 
there now's of its champion because he
completely<00:01:13.470> outmatched<00:01:14.330> flexin<00:01:15.330> ok<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:16.140> know

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
completely outmatched flexin ok you know

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.469 
completely outmatched flexin ok you know
des<00:01:16.470> has<00:01:16.650> issues<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.009> his<00:01:17.310> abdomen<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:18.450> a

des has issues with his abdomen like a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.179 
des has issues with his abdomen like a
lot<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.780> bodybuilders<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.070> he

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
lot of bodybuilders do but I think if he

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.310 
lot of bodybuilders do but I think if he
can<00:01:20.369> bring<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> tight<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.090> midsection<00:01:21.420> but

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
can bring in a tight in midsection but

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.080 
can bring in a tight in midsection but
bringing<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.880> wow<00:01:24.060> factor

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
bringing that you know that wow factor

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.560 
bringing that you know that wow factor
and<00:01:25.080> be<00:01:25.259> 30<00:01:25.560> 35<00:01:26.220> pound<00:01:26.490> heavy<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> last<00:01:27.060> year<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and be 30 35 pound heavy the last year I

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.120 
and be 30 35 pound heavy the last year I
think<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> lot<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> people<00:01:28.500> are<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> sit

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
think a lot of people are going to sit

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.640 
think a lot of people are going to sit
up<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.549> take<00:01:30.180> them<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.689> think<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.200> think<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.560> does

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
up and take them I think I think it does

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.990 
up and take them I think I think it does
has<00:01:31.829> got<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.220> idea<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.640> know<00:01:32.759> he's

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
has got the right idea you know he's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.840 
has got the right idea you know he's
he's<00:01:33.210> mixing<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:33.930> his<00:01:34.079> training<00:01:34.380> he's<00:01:34.850> period

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
he's mixing up his training he's period

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.490 
he's mixing up his training he's period
izing<00:01:36.119> his<00:01:36.210> trading<00:01:36.509> he's<00:01:36.780> doing<00:01:37.049> some<00:01:37.380> hit

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
izing his trading he's doing some hit

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.140 
izing his trading he's doing some hit
some<00:01:37.710> heavy<00:01:37.860> weeks<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.430> heavy<00:01:38.640> weeks<00:01:38.880> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
some heavy weeks for heavy weeks and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.569 
some heavy weeks for heavy weeks and
then<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:39.930> lighter<00:01:40.140> weeks<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.220> more

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
then for lighter weeks going for more

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.340 
then for lighter weeks going for more
repetitions<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.420> perhaps<00:01:42.570> more<00:01:42.869> sex<00:01:43.170> more

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
repetitions and perhaps more sex more

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.310 
repetitions and perhaps more sex more
volume<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.460> think<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.750> kind<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.049> phase

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
volume and I think in this kind of phase

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.429 
volume and I think in this kind of phase
of<00:01:46.790> dieting<00:01:47.790> even<00:01:48.570> though<00:01:48.659> he's<00:01:48.840> taken<00:01:49.290> in

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
of dieting even though he's taken in

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.219 
of dieting even though he's taken in
over<00:01:49.950> 6,000<00:01:50.549> calories<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.880> day<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.869> bodies<00:01:52.200> in

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
over 6,000 calories a day the bodies in

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.899 
over 6,000 calories a day the bodies in
a<00:01:52.380> fairly<00:01:52.590> delicate<00:01:52.829> state<00:01:53.310> body<00:01:53.579> fact<00:01:53.790> there

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
a fairly delicate state body fact there

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.780 
a fairly delicate state body fact there
was<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> very<00:01:54.270> low<00:01:55.040> you<00:01:56.040> can't<00:01:56.280> push<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.610> too

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
was a very low you can't push it too

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.160 
was a very low you can't push it too
much<00:01:56.820> because<00:01:57.240> you're<00:01:57.509> nervous<00:01:57.659> system<00:01:58.110> is

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
much because you're nervous system is

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.260 
much because you're nervous system is
going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.350> take<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> hammering<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.310> I've

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
going to take a hammering so I've

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.030 
going to take a hammering so I've
suggested<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.899> Darren<00:02:01.320> what<00:02:01.590> he<00:02:01.649> does<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:02.009> is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
suggested to Darren what he does now is

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.249 
suggested to Darren what he does now is
he<00:02:02.310> perhaps<00:02:03.270> pulls<00:02:03.540> back<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.780> little<00:02:03.960> bit<00:02:04.140> from

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
he perhaps pulls back a little bit from

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.260 
he perhaps pulls back a little bit from
the<00:02:04.409> training<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:05.490> trains<00:02:05.790> once<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.149> day

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the training just trains once a day

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.479 
the training just trains once a day
rather<00:02:06.479> than<00:02:06.570> twice<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> day<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.250> place

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
rather than twice a day and in the place

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.010 
rather than twice a day and in the place
of<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.849> training<00:02:09.119> session<00:02:09.539> he<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.869> does<00:02:09.989> a

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
of that training session he just does a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.380 
of that training session he just does a
little<00:02:10.229> bit<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.530> very<00:02:10.739> low<00:02:10.920> impact<00:02:11.220> cardio

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
little bit of very low impact cardio

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.940 
little bit of very low impact cardio
just<00:02:13.390> give<00:02:13.510> them<00:02:13.599> a<00:02:13.690> bit<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.930> rest<00:02:14.170> help<00:02:14.769> keep

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
just give them a bit the rest help keep

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.759 
just give them a bit the rest help keep
him<00:02:15.069> full<00:02:15.400> he'll<00:02:16.390> be<00:02:16.510> able<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.840> utilize<00:02:17.590> all

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
him full he'll be able to utilize all

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.339 
him full he'll be able to utilize all
those<00:02:17.920> calories<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.959> know<00:02:20.080> possibly

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
those calories and you know possibly

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.110 
those calories and you know possibly
even<00:02:20.680> grow<00:02:20.950> into<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.250> show<00:02:21.459> which<00:02:21.670> which<00:02:22.000> a
