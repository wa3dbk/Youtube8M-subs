00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
really cool math blaster did something

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.150 
really cool math blaster did something
to<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> squirt<00:02:10.739> at<00:02:10.860> HQ<00:02:11.220> that's<00:02:11.400> never<00:02:11.670> really

done before the game with these bolts

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.180 
done before the game with these bolts
will<00:02:14.050> occasionally<00:02:14.350> do<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.560> big<00:02:14.770> name<00:02:14.920> title

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190

but<00:02:15.340> we<00:02:15.430> try<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.640> do<00:02:15.820> games<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.270> some<00:02:16.510> may

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
but we try to do games that some may

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.180 
but we try to do games that some may
have<00:02:16.810> heard<00:02:16.960> of<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.170> others<00:02:17.350> not<00:02:17.530> with<00:02:18.010> math

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190

blaster<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.670> thought<00:02:18.910> we<00:02:19.000> were<00:02:19.090> doing<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.300> game

that<00:02:19.570> no<00:02:19.870> one<00:02:20.080> would<00:02:20.200> know<00:02:20.350> but<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.620> turned<00:02:20.830> out

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that no one would know but it turned out
