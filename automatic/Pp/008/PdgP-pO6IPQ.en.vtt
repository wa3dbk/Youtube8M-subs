away from it I fold the fabric over

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.249 
away from it I fold the fabric over

especially if it's in fly season make

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.870 
especially if it's in fly season make
sure<00:02:05.409> that's<00:02:05.590> nice<00:02:05.770> that's<00:02:05.979> nice<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.520> secure

nothing's<00:02:07.329> going<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:07.539> get<00:02:07.689> in<00:02:07.840> there<00:02:08.019> and<00:02:08.229> set

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
nothing's going to get in there and set

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.499 
nothing's going to get in there and set
this<00:02:09.009> for<00:02:09.340> several<00:02:09.640> hours<00:02:09.759> on<00:02:10.060> your<00:02:10.179> counter

this for several hours on your counter
at<00:02:11.500> room<00:02:11.650> temperature<00:02:12.099> because<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.819> way<00:02:13.090> does

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
at room temperature because the way does

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.600 
at room temperature because the way does
not<00:02:13.300> drain<00:02:13.840> well<00:02:14.140> unless<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:14.980> at<00:02:15.220> room

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
not drain well unless it's at room

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.130 
not drain well unless it's at room
temperature<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.569> can<00:02:16.690> see<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.900> already

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
temperature so you can see it already

starting to drip the weight of yogurt

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.509 
starting to drip the weight of yogurt
will<00:02:19.690> do<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.890> we're<00:02:21.010> going<00:02:21.099> to<00:02:21.160> set<00:02:21.370> that

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
will do that so we're going to set that

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.289 
will do that so we're going to set that
aside<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:24.190> one<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.730> did<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:25.000> couple

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
aside and just one that I did a couple

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.550 
aside and just one that I did a couple
days<00:02:25.480> ago<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:27.060> after<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> few<00:02:28.959> hours<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.440> most

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
days ago and after a few hours and most

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.140 
days ago and after a few hours and most
of<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.799> way<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.010> dripped<00:02:30.340> out<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:30.819> can<00:02:30.970> set

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
of the way is dripped out you can set

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.820 
of the way is dripped out you can set
this<00:02:31.269> in<00:02:31.420> your<00:02:31.540> fridge<00:02:31.780> overnight<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.680> they

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
this in your fridge overnight so they

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.770 
this in your fridge overnight so they
continue<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.280> dripping<00:02:33.700> but<00:02:33.880> it's<00:02:34.000> at<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> safer

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
continue to dripping but it's at a safer

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.830 
continue to dripping but it's at a safer
temperature<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.700> don't<00:02:36.700> have<00:02:37.150> much<00:02:37.480> room<00:02:37.510> in<00:02:37.720> my

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
temperature I don't have much room in my

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.140

fridge at any given time if so many
projects<00:02:40.540> going<00:02:40.599> so<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.349> transfer<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.130> a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
projects going so I transfer it to a

pitcher what I do is you can see the way

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.920 
pitcher what I do is you can see the way
at<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.829> bottom<00:02:45.160> what<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.209> do<00:02:46.299> is<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.599> would<00:02:46.660> take

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
at the bottom what I do is I would take

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.819 
at the bottom what I do is I would take
this<00:02:47.110> bowl<00:02:47.700> or<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.940> way<00:02:49.090> into<00:02:49.569> there<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.079> then

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
this bowl or the way into there and then

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:58.050 
this bowl or the way into there and then
I<00:02:50.890> would<00:02:51.250> take<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:51.760> fabric<00:02:56.160> first<00:02:57.160> or<00:02:57.459> or

knife or any piece of somewhere across
that<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.319> take<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.709> opposite<00:03:03.130> corners

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
that and take to the opposite corners

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.460 
that and take to the opposite corners
and<00:03:05.650> I'm<00:03:05.770> going<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:05.950> tie<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:07.750> double<00:03:08.290> knot

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
and I'm going to tie just double knot

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.260 
and I'm going to tie just double knot
and<00:03:09.239> take<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.390> opposite<00:03:10.810> ones

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.770

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.450 

now<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.650> something<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.220> you've<00:03:20.340> been

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
now you have something that you've been

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.340 
now you have something that you've been
hanging<00:03:20.640> across<00:03:21.000> your<00:03:21.210> picture<00:03:21.540> now<00:03:22.110> this

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
hanging across your picture now this

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.350 
hanging across your picture now this
will<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.680> reduced<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.190> volume<00:03:23.610> by<00:03:23.940> then<00:03:24.150> but

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
will have reduced in volume by then but

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.910 
will have reduced in volume by then but
it<00:03:24.510> will<00:03:24.570> still<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.960> little<00:03:25.170> too<00:03:25.410> big<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.620> fit

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
it will still be a little too big to fit

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.760 
it will still be a little too big to fit
into<00:03:26.100> an<00:03:26.250> average<00:03:26.520> picture<00:03:26.990> so<00:03:27.990> you'll<00:03:28.650> need

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
into an average picture so you'll need

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.610 
into an average picture so you'll need
to<00:03:29.040> sort<00:03:29.550> of<00:03:29.580> stuff<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.120> in<00:03:30.210> there<00:03:30.500> after<00:03:31.500> it's

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
to sort of stuff it in there after it's

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.960 
to sort of stuff it in there after it's
completely<00:03:31.920> drained<00:03:32.220> out<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.520> see<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.790> fits

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
completely drained out you see it fits

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.330 
completely drained out you see it fits
nicely<00:03:33.410> all<00:03:34.410> right<00:03:34.590> now<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.830> question<00:03:34.980> is

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
nicely all right now the question is

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.810 
nicely all right now the question is
what<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:36.150> with<00:03:36.300> this<00:03:37.280> since<00:03:38.280> we're<00:03:38.459> talking

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
what to do with this since we're talking

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.150 
what to do with this since we're talking
about<00:03:39.209> weight<00:03:39.480> I'll<00:03:40.350> address<00:03:40.620> what<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:40.950> do<00:03:41.070> it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
about weight I'll address what to do it

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.430 
about weight I'll address what to do it
the<00:03:41.250> way<00:03:41.370> first<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.020> way<00:03:43.170> that

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
the way first this is the way that

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.360 
the way first this is the way that
you're<00:03:43.560> going<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.740> use<00:03:43.920> if<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.190> want<00:03:44.220> to

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
lacto-fermented and give them a head
