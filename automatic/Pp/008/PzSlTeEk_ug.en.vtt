00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.640
 Hi everyone tea 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:09.310
 It is Gutchi of the world rubber market also thank you Table Tennis Answers side this time 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.390
 Today's theme is here 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:17.020
 I will try to go about the point where back strike is stable 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:21.670
 Various called Uchikata of basic compression method of backhand 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:27.369
 Racket of angle Toka arm swing How Toka also Well that various videos 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:29.300
 I also put out, but today is not the angle of the racket or how to swing the arm 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.180
 The backhand will swing 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.290
 Be able to play 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.520
 I would like to introduce the way 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.390
 This time is three steps of this time 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:49.070
 If you are happy with the other three points please try 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:51.070
 To increase the left hand at the time of the in first one I am the eyes one a glance back 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.030
 Please try to do something 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.950
 When you 're always backhand down, maybe your left hand is 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:03.390
 I think it's delicious I wonder if it's served together 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:08.330
 Maybe your left hand is completely down and you're back 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.020
 Actually, I look at this backhand good player top player 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:16.009
 Is the left hand when the well is falling magazine whether back Table Tennis 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.460
 Has come out high Pitte is this I think has come out the left hand 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:23.450
 There are so many pictures like this 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.710
 The left hand falls down and I do not see much backhand 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.340
 Top players also are you up properly as people backhand is good to back touches 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.010
 right 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.230
 Backhand as the person who left is out Te pitch is sweet 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.210
 I will 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.470
 Mimicking it and raising your left hand to your backhand a little 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.150
 Backhand 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.220
 Please try it while say so together Then that 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:51.440
 Actually the posture of the body 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:55.700
 It's very stable, but if you have a left hand when shaking the backhand, let's go for a moment 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:02.630
 You will be able to back with your body facing straight ahead 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:06.240
 This is because if you do not have a left hand, it is easier for you to move back and forth, and your upper body shakes. 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.479
 Again anyone who Naa's something unstable not touch the back hand is 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.860
 The balance of the body posture is bad, isn't it? 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.010
 Since the body by placing it in the little increase'll keep left painter 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.370
 It will not sell 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.150
 Firmly steady and touching the backhand 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.290
 Say space is easy to make to shake the backhand because the body is facing a decent front 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.500
 It is a thing 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:31.510
 Moreover also stable position of the racket and raise the left hand 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.819
 If there is not a racket onslaught left hand, guan's gear moves quite well but it's a wiggle movement, but the left hand 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.260
 As it comes out, the racket will come out from above 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:43.219
 If you take something to the left you may not know the right smoke completion but I will say it from above 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.269
 So it makes a good effect and makes noodles firmly from above 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:49.480
 I will go to slap, so the backhand racket's face will also be stable 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.480
 Right 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.709
 2 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.210
 So this is the only opportunity to raise this left hand 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:19.580
 Apart from this, it is not something that is sold directly but it is not necessarily related to hitting 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:21.340
 By all means everyone because it is the other essential is to shake the left hand that you are by it backhand of magic 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.910
 Raise your left hand to backhand 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.660
 This is first a little also change enough backhand this alone anymore Please try to consciousness 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.360
 I will 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.050
 And 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.440
 It is the second and the second is this time 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:40.530
 Please be aware that you are in a forward-looking position 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:44.310
 In well there tend to the foot when you are hit full in the back I want back Yappako 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.870
 Human What do I body is shaking back with the feeling you are standing do this is still not touch too much 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.000
 There is an image of 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.920
 Do it with a stick 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.829
 Then you still would have Yappa shake the body to backhand is defeated your opponent's ball 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.900
 Or does not heal the video recording 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:03.660
 Since such worries will come out a lot, etc. 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:09.390
 Lower the body star 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:15.270
 If you shake the backhand in this way, the center of gravity of the body will lower and become stable. 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:23.680
 So it's easy to shake your backhand and it won't shake you 'll block your drive 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:26.770
 Backhand as a whole in front of the body by saying that the body does not shake the mac 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.920
 It will be Tteyuu be improved by becoming the Heisei 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.870
 So I 'm in a low forward attitude 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.870
 Please do not forget 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.780
 Ah 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.649
 eme 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.110
 Oh 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.550
 Putsu 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:56.750
 8 Now three It's eye three eyes is now the racket tip 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:00.600
 It means that you strike with legal awareness of 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.630
 In fact, this racket shake and pen 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:08.760
 I'm such even players also have that grain sales in the player 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.580
 It is Mr. cormorant it above than usual against the little towards the top of the racket 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:16.090
 In hitting Then 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:17.569
 This racket 's return will be easier This will make the racket turn around The tip is 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.790
 I can't shake it 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:23.050
 spin 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:27.070
 If it is a top player but a good player, it is turning around the backhand of the road beautifully 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:31.000
 The racket does not turn around like this with players who are not good at backing 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:36.040
 Because there are many people who say that they stop in the middle and say something is wrong 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.520
 The back may turn the racket center clean as full-back can be successfully 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.950
 Become 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.129
 Because it is a point 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.960
 I spend a little on you 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:48.530
 If you shake it like this , the racket will go pretty smoothly 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.310
 I wonder what the Fu say clean you around round and round sailing this 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:57.580
 As drawing the moving school circle of the racket 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:06:01.420
 You will be able to shake the back softly Normally I usually hit in the middle 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:07.180
 Please be aware that you should hit the ball a little closer to the upper tip 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:09.849
 The racket's interesting structure makes it play better when you hit it on the tip of the cheek . 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:14.860
 I kinda This enabled Te pow 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:15.610
 When you play with snapping, when you hit it a little against the cheek of the tip and play, the ball becomes faster with pawn 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:22.080
 Because 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:22.080
 That's why I think it's also easy to improve the backhand's good playing ability 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.150
 Yes yes 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.960
 pa 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:40.070
 Ah 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:44.670
 I was allowed to say the important point three now that say 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:47.570
 Please try to do that because it is possible to change to gulp 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.570
 Thank you very much 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:45.009
 The
