and they finally found it when in 105 AD
the<00:03:08.410> world's<00:03:08.769> first<00:03:09.069> sheets<00:03:09.610> of<00:03:09.819> real<00:03:10.120> paper

the world's first sheets of real paper

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.140 
the world's first sheets of real paper
were<00:03:10.780> invented<00:03:11.290> with<00:03:12.069> this<00:03:12.340> paper<00:03:12.640> they<00:03:12.940> made

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
were invented with this paper they made

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.000 
were invented with this paper they made
books<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.840> were<00:03:13.959> written<00:03:14.170> by<00:03:14.470> hand

books that were written by hand

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.430 
books that were written by hand
eventually<00:03:15.790> they<00:03:16.299> developed<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.900> printmaking

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
eventually they developed a printmaking

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.620 
eventually they developed a printmaking
method<00:03:17.950> called<00:03:18.220> woodcut<00:03:18.760> which<00:03:19.359> made

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
method called woodcut which made

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.390 
method called woodcut which made
illustrating<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.590> making<00:03:20.920> multiple

because of this new paper the Chinese

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.680 
because of this new paper the Chinese
changed<00:03:26.680> how<00:03:26.859> they<00:03:27.070> made<00:03:27.310> books<00:03:27.579> they<00:03:28.359> began
