probably be called Dragon Ball Z super
Dragon<00:00:36.360> Ball<00:00:36.510> super<00:00:36.750> Z<00:00:37.140> something<00:00:37.559> along

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
Dragon Ball super Z something along

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.410

but<00:00:39.600> Dragon<00:00:40.320> Ball<00:00:40.469> super<00:00:40.770> I'm<00:00:41.430> excited<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
but Dragon Ball super I'm excited at the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.910 
but Dragon Ball super I'm excited at the
same<00:00:42.510> time<00:00:42.750> I'm<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> little<00:00:43.200> bit<00:00:43.320> skeptical<00:00:43.620> to

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
same time I'm a little bit skeptical to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.170 
same time I'm a little bit skeptical to
see<00:00:44.040> exactly<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.460> they're<00:00:44.610> gonna<00:00:44.730> do<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
see exactly what they're gonna do and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.330 
see exactly what they're gonna do and
also<00:00:45.750> again<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> fact<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.410> Akira<00:00:47.010> Toriyama

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
also again the fact that Akira Toriyama

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.190 
also again the fact that Akira Toriyama
is<00:00:47.610> involved<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> good<00:00:48.480> thing<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:49.050> that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
is involved is a good thing but that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.299 
is involved is a good thing but that
same<00:00:49.440> time<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> little<00:00:49.950> worried<00:00:50.070> thing

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
same time I was a little worried thing

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.100 
same time I was a little worried thing
because<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> Akira<00:00:51.390> Toriyama<00:00:51.719> from

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
because is it the Akira Toriyama from

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.080 
because is it the Akira Toriyama from
like<00:00:52.260> 20<00:00:52.620> years<00:00:52.800> ago<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.219> gave<00:00:53.640> us<00:00:53.820> some<00:00:53.850> of

battle of gods somewhere along lines up

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.830 
battle of gods somewhere along lines up
there<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.310> not<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.490> complete<00:02:24.000> GT<00:02:24.570> but

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
there so it's not a complete GT but

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.660 
there so it's not a complete GT but
maybe<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:26.010> what<00:02:26.160> they<00:02:26.280> were<00:02:26.340> trying<00:02:26.550> to

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
maybe this is what they were trying to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.580 
maybe this is what they were trying to
set<00:02:26.850> up<00:02:26.940> all<00:02:27.060> along<00:02:27.270> maybe<00:02:27.510> originally<00:02:28.470> they

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
set up all along maybe originally they

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.080 
set up all along maybe originally they
were<00:02:28.710> skeptical<00:02:29.400> because<00:02:29.520> this<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.850> what<00:02:30.000> I'm

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
were skeptical because this is what I'm

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.760 
were skeptical because this is what I'm
thinking<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.840> original<00:02:31.290> battle<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.620> gods

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
thinking the original battle of gods

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.250 
thinking the original battle of gods
movie<00:02:32.130> not<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.550> resurrection<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.540> f<00:02:33.750> not<00:02:34.080> that

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
movie not the resurrection of f not that

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.410 
movie not the resurrection of f not that
maybe<00:02:34.980> they<00:02:35.190> were<00:02:35.280> like<00:02:35.430> okay<00:02:35.730> maybe<00:02:36.180> we<00:02:36.360> will

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
maybe they were like okay maybe we will

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.000 
maybe they were like okay maybe we will
do<00:02:36.570> movies<00:02:36.930> every<00:02:37.200> few<00:02:37.380> years<00:02:37.530> about<00:02:37.770> these

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
do movies every few years about these

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.290 
do movies every few years about these
new<00:02:38.190> gods<00:02:38.430> or<00:02:38.580> whatever<00:02:38.790> when<00:02:38.880> they<00:02:38.910> set<00:02:39.120> up<00:02:39.209> to

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
new gods or whatever when they set up to

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.000 
new gods or whatever when they set up to
twelve<00:02:39.540> gods<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.990> then<00:02:40.320> maybe<00:02:40.500> they<00:02:40.680> realise

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
twelve gods and then maybe they realise

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.830 
twelve gods and then maybe they realise
along<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.490> way<00:02:41.640> hmm

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
along the way hmm

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.780 
along the way hmm
people<00:02:43.200> really<00:02:43.500> still<00:02:43.740> love<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.340> maybe

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
people really still love this maybe

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.220 
people really still love this maybe
we<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.120> make<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.239> series<00:02:45.570> on<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.050> maybe

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
we can make a series on it and maybe

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.380 
we can make a series on it and maybe
it'll<00:02:46.470> start<00:02:46.709> off<00:02:46.890> after<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.670> Buu<00:02:47.790> saga<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
it'll start off after the Buu saga and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.240 
it'll start off after the Buu saga and
then<00:02:48.480> eventually<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.989> reference<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.650> Battle

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
then eventually a reference the Battle

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.770 
then eventually a reference the Battle
of<00:02:50.310> God<00:02:50.520> movies<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.090> stuff<00:02:51.270> along<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.600> lines

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
of that and then eventually maybe we'll

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.400
