00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.960 
so just play around with that or maybe
I'll<00:03:49.540> start<00:03:49.840> with<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.260> one

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:05.990 

that's<00:03:56.810> gonna<00:03:57.020> meet<00:03:57.670> now<00:03:59.440> go<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:01.010> four

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.450 

sort<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.720> ending<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.230> phrase<00:04:07.590> here<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.160> get<00:04:08.340> us

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
sort of ending a phrase here to get us

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
sort of ending a phrase here to get us
back<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:09.240> theirs<00:04:09.630> at<00:04:09.780> five<00:04:10.020> chord<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.800> one

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
back to theirs at five chord to the one

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.640 
back to theirs at five chord to the one
so<00:04:12.480> we<00:04:12.570> can<00:04:12.630> kind<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.840> move<00:04:12.990> them<00:04:13.200> around<00:04:13.320> in

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
so we can kind of move them around in

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.910 
so we can kind of move them around in
different<00:04:14.040> different<00:04:14.580> ways<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:16.470> what<00:04:16.620> do<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:16.769> do

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
different different ways so what do I do

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.039 
different different ways so what do I do

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
when I'm just going to sit down and

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.080 
when I'm just going to sit down and

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
know how the chords relate to each other

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.580 
know how the chords relate to each other
in<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:24.510> particular<00:04:25.020> key<00:04:25.820> I<00:04:26.820> start<00:04:27.690> with<00:04:27.930> if<00:04:28.380> I'm

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
in a particular key I start with if I'm

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.500 
in a particular key I start with if I'm
going<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.800> create<00:04:29.070> a<00:04:29.160> melody<00:04:29.430> just<00:04:30.120> using<00:04:30.420> the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
going to create a melody just using the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.460 
going to create a melody just using the
notes<00:04:30.720> in<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:30.930> scale<00:04:31.250> so<00:04:32.900> that's<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.110> basic

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
notes in that scale so that's the basic

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.350 
notes in that scale so that's the basic
idea<00:04:34.590> now<00:04:35.070> I'm<00:04:35.760> just<00:04:35.970> going<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.210> pick<00:04:36.330> a

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
idea now I'm just going to pick a

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.110 
idea now I'm just going to pick a
different<00:04:36.420> key<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.730> I'm<00:04:38.730> going<00:04:38.850> to<00:04:38.880> go<00:04:39.060> to

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
different key and I'm going to go to

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.520 
different key and I'm going to go to
e-flat<00:04:39.840> now<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:41.250> I'm<00:04:41.580> just<00:04:41.640> going<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.530> first

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
e-flat now and I'm just going to first

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.750 
e-flat now and I'm just going to first
thing<00:04:43.650> that<00:04:43.770> comes<00:04:43.980> up<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.340> I'm<00:04:44.460> just<00:04:44.640> going

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
you can start really basic like we did

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.280 
you can start really basic like we did
when<00:07:05.590> we<00:07:05.650> were<00:07:05.830> playing<00:07:06.100> in<00:07:06.250> the<00:07:06.340> key<00:07:06.520> of<00:07:06.550> C<00:07:06.910> and

when we were playing in the key of C and

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.870 
when we were playing in the key of C and
even<00:07:08.290> just<00:07:08.440> playing<00:07:08.710> those<00:07:09.040> chords<00:07:09.100> together

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 
and getting that feel we already started

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.610 
and getting that feel we already started
to<00:07:12.220> create<00:07:12.430> a<00:07:12.460> bit<00:07:12.639> of<00:07:12.669> a<00:07:12.850> song<00:07:13.470> once<00:07:14.470> you're
