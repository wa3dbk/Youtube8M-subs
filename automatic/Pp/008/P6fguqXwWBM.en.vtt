then an additional filter let's explain
a<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.600> bit<00:00:51.839> more<00:00:52.050> about<00:00:52.230> what<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.620> does

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
a little bit more about what this does

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.309 
a little bit more about what this does
so<00:00:53.429> that<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.210> understand<00:00:54.659> how<00:00:54.870> valuable

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:55.319 
so that you can understand how valuable

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:59.119 
so that you can understand how valuable
of<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.949> part<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.699> really<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.890> on<00:00:58.890> your

here there's a little air inlet that

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.180 
here there's a little air inlet that
will<00:01:09.210> allow<00:01:09.510> particulate<00:01:10.260> matter<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.800> go<00:01:10.950> down

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
will allow particulate matter to go down

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.520 
will allow particulate matter to go down
inside<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:12.180> carburetor<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.810> sit<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.320> top

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
is we're going to start with the two

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.660 
is we're going to start with the two
screws<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.390> are<00:02:24.690> most<00:02:25.380> close<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.490> motor

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
screws that are most close to the motor

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.530 
screws that are most close to the motor
those<00:02:27.090> are<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.330> only

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
those are the only

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.750 
those are the only
two<00:02:27.659> that<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.140> be<00:02:28.230> removed<00:02:28.640> we're<00:02:29.640> going

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
two that have to be removed we're going

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.630 
two that have to be removed we're going
to<00:02:29.819> go<00:02:29.909> ahead<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.209> take<00:02:30.360> those<00:02:30.569> off<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.980> then

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
to go ahead and take those off and then

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.670 
to go ahead and take those off and then
we're<00:02:35.790> very<00:02:35.819> simply<00:02:36.480> going<00:02:36.689> to<00:02:36.780> place<00:02:37.290> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
we're very simply going to place the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.240 
we're very simply going to place the
filter<00:02:38.659> right<00:02:39.659> over<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:42.469> existing<00:02:43.469> holes<00:02:43.709> so

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
filter right over the existing holes so

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.119 
filter right over the existing holes so
basically<00:02:44.909> this<00:02:45.689> is<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.959> filter<00:02:46.200> here<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
basically this is the filter here the

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.460 
basically this is the filter here the
filter<00:02:47.459> housing<00:02:47.609> and<00:02:48.569> it<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:48.959> going<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.319> go

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
filter housing and it is going to go

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.960 
filter housing and it is going to go
right<00:02:49.709> down<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.340> you're<00:02:50.459> going<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.670> screw<00:02:50.939> it

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
right down and you're going to screw it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.460 
right down and you're going to screw it
right<00:02:51.269> on<00:02:52.140> top<00:02:52.409> of<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:54.720> carb<00:02:54.989> with<00:02:55.319> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
right on top of the carb with the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.399 
right on top of the carb with the
existing<00:02:56.010> screws<00:02:56.510> before<00:02:57.510> we<00:02:57.780> install<00:02:58.170> that

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
existing screws before we install that

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:59.629 
existing screws before we install that
we're<00:02:58.560> going<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.709> go<00:02:58.859> ahead<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.189> take<00:02:59.340> one<00:02:59.370> of
