00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
just going to start at the side and just

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.770 
just going to start at the side and just
put<00:01:10.930> it<00:01:11.020> right<00:01:11.170> next<00:01:11.650> to<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.950> edge<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.750> yeah<00:01:13.750> I

put it right next to the edge and yeah I

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.440 
put it right next to the edge and yeah I
just<00:01:13.900> kind<00:01:14.110> of<00:01:14.140> work<00:01:14.350> our<00:01:14.560> way<00:01:14.860> down<00:01:15.159> and<00:01:15.490> cut

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
just kind of work our way down and cut

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.310 
just kind of work our way down and cut
it<00:01:16.810> at<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.260> bottom<00:01:17.619> here<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:19.630> most

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
it at the bottom here and then most

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.710 
it at the bottom here and then most
washi<00:01:20.560> tapes<00:01:20.890> they<00:01:21.100> will<00:01:21.310> connect<00:01:21.790> so<00:01:22.479> just

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
washi tapes they will connect so just

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.600 
washi tapes they will connect so just
trying<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:22.930> find<00:01:23.229> that<00:01:23.439> place<00:01:24.369> where<00:01:24.549> it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
trying to find that place where it

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.640 
trying to find that place where it
connects<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:25.210> then<00:01:25.450> just<00:01:26.200> do<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.439> same<00:01:26.590> thing

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
connects and then just do the same thing

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.100 
connects and then just do the same thing
going<00:01:27.189> down<00:01:27.400> and<00:01:27.759> then<00:01:28.390> cut<00:01:28.600> that<00:01:28.630> part<00:01:29.020> as

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
going down and then cut that part as

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.450 
going down and then cut that part as
well<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:32.200> worry<00:01:32.410> about<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.740> access<00:01:33.190> on<00:01:33.370> the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
well don't worry about the access on the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.370 
well don't worry about the access on the
side<00:01:33.700> yet<00:01:33.880> we'll<00:01:34.090> cut<00:01:34.330> that<00:01:34.540> away<00:01:34.720> later<00:01:35.080> and

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
side yet we'll cut that away later and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.580 
side yet we'll cut that away later and
just<00:01:36.310> do<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.550> same<00:01:36.700> for<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.030> top<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.660> once

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
just do the same for the top and once

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.470 
just do the same for the top and once
you<00:01:38.710> get<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.250> center<00:01:39.730> of<00:01:40.060> where<00:01:40.300> the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
you get to the center of where the

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.920 
you get to the center of where the
camera<00:01:40.990> is<00:01:41.200> um<00:01:41.710> I<00:01:42.190> will<00:01:42.940> just<00:01:43.120> be<00:01:43.270> cutting<00:01:43.540> it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
camera is um I will just be cutting it

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.710 
camera is um I will just be cutting it
it's<00:01:44.430> right<00:01:45.430> there<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.300> doesn't<00:01:46.570> cover

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
it's right there and so it doesn't cover

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.860 
it's right there and so it doesn't cover
and<00:01:47.080> I<00:01:47.230> actually<00:01:47.380> went<00:01:47.740> back<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.690> cut<00:01:49.690> our

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
and I actually went back to cut our

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.810 
and I actually went back to cut our
circle<00:01:50.290> out<00:01:50.470> later<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:51.460> we're<00:01:51.610> just<00:01:51.640> going

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
circle out later and so we're just going

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.940 
circle out later and so we're just going
to<00:01:51.880> continue<00:01:52.060> at<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.420> top<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:52.900> then<00:01:53.050> just

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
to continue at the top and then just

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.730 
to continue at the top and then just
overlap<00:01:54.550> again<00:01:54.909> for<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.659> empty<00:01:55.960> space<00:01:56.350> and

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
overlap again for the empty space and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:12.480 
overlap again for the empty space and
just<00:01:57.700> do<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:57.970> all<00:01:58.120> over<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.420> laptop

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.340 

right<00:02:13.490> so<00:02:13.700> I'm<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:13.819> going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.209> cut<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:15.200> it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
right so I'm just going to cut so it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.630 
right so I'm just going to cut so it
straight<00:02:15.680> at<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.890> bottom<00:02:16.190> because<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.459> don't

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
straight at the bottom because I don't

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.699 
straight at the bottom because I don't
want<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.120> washi<00:02:17.660> tape<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.110> be<00:02:18.230> overlapping

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
want the washi tape to be overlapping

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.090 
want the washi tape to be overlapping
and<00:02:19.160> then<00:02:19.850> I'm<00:02:20.209> just<00:02:20.420> going<00:02:20.569> to<00:02:20.920> tape<00:02:21.920> it

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.289 
all right so this parts pretty easy you
just<00:03:14.469> want<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.739> put<00:03:14.950> your<00:03:15.249> a<00:03:15.310> washi<00:03:15.700> tape<00:03:16.060> over

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
just want to put your a washi tape over

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.140 
just want to put your a washi tape over
the<00:03:16.689> Apple<00:03:17.200> logo<00:03:17.379> and<00:03:17.829> again<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.939> want<00:03:19.090> to

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
the Apple logo and again you want to

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.789 
the Apple logo and again you want to
align<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.749> washi<00:03:19.959> tape<00:03:20.319> so<00:03:20.499> that<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
align the washi tape so that the

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.309 
align the washi tape so that the
patterns<00:03:21.219> kind<00:03:21.579> of<00:03:21.639> match<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:22.180> just<00:03:22.989> cover

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
patterns kind of match and just cover

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.259 
patterns kind of match and just cover
the<00:03:23.709> logo<00:03:23.889> and<00:03:24.219> then<00:03:24.370> we'll<00:03:24.549> go<00:03:24.849> to<00:03:24.879> the<00:03:25.030> next

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
the logo and then we'll go to the next

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:35.820 
the logo and then we'll go to the next
step

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.200

thingy and kind of pressing the tape in

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.220 
thingy and kind of pressing the tape in

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230
