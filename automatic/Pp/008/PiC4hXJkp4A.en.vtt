00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.759
 tells crowd again that still speaks 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.320
 what the party 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.580
 Today I 'll bring you there, have the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.410
 very doubtful people here in the store 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.539
 will spend some of the things I 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.180
 I learned that I know there for the thing that I 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.450
 I 'm going to teach you today how to do the 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.730
 I prouni the leader to the mount flamento 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.770
 let's assume that this is the 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.230
 multifilament and here's your leader 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.789
 waking red the multi yellow 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.800
 I'm doing with the ropes to stay 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.300
 better visualization of you 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.980
 the staff is very doubtful about 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.410
 This is so the time that I come 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.110
 Testing I came adapting Nokia is very 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.360
 used that is bright then allright is 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.890
 very good but I see some forms that 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.600
 it has become a little better and I think 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.160
 got a little more reliable 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.440
 I'll show you with these two 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.780
 ways to be well do a lot 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.380
 Let's just say that here you have the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.780
 leader 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.719
 you will catch the leader and not make a 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.920
 I turned a round on him 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:09.380
 You will get a lot that is 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.420
 represented by this yellow string goes 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:18.200
 entering underneath will let you make a 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.780
 looping past the yellow rope for 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.209
 up the red and locking with your finger 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.289
 will be exactly what you are seeing 

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:30.139
 here we are going to wrap the red rope 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.469
 giving ten laps or yellow 

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:34.490
 hellmuth and red is the leader of flo 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.049
 carbon 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.990
 You're going to pick it up and give it 10 laps. 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:44.560
 multifilament in that position exactly 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.560
 here o 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.610
 we're supposed to have ten laps later 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.510
 of the ten laps the great secret of this 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.540
 it 's not that 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.200
 if you enter with it underneath you will 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.210
 come out with the end of the cable over 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.330
 only you're not going to give just one 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.660
 with 69 bright you will give two breaks 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.260
 really made sure you knot after you go 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:17.300
 adjust by hand and go on a whim 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.940
 Our simple knot is easy to make 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.340
 in the fishing that you do not need to do 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.350
 a very beautiful and arrive at the time of 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.690
 fishery is full of fish you do not 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.489
 You have time to make a new Ka 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.790
 much gracing so this knot is very 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.560
 used large plot noel set it you 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.300
 will be there and it will be exactly 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.250
 so a reliable one who will not come back 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.250
 See how it goes, and how much more 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.610
 You pull but it tightens or it does not go 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.340
 let go now I'll show you how 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.950
 would be direct in the leader 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.739
 along with multiplan would be more or less 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.870
 so the same scheme 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.320
 Are you going to take a ride? 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:08.150
 inside the liner will get the multi going 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:10.579
 enter below will loop with the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:25.450
 multi you will wrap the flu the carbon 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:25.450
 ten times 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.860
 What a great secret if you came in 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.569
 low 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.980
 You will go out with him on top giving 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:39.629
 two turns 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:41.430
 one to just or not before pulling and 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.739
 a great secret that so is nothing 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.689
 personal gento only a private room 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:51.859
 to help choose the saved node 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.859
 pulled it new will adjust 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.790
 and will stay that way does not run for 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.459
 Nothing, this is an okay, I assure you. 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.569
 let's say the allright adapted by 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.010
 cef fishing 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.010
 Now we're going to do the finishing. 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.900
 get this scissors line theory 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.100
 special rafaela to cut multi and 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.840
 flower 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.549
 you will cut the multi end will see 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.220
 with the type squirrel but it came out 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:27.490
 is also not in the fpf technique 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:30.140
 to make the finish is a little bit 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.610
 Do you make this finish? 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.150
 help with what does not happen with 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.860
 facility on the treadmill of its perch in 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.020
 time of the longest throw and will not 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.570
 to create friction that this is an evil is 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:46.330
 essential for those who use mainly 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:50.090
 official discard burns the tip of the 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.810
 flu is here the knot with you can see 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.600
 a small extreme need 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.430
 if this size due to create - act of 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.020
 pass the treadmill and highly 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.190
 reliable as you can see I do not 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.650
 charge nothing 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.700
 Here's another tip from the personal party one 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.700
 hug until the next
