00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.850
 Y 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.700
 Y 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.830
 throwing youtube wool as they are 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.560
 welcome to another video of your channel 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.509
 planet x this time I bring you a 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.000
 video of how to increase the volume of your 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.130
 device is obviously going to be with the 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.960
 jailbreak help and good as in every 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.510
 tutorial I'll show you what it is that 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.820
 let's achieve with this tweet in this 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.290
 case I will unlock my device and 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.199
 how can you tell here in the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.050
 screen I will start to manipulate the volume 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.489
 of my device in this case here I 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.400
 a legend that says 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.610
 press more to amplify if I 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.739
 I obviously start to turn up the volume 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.989
 will start as another section where 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.080
 an amplification will appear according to the 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.299
 percentage of it this tweet amplifies 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.860
 the volume up to 200 percent so 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.470
 which obviously is not convenient 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.030
 amplifies both the volume but if you 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.490
 I recommend that it be our bars 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.590
 that appear in green let's enter 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.570
 Syria to have this click if you have already 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.270
 seen my previous videos and have the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.010
 potential network and dotcom and it is necessary 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.080
 that you add it but in case you do not 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.520
 you have us going to drive 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.420
 sources 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.350
 edit and add and here we are going to put 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.350
 spike widening dotcom 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.860
 I'll leave it here on the screen for a moment 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.010
 so you can verify how it 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.050
 Write once you verify this 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.050
 we are going to give you in add source 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.610
 here the source warning will appear 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.610
 we're going to give it in anyway 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.909
 and start downloading all packages 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.920
 of the network will take a moment 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.530
 once the return button appears 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.479
 We will give silvia in that button and 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.000
 now we are going to go to the tab 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.549
 to search and in the search bar 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.549
 let's put amplify volume 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.570
 in the same way I'm going to leave you here 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.390
 on the screen so you can 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.930
 verify how it is written as it has 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.090
 a good one is a rare pronouncement and 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.319
 well here we have to verify that 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.749
 the insania logo appears 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.060
 and well we also have to verify 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:30.129
 Which devices are compatible according to 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.920
 I understand that for the iphone 4 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.299
 It does not work but it may work already 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.760
 they would be things that you can 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.379
 verify here is going to be a modification 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.420
 of the system and will restart the 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:44.049
 device then after you what 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.030
 install once and once rebooted goes 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.760
 to have the effect for which you already 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.849
 You can check here as I told you 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.549
 it's almost at the beginning of the video and here 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.680
 a colored bar will appear on the 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.379
 which one of the recommendations is a 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.659
 access this green web limit and 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.519
 that if we start to raise too much 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.040
 volume we will not have a sound 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.500
 totally pleasant indeed until the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.930
 horn about listening a little ugly ni and 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.909
 in the same way then you can damage it and 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.340
 good friends I hope you have used this 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.109

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.230
 commentary 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.939
 Any doubt or clarification I am in the 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.849
