00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.700 
a bit of a transition period right now
where<00:00:14.910> games<00:00:15.210> are<00:00:15.450> becoming<00:00:16.080> more<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.500> more

where games are becoming more and more

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.400 
where games are becoming more and more
like<00:00:17.070> movies<00:00:17.940> there's<00:00:18.210> less<00:00:18.480> gameplay<00:00:19.020> more

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
like movies there's less gameplay more

playing<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.109> i<00:00:22.230> don't<00:00:22.380> think<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.680> is

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
playing and i don't think this is

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.750 
playing and i don't think this is
particularly<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.090> bad<00:00:24.330> thing<00:00:24.600> I'm<00:00:25.529> not

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
particularly a bad thing I'm not

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.460 
particularly a bad thing I'm not
completely<00:00:26.760> against<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.420> but<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.840> see<00:00:28.170> where

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
completely against it but I see where

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.429 
completely against it but I see where

in<00:00:31.619> particular<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> most

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
in particular is one of the most

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.549 
in particular is one of the most
cinematic<00:00:33.000> games<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.540> ever<00:00:33.690> played<00:00:33.870> the

cinematic games have ever played the
only<00:00:34.710> game<00:00:34.890> that's<00:00:35.130> been<00:00:35.340> more<00:00:35.640> cinematic

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
only game that's been more cinematic

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.270

than<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.750> my<00:00:37.170> experience<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> service

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
than this in my experience is a service

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.569 
than this in my experience is a service
wrath<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.600> very<00:00:40.579> interesting

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
wrath and that was a very interesting

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.220 
wrath and that was a very interesting
game<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.149> definitely<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.570> different<00:00:43.020> game<00:00:43.200> I

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
game is definitely a different game I

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.330 
game is definitely a different game I
like<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.680> game<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.100> was<00:00:44.190> definitely

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
like that game but it was definitely

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.130 
like that game but it was definitely
different<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.120> came<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.899> three

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
different and I came out with three

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.340 
different and I came out with three
years<00:00:46.350> ago<00:00:46.530> or<00:00:46.680> something<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.809> order<00:00:49.020> 1886

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
years ago or something so the order 1886

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.650 
years ago or something so the order 1886
if<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.920> had<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.190> describe<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.300> statement

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
if I had to describe it in one statement

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.410 
if I had to describe it in one statement
it<00:00:51.989> would<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> good<00:00:53.579> game<00:00:53.610> but

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it would be that this is a good game but

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.229 
it would be that this is a good game but
it's<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.629> bad<00:00:54.930> value<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:56.550> game<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.059> worth

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
it's a bad value this game is not worth

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.840 
it's a bad value this game is not worth
sixty<00:00:57.600> dollars<00:00:57.949> if<00:00:58.949> six<00:00:59.250> dollars<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.730> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
sixty dollars if six dollars is that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.779 
sixty dollars if six dollars is that
much<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.210> than<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.780> guess<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.170> buy<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.379> and

much to you than I guess go buy it and

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.189 
much to you than I guess go buy it and
it's<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.879> good<00:01:03.000> game<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.629> six<00:01:03.870> dollars

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
it's a good game but if six dollars

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.810 
it's a good game but if six dollars

that<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.620> cinematics<00:03:29.099> look<00:03:29.250> bad<00:03:29.430> it's<00:03:29.699> just

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
that the cinematics look bad it's just

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.199 
that the cinematics look bad it's just
that<00:03:30.060> everything<00:03:30.659> looks<00:03:30.930> great<00:03:31.909> you<00:03:32.909> just

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
that everything looks great you just

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.119 
that everything looks great you just
can't<00:03:33.449> believe<00:03:33.599> how<00:03:34.049> good<00:03:34.260> this<00:03:34.319> game<00:03:34.739> looks<00:03:34.949> i

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
can't believe how good this game looks i

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.979 
can't believe how good this game looks i
know<00:03:35.250> it's<00:03:35.489> only<00:03:35.549> 900<00:03:36.180> p<00:03:36.359> or<00:03:36.479> whatever<00:03:36.750> but

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
know it's only 900 p or whatever but

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.619 
know it's only 900 p or whatever but
that<00:03:37.229> didn't<00:03:38.220> really<00:03:38.280> bother<00:03:38.669> me<00:03:38.879> they<00:03:39.239> did<00:03:39.389> a

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
that didn't really bother me they did a

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.110 
that didn't really bother me they did a
great<00:03:39.989> job<00:03:40.109> at<00:03:40.560> making<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:41.069> 900p<00:03:41.729> look<00:03:41.909> good

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
great job at making the 900p look good

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.369 
great job at making the 900p look good
and<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.269> guess<00:03:42.449> part<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.049> because<00:03:43.079> the

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
and I guess part of that is because the

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.619 
and I guess part of that is because the
game<00:03:43.889> is<00:03:44.099> letterbox<00:03:44.609> there's<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.239> two<00:03:45.389> black

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
game is letterbox there's the two black

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.289 
game is letterbox there's the two black
bars<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.409> 900p<00:03:46.949> goes<00:03:47.729> a<00:03:47.760> lot<00:03:48.030> further

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
bars so that 900p goes a lot further

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.659 
bars so that 900p goes a lot further
considering<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.349> lot<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.159> the<00:03:50.220> screen<00:03:50.519> is<00:03:50.639> just

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
considering a lot of the screen is just

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.990 
considering a lot of the screen is just
black<00:03:50.879> anyway<00:03:51.540> or<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.560> decent<00:03:53.400> portion<00:03:53.699> of<00:03:53.909> it

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
black anyway or a decent portion of it

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.300 
black anyway or a decent portion of it
is<00:03:54.120> but<00:03:54.870> they<00:03:55.229> did<00:03:55.379> a<00:03:55.409> great<00:03:55.650> job<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.159> making

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
is but they did a great job and making

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.219 
is but they did a great job and making
the<00:03:56.579> game<00:03:58.010> great<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.220> watch<00:03:59.370> that<00:04:00.239> that's<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:01.019> I
