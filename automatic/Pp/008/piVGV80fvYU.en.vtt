00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.110
 In 1970, concerts in South America were held in Panama 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.470
 and the Caribbean 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.799
 I saw this great event 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.339
 It should be noted that the state 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:10.869
 ramón fernández 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:14.619
 with the passage of time, its facilities deteriorated and 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.130
 for the 2000s be the most realistic remodeling 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.079
 I think it was something 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.519
 the Parlament 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.519
 I think it's been like you rubén xaus 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.320
 and on the subject when you love red tide but with that theme of the 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.650
 selection just 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.040
 federer appear the corpse among them one of the two historic with coast 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.810
 delicious 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.740
 the country realized that soccer exists 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.800
 the deposed ruler 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.810
 and that the young man was missing 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.810
 but the very idea that you had to adjust 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.570
 something similar that's why it makes the decision according to the works of 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.280
 remodeling 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.340
 so you can bother with the countries of the first world 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.770
 in his message he pointed out cultivating this euphoria for those he opposes because it was 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.760
 the soccer of our country increases its house without more in vain the screen 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.310
 giant and a note 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.490
 athletics farina lawyer for the act guessed right 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.890
 of the first Central American sports games in 2010 we have to 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.480
 start a painting job 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.590
 for what 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.180
 there are not sectors where there are too many people because we can face this 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.670
 new challenge is the fruit of the game 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.130
 so it seems that an estimated 29 thousand people sitting comfortably 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.440
 can sit a good football match 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.979
 today you will enjoy 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.370
 the only athletics competition will be the inevitable 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.460
 so more talents to more and the most modern that all are in liza 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.560
 overlap 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.430
 from the sports city of Quito and Saladino and will soon host 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.550
 the Central American Cup 2011 and the Bolivarian Games of 2013 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.810
 the man is ready to receive any flight not only the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.910
 Bolivarians 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.750
 look I have received visits 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.450
 dent spain 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.350
 Believer United States 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.010
 and when you moral lion affirmed charles roven 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.280
 be surprised 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.060
 for monago has 3 million inhabitants and that would be a bit of 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.789
 history 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.809
 build a coliseum 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:12.620
 although not so much 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.409
 I think after the arrival of Messi 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.909
 we will discover that I take care of oil with the 0 0 0 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.519
 little girl for us the Panamanian lpf 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.280
 we were surprised as a coach in san francisco they managed to fill that coliseum 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.889
 exceeded the expectations of street neighbors 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.209
 football 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.729
 space 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.939
 it makes people come 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.609
 and I do not want to think about the one that came down to our selection and to which 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:38.819
 definitely 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.819
 We will do everything possible to arrive in Brazil 2014 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.869
 I want to know that soon it will be crowded 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.059
 it's called the war 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.000
 we aspire to have to think about 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.789
 lopez to the present 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.679
 you have to think about feeling and I compare doing nowadays like when 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:56.439
 he built the canal a hundred years ago 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.119
 an hour that lasts to determine so that means that we are going to 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:03.169
 do between us we advance recognizes that you have to start building in the 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.959
 future and not build 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:05.619
 in thirteen
