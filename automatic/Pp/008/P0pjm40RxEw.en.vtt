extremists<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.960> gotta<00:00:34.170> follow<00:00:34.620> good<00:00:35.190> science

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
extremists we gotta follow good science

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.330 
extremists we gotta follow good science
not<00:00:35.880> junk<00:00:36.210> science<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.680> think<00:00:37.739> rather

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
not junk science right I think rather

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.280 
not junk science right I think rather
than<00:00:38.520> committing<00:00:38.910> ourselves<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.719> huge

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
than committing ourselves to huge

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990 
than committing ourselves to huge
amounts<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.829> money<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.430> ought<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.820> what

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
amounts of money we ought to know what

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.639 
amounts of money we ought to know what
we're<00:00:42.149> talking<00:00:42.329> about<00:00:42.600> global<00:00:43.230> warming<00:00:43.590> I

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
we're talking about global warming I

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.200 
we're talking about global warming I
think<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.129> know<00:00:44.250> maybe<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.640> was<00:00:44.789> made<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.180> by

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
think you know maybe it was made up by

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660 
think you know maybe it was made up by
overeager<00:00:46.020> scientists<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.100> know<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.430> same

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
overeager scientists you know the same

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.209 
overeager scientists you know the same
scientists<00:00:48.510> maybe<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.020> made<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.469> things

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
scientists maybe that made up things

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.450 
scientists maybe that made up things
like<00:00:50.430> evolution<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.539> gravity<00:00:54.980> you<00:00:55.980> guys<00:00:56.190> call

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
like evolution and gravity you guys call

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.430 
like evolution and gravity you guys call
it<00:00:56.640> climate<00:00:56.879> change<00:00:57.360> right<00:00:57.690> because<00:00:58.020> global

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
it climate change right because global

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.430 
it climate change right because global
warming<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.039> mean<00:00:59.219> that's<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.609> key<00:00:59.789> right<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
warming I mean that's a key right the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.439 
warming I mean that's a key right the
climate<00:01:01.920> gets<00:01:02.340> warmer<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.789> gets<00:01:02.910> cooler<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
climate gets warmer it gets cooler and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
climate gets warmer it gets cooler and
we've<00:01:03.690> got<00:01:03.899> two<00:01:04.350> million<00:01:04.830> years<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.250> history

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
we've got two million years of history

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.039 
we've got two million years of history
to<00:01:05.790> demonstrate<00:01:06.270> there<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.810> true

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
to demonstrate there have it's true

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.390 
to demonstrate there have it's true
there<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.350> been<00:01:07.439> other<00:01:07.650> periods<00:01:08.250> of

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
there have been other periods of

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.760 
there have been other periods of
temperature<00:01:08.880> change<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.900> example<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.590> got

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
temperature change for example you got

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.940 
temperature change for example you got
elected<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.520> hell<00:01:11.729> froze<00:01:12.060> over<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:13.470> issue<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
elected and hell froze over the issue is

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.700 
elected and hell froze over the issue is
what<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.030> man<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.600> doing<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.409> that's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
what is it that man is doing and that's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.039 
what is it that man is doing and that's
where<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.310> said<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.610> want<00:01:18.000> sound<00:01:18.240> science<00:01:18.810> we

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
where we said we want sound science we

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.109 
where we said we want sound science we
want<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> know<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.860> whatever<00:01:20.100> remedies<00:01:20.820> that

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
want to know that whatever remedies that

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.270 
want to know that whatever remedies that
we<00:01:21.299> produce<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.960> Congress<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.830> actually

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
we produce out of Congress are actually

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.580 
we produce out of Congress are actually
going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.759> work<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.240> answers<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:24.900> good<00:01:25.439> I

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
going to work the answers very good I

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.910 
going to work the answers very good I
see<00:01:25.799> Karl<00:01:26.159> Rove<00:01:26.490> has<00:01:26.820> trained<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.390> well

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
see Karl Rove has trained you well

streets are a rolled-up newspaper you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.020 
streets are a rolled-up newspaper you
should<00:01:31.500> support<00:01:31.710> global<00:01:32.430> warming<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.850> that

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
should support global warming with that

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.719 
should support global warming with that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
air all the aerosol you use has probably

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.510 
air all the aerosol you use has probably
heated<00:01:36.000> up<00:01:36.240> Alaska<00:01:36.810> by<00:01:40.040> there's<00:01:41.040> no<00:01:41.250> sound

heated up Alaska by there's no sound
science<00:01:42.149> that<00:01:42.600> absolutely<00:01:43.500> confirms<00:01:44.490> global

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
science that absolutely confirms global

science that absolutely confirms global
warming<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.630> mean<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.899> really<00:01:46.080> need<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.710> have

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
warming I mean we really need to have

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.340 
warming I mean we really need to have
some<00:01:47.190> kind<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.520> overwhelming<00:01:48.390> evidence<00:01:48.600> don't

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
some kind of overwhelming evidence don't

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.590 
some kind of overwhelming evidence don't
you<00:01:49.530> think<00:01:49.770> something<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.220> maybe<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.090> city

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
you think something like maybe a city

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.320 
you think something like maybe a city
underwater<00:01:52.610> something<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.789> that

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
underwater something like that

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.050 
underwater something like that
hurricane<00:01:55.229> cycles<00:01:55.710> are<00:01:55.860> natural<00:01:56.340> made<00:01:56.640> happen

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
hurricane cycles are natural made happen

right come on Florida's had more

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.719 
right come on Florida's had more
evacuations<00:02:06.600> than<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> Taco<00:02:07.200> Bell<00:02:07.350> Chihuahua
