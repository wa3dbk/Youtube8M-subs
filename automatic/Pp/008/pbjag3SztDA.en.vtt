00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.160
 as you see tonight's match 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.300
 you say there is a class or 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.490
 several gap classes today 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.509
 see a world of gap between the psg and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.590
 om interpreted as you want 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.939
 but I have the feeling that in the first half 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.970
 time there was not a world away 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.269
 between us and on the second half 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.949
 after that I think we have them on the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.349
 first goal we could have done better and 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.149
 they do not need that to score 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.649
 after after it's another match when 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.270
 we took a goal it becomes another evil 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.700
 it becomes more difficult but after the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.930
 talent in the face to exist but on their 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.000
 against I do not have a world 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.530
 difference between marseille and paris in all 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.950
 case under the first period even though 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.960
 it's always difficult even though 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
 heard the psg is above 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.199
 marseille it's clear above 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.140
 marseille in all areas 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.270
 tactical techniques also listen 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.160
 look at their bath and you see what 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.059
 is sitting you see the warm up you 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.369
 see what it cost and since on 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.320
 the field and here you have the answer 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.689
 it's a team that is today 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.880
 carved for the champion's league which 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.950
 plays in a championship of France and we 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.390
 will not be the only team fear is 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.729
 not the only team to have lost here and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.140
 will have others who will lose again 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.740
 after that it's trying to make a match 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.000
 correct 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.619
 do you regret having been 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.939
 as ambitious tactically with 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.409
 players also offensive to have them 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.150
 wanted to play rather than wait 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.070
 absolutely not absolutely not because 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.350
 that I would have stayed behind if I were 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.090
 come to play at the mill simply defend 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.920
 maybe I would have taken a goal too 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.299
 and I regret it just do not have 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.799
 played so I have no regrets at all 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.420
 you were beaten by the champion of 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.369
 France tonight I think the future 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.210
 french champion i think i think that 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.159
 paris will not have 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.840
 I do not think I do not see in Monaco 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:56.810
 superior to paris and I think paris 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:58.009
 will definitely be at the finish one last 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.290
 match one ambition it was precisely 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.479
 to go and press them very high very quickly 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.649
 beginnings which rather does everything 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.680
 good market from the beginning it's 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.270
 important to give them the reasons to 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.190
 doubt 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.930
 not necessarily I find that on the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.569
 first period we showed a lot 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.950
 aggression we were there we were 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.900
 was present in the fight he was 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.300
 present when we could stand out 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.830
 did it cleanly it happened it's 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.769
 not that possible because paris has 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.540
 talent and when me against them the 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.120
 accounts of the crazy is really support 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.290
 what is a team that says that 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.750
 you want it to leave some space 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.099
 he rushes in but on the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.069
 first period except two three 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.209
 situations where they could have scored 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.540
 I did not see my name of a man then everything 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.269
 the time in danger this is a little bit 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.150
 who we are disappointed but we do not leave in 2 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.250
 of this match because because 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.760
 it's a game I feel like we 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.890
 gave what we had to give tonight 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.200
 on the end of the match 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.909
 you felt that Parisians 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.530
 room a little no but it does not matter 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.870
 it's life that's like it's not 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.810
 it's me it's me 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.310
 from a distant little to go round but nothing 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.959
 serious is not finally in 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.129
 the heart of central defense is this 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.169
 it's even harder to play 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.400
 finally that when you are in the name no 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.599
 precisely it is much harder to 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.549
 play when he approaches the surface 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.889
 when he is far away he is much less 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.260
 dangerous and the limit is easier 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.689
 because finally when when they 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.709
 come behind the central circle 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.000
 you know that the danger is still 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.769
 far enough after when he gets close 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.930
 but tonight he did not score but hey 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.250
 it 's other other players but I 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.419
 tell you again when we see 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.770
 to go cabaye cavani pastore and all 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:44.790
 the band 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.420
 we say that championship of France he has 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.760
 took another dimension for the psg and 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.300
 we like others including monaco 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.470
 we must suffer what could have been 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.270
 to make a swing to get closer 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.620
 even more of the peloton head is 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.460
 a shame to see in view of the results a 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.810
 little of this weekend 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.790
 yeah that's a pity it's a pity but 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.940
 we are done first half time 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.870
 again I tell you 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.870
 satisfactory it was a first mi 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.190
 controlled time 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.010
 paris is tactically we got to 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.120
 control what you want to control 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.320
 enjoy the second period 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.030
 apartment where we take the goal it's 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.739
 more is more the same age it is folded 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.020
 kwai we know it too because it's okay 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.820
 to become difficult the more we will go out more 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:28.020
 we will expose ourselves to the counters and 1 goal 6 to 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:32.010
 see that from a veil to study and from 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.740
 flora have florian he is a dancer we have 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.940
 we have players 20 years old 19 years old 21 years old 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.910
 we have four 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.170
 like that we have to let them continue to 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.460
 do their apprenticeship and there is 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.710
 no disappointment it's players from 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.500
 talent and they too are in the process of 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.930
 discover the very high level 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.140
 florian I remind you that he has there 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.150
 he does not even have 70 matches in league 1 he 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.370
 must let him come forward and the 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.710
 peace and is what we put in place that 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.750
 is a project over two three years he in 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.220
 is part of it he is going to grow he is going he is going 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.290
 have this experience for him as 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.900
 others like the others but the 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.040
 talent milo but it's another 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.630
 work philosophy 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.210
 it exists and it's ours but it 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.980
 must be accepted but I 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.080
 say it's not floral that makes us 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.450
 lose tonight it's not it's not the 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.190
 consequence of the defeat of marseille 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.960
 in any case I say that water can not 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.100
 go up six points in day six 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.740
 points on the third that is 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.750
 the goal of being there remains 33 points to 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.040
 take on the roses match it's this 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.180
 we said to ourselves before their 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.160
 encounter that's why we came 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.660
 and as an ambitious project we came 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.700
 because because today as 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.050
 in other matches we must 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.670
 to try to take the maximum of 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.420
 points 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.470
 today we did not get there because 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.180
 we came across better than we 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.050
 point to the line and then and then there 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.460
 will have other matches it will take 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.260
 continue but tonight there was for 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.700
 us that three points in the game and we 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.020
 will continue to do business our 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:55.480
 course try to catch up with what is 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:57.010
 in front of there not so much with 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:02.050
 paris a gap but after not necessary 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:09.910
 exaggerate no no we are we are ready 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:12.640
 of a life to these teams there our games vieri 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.040
 naked all had so much better for him and 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.330
 so much better 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.600
 the goals are different for 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:23.110
 to bet that for Marseille at the same time 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.850
 we will ask him to go to the 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.780
 nirvana he'll have to for him it's 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.630
 not the championship of France is 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.340
 champion of France 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.480
 they have already taken so it happens 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.530
 after today the bar for him 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.630
 maybe it's going to get the 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.890
 Champions league unfortunately 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.430
 after the league champions you fall 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:40.650
 on cadors 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:42.780
 and that's where we will find teams 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.650
 same level and it gets a little more 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.630
 complicated cc it's different of course 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.460
 for a coach is to have this 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.960
 kind of manpower but not just for a 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.000
 coach I guess for the 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:58.050
 supporters for the leaders it's 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.740
 that's fine but now we've had this 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.600
 period us a moment in the past 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:09.650
 and it will come back again 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.650
 certainly our evening
