00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.190
 it is more like the type must be on 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:38.830
 the guy has only the man has only one ear 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:42.809
 this is a profile recording saga 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.809
 There are actually boats in the Danube 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.830
 I hope that people do that and that 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.830
 to stop air 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.629
 So once again summarizes 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.040
 an old woman is robbed of the 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.140
 Handbag is taken away from her and she 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.809
 is then in with the bare hand 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.900
 pieces ripped 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.659
 issued a pass next to the corpse 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.030
 on the name you continue to have fun as well 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.979
 a few shoes the bloody football 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.820
 This leads into the umbrella business nicely 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.890
 Business belongs to Walter Fun man mentally 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.299
 abnormal lawbreaker 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.490
 the act was photographed by passersby 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 that would create a video as well 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.430
 has fun man confessed that it was 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.979
 also very interesting the murder victim 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.780
 is a hated mother in law the 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.979
 neighbors report that it has been 15 years 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.049
 years trying to kill himself 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.659
 now it has done justice 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.310
 never through that time no chance that 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.560
 is the chance the evidence is a lot 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.880
 to do 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.789
 I'm afraid we have to go to the case 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.159
 File unresolved in the scale of me 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.990
 from had all closed by albert 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.829

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.829
 hey why are you now anti-alcoholic 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.829
 but 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:17.940
 yes that was the culprit of the German 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:21.300
 Pathologist when we play the series 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:30.660
 Actually only Germans have it that way or that 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:32.840
 something like that today she comes across kommissar 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.799
 randomly directed 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.459
 you understand has a beard of fun 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:43.829
 one found at his own brand 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.860
 besides, the seed was given to him 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.480
 a routine traffic control 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.030
 Economists are concerned about security 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.540
 bordering probability of one 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.120
 server 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.860
 now in the terminal continues to be fun 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.860
