00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.850 

and<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.970> were<00:01:34.210> apparently<00:01:34.960> we<00:01:35.679> were

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
and we were apparently we were

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.109 
and we were apparently we were
apparently<00:01:36.340> brought<00:01:36.549> into<00:01:36.819> a<00:01:36.850> different

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
apparently brought into a different

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.830 
apparently brought into a different
dimension<00:01:37.679> by<00:01:38.679> a<00:01:38.710> monster<00:01:42.479> by<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.539> name<00:01:43.810> of

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
dimension by a monster by the name of

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.660 
dimension by a monster by the name of
Bowser<00:01:45.630> he<00:01:46.630> was<00:01:46.780> created<00:01:47.409> like<00:01:47.590> shadow<00:01:47.979> the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
Bowser he was created like shadow the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.100 
Bowser he was created like shadow the
ultimate<00:01:49.149> life-form

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
ultimate life-form

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.510 
ultimate life-form
I<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:52.899> shadow<00:01:54.030> were<00:01:55.030> basically<00:01:55.659> brothers

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
I know shadow were basically brothers

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.899 
I know shadow were basically brothers
yeah

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
yeah

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.420 
yeah
and<00:01:59.100> so<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:01.090> alternate<00:02:01.390> life-form<00:02:01.810> was<00:02:01.990> crate

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and so the alternate life-form was crate

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.469 
and so the alternate life-form was crate
was<00:02:03.430> supposed<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.850> be<00:02:03.969> Bowser

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
was supposed to be Bowser

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.649 
was supposed to be Bowser
but<00:02:05.049> then<00:02:05.200> shadow<00:02:05.560> was<00:02:05.829> created<00:02:06.539> but<00:02:07.539> the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
but then shadow was created but the

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.650 
but then shadow was created but the
power<00:02:07.869> of<00:02:08.049> the<00:02:08.140> Chaos<00:02:08.350> Emerald<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:13.000> shadow<00:02:13.299> was

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
power of the Chaos Emerald so shadow was

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.559 
power of the Chaos Emerald so shadow was
clearly<00:02:14.200> much<00:02:14.350> more<00:02:14.380> powerful

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.830 

and<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:20.590> then<00:02:23.099> after<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.430> long<00:02:24.760> day<00:02:25.150> they

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
and so then after a long day they

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.849 
and so then after a long day they
finally<00:02:26.140> finished<00:02:27.420> after<00:02:28.420> two<00:02:28.750> hours<00:02:29.109> of<00:02:29.560> a

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
finally finished after two hours of a

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.869 
finally finished after two hours of a
speech<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:31.349> that's<00:02:32.349> how<00:02:32.829> we<00:02:32.890> got<00:02:33.280> sucked<00:02:33.640> in
