00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 we'll see 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.630
 percent 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.630
 here in this class of the music course 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:10.179
 the staff 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.569
 musical 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.859
 let's start 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.050
 seeing 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.800
 we are going to see 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.980
 what is a staff 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.140
 first of all we can say 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.589
 What are five lines for candles? 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.199
 polenta action 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.170
 horizontal 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.180
 also 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.720
 between such lines is formed 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 four spaces 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.430
 here for example we have a staff 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.920
 this would be the first line 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.540
 here we had the second line 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.690
 another line over here 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.690
 another line 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.739
 up to five lines 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.700
 I'm going to take my foot off 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.850
 the edge 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.830
 full 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.250
 what 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.820
 what can confuse 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.820
 good that 5 parallel and horizontal line 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.520
 between that line as we see 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 spaces are formed here we have a space 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.160
 here 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
 we have another space here another 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200
 here another 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.670
 but what is the use of a pentagram 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.130
 it is a support 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.210
 what count are we going to write 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.430
 The musical notes 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.440
 and in addition another symbol 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.440
 what of those who put the music 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.780
 also 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.250
 We could say 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.340
 What is it 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 the skeleton where it is sustained 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
 all the musical writing 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.339
 for example 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.679
 let's see the next image 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:14.879
 we can see here 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.879
 a very small score 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.489
 it was revealed that what is meant 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.759
 here we have the pentagram a staff 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.759
 and here we have another staff 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.069
 how to see 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.819
 on the staff we wrote 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.999
 we noticed icane 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:38.729
 and other symbols like this one that we will already learn or this 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.239
 even this 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.189
 that we will see what they are about is a symbol 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:47.149
 for now 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:48.419
 you just have to know 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.349
 what the staff 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.559
 it is running along 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:54.840
 of support 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.149
 lugo paper 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:59.559
 a music computer program 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.790
 and it serves that the eto'o to house them differently 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.249
 musical symbol in this case a note 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:11.419
 in this case another symbol that we will see what you are cost 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.389
 let's see now 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.449
 from which parts he wins a pentagram 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.769
 the death lines and space but we have not seen 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:28.520
 how to name 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.839
 said lines and space 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:33.599
 here we have 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.229
 it's an image 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:38.089
 where we can see how they are named 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:39.999
 the spaces 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:42.479
 the lines 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.719
 of a staff 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:48.209
 as you see they are named from below up 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.849
 for example the spaces have here the first space 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.789
 it would 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.739
 then here we would have the second space 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.519
 here 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.229
 the third and here 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:06.379
 the fourth 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.819
 as indicated 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.799
 then as for lines we have here the first line 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.959
 from bottom to top we have the second 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.959
 line 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.729
 the third line 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:32.979
 then the fourth line 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.419
 and finally the fifth line 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.419
 that this anmat the one that was above 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.219
 so when 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:49.889
 listen to music things like first line other be ranked second 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.830
 space for example 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.559
 you can immediately identify if it is this line 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.289
 podestÃ¡ 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.289
 there was this space st 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:03.960
 You must also know 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.539
 queen we have 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.439
 what the pentagram hi notes 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.620
 for example that in the staff 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.790
 they do not have to be inside the staff but we can put a 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.790
 series of lines 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:24.689
 so that the notes scene the staff 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.610
 this line is called additional lines 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.430
 and they will not also allow 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.580
 locate 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.689
 said notes in additional spaces 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:39.839
 that is to say 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.729
 the additional line in 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:43.749
 percent 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:47.199
 for example if I create an additional line 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.870
 we see that there is a space 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.870
 here 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.480
 is formed from the left line 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.960
 so 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.570
 the additional line in 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.229
 they will help us to be well 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.199
 the ability of the pentagram for the pp won so musical 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:12.959
 well this has been all in this kind of music course 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.080
 Now you know what a musical staff is until next time
