look the entire back lip is still intact
I<00:01:24.530> really<00:01:25.530> thought<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:25.979> thing<00:01:26.189> would

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I really thought that this thing would

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.870 
I really thought that this thing would
wear<00:01:26.520> off<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:27.180> no<00:01:27.750> time<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> didn't<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.820> I

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
month swear this is what it looks like I

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.279 
month swear this is what it looks like I
would<00:02:08.000> be<00:02:08.090> most<00:02:08.270> concerned<00:02:08.479> about<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:08.959> area

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.690 
I think I've cleaned these once or twice

nice the glove didn't stretch out
actually<00:03:23.840> at<00:03:23.900> one<00:03:23.989> point<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.350> have<00:03:24.470> these<00:03:24.650> were

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
actually at one point I have these were

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.350 
actually at one point I have these were
like<00:03:24.950> covered<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.400> thorns<00:03:25.700> that<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.120> ran

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
like covered in thorns that I ran

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.060 
like covered in thorns that I ran
through<00:03:26.660> I<00:03:26.840> pulled<00:03:27.170> all<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.410> thorns<00:03:27.620> out<00:03:27.829> it

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
didn't ruin the texture I kind of

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.170 
didn't ruin the texture I kind of
figured<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:30.890> would<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.670> can't<00:03:31.910> even<00:03:32.000> really

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
figured it would you can't even really

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.949 
figured it would you can't even really
tell<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.850> again<00:03:35.060> this<00:03:35.209> phone<00:03:35.450> would<00:03:35.600> clean<00:03:35.810> up

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
tell and again this phone would clean up

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.509 
tell and again this phone would clean up
if<00:03:36.109> I<00:03:36.200> just<00:03:36.380> I<00:03:36.560> just<00:03:36.650> finished<00:03:37.100> brewing<00:03:37.190> if<00:03:37.430> I

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
if I just I just finished brewing if I

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.890 
if I just I just finished brewing if I
actually<00:03:37.670> cleaned<00:03:38.060> up<00:03:38.150> with<00:03:38.269> some<00:03:38.390> sneaker

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
actually cleaned up with some sneaker

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.680 
actually cleaned up with some sneaker
cleaner<00:03:39.049> this<00:03:39.470> would<00:03:39.560> be<00:03:39.590> fine<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:41.269> a<00:03:41.299> lot<00:03:41.660> of

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
cleaner this would be fine so a lot of

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.940 
cleaner this would be fine so a lot of
people<00:03:41.780> asking<00:03:42.079> about<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.320> way<00:03:42.440> down<00:03:42.680> I<00:03:42.829> mean

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
people asking about the way down I mean

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.470 
people asking about the way down I mean
the<00:03:43.040> moral<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.340> stories<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.090> can<00:03:44.299> see

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
the moral the stories and you can see

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.090 
the moral the stories and you can see
this<00:03:44.600> this<00:03:44.840> is<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.109> area<00:03:45.260> where<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.620> wears<00:03:45.799> and

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
this this is the area where it wears and

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.259 
this this is the area where it wears and
I<00:03:46.400> think<00:03:46.609> this<00:03:46.700> is<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.820> area<00:03:47.000> where<00:03:47.209> you

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
I think this is the area where you

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.990 
I think this is the area where you
spring<00:03:47.690> off<00:03:48.459> people<00:03:49.459> are<00:03:49.519> saying<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:49.880> know

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
spring off people are saying you know

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.039 
spring off people are saying you know
how<00:03:50.150> much<00:03:50.299> where<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.570> gonna<00:03:50.660> get<00:03:50.810> out<00:03:50.930> of

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
these i'll probably get two to two and a

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.420 
these i'll probably get two to two and a
half<00:03:54.140> months<00:03:54.290> of<00:03:54.470> running<00:03:54.739> but<00:03:54.890> frankly

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
half months of running but frankly

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.610 
half months of running but frankly
that's<00:03:55.549> all<00:03:55.790> I<00:03:55.820> get<00:03:56.030> on<00:03:56.120> my<00:03:56.150> Nikes<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:56.780> my

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
that's all I get on my Nikes and my

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.620 
that's all I get on my Nikes and my
Nikes<00:03:57.980> we're<00:03:58.220> out<00:03:58.400> in<00:03:58.609> terms<00:03:58.820> of<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.239> cushion

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
Nikes we're out in terms of the cushion

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.870 
Nikes we're out in terms of the cushion
in<00:03:59.780> this<00:03:59.930> area<00:04:00.320> long<00:04:01.040> before<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.549> tread<00:04:01.760> ever

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880

does<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:02.419> I<00:04:02.449> don't<00:04:02.750> think<00:04:03.019> the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
does so I don't think the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.250 
does so I don't think the
life<00:04:03.269> span<00:04:03.510> on<00:04:03.629> it's<00:04:03.840> actually<00:04:04.109> gonna<00:04:04.200> be

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
shorter you're just depleting this stuff

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.080 
shorter you're just depleting this stuff
instead<00:04:08.099> of<00:04:08.219> the<00:04:08.280> actual<00:04:08.430> cushion<00:04:08.849> I<00:04:08.909> mean<00:04:09.030> I

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
instead of the actual cushion I mean I

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.490 
instead of the actual cushion I mean I
