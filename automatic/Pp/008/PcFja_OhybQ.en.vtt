actually because the whole air it's not

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.070 
actually because the whole air it's not
issue<00:02:42.590> but<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.580> price<00:02:43.970> of<00:02:44.210> players<00:02:44.420> are<00:02:44.750> going

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
issue but the price of players are going

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.500 
issue but the price of players are going
down<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.680> up<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.010> stuff<00:02:46.370> at<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:46.820> it's

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
down and up and stuff at so it's

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.820 
down and up and stuff at so it's
basically<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.020> film<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.670> 133k<00:02:49.670> at<00:02:50.030> minimum<00:02:50.420> I

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
basically the film I 133k at minimum I

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.380 
basically the film I 133k at minimum I
let's<00:02:51.830> find<00:02:52.130> how<00:02:52.280> much<00:02:52.430> he's<00:02:52.610> going<00:02:52.790> for<00:02:53.120> so

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
let's find how much he's going for so

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.080 
let's find how much he's going for so
there's<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:55.070> there's<00:02:55.340> quite<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.610> lot<00:02:55.850> now<00:02:56.060> that

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
there's it there's quite a lot now that

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.840 
there's it there's quite a lot now that
about<00:02:56.570> franchise<00:02:57.410> won<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.710> French<00:02:58.010> 15k<00:02:58.580> bin

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
about franchise won that French 15k bin

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.930 
about franchise won that French 15k bin
but<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.810> reckon<00:03:00.620> he'll<00:03:00.770> go<00:03:00.950> out<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.160> about<00:03:01.220> 400

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
but I reckon he'll go out to about 400

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.090 
but I reckon he'll go out to about 400
because<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:03.020> every<00:03:03.470> day<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:03.590> getting<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.980> lot

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
because that every day is getting a lot

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.160 
because that every day is getting a lot
less<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.490> him<00:03:04.640> yesterday<00:03:05.510> there's<00:03:05.720> about<00:03:05.870> five

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
less of him yesterday there's about five

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.980 
less of him yesterday there's about five
pages<00:03:06.410> worth<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.100> now<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.310> there's<00:03:07.820> not<00:03:08.210> and<00:03:08.960> I

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
pages worth and now I there's not and I

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.690 
pages worth and now I there's not and I
think<00:03:09.260> that's<00:03:09.410> pretty<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.160> full<00:03:10.490> so

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
think that's pretty that is full so

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.070 
think that's pretty that is full so
that's<00:03:10.880> a<00:03:10.970> whole<00:03:11.120> page<00:03:11.360> taken<00:03:11.690> out<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:11.870> one<00:03:12.050> day
