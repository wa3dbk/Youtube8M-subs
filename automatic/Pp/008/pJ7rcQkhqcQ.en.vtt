00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
to make sure it wasn't a figment of my

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.840 
to make sure it wasn't a figment of my
imagination<00:01:04.129> and<00:01:05.129> actually<00:01:05.489> went<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> my

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
imagination and actually went to my

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.450 
imagination and actually went to my
husband<00:01:06.299> yesterday<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.860> he<00:01:08.070> could<00:01:08.250> tell<00:01:08.430> a

husband yesterday and he could tell a
big<00:01:08.700> difference<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:09.270> well<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> hubby

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
big difference as well so if the hubby

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.600 
big difference as well so if the hubby
seeing<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.830> difference<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.310> know<00:01:11.369> there

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
seeing a difference you know there

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.130 
seeing a difference you know there
probably<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> dirt<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:12.840> see

probably is a dirt can you really see

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.499 
probably is a dirt can you really see
the<00:01:13.799> difference<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.610> quickly<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.270> most

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the difference at quickly on most

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.210 
the difference at quickly on most
patients<00:01:16.020> yeah<00:01:16.470> that's<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> nice

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220

patients yeah that's one of the nice
advantages<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.180> machine<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.320> you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
advantages to this machine is that you

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.460 
advantages to this machine is that you
know<00:01:20.040> there's<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.400> lot<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.580> non-invasive

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
know there's a lot of non-invasive

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.630 
know there's a lot of non-invasive
techniques<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> market<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.430> one

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
techniques on the market but this one

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.120 
techniques on the market but this one
actually<00:01:23.850> works<00:01:24.479> much<00:01:24.780> faster<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.920> takes

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
actually works much faster it takes

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.800 
actually works much faster it takes
fewer<00:01:26.430> treatments<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.180> most<00:01:27.479> people<00:01:27.750> are

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
fewer treatments and most people are

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.880 
fewer treatments and most people are
seeing<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> difference<00:01:28.350> after<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:28.860> two

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
seeing a difference after one or two

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.620 
seeing a difference after one or two
treatments<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.090> how<00:01:30.240> many<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
treatments and how many of the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.899 
treatments and how many of the
treatments<00:01:31.470> ideally<00:01:32.100> because<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.610> many<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
treatments ideally because so many of

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.130 
treatments ideally because so many of
them<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.180> seems<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.540> sometimes<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.020> even

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
them it seems like sometimes you even

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.469 
them it seems like sometimes you even
have<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> go<00:01:34.500> back<00:01:34.650> 15<00:01:35.100> times<00:01:35.400> right<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.180> with

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
have to go back 15 times right and with

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.060 
have to go back 15 times right and with
this<00:01:36.630> treatment<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.110> recommended<00:01:37.619> protocol

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
this treatment the recommended protocol

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.190 
this treatment the recommended protocol
is<00:01:38.189> only<00:01:38.369> four<00:01:38.729> treatments<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.450> we've<00:01:39.960> seen

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
is only four treatments and we've seen

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.310 
is only four treatments and we've seen
anywhere<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.070> one<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.369> six<00:01:41.700> inches<00:01:41.970> of

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
anywhere from one to six inches of

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.660 
anywhere from one to six inches of
circumference<00:01:43.320> loss<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.920> four<00:01:44.130> treatments

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
circumference loss in four treatments

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.580 
circumference loss in four treatments
how<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.990> happening<00:01:46.439> where

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
how can that be what is happening where

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.929 
how can that be what is happening where
she<00:01:46.770> could<00:01:46.920> tell<00:01:47.100> an<00:01:47.250> immediate<00:01:47.729> difference

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
she could tell an immediate difference

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.020 
she could tell an immediate difference
so<00:01:48.570> some<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.860> way<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.670> device

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
so some of it is the the way this device

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.819 
so some of it is the the way this device
delivers<00:01:51.299> energy<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> little<00:01:52.350> bit<00:01:52.439> unique

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
delivers energy is a little bit unique

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.399 
delivers energy is a little bit unique
in<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.630> targeting<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.840> fat<00:01:55.110> layer

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
in that it's targeting that fat layer

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.139 
in that it's targeting that fat layer
much<00:01:55.740> more<00:01:55.979> efficiently<00:01:56.460> than<00:01:56.579> many<00:01:56.969> other

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
much more efficiently than many other

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.060 
much more efficiently than many other
machines<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.380> sending<00:01:58.649> heat<00:01:58.890> down

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
machines and so it's sending heat down

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.980 
machines and so it's sending heat down
anywhere<00:01:59.700> from<00:01:59.790> one<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.060> three<00:02:00.180> centimeters

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
anywhere from one to three centimeters

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080 
anywhere from one to three centimeters
and<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.920> as<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.250> heats<00:02:02.490> up<00:02:02.640> those<00:02:02.790> fat

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and that as that heats up those fat

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.090 
and that as that heats up those fat
cells<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.689> causes<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.170> fatty<00:02:04.409> acids<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.920> come

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
cells it causes the fatty acids to come

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.639 
cells it causes the fatty acids to come
out<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.460> shrink<00:02:06.060> those<00:02:06.149> fat<00:02:06.420> cells<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:07.380> all

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
out in shrink those fat cells it's all

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.380 
out in shrink those fat cells it's all
so<00:02:07.799> over<00:02:08.069> time<00:02:08.280> getting<00:02:08.640> some<00:02:08.849> college<00:02:09.239> and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
so over time getting some college and

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.029 
so over time getting some college and
contraction<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.319> we're<00:02:10.440> getting<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.739> skin

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
contraction and so we're getting a skin

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.190 
contraction and so we're getting a skin
tightening<00:02:11.430> effect<00:02:11.520> also

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
tightening effect also

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.470 
tightening effect also
and<00:02:12.500> again<00:02:12.980> do<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:13.610> feel<00:02:13.730> sort<00:02:14.209> of<00:02:14.330> a

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
and again do you just feel sort of a

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.330 
and again do you just feel sort of a
warming<00:02:15.050> just<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.349> nice<00:02:15.530> massage<00:02:15.800> right<00:02:16.280> now

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
warming just a nice massage right now

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.520 
warming just a nice massage right now
really<00:02:16.879> and<00:02:17.420> that's<00:02:17.629> it<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:17.959> what<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.290> want

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
really and that's it and what I want

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.440 
really and that's it and what I want
body<00:02:18.830> parts<00:02:19.220> do<00:02:19.459> you<00:02:19.519> do<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.819> procedure<00:02:20.030> on

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
body parts do you do this procedure on

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.080 
body parts do you do this procedure on
so<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:20.959> is<00:02:21.040> any<00:02:22.040> body<00:02:22.250> part<00:02:22.670> really<00:02:22.879> we're

can see the little grid on deana stomach

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.500 
can see the little grid on deana stomach
but<00:02:39.440> we're<00:02:39.890> able<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.130> treat<00:02:40.340> about<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> 5<00:02:41.030> inch<00:02:41.060> x

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
but we're able to treat about a 5 inch x

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.110 
but we're able to treat about a 5 inch x
7<00:02:41.870> inch<00:02:41.989> area<00:02:42.379> at<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.620> time<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:43.519> because<00:02:43.940> we

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
7 inch area at a time and so because we

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.630 
7 inch area at a time and so because we
treat<00:02:44.330> such<00:02:44.569> small<00:02:44.930> areas<00:02:45.440> where<00:02:46.069> really

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
treat such small areas where really

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.670 
treat such small areas where really
customized<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.569> treatment<00:02:48.049> so<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.290> we<00:02:48.500> can

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
customized the treatment so that we can

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.770 
customized the treatment so that we can
do<00:02:48.890> anywhere<00:02:49.250> from<00:02:49.459> one<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.760> eight<00:02:50.030> zones<00:02:50.360> in<00:02:50.750> a

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
do anywhere from one to eight zones in a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.020 
do anywhere from one to eight zones in a
session<00:02:51.049> that<00:02:51.440> allows<00:02:52.069> us<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.430> treat<00:02:52.610> maybe<00:02:52.849> on

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
session that allows us to treat maybe on

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.120 
session that allows us to treat maybe on
the<00:02:53.120> abdomen<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.810> love<00:02:54.019> handles<00:02:54.319> inner

problem<00:02:58.010> areas<00:02:58.069> that<00:02:58.430> we<00:02:58.790> have<00:02:58.940> in<00:02:59.150> just<00:02:59.510> a

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
problem areas that we have in just a

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.569 
problem areas that we have in just a
matter<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.989> minutes<00:03:00.200> really<00:03:00.739> it<00:03:00.890> sounds<00:03:01.130> right

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
matter of minutes really it sounds right

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:02.830

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
treated it can range from about nine
