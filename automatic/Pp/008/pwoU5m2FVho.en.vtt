00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.949
 spring is the right opportunity for 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.180
 start making some changes 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.339
 food and to be able to do some sort of 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.530
 purification of our body 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.260
 at this stage there are help without 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.230
 other whole grains you know by now 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.659
 that I especially love rice but 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.979
 the invitation just to have fun with 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.210
 all the cereals we have a 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.210
 layout 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.180
 the spelled the barley the best and all types 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.400
 of rice then we can also use it 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.670
 others like quinoa is really the 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.070
 nature comes to our aid in this regard 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.290
 we will need few oil from 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.810
 the extra virgin olive oil that is important 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.090
 of excellent quality and even if we use it 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.820
 little in this phase 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.979
 we say is not is not important and the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.469
 seasonal vegetables and in this season 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.329
 spring has finally arrived 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:25.359
 so it really brings us so many 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.490
 vegetables and today's recipe provides 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.020
 the use of artichokes cereals 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.600
 integrals are very easy to cook 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.390
 the proportions are always more or less the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.819
 same as a whole cereal cup in 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.420
 this case we have rice and three cups 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.369
 of water 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.960
 we put all together in a pot 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.630
 we don't have to worry about anything 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.399
 because it will do everything by itself the rice will be 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.369
 ready when the water is all 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.649
 absorbed and really only need 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.619
 stay a while to check the cooking 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.050
 if you are not yet used to this 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.390
 type of whole food 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.510
 I suggest you check the cooking 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.580
 and will always remain a little bit more 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.680
 crunchy than you are used to 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.420
 example with white rice but this is it 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.580
 just the beauty of the cereal 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.410
 integral so you can also cook 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.420
 the day before can be held in 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.690
 refrigerator and will never become one 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.830
 glue that can then be seasoned at the time 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.230
 we can use for example i 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.300
 artichokes that we will then go to clean liters 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.210
 we simply drill with very little 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.070
 Oil really it just as much as them 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.560
 we always leave it crunchy because 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.290
 however the recipe is good this way 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.760
 season with a little salt and some salt 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.040
 aromatic herbs in this case the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.490
 parsley cut at the moment to 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.890
 time to serve we mix the cereal 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.860
 the vegetables together we will have a first 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.690
 light but strong dish that will give you 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.340
 energy want to be optimistic and can 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.520
 help you eliminate the pounds accumulated 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.340
 during the winter and a skin really 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.200
 bright I suggest you eat a 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.410
 dish based on whole grains e 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.080
 vegetables at every meal and to accompany it 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.480
 with two or three side dishes of other vegetables 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.239
 seasoned in various ways and cooked in a manner 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.100
 different we do not mind the quantities in 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.959
 this period because we will be very hungry 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.200
 especially because we would have eliminated 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.790
 other foods and be careful of the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.850
 variety of what you bring to the table 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:26.100
 to have fun cooking to use the 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.100
 your imagination and costing you your life
