couple times as it's just the way the
capitalization<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> makes<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.500> looks<00:00:37.620> like

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
capitalization it makes it looks like

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.590 
capitalization it makes it looks like
it's<00:00:37.890> more<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.190> bra<00:00:38.489> top<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:38.820> brat<00:00:39.149> okay<00:00:39.480> as

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it's more like bra top or brat okay as

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
what's going to be happening when white

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.799 
what's going to be happening when white
wall<00:00:53.940> will<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.210> fact<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.449> getting<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
wall will in fact be getting that

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.290 
wall will in fact be getting that
gateway<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.670> gateways<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> be

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
gateway or if that gateways going to be

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.639 
gateway or if that gateways going to be
a<00:00:57.329> little<00:00:57.600> bit<00:00:57.780> delayed<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.199> order<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.500> get

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
a little bit delayed in order to get

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.040 
a little bit delayed in order to get
some<00:00:58.859> additional<00:00:59.510> probes<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
some additional probes out for that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.779 
some additional probes out for that
economic<00:01:01.530> advantage<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.460> looks<00:01:02.670> as

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
economic advantage and it looks as

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.640 
economic advantage and it looks as
though<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.969> white<00:01:03.149> wall<00:01:03.390> right<00:01:03.840> raw<00:01:04.170> will<00:01:04.470> be

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
though a white wall right raw will be

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.870 
though a white wall right raw will be
trying<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.129> economic<00:01:05.519> advantage

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
trying to get that economic advantage

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.310

going<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.299> go<00:01:06.420> ahead<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> chrono<00:01:06.900> boost<00:01:07.140> right

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
going to go ahead and chrono boost right

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.800 
going to go ahead and chrono boost right
now<00:01:07.560> most<00:01:07.860> likely<00:01:07.950> waiting<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.180> no<00:01:09.540> not

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
now most likely waiting for that no not

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.350 
now most likely waiting for that no not
chrono<00:01:10.110> boosting<00:01:10.530> okay<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:10.920> perhaps<00:01:11.790> delaying

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
chrono boosting okay so perhaps delaying

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.179 
chrono boosting okay so perhaps delaying

get<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.580> additional<00:01:15.890> gateway<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.070> then

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
get that additional gateway and then

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.249

more and we'll see what's going to be
happening<00:02:00.960> taking<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.890> look<00:02:01.979> over<00:02:02.219> here<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.490> do

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
happening taking a look over here we do

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.639 
happening taking a look over here we do
in<00:02:02.729> fact<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:03.000> an<00:02:03.210> SUV<00:02:03.540> now<00:02:03.780> moving<00:02:04.020> out<00:02:04.200> SUV

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
in fact have an SUV now moving out SUV

in fact have an SUV now moving out SUV
took<00:02:04.799> ones<00:02:05.130> out<00:02:05.340> from<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.759> probe<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.689> not

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
took ones out from that probe but not

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.510 
took ones out from that probe but not
really<00:02:07.200> enough<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.680> anything<00:02:07.890> else<00:02:08.099> so

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
really enough to do anything else so

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.029 
really enough to do anything else so
it's<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.729> particle<00:02:09.209> beam<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.750> few

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
brought talk able to see it so in fact

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.210 
brought talk able to see it so in fact
we'll<00:02:58.879> be<00:02:59.000> able<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.299> get<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.689> some<00:02:59.900> of<00:03:00.019> those

time for zealot42 for a stalker and a

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.670 
time for zealot42 for a stalker and a
century<00:03:40.459> also<00:03:40.970> 42<00:03:41.720> build<00:03:42.019> time<00:03:42.229> is<00:03:42.409> the<00:03:42.500> amount

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
century also 42 build time is the amount

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.860 
century also 42 build time is the amount
of<00:03:42.829> time<00:03:43.069> it<00:03:43.220> takes<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.549> to<00:03:43.639> takes<00:03:44.569> a<00:03:44.659> player

too<00:03:45.139> I<00:03:45.349> believe<00:03:45.769> gather<00:03:46.159> 200<00:03:46.609> gas<00:03:47.180> off<00:03:47.479> of

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
too I believe gather 200 gas off of

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.050 
too I believe gather 200 gas off of
double<00:03:48.109> simulators<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:49.459> can<00:03:49.669> essentially

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
double simulators so you can essentially

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.069 
double simulators so you can essentially
mass<00:03:50.479> centuries<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:51.500> double<00:03:51.919> stalkers<00:03:52.310> and

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
mass centuries and double stalkers and

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.270 
mass centuries and double stalkers and
from<00:03:54.079> a<00:03:54.109> three<00:03:54.349> gateways<00:03:54.709> as<00:03:54.889> long<00:03:55.040> as<00:03:55.189> you

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
from a three gateways as long as you

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.309 
from a three gateways as long as you
have<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:55.729> gas<00:03:55.939> taking<00:03:56.629> a<00:03:56.689> look<00:03:56.810> back<00:03:56.930> over<00:03:56.989> here

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
have to gas taking a look back over here

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.679 
have to gas taking a look back over here
we<00:03:57.470> now<00:03:57.650> have<00:03:57.919> a<00:03:57.949> factory<00:03:58.519> coming<00:03:58.790> in<00:03:58.909> to<00:03:59.449> play

masked<00:04:11.359> Marauders<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:11.870> just<00:04:12.139> don't<00:04:12.349> think<00:04:12.530> that

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
masked Marauders I just don't think that

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.990 
masked Marauders I just don't think that
that's<00:04:12.799> going<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.129> be<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.370> right<00:04:13.489> strategy<00:04:13.909> at

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
that's going to be the right strategy at

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.849 
that's going to be the right strategy at
this<00:04:14.120> stage<00:04:14.299> in<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:14.449> game<00:04:14.509> single<00:04:15.259> probe<00:04:15.530> and

this stage in the game single probe and

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.499 
this stage in the game single probe and
now<00:04:16.070> we<00:04:16.130> also<00:04:16.370> have<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.609> siege<00:04:16.849> tank<00:04:17.120> this
