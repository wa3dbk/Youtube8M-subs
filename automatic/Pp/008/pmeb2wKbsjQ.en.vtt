00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.929 

people<00:00:05.470> often<00:00:05.740> ask<00:00:05.830> me<00:00:06.009> about<00:00:06.130> paint<00:00:06.670> thinning

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:06.939 
people often ask me about paint thinning

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:08.340 
people often ask me about paint thinning
ratios<00:00:07.330> and<00:00:07.540> if<00:00:07.630> there<00:00:07.779> is<00:00:07.870> a<00:00:07.899> rule<00:00:08.200> of<00:00:08.260> thumb

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.350 
ratios and if there is a rule of thumb

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.289 
ratios and if there is a rule of thumb
and<00:00:08.740> unfortunately<00:00:09.490> there<00:00:09.670> really<00:00:09.820> is<00:00:10.030> not

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:10.299 
and unfortunately there really is not

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.080 
and unfortunately there really is not
for<00:00:11.049> any<00:00:11.200> particular<00:00:11.469> line<00:00:11.950> of<00:00:11.980> paint<00:00:12.370> each

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
for any particular line of paint each

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.600 
for any particular line of paint each
color<00:00:13.480> within<00:00:13.750> that<00:00:13.990> line<00:00:14.290> is<00:00:14.860> formulated<00:00:15.550> a

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
color within that line is formulated a

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.609 
color within that line is formulated a
little<00:00:15.849> bit<00:00:15.969> differently<00:00:16.420> some<00:00:17.110> colors<00:00:17.410> will

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
little bit differently some colors will

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.380 
little bit differently some colors will
require<00:00:17.980> more<00:00:18.400> thinner<00:00:18.640> while<00:00:18.910> others<00:00:19.180> will

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
require more thinner while others will

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.929 
require more thinner while others will
require<00:00:19.570> less<00:00:20.140> so<00:00:21.070> therefore<00:00:21.489> you're<00:00:21.700> really

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
require less so therefore you're really

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.540 
require less so therefore you're really
looking<00:00:22.090> for<00:00:22.300> a<00:00:22.779> paint<00:00:23.560> consistency<00:00:24.310> rather

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
looking for a paint consistency rather

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.479 
looking for a paint consistency rather
than<00:00:24.790> a<00:00:24.880> specific<00:00:25.090> ratio<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.890> let's<00:00:27.099> discuss

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
than a specific ratio so let's discuss

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.030 
than a specific ratio so let's discuss
this<00:00:27.669> in<00:00:27.730> greater<00:00:27.880> detail<00:00:28.380> most<00:00:29.380> hobby<00:00:29.590> colors

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
this in greater detail most hobby colors

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.310 
this in greater detail most hobby colors
whether<00:00:30.250> they're<00:00:30.460> acrylic<00:00:30.880> or<00:00:31.090> enamel<00:00:31.419> will

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
whether they're acrylic or enamel will

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.200 
whether they're acrylic or enamel will
have<00:00:32.559> a<00:00:32.590> tendency<00:00:32.829> to<00:00:33.100> separate<00:00:33.489> over<00:00:34.000> time

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
have a tendency to separate over time

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.360 
have a tendency to separate over time
when<00:00:34.450> they're<00:00:34.570> not<00:00:34.690> used<00:00:35.020> so<00:00:35.290> before<00:00:36.100> you<00:00:36.190> use

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
when they're not used so before you use

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.160 
when they're not used so before you use
a<00:00:36.399> particular<00:00:36.790> color<00:00:37.270> you<00:00:37.660> want<00:00:37.810> to<00:00:37.900> give<00:00:38.020> it<00:00:38.110> a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
a particular color you want to give it a

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.750 
a particular color you want to give it a
good<00:00:38.320> shake<00:00:38.590> I've<00:00:39.070> already<00:00:39.310> done<00:00:39.490> that<00:00:39.640> with

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
good shake I've already done that with

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.880 
good shake I've already done that with
my<00:00:39.880> gloss<00:00:40.090> black<00:00:40.360> but<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.410> next<00:00:41.620> step<00:00:41.770> you

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
my gloss black but the next step you

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.170 
my gloss black but the next step you
want<00:00:41.920> to<00:00:42.070> do<00:00:42.250> is<00:00:42.370> go<00:00:42.520> ahead<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:42.910> give<00:00:43.030> it<00:00:43.060> a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
want to do is go ahead and give it a

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.510 
want to do is go ahead and give it a
good<00:00:43.360> stir<00:00:43.720> before<00:00:44.230> you<00:00:44.530> go<00:00:44.650> ahead<00:00:44.770> and<00:00:45.010> add<00:00:45.280> it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
good stir before you go ahead and add it

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.180 
good stir before you go ahead and add it
to<00:00:45.550> your<00:00:45.820> color<00:00:46.030> column<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.860> way<00:00:48.040> you<00:00:48.100> just

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
to your color column this way you just

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.490 
to your color column this way you just
know<00:00:48.490> that<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.790> paint<00:00:49.060> is<00:00:49.329> fully<00:00:49.600> homogenized

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
know that the paint is fully homogenized

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.810 
know that the paint is fully homogenized
inside<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.040> bottle<00:00:56.070> now<00:00:57.070> when<00:00:57.310> we<00:00:57.430> add<00:00:57.550> some

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
inside the bottle now when we add some

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.450 
inside the bottle now when we add some
to<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.060> color<00:00:58.270> Cup<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:59.590> automatically<00:01:00.190> know

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
to the color Cup we automatically know

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.460 
to the color Cup we automatically know
that<00:01:00.489> it's<00:01:00.850> not<00:01:01.180> ready<00:01:01.540> for<00:01:01.750> airbrush<00:01:02.170> use

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
that it's not ready for airbrush use

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.460 
that it's not ready for airbrush use
because<00:01:02.920> it's<00:01:03.100> too<00:01:03.280> thick<00:01:03.579> but<00:01:04.479> just<00:01:04.720> for<00:01:05.379> the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
because it's too thick but just for the

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.530 
because it's too thick but just for the
sake<00:01:05.649> of<00:01:05.740> example<00:01:06.000> I'm<00:01:07.000> going<00:01:07.149> to<00:01:07.210> streak<00:01:07.420> it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
sake of example I'm going to streak it

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.450 
sake of example I'm going to streak it
up<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.780> side<00:01:07.990> here<00:01:08.290> and<00:01:08.380> you<00:01:08.470> can<00:01:08.620> see<00:01:08.860> how<00:01:09.130> has

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
up the side here and you can see how has

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.190 
up the side here and you can see how has
a<00:01:09.490> tendency<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.150> want<00:01:10.360> to<00:01:10.420> adhere<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.990> side

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
a tendency to want to adhere to the side

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.620 
a tendency to want to adhere to the side
of<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.409> color<00:01:11.620> Cup<00:01:11.890> in<00:01:12.700> that<00:01:12.970> flow<00:01:13.180> back<00:01:13.390> into

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
of the color Cup in that flow back into

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.630 
of the color Cup in that flow back into
the<00:01:13.720> pool<00:01:13.870> of<00:01:13.990> paint<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:15.159> that's<00:01:15.340> when<00:01:15.520> we

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
the pool of paint so that's when we

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.450 
the pool of paint so that's when we
start<00:01:15.880> adding<00:01:16.000> thinner<00:01:20.010> we're<00:01:21.010> gonna<00:01:21.100> start

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
start adding thinner we're gonna start

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.719 
start adding thinner we're gonna start
off<00:01:21.580> with<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:21.820> few<00:01:23.310> generous<00:01:24.310> drops<00:01:24.640> here<00:01:25.000> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
off with a few generous drops here and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.940 
off with a few generous drops here and
see<00:01:27.729> where<00:01:27.880> we're<00:01:28.060> at<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:29.350> is<00:01:29.409> generally<00:01:29.890> an

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
see where we're at this is generally an

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.289 
see where we're at this is generally an
additive<00:01:30.370> process<00:01:30.430> where<00:01:31.120> you're<00:01:31.180> gonna

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
additive process where you're gonna

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.270 
additive process where you're gonna
probably<00:01:31.630> hit<00:01:31.900> continue<00:01:32.350> add<00:01:32.650> thinner<00:01:33.010> until

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
probably hit continue add thinner until

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.070 
probably hit continue add thinner until
you<00:01:33.640> get<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:34.090> proper<00:01:34.450> proportion<00:01:34.990> that

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
you get the proper proportion that

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.289 
you get the proper proportion that
you're<00:01:35.229> looking<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.500> get<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:40.000> getting

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
you're looking to get that's getting

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.899 
you're looking to get that's getting
closer<00:01:40.540> to<00:01:41.350> what<00:01:41.500> I'm<00:01:41.619> looking<00:01:41.920> for<00:01:42.159> but<00:01:42.850> I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
closer to what I'm looking for but I

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.039 
closer to what I'm looking for but I
want<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.180> go<00:01:43.270> ahead<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:43.600> add<00:01:43.690> just<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:44.020> little

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
want to go ahead and add just a little

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.289 
want to go ahead and add just a little
bit<00:01:44.290> more<00:01:44.560> thinner<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.520> get<00:01:45.729> so<00:01:46.119> that's

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
bit more thinner and get so that's

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.000 
bit more thinner and get so that's
flowing<00:01:46.570> just<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:47.049> little<00:01:47.409> bit<00:01:47.530> more<00:01:47.710> for<00:01:47.920> my

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
flowing just a little bit more for my

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:57.590 
flowing just a little bit more for my
purposes

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.330 

okay<00:01:58.600> that's<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.350> consistency<00:01:59.649> I'm<00:02:00.039> looking

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
okay that's the consistency I'm looking

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.639 
okay that's the consistency I'm looking
for<00:02:00.630> what<00:02:01.630> I<00:02:01.659> want<00:02:01.719> to<00:02:01.990> see<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.409> paint

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
for what I want to see is the paint

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.010 
for what I want to see is the paint
flowing<00:02:03.009> back<00:02:03.220> into<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.520> pool<00:02:03.789> now<00:02:04.780> there's

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
flowing back into the pool now there's

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.359

consideration also when you're thinning

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.779 
consideration also when you're thinning
your<00:02:07.990> paint<00:02:08.289> for<00:02:08.920> one<00:02:09.039> thing<00:02:09.280> what<00:02:09.550> is<00:02:09.580> it

working on fine line or detail work in
which<00:02:13.660> case<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:13.989> may<00:02:14.140> want<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.530> paint<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.769> be

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
which case you may want the paint to be

which case you may want the paint to be
a<00:02:14.980> little<00:02:15.250> bit<00:02:15.430> thinner<00:02:15.700> or<00:02:16.300> general<00:02:16.690> coverage

where<00:02:17.260> it's<00:02:17.349> not<00:02:17.470> quite<00:02:17.739> so<00:02:17.890> critical<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.489> you

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
where it's not quite so critical and you

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.770 
where it's not quite so critical and you
can<00:02:18.730> go<00:02:18.849> with<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.120> little<00:02:19.330> less<00:02:19.510> then

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
can go with it a little less then

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.380 
can go with it a little less then
another<00:02:20.680> consideration<00:02:21.099> also<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.970> what<00:02:22.269> the

more so that it'll flow through the
