freerunning<00:00:00.539> 2<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.290> fun<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.610> it's<00:00:03.000> free<00:00:03.330> it's

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
freerunning 2 is fun and it's free it's

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.320 
freerunning 2 is fun and it's free it's
just<00:00:04.049> like<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.830> perfect<00:00:05.370> game<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.850> play<00:00:06.029> when

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
just like the perfect game to play when

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.360 
just like the perfect game to play when
you're<00:00:06.450> bored<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:07.140> actually<00:00:07.470> played<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.130> first

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
you're bored I actually played the first

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.980 
you're bored I actually played the first
freerunning<00:00:09.030> game<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.480> thought<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.870> was

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
freerunning game and I thought it was

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.379 
freerunning game and I thought it was
good<00:00:10.410> but<00:00:10.440> at<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.370> same<00:00:11.610> time<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.059> was<00:00:12.179> pretty

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
good but at the same time it was pretty

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.360 
good but at the same time it was pretty
boring<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.110> didn't<00:00:13.380> really<00:00:13.620> hold<00:00:13.830> me<00:00:14.130> for

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
boring and it didn't really hold me for

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.129 
boring and it didn't really hold me for
too<00:00:14.549> long<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.969> must<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.330> played<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.750> for<00:00:15.780> about

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
too long I must have played it for about

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.870 
too long I must have played it for about
10<00:00:16.379> minutes<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.070> just<00:00:17.279> bored<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.760> I

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
10 minutes and I was just bored and I

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.189 
10 minutes and I was just bored and I
really<00:00:18.180> never<00:00:18.330> touched<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.900> again

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
really never touched it again

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.080 
really never touched it again
freerunning<00:00:19.770> 2<00:00:20.160> though<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.400> could<00:00:20.730> see<00:00:20.910> myself

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
freerunning 2 though I could see myself

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.000 
freerunning 2 though I could see myself
coming<00:00:21.600> back<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.230> game<00:00:22.439> they<00:00:22.619> really

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
coming back to this game they really

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.250 
coming back to this game they really
improved<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.580> physics<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.240> fact<00:00:24.810> they<00:00:25.019> made

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
improved the physics in fact they made

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.160 
improved the physics in fact they made
the<00:00:25.470> game<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.510> third-person<00:00:27.510> Mirror's

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the game like a third-person Mirror's

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.109 
the game like a third-person Mirror's
Edge<00:00:28.349> not<00:00:28.859> just<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> way<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.369> run<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.970> move

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
Edge not just the way you run and move

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.820 
Edge not just the way you run and move
in<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> physics<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.710> actually

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
in the physics but like it actually

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.620 
in the physics but like it actually
looks<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.489> Mirror's<00:00:32.850> Edge<00:00:32.969> like<00:00:33.239> Dean<00:00:33.390> by

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
looks like Mirror's Edge like Dean by

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.910 
looks like Mirror's Edge like Dean by
amends<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.140> fact<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.440> there's<00:00:34.590> red

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
amends the fact that there's red

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.830 
amends the fact that there's red
everywhere<00:00:35.550> there's<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.239> lines<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.809> show

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
everywhere there's like lines to show

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.540 
everywhere there's like lines to show
you<00:00:37.050> where<00:00:37.350> you're<00:00:37.559> supposed<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.010> jump<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
you where you're supposed to jump and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.310 
you where you're supposed to jump and
that's<00:00:38.940> not<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> bad<00:00:39.390> thing<00:00:39.600> by<00:00:39.809> copying

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
that's not a bad thing by copying

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.690 
that's not a bad thing by copying
Mirror's<00:00:40.680> Edge<00:00:40.800> they're<00:00:41.070> doing<00:00:41.370> something

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
Mirror's Edge they're doing something

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.520 
Mirror's Edge they're doing something
great<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.450> Mirror's<00:00:42.780> Edge<00:00:42.930> was<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> great

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
great because Mirror's Edge was a great

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.229 
great because Mirror's Edge was a great
game<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:43.980> they're<00:00:44.370> taking<00:00:44.730> all<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> good

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
game and they're taking all the good

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.389 
game and they're taking all the good
parts<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.750> Mirror's<00:00:46.020> Edge<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.530> freerunning

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
parts of Mirror's Edge the freerunning

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.670 
parts of Mirror's Edge the freerunning
on<00:00:47.520> rooftops<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.899> making<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.440> whole

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
on rooftops and just making the whole

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.799 
on rooftops and just making the whole
game<00:00:49.920> about<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.850> graphics<00:00:51.239> obviously

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
game about that the graphics obviously

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.569 
game about that the graphics obviously
aren't<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.230> good<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.710> Mirror's<00:00:53.070> Edge<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
aren't as good as Mirror's Edge but the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.490 
aren't as good as Mirror's Edge but the
graphics<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:54.149> absolutely<00:00:54.469> fantastic<00:00:55.469> for

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
graphics are absolutely fantastic for

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.650 
graphics are absolutely fantastic for
something<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.460> play<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.329> browser

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
something you just play in your browser

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
something you just play in your browser
for<00:00:57.899> free<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.460> don't<00:00:59.670> even<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.090> wait

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
for free and you don't even have to wait

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.970 
for free and you don't even have to wait
for<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> game<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> load<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.260> mean<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.590> swear<00:01:01.829> I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
for the game to load I mean I swear I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.830 
for the game to load I mean I swear I
turned<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.149> was<00:01:03.180> playing<00:01:03.600> within

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
turned it on and I was playing within

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.109 
turned it on and I was playing within
seconds<00:01:04.439> there's<00:01:04.920> different<00:01:05.400> environments

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
seconds there's different environments

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.149 
seconds there's different environments
different<00:01:06.270> rooftops<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.140> run<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:07.830> it's

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
different rooftops you run on but it's

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.890 
different rooftops you run on but it's
more<00:01:08.490> or<00:01:08.640> less<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.970> same<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:09.689> just

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
more or less the same like they just

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.719 
more or less the same like they just
repeat<00:01:10.380> themselves<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
repeat themselves it's just that the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.700 
repeat themselves it's just that the
weather<00:01:12.000> kind<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.510> changes<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> little<00:01:13.409> bit

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
weather kind of changes a little bit

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.590 
weather kind of changes a little bit
that<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.189> colors<00:01:14.610> might<00:01:14.880> change<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that the colors might change but the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480 
that the colors might change but the
basic<00:01:16.080> environments<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:16.979> say<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
basic environments like say all the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.160 
basic environments like say all the
pipes<00:01:17.759> all<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> things<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> climb<00:01:18.750> all<00:01:19.140> the
