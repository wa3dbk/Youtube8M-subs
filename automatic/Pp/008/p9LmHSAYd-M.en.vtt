00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.660
 My work at M1 was really fun and could be said to be a blessing. 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:13.300
 Korg talks to American and European musicians, 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.540
 It was one of the first models developed with a Japanese engineer. 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.340
 At that time it was about time when new synthesizers started to appear, but 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.720
 Most of the third-party models were PCM only, not the full sample. 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.080
 Meanwhile, M1 is a complete workstation that first appeared, 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.340
 The sound could be made perfectly, and the effects were also included. 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.700
 Until then, I had never seen such a synthesizer. 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.260
 And there was a full sample library and it was really intense. 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.800
 Korg is really ugly. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.520
 All the sounds of M1, all the features, all the expansion cards, everything is everything, 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.700
 I was really blown away. It's really interesting to play 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.120
 And you can carry it with you anywhere. Surely everyone will be addicted. 

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:20.100
 It is exactly the revival of M1. 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.800
 I would like to say a loud voice to those who have forgotten how wonderful the sound is. 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.040
 Alreadyâ€¦ 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.200
 At that time I used the M1's sequencer quite a bit. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.820
 I also overwhelmed the sound. 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.940
 At that time, the popularity of sound in popular music changed dramatically. 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.540
 Everyone used M1. 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.880
 Now everything in M1 is so small, 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.240
 In addition, all expansion cards that could be used at the time are available. 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.520
 Also surprisingly, the keyboard is very easy to play, 

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:14.245
 The sound can also be edited in great detail, 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.550
 And it's the best sound quality. 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.750
 This is definitely a shock.
