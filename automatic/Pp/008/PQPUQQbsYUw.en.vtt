00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
actually one thing that's pretty cool

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.979 
actually one thing that's pretty cool
I'm<00:03:22.290> going<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.739> go<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.950> encode<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:24.660> unit

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
I'm going to go to encode the unit

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.949 
I'm going to go to encode the unit
converter<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:26.430> from<00:03:26.819> wait<00:03:27.060> they<00:03:27.690> use<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
converter so from wait they use the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.690 
converter so from wait they use the
metric<00:03:28.260> system<00:03:28.290> here<00:03:28.829> of<00:03:29.040> course<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.640> they

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
metric system here of course and they

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.720 
metric system here of course and they
also<00:03:29.849> use<00:03:30.260> Celsius<00:03:31.260> instead<00:03:31.829> of<00:03:31.950> Fahrenheit

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
also use Celsius instead of Fahrenheit

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.240 
also use Celsius instead of Fahrenheit
so<00:03:33.720> I've<00:03:33.810> opened<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.349> up<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.620> few<00:03:34.769> times<00:03:34.950> and

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
so I've opened this up a few times and

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.440 
so I've opened this up a few times and
used<00:03:36.180> out<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.390> few<00:03:36.599> times<00:03:37.910> show<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> camera

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
used out a few times show you the camera

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.710 
used out a few times show you the camera
I<00:03:39.510> guess

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:55.790 

so<00:03:47.380> I'm

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.800 

that's<00:03:56.800> pretty<00:03:57.010> good<00:03:57.300> when<00:03:58.300> you<00:03:58.390> point<00:03:58.629> it<00:03:58.690> out

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
that's pretty good when you point it out

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.420 
that's pretty good when you point it out
like<00:03:59.049> dark<00:03:59.319> places<00:03:59.379> it<00:03:59.950> lightens<00:04:00.310> it

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
like dark places it lightens it

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.680 
like dark places it lightens it
brightens<00:04:00.909> up<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.180> everything<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.540> has<00:04:01.659> a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
brightens up and everything it has a

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.100 
brightens up and everything it has a
sensor<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:06.220> you<00:04:06.310> got<00:04:06.519> your<00:04:06.810> microSD<00:04:07.810> on<00:04:07.989> the

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
adapter and the battery life on this is

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.439 
adapter and the battery life on this is
pretty<00:04:35.229> good<00:04:35.440> i<00:04:35.470> called<00:04:35.800> my<00:04:35.949> friend<00:04:36.130> in<00:04:36.490> solo<00:04:37.270> I

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
pretty good i called my friend in solo I

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:38.430 
pretty good i called my friend in solo I
spoke<00:04:37.690> to<00:04:37.840> him<00:04:37.870> for<00:04:38.110> about<00:04:38.199> two<00:04:38.410> hours

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
spoke to him for about two hours

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.890 
spoke to him for about two hours
yesterday<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:39.850> now<00:04:40.000> when<00:04:40.120> you<00:04:40.210> lost<00:04:40.389> one<00:04:40.660> bar

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
yesterday and now when you lost one bar

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.230 
yesterday and now when you lost one bar
so<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:41.830> imagine<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.400> battery<00:04:42.669> would<00:04:42.789> last<00:04:42.850> for

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
so I imagine the battery would last for

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.270 
so I imagine the battery would last for
a<00:04:43.270> few<00:04:43.389> days<00:04:43.600> but<00:04:44.470> I<00:04:44.530> guess<00:04:44.770> if<00:04:44.919> you<00:04:45.039> have<00:04:45.160> to

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
a few days but I guess if you have to

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.890 
a few days but I guess if you have to
play<00:04:45.460> this<00:04:45.639> going<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:46.240> you're<00:04:46.419> calling

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
play this going and you're calling

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.990 
play this going and you're calling
