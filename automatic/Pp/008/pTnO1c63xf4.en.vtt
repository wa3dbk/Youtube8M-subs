this<00:00:03.360> amorphous<00:00:03.870> background<00:00:04.470> that<00:00:04.620> you<00:00:04.740> see

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:04.979 
this amorphous background that you see

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:08.030 
this amorphous background that you see
here<00:00:05.330> would<00:00:06.330> be<00:00:06.750> representing<00:00:07.529> what<00:00:07.920> is

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
here would be representing what is

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.030 
here would be representing what is
called<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.400> cytosol<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:10.170> cytosol<00:00:10.710> is

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
called the cytosol and the cytosol is

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.120 
called the cytosol and the cytosol is
basically<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.700> very<00:00:11.970> viscous<00:00:12.510> gel<00:00:13.130> like

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
basically a very viscous gel like

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.829 
basically a very viscous gel like
substance<00:00:15.230> which<00:00:16.230> at<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.740> magnification<00:00:17.160> is

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:17.839 
substance which at this magnification is

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.349 
substance which at this magnification is
just<00:00:18.839> filling<00:00:19.289> up<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.829> contents<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
just filling up the contents of the

just filling up the contents of the
cytoplasm

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
cytoplasm

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.319 
cytoplasm
this<00:00:22.949> distinct<00:00:23.550> structures<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.089> see

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.329 
this distinct structures that you see

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.950 
this distinct structures that you see
here<00:00:24.720> these<00:00:24.900> red<00:00:25.279> granules<00:00:26.509> are<00:00:27.509> meant<00:00:27.839> to

here these red granules are meant to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.909 
here these red granules are meant to
represent<00:00:28.249> ribosomes<00:00:29.249> and<00:00:30.289> these<00:00:31.289> would

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
represent ribosomes and these would

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.840 
represent ribosomes and these would
represent<00:00:32.399> free<00:00:33.030> ribosomes<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:34.850> ribosomes

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.439 
represent free ribosomes the ribosomes
are<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.930> location<00:00:37.710> where<00:00:38.180> protein<00:00:39.180> is

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
are the location where protein is

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.959 
are the location where protein is

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
synthesized inside the cell find them

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.220 
synthesized inside the cell find them
here<00:00:42.329> not<00:00:43.079> attached<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.769> any<00:00:44.010> other<00:00:44.340> organelle

you<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.219> these<00:00:47.489> red<00:00:47.850> granules<00:00:48.449> are

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you can see that these red granules are

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.650 
you can see that these red granules are
also<00:00:49.350> present<00:00:49.949> on<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.129> membrane<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.879> these

also present on the membrane of these
organelles<00:00:52.649> these<00:00:53.429> would<00:00:53.850> be<00:00:54.089> referred<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.719> as

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
organelles these would be referred to as

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.759 
organelles these would be referred to as

the centrioles as a pair near the center
of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.030> cell<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.050> zoom<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
of the cell if we zoom in on the the

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.270 
of the cell if we zoom in on the the
centrioles<00:01:06.300> here's<00:01:06.540> one<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.470> here's

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
centrioles here's one here and here's

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.930 
centrioles here's one here and here's
one<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.710> these<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.940> cylindrical

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
one here and these are cylindrical

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.560 
one here and these are cylindrical
structures<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.760> each<00:01:15.510> of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
structures and you can see that each of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.700 
structures and you can see that each of
these<00:01:15.930> cylindrical<00:01:17.030> centrioles<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.710> oriented

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
these cylindrical centrioles is oriented

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.880 
these cylindrical centrioles is oriented
at<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> right<00:01:20.820> angle<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.260> other<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.800> that

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
at a right angle to the other and that

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
at a right angle to the other and that
is<00:01:23.070> typical<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.820> they're<00:01:24.030> oriented<00:01:24.510> in<00:01:24.630> this

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
is typical that they're oriented in this

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.370 
is typical that they're oriented in this
fashion

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
fashion

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.820 
fashion
these<00:01:25.530> centrioles<00:01:26.160> are<00:01:26.550> made<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
these centrioles are made up of

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.130 
these centrioles are made up of
microtubules<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:30.120> centrioles<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.840> also

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
microtubules and the centrioles is also

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.220 
microtubules and the centrioles is also
the<00:01:31.290> location<00:01:31.950> which<00:01:32.930> organizes<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
the location which organizes and

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.670 
the location which organizes and
produces<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.660> microtubules<00:01:36.660> of<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.110> cell<00:01:37.380> so

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
produces the microtubules of the cell so

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.340 
produces the microtubules of the cell so
it's<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> centrioles<00:01:38.970> are<00:01:39.350> sometimes

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
it's so the centrioles are sometimes

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.080 
it's so the centrioles are sometimes
referred<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.770> together<00:01:41.340> or<00:01:41.700> sometimes

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
referred to together or sometimes

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.790 
referred to together or sometimes
referred<00:01:42.480> to<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.050> microtubule

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
referred to as the microtubule

we'll talk about are Cluj ins which are

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.610 
we'll talk about are Cluj ins which are
