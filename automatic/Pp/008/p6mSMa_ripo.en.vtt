00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
decent if you can get it off but it's

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.770 
decent if you can get it off but it's
it's<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:52.980> okay<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.510> won't<00:00:54.660> get

the same i believe it's unconfirmed that
this<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.910> effect<00:02:09.360> but<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.640> looks<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.849> this

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
this the effect but it looks like this

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.460 
this the effect but it looks like this
is<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.840> effect

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
is going to be the effect

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.470 
is going to be the effect
