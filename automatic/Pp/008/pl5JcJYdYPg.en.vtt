00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.489 

hey<00:00:07.500> guys<00:00:07.710> I'm<00:00:08.250> nice<00:00:08.639> heart<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.419> today<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:10.110> have

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:10.499 
hey guys I'm nice heart and today I have

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.829 
hey guys I'm nice heart and today I have
a<00:00:10.709> very<00:00:10.740> simple<00:00:11.490> way<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.879> detect<00:00:12.269> ma<00:00:12.570> please

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:12.839 
a very simple way to detect ma please

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.289 
a very simple way to detect ma please
and<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.469> used<00:00:13.709> the<00:00:13.919> hitbox<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.579> the<00:00:14.700> iron<00:00:14.940> bars

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
and it used the hitbox of the iron bars

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.380 
and it used the hitbox of the iron bars
so<00:00:16.230> as<00:00:16.530> you<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.800> see<00:00:17.100> right<00:00:17.130> now<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.790> hitbox

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
so as you can see right now the hitbox

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.860 
so as you can see right now the hitbox
is<00:00:18.630> like<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> full<00:00:19.410> block<00:00:20.330> but<00:00:21.330> if<00:00:21.540> you<00:00:21.660> place

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:21.870 
is like a full block but if you place

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.960 
is like a full block but if you place
box<00:00:22.230> next<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> iron<00:00:23.100> bars<00:00:23.460> they<00:00:23.820> will

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
box next to the iron bars they will

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.060 
box next to the iron bars they will
connect<00:00:24.270> to<00:00:24.420> them<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.840> now<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.290> hill<00:00:25.650> box<00:00:25.860> is

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
connect to them and now the hill box is

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.980 
connect to them and now the hill box is
like<00:00:26.370> a<00:00:26.400> full<00:00:26.730> book<00:00:26.910> anymore<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.780> walk

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
like a full book anymore so you can walk

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.520 
like a full book anymore so you can walk
in<00:00:28.200> here<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.270> you're<00:00:30.270> inside<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> iron<00:00:31.170> bars

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.530 
in here and you're inside the iron bars

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.689 
in here and you're inside the iron bars
now<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.070> now<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.610> jump<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.089> and<00:00:34.489> yeah<00:00:35.489> but

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
now so now you can jump up and yeah but

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.430 
now so now you can jump up and yeah but
that's<00:00:35.910> basically<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.480> concept<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:37.199> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
that's basically the concept of the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.669 
that's basically the concept of the
elevator<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.909> still<00:00:39.179> need<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.480> jump<00:00:39.749> but<00:00:40.050> s0

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
elevator you still need to jump but s0

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:43.790 
elevator you still need to jump but s0
it's<00:00:41.429> still<00:00:41.789> faster<00:00:42.390> than<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:43.140> climbing<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
it's still faster than just climbing a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.180 
it's still faster than just climbing a
ladder<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> I'm<00:00:45.809> using<00:00:46.109> a<00:00:46.319> jump<00:00:46.649> boost<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
ladder so I'm using a jump boost to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.059 
ladder so I'm using a jump boost to
beacon<00:00:47.609> for<00:00:47.819> it<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.510> makes<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.679> elevator

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
beacon for it it makes the elevator

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.069 
beacon for it it makes the elevator
faster<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.300> don't<00:00:51.480> have<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.629> beacon

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
faster but if you don't have a beacon

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.149 
faster but if you don't have a beacon
it's<00:00:52.589> not<00:00:52.979> a<00:00:53.039> problem<00:00:54.589> so<00:00:55.589> for<00:00:55.859> this<00:00:55.979> tutorial

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
it's not a problem so for this tutorial

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.579 
it's not a problem so for this tutorial
you<00:00:56.850> would<00:00:57.030> start<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.569> building<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.530> thing

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
you would start with building this thing

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.079 
you would start with building this thing
here<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.999> basically<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:02.010> starting<00:01:02.429> point<00:01:02.699> so

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
here so basically the starting point so

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.149 
here so basically the starting point so
you<00:01:03.120> place<00:01:03.569> a<00:01:03.600> pressure<00:01:04.050> plate<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.650> connected

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
you place a pressure plate and connected

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.310 
you place a pressure plate and connected
to<00:01:05.339> those<00:01:05.489> Pistons<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.630> walk<00:01:06.899> in<00:01:07.110> like

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
to those Pistons so you can walk in like

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.990 
to those Pistons so you can walk in like
this<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:10.320> next<00:01:10.530> step<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.189> basically

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this and the next step is basically

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.670 
this and the next step is basically
booting<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:14.810> so<00:01:15.810> let's<00:01:16.020> say<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.500> an

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
booting up so let's say you want an

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.440 
booting up so let's say you want an
elevator<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.820> head<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:20.210> we're<00:01:21.210> going<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
elevator of this head so we're going to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.600 
elevator of this head so we're going to
space<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.649> pressure<00:01:22.979> plate<00:01:23.219> with<00:01:23.579> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
space out the pressure plate with the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.200 
space out the pressure plate with the
fence<00:01:24.500> everyone<00:01:25.500> walk<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.520> skip<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.030> back

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
fence everyone walk so we skip one back

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.340 
fence everyone walk so we skip one back
here<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.689> go<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:32.509> well<00:01:33.509> actually<00:01:33.719> can't<00:01:34.109> waste

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
here and go up well actually can't waste

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.030 
here and go up well actually can't waste
them<00:01:34.649> right<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.039> top<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.670> each<00:01:36.210> other

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.649 

so<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.280> next<00:01:40.490> step<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:42.310> connect<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
so the next step is to connect the

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.889 
so the next step is to connect the
pressure<00:01:44.659> place<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.200> those<00:01:45.350> Pistons<00:01:46.840> so<00:01:47.840> you

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
pressure place to those Pistons so you

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.859 
pressure place to those Pistons so you
place<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.380> pizza<00:01:48.770> at<00:01:48.950> 46<00:01:49.640> right<00:01:49.850> here<00:01:51.220> torch

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
place a pizza at 46 right here torch

00:01:52.869 --> 00:02:04.330 
place a pizza at 46 right here torch
block<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:55.720> do<00:01:56.720> this<00:01:59.619> three<00:02:00.619> ticks<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:03.340> you're

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
block and do this three ticks and you're

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.820 
block and do this three ticks and you're
done<00:02:04.490> now<00:02:04.939> just<00:02:05.210> repeat<00:02:05.390> for<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.080> rest<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.679> the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
done now just repeat for the rest of the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.089 
done now just repeat for the rest of the
Pistons<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.599> you<00:02:08.599> have<00:02:08.899> your<00:02:09.170> elevator<00:02:09.739> done

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
Pistons and you have your elevator done

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.240 
Pistons and you have your elevator done
all<00:02:10.910> right<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:11.450> i<00:02:11.630> finished<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.380> elevator<00:02:12.830> and

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
all right so i finished the elevator and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.500 
all right so i finished the elevator and
eat<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.750> one<00:02:15.019> without<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.440> beacon<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:17.030> if<00:02:17.390> you

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
eat the one without the beacon so if you

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.509 
eat the one without the beacon so if you
don't<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.959> beacon<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.950> just<00:02:19.250> have<00:02:19.489> to

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
don't have a beacon you just have to

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.360 
don't have a beacon you just have to
place<00:02:20.030> an<00:02:20.239> extra<00:02:20.690> piston<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.290> set<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.220> way<00:02:22.310> to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
place an extra piston and set the way to

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.850 
place an extra piston and set the way to
three<00:02:22.640> chicks<00:02:22.940> if<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:24.019> have<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.260> bit<00:02:24.530> convince

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
three chicks if you have a bit convince

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.100 
three chicks if you have a bit convince
jump<00:02:25.250> booster<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:26.090> just<00:02:26.299> need<00:02:26.450> one<00:02:26.660> Joey<00:02:26.900> and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
jump booster you just need one Joey and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.900 
jump booster you just need one Joey and
one<00:02:27.560> pistol<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.840> yeah<00:02:29.840> let's<00:02:30.080> test<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:30.470> out<00:02:33.910> so

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
one pistol and yeah let's test it out so

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.630 
one pistol and yeah let's test it out so
as<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.450> can<00:02:35.690> see<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.200> also<00:02:36.680> works<00:02:36.890> without<00:02:37.280> the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
as you can see it also works without the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.229 
as you can see it also works without the
beacon<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.209> yep<00:02:39.049> this<00:02:39.349> is<00:02:39.470> basically<00:02:39.769> it
