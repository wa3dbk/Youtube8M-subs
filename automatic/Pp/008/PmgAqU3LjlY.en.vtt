just going to be showing you guys how to

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.250 
just going to be showing you guys how to
play<00:02:02.650> pvp<00:02:03.280> on<00:02:03.520> this<00:02:03.610> map<00:02:03.790> because<00:02:04.180> it's<00:02:05.110> not

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
play pvp on this map because it's not

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.200 
play pvp on this map because it's not
that<00:02:05.440> different<00:02:05.770> from<00:02:06.040> very<00:02:06.370> good<00:02:06.580> pvp<00:02:06.910> but

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
that different from very good pvp but

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.919 
that different from very good pvp but
this<00:02:07.360> map<00:02:07.510> is<00:02:07.540> a<00:02:07.900> very<00:02:08.410> big<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:08.950> does<00:02:09.929> it

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
this map is a very big so it does it

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.680 
this map is a very big so it does it
pretty<00:02:11.200> much<00:02:11.320> like<00:02:12.420> manipulates<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.480> game<00:02:13.630> a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
pretty much like manipulates the game a

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.230 
pretty much like manipulates the game a
little<00:02:13.720> bit<00:02:13.930> because<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:15.550> size<00:02:15.820> of<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.030> map

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
little bit because the size of this map

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.030 
little bit because the size of this map
pretty<00:02:16.510> much<00:02:16.660> tells<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.380> what<00:02:17.560> type<00:02:17.740> of<00:02:17.770> build

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
pretty much tells you what type of build

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.620 
pretty much tells you what type of build
are<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.310> going<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.490> do<00:02:18.550> like<00:02:18.730> Jenny<00:02:19.360> want<00:02:19.570> to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
are you going to do like Jenny want to

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.820 
are you going to do like Jenny want to
do<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.720> build<00:02:19.960> order<00:02:20.200> where<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.440> have<00:02:20.620> map

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
do a build order where you have map

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.530 
do a build order where you have map
control<00:02:21.220> because<00:02:21.490> at<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:21.910> size<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.360> map

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
control because at this size of a map

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.930 
control because at this size of a map
having<00:02:22.900> our<00:02:23.020> control<00:02:23.320> is<00:02:23.470> kind<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.400> keys<00:02:24.640> it's

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
having our control is kind of keys it's

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.460 
having our control is kind of keys it's
not<00:02:25.060> really<00:02:25.270> that<00:02:25.390> important<00:02:25.840> well<00:02:26.170> actually

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
not really that important well actually

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.720 
not really that important well actually
it's<00:02:26.680> pretty<00:02:26.770> important<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.250> not<00:02:27.430> gonna<00:02:27.580> lie

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
it's pretty important to not gonna lie

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.180 
it's pretty important to not gonna lie
because<00:02:28.530> okay<00:02:29.530> right<00:02:29.709> now<00:02:29.800> try<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.010> get<00:02:30.130> this

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
because okay right now try to get this

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.160 
because okay right now try to get this

control<00:02:39.490> it's<00:02:39.730> good<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.150> because<00:02:40.360> and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
control it's good this is because and

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.020 
control it's good this is because and
another<00:02:41.020> key<00:02:41.410> feature<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.770> this<00:02:41.890> map<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.100> your

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
another key feature of this map is your

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.690 
another key feature of this map is your
natural<00:02:43.180> expansion<00:02:43.630> has<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:44.220> relatively<00:02:45.220> wide

natural expansion has a relatively wide

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.080 
natural expansion has a relatively wide
open<00:02:46.330> choke<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:47.140> oh<00:02:48.430> my<00:02:48.670> life<00:02:48.820> my

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
open choke so oh my life my

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.900 
open choke so oh my life my
prototype<00:02:49.630> um<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.830> ever<00:02:51.250> made<00:02:51.520> relatively

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
prototype um you ever made relatively

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.060 
prototype um you ever made relatively
wide<00:02:52.209> open<00:02:52.480> choke<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.959> gate<00:02:53.440> with<00:02:53.650> river

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
wide open choke so to gate with river

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.440 
wide open choke so to gate with river
could<00:02:54.430> be<00:02:54.550> really<00:02:54.760> powerful<00:02:54.880> on<00:02:55.180> this<00:02:55.270> map

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
could be really powerful on this map

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.180 
could be really powerful on this map
which<00:02:55.690> is<00:02:56.260> probably<00:02:56.709> what<00:02:56.920> i'll<00:02:57.040> be<00:02:57.100> doing

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
which is probably what i'll be doing

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.100 
which is probably what i'll be doing
maybe<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.150> little<00:02:58.270> bit<00:02:58.540> something<00:02:58.690> different

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
maybe a little bit something different

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.740 
maybe a little bit something different
depending<00:02:59.410> on<00:02:59.500> what<00:02:59.620> his<00:02:59.739> blur<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.760> i<00:03:01.000> knew

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
depending on what his blur is and i knew

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.420 
depending on what his blur is and i knew
this<00:03:01.900> was<00:03:02.080> coming<00:03:02.410> I'm<00:03:02.739> going<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:02.950> be<00:03:03.040> honest<00:03:03.340> I

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
this was coming I'm going to be honest I

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.890 
this was coming I'm going to be honest I
actually<00:03:03.550> did<00:03:03.850> fully<00:03:04.120> know<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:04.420> was<00:03:04.570> coming

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
actually did fully know this was coming

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.740 
actually did fully know this was coming
but<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.790> really<00:03:06.790> don't<00:03:06.970> know<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.090> just<00:03:07.180> like

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
but I really don't know I just like

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.420 
but I really don't know I just like
sometimes<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.320> just<00:03:08.380> get<00:03:08.590> really<00:03:08.650> lazy<00:03:08.950> and

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
sometimes I just get really lazy and

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.100 
sometimes I just get really lazy and
unless<00:03:10.299> I'm<00:03:10.450> playing<00:03:10.720> in<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.900> really

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110

competitive unless I'm really doing
something<00:03:13.209> competitive<00:03:13.660> generally<00:03:14.350> it's

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
something competitive generally it's

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.530 
something competitive generally it's
just<00:03:14.650> like<00:03:14.799> oh<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:15.970> whatever<00:03:16.120> it's<00:03:16.420> not

just like oh it whatever it's not

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.940 
just like oh it whatever it's not
that<00:03:16.690> important<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.320> then<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.560> let<00:03:17.739> them<00:03:17.860> get

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
that important and then I let them get

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.650 
that important and then I let them get
the<00:03:18.040> minor<00:03:18.220> problem<00:03:18.549> in<00:03:18.700> which<00:03:18.880> not<00:03:19.299> really

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
the minor problem in which not really

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.810 
the minor problem in which not really
good<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:19.989> don't<00:03:20.080> want<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.380> just<00:03:20.650> like<00:03:20.820> already

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
good you don't want to just like already

one<00:04:09.230> probe<00:04:09.440> not<00:04:10.070> really<00:04:10.280> worth<00:04:10.430> it

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
one probe not really worth it

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.370 
one probe not really worth it
considering<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.270> mineral<00:04:11.540> account<00:04:11.750> if<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:11.960> I

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
considering the mineral account if you I

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.400 
considering the mineral account if you I
think<00:04:12.710> about<00:04:12.860> it<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.660> sugar<00:04:14.660> pros<00:04:14.900> mining<00:04:15.290> so

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
think about it and sugar pros mining so

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.570 
think about it and sugar pros mining so
it's<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.590> little<00:04:15.680> more<00:04:15.830> important<00:04:16.220> but<00:04:16.310> now<00:04:16.519> the

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
it's a little more important but now the

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.160 
it's a little more important but now the
thing<00:04:17.030> you<00:04:17.120> want<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.330> do<00:04:17.480> is<00:04:17.630> if<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:18.019> kill

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
thing you want to do is if you kill

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.800 
thing you want to do is if you kill
their<00:04:18.320> first<00:04:18.500> not<00:04:18.910> directly<00:04:19.910> after<00:04:20.570> you<00:04:20.660> call

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
their first not directly after you call

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.090 
their first not directly after you call
their<00:04:20.930> first<00:04:21.080> of<00:04:21.200> all<00:04:21.260> go<00:04:21.440> Preston<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:22.010> way

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
their first of all go Preston the way

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.530 
their first of all go Preston the way
I'm<00:04:22.220> doing<00:04:22.370> right<00:04:22.550> now<00:04:22.640> and<00:04:22.760> if<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.390> pressure

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
I'm doing right now and if you pressure

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.600 
I'm doing right now and if you pressure
them<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.900> way<00:04:23.990> I'm<00:04:24.110> doing<00:04:24.280> well<00:04:25.280> think<00:04:25.460> of<00:04:25.520> it

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
them the way I'm doing well think of it

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.950 
them the way I'm doing well think of it
I<00:04:25.670> have<00:04:25.880> more<00:04:26.060> of<00:04:26.150> an<00:04:26.240> army<00:04:26.450> than<00:04:26.720> he<00:04:26.810> does

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
I have more of an army than he does

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.050 
I have more of an army than he does
because<00:04:27.170> it's<00:04:27.530> literally<00:04:28.190> impossible<00:04:28.430> for

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
because it's literally impossible for

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.670 
because it's literally impossible for
him<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.180> have<00:04:29.360> more<00:04:29.570> units<00:04:29.870> than<00:04:29.930> I<00:04:30.110> well<00:04:30.650> I

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
him to have more units than I well I

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.580 
him to have more units than I well I
guess<00:04:30.920> it<00:04:31.040> is<00:04:31.070> possible<00:04:31.460> but<00:04:32.410> judging<00:04:33.410> by<00:04:33.440> the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
guess it is possible but judging by the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.990 
guess it is possible but judging by the
Builder<00:04:34.010> he's<00:04:34.220> done<00:04:34.430> it's<00:04:34.640> not<00:04:34.790> really

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
Builder he's done it's not really

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.490 
Builder he's done it's not really
possible<00:04:35.030> for<00:04:35.480> him<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:35.690> have<00:04:35.840> more<00:04:36.020> units<00:04:36.410> than

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
possible for him to have more units than

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.410 
possible for him to have more units than
I<00:04:36.680> am<00:04:36.890> then<00:04:37.520> I<00:04:37.610> have<00:04:37.820> because<00:04:38.180> I've<00:04:38.300> already

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
I am then I have because I've already

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.700 
I am then I have because I've already
killed<00:04:38.630> as<00:04:38.840> a<00:04:38.870> lot<00:04:39.050> of<00:04:39.170> his<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:40.390> that<00:04:41.390> ah<00:04:41.710> not

really<00:04:42.770> game<00:04:43.520> decisive<00:04:44.120> but<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:44.930> does<00:04:45.200> let<00:04:45.410> me

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
really game decisive but it does let me

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.710 
really game decisive but it does let me

I'm<00:04:50.090> just<00:04:50.330> pretty<00:04:51.020> much<00:04:51.170> my<00:04:51.290> unit<00:04:51.560> suicide<00:04:51.860> is

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
I'm just pretty much my unit suicide is

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.610 
I'm just pretty much my unit suicide is
based<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.310> see<00:04:52.460> what's<00:04:52.640> going<00:04:52.790> down<00:04:52.970> I

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
based to see what's going down I

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.560 
based to see what's going down I
retreated<00:04:54.620> myself<00:04:55.100> because<00:04:55.490> the<00:04:56.210> way<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:56.360> think

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
retreated myself because the way I think

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.840 
retreated myself because the way I think
of<00:04:56.840> it<00:04:56.990> is<00:04:57.140> whatever<00:04:57.860> pushes<00:04:58.340> down<00:04:58.460> that<00:04:58.640> ramp

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
of it is whatever pushes down that ramp

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.510 
of it is whatever pushes down that ramp
is<00:04:59.060> going<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.300> be<00:04:59.390> slower<00:04:59.630> than<00:04:59.750> my<00:04:59.990> drew<00:05:00.140> guns

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
is going to be slower than my drew guns

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
is going to be slower than my drew guns
well<00:05:01.520> at<00:05:01.610> least<00:05:01.730> I<00:05:01.880> don't<00:05:01.940> think<00:05:02.060> speed<00:05:02.360> tiles

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
well at least I don't think speed tiles

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.640 
well at least I don't think speed tiles
are<00:05:02.690> gonna<00:05:02.780> push<00:05:02.960> down<00:05:03.110> that<00:05:03.230> ramp<00:05:03.380> but

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
are gonna push down that ramp but

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.720 
are gonna push down that ramp but
whatever<00:05:03.950> it<00:05:04.100> is<00:05:04.130> it's<00:05:04.340> gonna<00:05:04.400> be<00:05:04.520> slower<00:05:04.700> than

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
whatever it is it's gonna be slower than

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.340 
whatever it is it's gonna be slower than
my<00:05:04.940> dribbling<00:05:05.090> so<00:05:05.390> I<00:05:05.450> can<00:05:05.630> probably<00:05:05.990> help

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
my dribbling so I can probably help

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.590 
my dribbling so I can probably help
micro<00:05:06.740> whatever<00:05:07.520> pushes<00:05:07.880> down<00:05:07.970> that<00:05:08.180> ramp<00:05:08.360> and

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
micro whatever pushes down that ramp and

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.240 
micro whatever pushes down that ramp and
that'll<00:05:09.169> by<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:09.530> time<00:05:09.680> it<00:05:09.800> gets<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:09.950> my<00:05:10.100> base

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
that'll by the time it gets to my base

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.950 
that'll by the time it gets to my base
hopefully<00:05:10.640> I<00:05:10.669> kill<00:05:10.880> off<00:05:11.000> your<00:05:11.030> unit<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:11.480> if

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
hopefully I kill off your unit and if

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.050 
hopefully I kill off your unit and if
not<00:05:12.200> I<00:05:12.230> damage<00:05:12.620> your<00:05:12.650> unit<00:05:12.950> so<00:05:13.190> small<00:05:13.880> things

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
not I damage your unit so small things

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.250 
not I damage your unit so small things
like<00:05:14.120> that<00:05:14.330> really<00:05:14.390> do<00:05:14.660> help<00:05:14.780> you<00:05:14.930> win<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.110> game

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
like that really do help you win a game

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.700 
like that really do help you win a game
and<00:05:16.870> yeah<00:05:17.870> so<00:05:18.140> right<00:05:18.350> now<00:05:18.410> getting

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
and yeah so right now getting

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.960 
and yeah so right now getting
observatory<00:05:19.190> you<00:05:19.280> know<00:05:19.370> being<00:05:19.550> a<00:05:19.610> little<00:05:19.760> safe

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
observatory you know being a little safe

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.730 
observatory you know being a little safe
build<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:20.540> getting<00:05:21.110> us<00:05:21.230> all<00:05:21.320> to<00:05:21.440> block<00:05:21.620> my

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
build and getting us all to block my

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.290 
build and getting us all to block my
ramp<00:05:21.980> you<00:05:22.430> know<00:05:22.550> everything<00:05:22.880> going<00:05:23.030> pretty

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
ramp you know everything going pretty

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.270 
ramp you know everything going pretty
standard<00:05:23.690> probably<00:05:24.350> gonna<00:05:24.440> go<00:05:24.560> Reavers<00:05:24.890> after

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
standard probably gonna go Reavers after

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.590 
standard probably gonna go Reavers after
this<00:05:25.400> because<00:05:25.700> generally<00:05:26.150> we're<00:05:26.270> both<00:05:26.419> going

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
this because generally we're both going

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.230 
this because generally we're both going
to<00:05:26.660> go<00:05:27.400> robotics<00:05:28.400> facility<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.970> then<00:05:29.090> right

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
to go robotics facility and then right

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.100 
to go robotics facility and then right
after<00:05:29.360> that<00:05:29.480> we're<00:05:29.690> both<00:05:29.780> going<00:05:29.990> to<00:05:30.050> go

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
after that we're both going to go

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.100 
after that we're both going to go
Reavers<00:05:30.410> and<00:05:30.710> now<00:05:31.130> he's<00:05:31.400> got<00:05:31.610> one<00:05:31.880> Dragoon<00:05:32.210> and

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
Reavers and now he's got one Dragoon and

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.230 
Reavers and now he's got one Dragoon and
two<00:05:33.320> thoughts<00:05:33.530> I<00:05:33.860> just<00:05:34.490> so<00:05:34.580> exactly<00:05:34.940> like<00:05:35.180> i

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
two thoughts I just so exactly like i

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.340 
two thoughts I just so exactly like i
was<00:05:35.360> saying<00:05:35.480> i<00:05:35.630> was<00:05:35.750> going<00:05:35.870> to<00:05:35.900> micro<00:05:36.200> like

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
was saying i was going to micro like

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.700 
was saying i was going to micro like
this<00:05:36.590> and<00:05:37.930> Sherry's<00:05:38.930> getting<00:05:39.169> one<00:05:39.290> dragoon<00:05:39.560> it

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
this and Sherry's getting one dragoon it

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.810 
this and Sherry's getting one dragoon it
off<00:05:39.830> me<00:05:39.980> but<00:05:40.160> i'm<00:05:40.220> going<00:05:40.310> to<00:05:40.370> get<00:05:40.520> to<00:05:40.640> Dragoon

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
off me but i'm going to get to Dragoon

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.390 
off me but i'm going to get to Dragoon
so<00:05:41.000> everyone<00:05:41.360> dragunity<00:05:41.630> yes<00:05:42.080> which<00:05:42.470> is<00:05:42.500> well

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
so everyone dragunity yes which is well

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.030 
so everyone dragunity yes which is well
if<00:05:43.580> you<00:05:43.640> do<00:05:43.760> the<00:05:43.850> math<00:05:43.880> it's<00:05:44.180> worth<00:05:44.780> it<00:05:44.960> because

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
if you do the math it's worth it because

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.590 
if you do the math it's worth it because
for<00:05:46.040> every<00:05:46.070> to<00:05:46.310> its<00:05:46.490> i<00:05:46.610> get<00:05:46.820> when<00:05:47.030> he<00:05:47.270> gets<00:05:47.450> one

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
for every to its i get when he gets one

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.239 
for every to its i get when he gets one
hit<00:05:47.780> so<00:05:48.050> you<00:05:48.320> know<00:05:48.440> it's<00:05:48.980> worth<00:05:49.160> it<00:05:49.310> um

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:50.249 
hit so you know it's worth it um

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.269 
hit so you know it's worth it um
and<00:05:50.369> now<00:05:51.409> zealots<00:05:52.409> you<00:05:52.889> know<00:05:53.009> they're<00:05:53.189> going

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:53.279 
and now zealots you know they're going

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
and now zealots you know they're going
to<00:05:53.369> hit<00:05:53.429> you<00:05:53.579> you're<00:05:53.669> not<00:05:53.789> perfectly

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:54.299 
to hit you you're not perfectly

00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:55.989 
to hit you you're not perfectly
eventually<00:05:54.839> is<00:05:54.899> also<00:05:55.139> gonna<00:05:55.259> hit<00:05:55.409> you<00:05:55.559> and

dt is that pretty much changes my whole
builder<00:06:13.619> completely<00:06:14.189> he's<00:06:14.939> going<00:06:15.149> to<00:06:15.239> tease

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
builder completely he's going to tease

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.359 
builder completely he's going to tease
that<00:06:15.659> pretty<00:06:16.049> much<00:06:16.289> means<00:06:16.589> that<00:06:16.889> I'm<00:06:17.069> the<00:06:17.249> one

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:17.369 
that pretty much means that I'm the one

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:18.919 
that pretty much means that I'm the one
that's<00:06:17.489> going<00:06:17.639> to<00:06:17.729> be<00:06:17.819> having<00:06:17.939> map<00:06:18.539> control

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:18.929 
that's going to be having map control

00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:20.149 
that's going to be having map control
just<00:06:19.109> automatically<00:06:19.559> because<00:06:19.829> I<00:06:19.859> got<00:06:20.009> the

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159 
just automatically because I got the

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:21.529 
just automatically because I got the

observer already and he's not gonna have

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.329 
observer already and he's not gonna have
that<00:06:21.569> much<00:06:21.779> army<00:06:22.079> because<00:06:22.349> he<00:06:22.949> invested

00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:23.339 
that much army because he invested

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.059 
that much army because he invested
