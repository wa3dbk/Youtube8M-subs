look at how you did it shopping and
let's<00:02:25.800> see<00:02:25.950> how<00:02:26.160> we<00:02:26.250> did<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.490> earlier<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.850> so

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
let's see how we did it earlier on so

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.340 
let's see how we did it earlier on so
you<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.450> see<00:02:27.480> there<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.780> mean<00:02:27.930> literally<00:02:28.200> this

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
you can see there I mean literally this

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.840 
you can see there I mean literally this
of<00:02:28.500> eight<00:02:28.740> inches<00:02:29.010> coming<00:02:29.400> off<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> bottom

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
of eight inches coming off the bottom

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.880 
of eight inches coming off the bottom
there<00:02:30.240> which<00:02:30.690> makes<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.080> huge<00:02:31.110> huge<00:02:31.590> difference

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
there which makes a huge huge difference

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.100 
there which makes a huge huge difference
so<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.489> as<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.790> say<00:02:33.000> really<00:02:33.480> don't<00:02:33.810> let<00:02:33.959> your

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
so that as I say really don't let your

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.630 
so that as I say really don't let your
hair<00:02:34.230> get<00:02:34.410> too<00:02:34.620> long<00:02:34.860> when<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.250> asked<00:02:35.550> if

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
hair get too long when you asked if

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.370 
hair get too long when you asked if
approaching<00:02:36.209> it's<00:02:36.750> likely<00:02:36.959> makes<00:02:37.140> your<00:02:37.260> face

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
approaching it's likely makes your face

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.810 
approaching it's likely makes your face
that<00:02:37.620> long<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:37.950> does<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.280> makes<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.519> face<00:02:38.700> it

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
that long it does it makes you face it

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.580 
that long it does it makes you face it
long<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.360> pulls<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.959> down<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.560> I

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
face-framing and much more flattering I

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.150 
face-framing and much more flattering I
think<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.260> thing<00:04:42.500> with<00:04:42.620> Leslie's<00:04:42.979> hair

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
think the thing with Leslie's hair

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.610 
think the thing with Leslie's hair
before<00:04:43.280> when<00:04:43.940> you've<00:04:44.090> got<00:04:44.240> curly<00:04:44.510> hair<00:04:44.660> and<00:04:45.229> it

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
before when you've got curly hair and it

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.260 
before when you've got curly hair and it
gets<00:04:45.800> long<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.370> tends<00:04:46.610> to<00:04:46.700> start<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.180> the

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
gets long it tends to start to the

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.270 
gets long it tends to start to the
triangular<00:04:48.020> so<00:04:48.590> I<00:04:48.620> think<00:04:48.800> one<00:04:48.890> of<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.039> key

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
triangular so I think one of the key

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.770 
triangular so I think one of the key
things<00:04:49.640> that's<00:04:50.000> really<00:04:50.270> important<00:04:50.690> with

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
things that's really important with

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.480 
things that's really important with
curly<00:04:51.050> hair<00:04:51.080> is<00:04:51.289> to<00:04:51.410> have<00:04:51.530> layers<00:04:51.800> layers<00:04:52.190> make

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
curly hair is to have layers layers make

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.060 
curly hair is to have layers layers make
hair<00:04:52.760> versatile<00:04:53.720> they<00:04:54.260> make<00:04:54.440> it<00:04:54.560> bouncy<00:04:54.979> they

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
hair versatile they make it bouncy they

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.740 
hair versatile they make it bouncy they
make<00:04:55.220> it<00:04:55.370> soft<00:04:55.700> and<00:04:56.030> they<00:04:56.270> actually<00:04:56.539> give<00:04:56.690> you
