up so I went for the corsets in the week
and<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:07.979> thought<00:01:08.130> well<00:01:08.310> might<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:08.670> well<00:01:08.850> now

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and just thought well might as well now

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
and just thought well might as well now
of<00:01:09.540> course<00:01:09.600> he<00:01:09.840> /<00:01:10.140> led<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> very<00:01:10.500> different<00:01:11.040> life

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
of course he / led a very different life

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.039 
of course he / led a very different life
to<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> Duchess<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.030> Devonshire<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.570> did<00:01:12.960> you

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049

I think that's what was amazing about
the<00:01:16.890> character<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.369> she's<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.180> mean<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:19.020> some

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the character is she's so I mean on some

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.990 
the character is she's so I mean on some
