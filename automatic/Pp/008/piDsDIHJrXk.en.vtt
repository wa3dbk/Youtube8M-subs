eggplants and now it's time to harvest

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.230 
eggplants and now it's time to harvest
I'm<00:00:26.710> very<00:00:26.980> excited<00:00:27.100> because<00:00:27.640> it's<00:00:28.060> been<00:00:28.180> a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
I'm very excited because it's been a

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.210 
I'm very excited because it's been a
cold<00:00:28.480> summer<00:00:28.690> here<00:00:29.140> in<00:00:29.170> Portland<00:00:29.590> but<00:00:30.070> we've

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
cold summer here in Portland but we've

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.180 
cold summer here in Portland but we've
still<00:00:30.310> got<00:00:30.550> a<00:00:30.580> lot<00:00:30.760> of<00:00:30.820> eggplants<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.830> when

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
still got a lot of eggplants so when

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.440 
still got a lot of eggplants so when
you're<00:00:33.340> harvesting<00:00:33.520> eggplants<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.300> never

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
you're harvesting eggplants you never

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.240 
you're harvesting eggplants you never
want<00:00:34.660> to<00:00:34.750> tug<00:00:35.050> them<00:00:35.380> off<00:00:35.559> the<00:00:35.739> plant<00:00:35.980> because

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
want to tug them off the plant because

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.799 
want to tug them off the plant because
they<00:00:36.430> are<00:00:36.610> really<00:00:36.940> attached<00:00:37.270> and<00:00:37.600> you<00:00:37.630> can

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
they are really attached and you can

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.000 
they are really attached and you can
hurt<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:38.199> plant<00:00:38.470> so<00:00:38.650> you<00:00:38.710> want<00:00:38.860> to<00:00:38.920> use

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
hurt the plant so you want to use

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.070 
hurt the plant so you want to use
scissors<00:00:39.220> and<00:00:39.670> you<00:00:40.270> should<00:00:40.420> be<00:00:40.510> careful<00:00:40.750> too

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
scissors and you should be careful too

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.470 
scissors and you should be careful too
because<00:00:41.410> they<00:00:41.530> can<00:00:41.710> have<00:00:41.860> spines<00:00:42.400> up<00:00:42.910> on<00:00:43.120> the

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
because they can have spines up on the

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.720 
because they can have spines up on the
little<00:00:43.629> cap<00:00:44.020> that<00:00:44.350> attaches<00:00:44.830> them<00:00:45.309> to<00:00:45.610> the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
little cap that attaches them to the

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.580 
little cap that attaches them to the
plants<00:00:46.180> so<00:00:46.390> be<00:00:46.629> careful<00:00:46.989> because<00:00:47.170> they<00:00:47.410> are

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
plants so be careful because they are

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.470 
plants so be careful because they are
pretty<00:00:47.769> pokey<00:00:48.280> so<00:00:49.030> I'm<00:00:49.120> just<00:00:49.239> going<00:00:49.360> to<00:00:49.420> go

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
pretty pokey so I'm just going to go

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.540 
pretty pokey so I'm just going to go
ahead<00:00:49.600> and<00:00:49.870> snip<00:00:50.230> off<00:00:50.379> a<00:00:50.440> couple<00:00:50.800> eggplants

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.160 
ahead and snip off a couple eggplants
here<00:00:51.850> because<00:00:52.269> we're<00:00:52.420> going<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.570> be<00:00:52.660> resting

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
here because we're going to be resting

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.100 
here because we're going to be resting
them<00:00:53.290> up<00:00:53.410> a<00:00:53.590> little<00:00:53.620> bit<00:00:53.979> later<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:55.930> just

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
them up a little bit later and I'm just

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.500 
them up a little bit later and I'm just
going<00:00:56.229> to<00:00:56.320> cut<00:00:56.949> them<00:00:57.100> off<00:00:57.309> close<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:58.089> where

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
going to cut them off close to where

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.289 
going to cut them off close to where
they<00:00:58.659> meet<00:00:58.809> up<00:00:58.989> with<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.290> main<00:00:59.470> stem<00:01:00.299> there's

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
they meet up with the main stem there's

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.640 
they meet up with the main stem there's
a<00:01:01.390> couple<00:01:01.600> ways<00:01:01.780> you<00:01:01.930> can<00:01:02.199> tell<00:01:02.379> that<00:01:02.409> an

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
a couple ways you can tell that an

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.979 
a couple ways you can tell that an
eggplant<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:03.280> just<00:01:03.729> perfect<00:01:04.239> that's<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.720> best

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
eggplant is just perfect that's the best

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.780 
eggplant is just perfect that's the best
time<00:01:05.080> to<00:01:05.379> harvest<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:06.280> is<00:01:06.430> a<00:01:06.460> lot<00:01:06.729> of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
time to harvest and that is a lot of

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.399 
time to harvest and that is a lot of
times<00:01:06.970> they're<00:01:07.150> tip<00:01:07.479> will<00:01:07.690> start<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.080> lighten

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
times they're tip will start to lighten

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.620 
times they're tip will start to lighten
up<00:01:08.500> in<00:01:08.680> color<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.220> if<00:01:09.760> you<00:01:09.880> press<00:01:10.120> your<00:01:10.330> thumb

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
up in color and if you press your thumb

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.260 
up in color and if you press your thumb
into<00:01:11.049> the<00:01:11.170> eggplants<00:01:11.740> flesh<00:01:12.040> it<00:01:12.430> should<00:01:12.909> be

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
into the eggplants flesh it should be

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.359 
into the eggplants flesh it should be
able<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.930> go<00:01:14.380> in<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.770> make<00:01:14.890> an<00:01:14.950> indentation

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
able to go in and make an indentation

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.039 
able to go in and make an indentation
but<00:01:15.909> that<00:01:16.060> should<00:01:16.210> also<00:01:16.270> bounced<00:01:16.720> right<00:01:16.990> back

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
but that should also bounced right back

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.980 
but that should also bounced right back
if<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:18.100> indentation<00:01:18.400> stays<00:01:19.150> that's<00:01:19.840> an

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
if the indentation stays that's an

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.510 
if the indentation stays that's an
indication<00:01:20.350> that<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.740> fruit<00:01:20.950> is<00:01:21.070> over<00:01:21.369> ripe

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
indication that the fruit is over ripe

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.550 
indication that the fruit is over ripe
and<00:01:21.760> it's<00:01:22.119> really<00:01:22.390> hard<00:01:22.510> and<00:01:23.260> we<00:01:23.409> probably

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
and it's really hard and we probably

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.320 
and it's really hard and we probably
want<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:23.860> leave<00:01:24.010> it<00:01:24.130> on<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.310> plant<00:01:24.580> for<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.000> few

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
want to leave it on the plant for a few

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.230 
want to leave it on the plant for a few
more<00:01:25.450> days<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:25.869> check<00:01:26.079> on<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.409> again<00:01:27.100> later<00:01:27.460> so

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
more days and check on it again later so

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.029 
more days and check on it again later so
I'm<00:01:28.420> going<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.659> harvest<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.439> few<00:01:29.590> eggplants<00:01:30.009> and

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
I'm going to harvest a few eggplants and

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.020 
I'm going to harvest a few eggplants and
then<00:01:30.189> we're<00:01:30.280> going<00:01:30.369> to<00:01:30.460> go<00:01:30.549> inside<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:30.939> make

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
then we're going to go inside and make

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.800 
then we're going to go inside and make
some<00:01:31.240> baba<00:01:31.390> ghanoush<00:01:32.909> baba<00:01:33.909> ghanoush<00:01:34.270> is<00:01:34.479> a
