00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:21.210
 Hi, I'm going to give you the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.740
 material needed for painting in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.279
 fabric 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.009
 we use the fabric paints in 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.499
 various colors depends on a model that 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.470
 people are going to work usually I already 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:38.190
 I leave a list of the colors that will be 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.449
 used in the work to be done 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.469
 It's very important that we have a 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:50.399
 any package that we 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.329
 It is good to put water to clean the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.879
 brush 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.379
 but I really like these little things that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.679
 have these ribs here these prisoners in the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.670
 background that we can clean the 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:10.500
 brush we go with the water people 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.060
 will tighten it to the two sides in 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.470
 two senses 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.850
 This is going to make cleaning better. 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.400
 of the brush 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.340
 it has other utilities also support 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.980
 the brush here leave waiting but what 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.600
 I like the most in this little piece of art. 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.630
 part here that helps to clear the skies 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:40.620
 we will also use the brushes of 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:46.080
 soft, firm bristles that help 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:49.170
 way of working also a point 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.430
 so that such a brush a cotton cloth 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.490
 An old T-shirt is really good for wearing a 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:01.050
 old cotton cloth that absorb the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.540
 ink and the flags I like to use 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.490
 these little bands of milk can be a fan of 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.310
 styrofoam money 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.920
 there are people who like to use the dish 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.430
 I do not like the deal much anymore 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.600
 I prefer this customer recyclable material 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.540
 back 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:24.810
 We're calling it warm. Seeing it. 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.820
 make our drawing that is a pencil with 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.730
 graphite marcyo we meet at 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.560
 carbon stationeries I like to use this 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.740
 computer carbon the good old people who 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.350
 justin comes together on forms to people 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.000
 in offices or can also 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.190
 people still buy through the area sometimes 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.270
 carbons suitable for drawing in the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.150
 fabric 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.340
 I do not like blue harbor blue 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.310
 leaves stains on the cloth 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.470
 I like this black red yellow 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.630
 but I really prefer the one of computer 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:12.330
 and the board we can not forget 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:15.450
 Also the board right away with the MDF 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.150
 ready glue and the fabric that the 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.310
 people are going to paint 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.690
 these are then the basic materials 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.410
 for us to try the very fabric 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.410
 thank you
