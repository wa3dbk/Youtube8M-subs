00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
right speed card I also looked at the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.139 
right speed card I also looked at the
samsung<00:00:29.630> card<00:00:29.869> but<00:00:30.500> it<00:00:30.649> was<00:00:30.890> it<00:00:31.220> had<00:00:31.430> only<00:00:31.640> 20

let's keep this aside and to the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.899 
let's keep this aside and to the
unpackaging<00:01:20.890> first<00:01:21.890> let's<00:01:22.460> start<00:01:22.579> with<00:01:22.759> the

unpackaging first let's start with the

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.350 
unpackaging first let's start with the
box<00:01:23.200> it<00:01:24.200> mentions<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:24.950> that<00:01:25.219> it<00:01:25.399> has<00:01:25.579> a<00:01:25.610> 400<00:01:26.180> X

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
speed that translates into 60 Mbps of

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.670 
speed that translates into 60 Mbps of
film<00:01:30.229> speed<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.770> 40<00:01:31.189> Mbps<00:01:31.610> of<00:01:31.759> write<00:01:31.939> speed<00:01:32.680> it

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
film speed and 40 Mbps of write speed it

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.980 
film speed and 40 Mbps of write speed it
is<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:33.920> class<00:01:34.159> 10<00:01:34.430> card<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:34.939> they<00:01:35.240> say<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.630> it

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
is a class 10 card and they say that it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.499 
is a class 10 card and they say that it
is<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.140> faster<00:01:36.649> speed<00:01:36.860> that<00:01:37.250> you<00:01:37.369> can<00:01:37.399> have<00:01:37.939> it's

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
is a faster speed that you can have it's

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.230 
is a faster speed that you can have it's
a<00:01:38.600> 32<00:01:38.990> GB<00:01:39.289> it<00:01:39.469> has<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.649> 32<00:01:40.039> GB<00:01:40.280> capacity<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:41.000> can

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
a 32 GB it has a 32 GB capacity it can

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.380 
a 32 GB it has a 32 GB capacity it can
be<00:01:41.420> used<00:01:41.630> with<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.840> camera<00:01:42.320> mobile<00:01:43.189> phone<00:01:43.490> or<00:01:44.329> a

be used with a camera mobile phone or a
gaming<00:01:44.990> console

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
gaming console

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.440 
gaming console
so<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.329> is<00:01:47.450> a<00:01:47.479> UHS<00:01:48.079> in<00:01:48.560> 1<00:01:48.829> compliant<00:01:49.430> card<00:01:49.670> on

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
so it is a UHS in 1 compliant card on

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.469 
so it is a UHS in 1 compliant card on
the<00:01:50.750> sides<00:01:51.100> there<00:01:52.100> is<00:01:52.189> nothing<00:01:52.579> of<00:01:52.700> except<00:01:53.210> the

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
the sides there is nothing of except the

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.319 
the sides there is nothing of except the
branding<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:55.039> top<00:01:55.280> mentions<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:55.969> it<00:01:56.180> is<00:01:56.299> a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
results with the other cards in the same

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.580 
results with the other cards in the same
category<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.860> are<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.670> samsung<00:03:45.060> pro<00:03:45.300> series

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
the sort and 400 X so first we talk

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.490 
the sort and 400 X so first we talk
about<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.340> prices<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.239> prices<00:03:54.480> are<00:03:54.900> from<00:03:55.350> the

expensive car so guys now let's talk
about<00:04:38.130> the

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
about the

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.860 
about the
in<00:04:39.040> technique<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.730> will<00:04:40.300> be<00:04:40.480> using<00:04:40.750> the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
in technique I will be using the

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.490 
in technique I will be using the
software<00:04:41.320> known<00:04:41.560> as<00:04:41.800> pistol<00:04:42.460> magnus<00:04:43.150> 3.0<00:04:44.050> and

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
software known as pistol magnus 3.0 and

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.410 
software known as pistol magnus 3.0 and
the<00:04:45.130> system<00:04:45.460> configuration<00:04:45.640> would<00:04:46.240> be

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
the system configuration would be

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.970 
the system configuration would be
third-generation<00:04:46.960> in<00:04:47.350> there<00:04:47.530> I<00:04:47.680> 5<00:04:47.950> processor

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
third-generation in there I 5 processor

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.690 
third-generation in there I 5 processor
along<00:04:48.880> with<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.300> USB<00:04:50.260> 2.0<00:04:51.160> memory<00:04:51.460> card

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
along with the USB 2.0 memory card

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.180 
along with the USB 2.0 memory card
reader<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:52.600> cards<00:04:53.140> we<00:04:53.320> perform<00:04:53.710> better<00:04:53.890> if

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
reader the cards we perform better if

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.850 
reader the cards we perform better if
used<00:04:54.460> with<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.850> uhs-1<00:04:55.360> compliant<00:04:56.230> memory

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
used with the uhs-1 compliant memory

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.330 
used with the uhs-1 compliant memory
card<00:04:57.450> so<00:04:58.450> now<00:04:58.690> let's<00:04:59.050> happen<00:04:59.530> with<00:05:00.250> the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
card so now let's happen with the

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.990 
card so now let's happen with the
reconnaissance<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:02.020> first<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:03.580> slowest

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
reconnaissance the first the slowest

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.630 
reconnaissance the first the slowest
card<00:05:04.270> where<00:05:04.900> is<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.590> SanDisk<00:05:05.980> Ultra<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.520> the

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
card where is the SanDisk Ultra and the

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.190 
card where is the SanDisk Ultra and the
results<00:05:07.000> will<00:05:07.090> be<00:05:07.150> showing<00:05:07.420> right<00:05:07.720> over<00:05:07.990> here

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
results will be showing right over here

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.450 
results will be showing right over here
as<00:05:08.530> you<00:05:09.220> can<00:05:09.400> have<00:05:09.580> a<00:05:09.610> look<00:05:09.820> it<00:05:10.720> is<00:05:11.020> around<00:05:11.770> 20

be showing right here and it's good and
amazing<00:05:32.100> 29<00:05:33.100> Mbps<00:05:33.730> running<00:05:34.450> speed<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:35.020> when

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
amazing 29 Mbps running speed and when

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.210 
amazing 29 Mbps running speed and when
before<00:05:36.670> Mbps<00:05:37.120> right<00:05:37.570> speed<00:05:37.920> and<00:05:38.920> that's

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
before Mbps right speed and that's

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.960 
before Mbps right speed and that's
amazing<00:05:39.880> card<00:05:40.260> so<00:05:41.260> comparing<00:05:42.130> their<00:05:42.490> cards

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
amazing card so comparing their cards

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.140 
amazing card so comparing their cards
along<00:05:43.690> with<00:05:43.750> their<00:05:44.050> prices<00:05:44.530> I<00:05:44.740> would<00:05:45.370> say<00:05:45.580> the

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
along with their prices I would say the
