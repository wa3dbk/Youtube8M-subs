00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.899
 hey people you look at spooky 6 delf 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.480
 and today a curtailment and new 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.259
 curtailment and we are going a golden one 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.000
 open package we think others 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.029
 have found a rare golden play 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.770
 this is what we have a chance of twice 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.740
 team or who attack here are known 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.500
 but we don't find a team of the here 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.500
 year player landreau is the best 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.310
 everything goes in the club and then we have 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.310
 another chance 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.980
 well these are all double 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.790
 holy shit net landreau why are you crazy 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.940
 on 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.860
 i just sell you for that if 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.710
 starting price 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.510
 so you can double me and me who would 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.770
 you all just the otherwise costs 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.420
 it really way too much time that i didn't 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.070
 have got 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.230
 and we can do it again 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.180
 and we now have the best chance on the team 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.329
 or do I do player's 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.600
 and that may be that it is in you 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.180
 have a lot of players here and i don't have one 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.689
 the feeling no because ilo 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.700
 that was him though have no no team 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.680
 records empty of the in this herein 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.630
 all the players 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.630
 unfortunately peanut butter is genius in that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.430
 save the club and those others who 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.290
 we just mercury cells because they have the will 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.820
 its must make another we sell 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.890
 we have that package new available 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.380
 do have the premium gold 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.290
 Djumbo and we have three chances of it so we 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.150
 go very large packages 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.630
 unpack and who knows there may be something 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.990
 something nice something new 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.970
 i didn't see what it was i see it now 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.970
 well 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.960
 Alex was all nice and nice 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.700
 alex value also have relatively little value 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.729
 in addition, all also have double and 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.619
 a new ball that I'm pretty cool 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.200
 but I don't use it as new but 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.180
 keep that ff in the club for the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.319
 I have something else left so I usually walk 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.079
 save those suits and 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.560
 yes for the rest those contracts i already have 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:17.840
 so many contracts and contract cards 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.249
 do that for me or not we will do it 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.109
 another try 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:23.359
 We are going to legal premium djumbo now 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:25.159
 I get a lot of curtailment 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.139
 for you that I actually still have to 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.870
 upload 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:32.329
 we really have nothing in it but I want you 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.639
 still show that 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.109
 well then we have our good friend here 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:41.510
 kean 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:46.189
 yakin makes kony happy 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.439
 Marconi quite happy and Benteke 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.510
 is happy for you you are worth something 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:56.180
 yes we will automatically see how much decision 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.730
 are and for the rest I find it fun 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.620
 and so the other harmony goes that man 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.329
 all had parqui again 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.359
 that's how fast we do it and we go immediately 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:10.060
 continue with the next word then 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.060
 what does that become or what that becomes? 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:17.659
 gsus kms that is also nothing 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:21.739
 j you even have double over 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:26.870
 bboying true foster 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.090
 three plus 30 condition is nice and that 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.799
 plus team training is also nice only yes 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.769
 it is full so I use my normal 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.060
 on a player you also always fit fun and 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.169
 then the match found he claimed 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.169
 again super super super 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.009
 and still have balls that I 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:46.389
 never often 9 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.389
 you never get much of those soccer balls 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.129
 and the rest all have double and 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.170
 sell quickly then we go to the 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.159
 next one 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.159
 I am now what that is 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.379
 but yes the stream at every place curious 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:09.189
 adebayor yes nice striker 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.439
 but also do not benefit much from adebayor 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:16.120

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:17.650
