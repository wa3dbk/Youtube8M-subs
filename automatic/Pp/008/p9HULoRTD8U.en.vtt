all the way through it's going to be in
standard<00:00:53.730> tuning<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:55.140> most<00:00:55.320> part<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.620> I

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
standard tuning and the most part like I

standard tuning and the most part like I
said<00:00:55.980> we're<00:00:56.129> using<00:00:56.159> power<00:00:56.579> course<00:00:56.970> but<00:00:57.210> at<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
said we're using power course but at the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.670 
said we're using power course but at the

octaves which is basically let's say our

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.180 
octaves which is basically let's say our
first<00:01:03.840> octave<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:04.470> we're<00:01:04.559> gonna<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.979> is

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
you basically do that four times in a

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.920 
you basically do that four times in a
row<00:04:23.100> now<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.730> other<00:04:24.000> part<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.389> comes<00:04:24.630> in

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
row now the other part that comes in

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:36.050 
row now the other part that comes in
after<00:04:27.590> after<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.650> few<00:04:28.800> bars<00:04:29.010> is<00:04:29.639> this<00:04:29.880> bar<00:04:35.060> and

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
after after a few bars is this bar and

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.610 
after after a few bars is this bar and
you<00:04:36.150> repeat<00:04:36.419> that<00:04:36.600> over<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:36.930> over<00:04:37.020> again<00:04:37.169> and

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
you repeat that over and over again and

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.990 
you repeat that over and over again and
that<00:04:37.740> actually<00:04:38.100> keeps<00:04:38.310> going<00:04:38.669> during<00:04:38.970> the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
that actually keeps going during the
