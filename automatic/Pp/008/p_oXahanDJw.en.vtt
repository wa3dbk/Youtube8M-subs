00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:24.079
 very proudly or to present today 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:29.090
 diamond of his abilities 14 which is the 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:33.550
 seventh evolution of the first frame that 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:38.269
 we built carbon in 1989 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:44.000
 this is a good body built in 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:48.199
 total absence of aluminum parts for 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.390
 which all the chassis components are 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:57.140
 in carbon from the movement box that 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.369
 integrated monocoque between the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.390
 inserts of his third that are also 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:07.960
 those inserted in their bursts 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:16.960
 this means less weight but with 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:21.460
 performance of a unique minor excellence 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.220
 this weight means this one frame 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.750
 15 gram reduction 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.830
 in the steering part is 25 grams 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:37.450
 this in the movement box 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:40.300
 means for us to use the same 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.140
 formula machine technology 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.190
 they open with regards to this 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.670
 evolution 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:53.410
 this new frame is 0.4 mm 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:59.170
 reflection in the communist shoe in the 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:02.770
 steering tube for 0.6 mm retaliation for 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.479
 which great weight reduction that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.840
 great performance 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:15.310
 the frame as a whole is a measure 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:16.950
 average weighs 850 grams and the 360 fork 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.520
 degrees 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.490
 It uses the best materials sisal 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.730
 of catona of the best heirs that 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:30.430
 I would like to 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:33.340
 the GraubÃ¼nden never one of the aspects anymore 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.790
 important in the planning of the 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.950
 diamond was to see it 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:47.430
 maximum to do this we have 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:50.920
 developed a frontal monobloc that 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.860
 it is completely integrated with the 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.170
 fork and we have redesigned it 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.470
 the stem of the handlebar that is part 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.020
 integral to the entire front 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.750
 of the bicycle 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.920
 this system has allowed us to have 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.040
 rigidity and excellent precision 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.040
 of driving 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.870
 another important aspect is the possibility 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:25.360
 to have a comfort kit that is new 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:30.610
 absolute for the bicycle sector 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:34.050
 racing and this gives the possibility to 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:41.550
 cyclist to find the exact location 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:45.510
 in the saddle 2014 diamond is not alone 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:49.450
 mileage guide responsiveness but it is also 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:53.980
 a dynamic and above all project 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:57.940
 aesthetic project that are themes a 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:04.230
 we dear as an athlete down 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:08.010
 this is the new 2014 diamond story 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.010
 beauty performance
