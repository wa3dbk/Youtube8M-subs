 I miss finding the girls here 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:43.589

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.149
 Well, he started to like it because 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.010
 I was accompanying my cousin to practice 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.320
 so when I saw him, he called me 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.839
 attention and therefore as it is a sport that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.670
 is characterized for men when they see 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:01:00.350

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:26.490

 they do not stop some secret identity 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.770
