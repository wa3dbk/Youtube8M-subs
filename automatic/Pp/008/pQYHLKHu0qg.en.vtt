 I really liked it 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.130
 at the time when it was not yet to be 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.739
 long standing time was still 1200 1200 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.709
 enrolled so I could see that it was low 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.690
 but she had plenty of 25 she liked 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.630
 even if you do not need to stay 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.780

 You want me to come back to a lot of 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.049
 people 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.790
 2 days ago there they asked me in the random 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.970
 because I could not know anything and I 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.160
 I was thinking I was going to bring my 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.170
 but it will decide of you why not 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.900
 had tried showing it had feedback 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.299
 low understood then it will depend on the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.420
 definition is common sense they want us to 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.790

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.859

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.440
 challenge a very very extreme challenge 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.900
