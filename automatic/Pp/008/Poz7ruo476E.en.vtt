script<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.890> will<00:01:47.040> get<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.850> option<00:01:48.270> of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
script and we will get the option of

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.630 
script and we will get the option of
assigning<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.899> data<00:01:49.140> ref<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.549> will

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
assigning a data ref to it and that will

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.090 
assigning a data ref to it and that will
determine<00:01:50.939> what<00:01:51.180> function<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.960> explain<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
determine what function in explain the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.370 
determine what function in explain the
movement<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.880> handle<00:01:54.299> will<00:01:54.630> depend<00:01:55.020> upon

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
movement of this handle will depend upon

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.370 
movement of this handle will depend upon
okay<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.219> what<00:01:57.030> we're<00:01:57.149> looking<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.899> gear

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
okay so what we're looking for is gear

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.240 
okay so what we're looking for is gear
retract

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
retract

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.639 
retract
so<00:01:59.610> let's<00:01:59.759> go<00:01:59.939> here<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:01.020> now<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.530> go

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
so let's go here for now I'm going to go

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.350 
so let's go here for now I'm going to go
by<00:02:01.770> memory<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.549> where<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.149> find

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
by memory and see where if I can find

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.840 
by memory and see where if I can find
the<00:02:03.689> actuator<00:02:04.439> for<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.070> landing<00:02:05.430> gear<00:02:05.610> so

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the actuator for the landing gear so

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.839 
the actuator for the landing gear so
let's<00:02:06.000> go<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.180> aircraft<00:02:06.360> oh<00:02:07.190> look<00:02:08.190> here's<00:02:08.459> gear

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
let's go to aircraft oh look here's gear

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.660 
let's go to aircraft oh look here's gear
and<00:02:09.349> then<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.560> CF<00:02:11.069> gear<00:02:11.810> retracted

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
and then a CF gear retracted

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.030 
and then a CF gear retracted
it<00:02:13.849> is<00:02:14.080> basically<00:02:15.080> what<00:02:15.349> this<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:15.560> telling<00:02:15.860> me

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
it is basically what this is telling me

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.670 
it is basically what this is telling me
is<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.550> when<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.360> handle<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.349> position

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
is that when this handle is in position

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.309 
is that when this handle is in position
of<00:02:18.950> frame<00:02:19.250> number<00:02:19.520> one<00:02:19.780> then<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.810> want<00:02:21.170> this

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
of frame number one then I want this

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.800 
of frame number one then I want this
data<00:02:21.590> ref<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.190> be<00:02:22.310> equal<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.819> zero<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.390> when

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
data ref to be equal to zero and when

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.990 
data ref to be equal to zero and when
the<00:02:23.959> same<00:02:24.200> lever<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.709> in<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.040> position<00:02:25.880> of

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
the same lever is in the position of

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.880 
the same lever is in the position of
frame<00:02:26.300> number<00:02:26.569> two<00:02:26.840> then<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.319> want<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.620> data

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
frame number two then I want this data

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.210 
frame number two then I want this data
ref<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.370> be<00:02:28.459> equal<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.910> one<00:02:29.230> now<00:02:30.230> this<00:02:31.010> is

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
ref to be equal to one now this is

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.220 
ref to be equal to one now this is
assuming<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:31.970> know<00:02:32.150> what<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.450> values<00:02:32.750> for<00:02:33.020> 0

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
assuming you know what the values for 0

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.010 
assuming you know what the values for 0
&amp;<00:02:33.440> 1<00:02:33.470> are<00:02:33.890> now<00:02:34.400> I'm<00:02:34.610> thinking<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.780> probably

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
&amp; 1 are now I'm thinking that probably

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.040 
&amp; 1 are now I'm thinking that probably
the<00:02:36.800> value<00:02:37.100> for<00:02:37.340> 0<00:02:37.610> is<00:02:37.819> going<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.060> be<00:02:38.120> gear

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
the value for 0 is going to be gear

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.229 
the value for 0 is going to be gear
extended<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.220> value<00:02:40.489> for<00:02:40.670> 1<00:02:40.850> is<00:02:41.030> going<00:02:41.180> to

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
extended and the value for 1 is going to

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.180 
extended and the value for 1 is going to
be<00:02:41.300> gear<00:02:41.660> attracted<00:02:42.260> if<00:02:42.380> not<00:02:42.769> it's<00:02:43.010> going<00:02:43.130> to

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
be gear attracted if not it's going to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.160 
be gear attracted if not it's going to
be<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.459> opposite<00:02:43.880> way<00:02:44.030> around<00:02:44.170> sometimes

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
be the opposite way around sometimes

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.390 
be the opposite way around sometimes
you're<00:02:45.290> going<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.440> have<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.709> explore<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.160> little

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
you're going to have to explore a little

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.490 
you're going to have to explore a little
bit<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:46.730> experiment<00:02:47.420> with<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.319> is

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
bit and experiment with it and this is

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.110 
bit and experiment with it and this is
probably<00:02:48.920> what's<00:02:49.160> going<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.310> be<00:02:49.430> most<00:02:49.790> time

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
probably what's going to be most time

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.120 
probably what's going to be most time
consuming<00:02:50.150> about<00:02:51.019> making<00:02:51.470> these<00:02:51.560> animations

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
consuming about making these animations

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.759 
consuming about making these animations
in<00:02:52.310> blender<00:02:52.730> but<00:02:53.299> let's<00:02:53.480> say<00:02:53.720> now<00:02:53.989> that<00:02:54.230> this

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
in blender but let's say now that this

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.710 
in blender but let's say now that this
is<00:02:54.950> what<00:02:55.130> we<00:02:55.250> want<00:02:55.459> we<00:02:55.730> can<00:02:56.120> always<00:02:56.360> just<00:02:56.540> try

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
is what we want we can always just try

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.449 
is what we want we can always just try
it<00:02:56.810> out<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.019> see<00:02:57.110> what<00:02:57.290> happens<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:57.799> let's<00:02:58.190> hit

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
it out and see what happens so let's hit

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.960 
it out and see what happens so let's hit
apply<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:59.290> now<00:03:00.340> since<00:03:01.340> we're<00:03:01.459> in<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.640> scripts

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
apply and now since we're in the scripts

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.759 
apply and now since we're in the scripts
window<00:03:02.120> we<00:03:02.360> also<00:03:02.540> have<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.900> option<00:03:03.110> of<00:03:03.470> using

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
window we also have the option of using

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.650 
window we also have the option of using
the<00:03:04.130> export<00:03:04.549> script<00:03:04.910> from<00:03:05.299> this<00:03:05.450> particular

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
the export script from this particular

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.199 
the export script from this particular
location<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:06.799> after<00:03:07.670> I've<00:03:07.760> saved<00:03:08.000> this

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209

location so after I've saved this
blender<00:03:08.930> file<00:03:09.140> I'm<00:03:09.350> going<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.590> export<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.959> open

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
blender file I'm going to export it open

up X plane switch to 3d cockpit view and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.470 
up X plane switch to 3d cockpit view and
look<00:03:14.989> there<00:03:15.290> we<00:03:15.410> have<00:03:15.650> our<00:03:15.920> lever<00:03:16.700> or<00:03:17.060> landing

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
look there we have our lever or landing

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.930 
look there we have our lever or landing
gear<00:03:17.660> left<00:03:17.840> so<00:03:18.709> what<00:03:18.890> we<00:03:19.010> can<00:03:19.160> see<00:03:19.459> from<00:03:19.730> this

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
gear left so what we can see from this

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.840 
gear left so what we can see from this
is<00:03:20.209> that<00:03:20.420> in<00:03:20.870> fact<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.709> texture<00:03:22.220> is<00:03:22.370> working

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
is that in fact the texture is working

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.720 
is that in fact the texture is working
and<00:03:23.120> most<00:03:24.109> likely<00:03:24.680> if<00:03:24.859> we<00:03:24.980> were<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.280> compare<00:03:25.459> it

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
and most likely if we were to compare it

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.000 
and most likely if we were to compare it
to<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.880> 2d<00:03:26.329> cockpit<00:03:26.930> we<00:03:27.380> would<00:03:27.500> in<00:03:27.620> fact<00:03:27.829> see

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
to the 2d cockpit we would in fact see

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.160 
to the 2d cockpit we would in fact see
that<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.489> landing<00:03:28.820> gear<00:03:29.060> is<00:03:29.209> being<00:03:29.540> retracted

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
that the landing gear is being retracted

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.710 
that the landing gear is being retracted
we<00:03:30.320> can<00:03:30.500> test<00:03:30.739> this<00:03:30.920> theory<00:03:31.220> by<00:03:32.000> accelerating

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
we can test this theory by accelerating

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.449 
we can test this theory by accelerating
and<00:03:32.900> getting<00:03:33.410> up<00:03:33.530> into<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.769> air<00:03:33.980> because<00:03:34.340> I

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
and getting up into the air because I

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.789 
and getting up into the air because I
think<00:03:34.519> that<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.940> plane<00:03:35.150> only<00:03:35.359> allows<00:03:35.750> for

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
think that the plane only allows for

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.590 
think that the plane only allows for

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
retracts once it's in the air so let's

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.120 
retracts once it's in the air so let's

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
to see if that works yes it does work we

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.720 
to see if that works yes it does work we

textured<00:03:53.390> in<00:03:53.480> such<00:03:53.720> a<00:03:53.750> way<00:03:53.989> that<00:03:54.230> clicking<00:03:54.980> on

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
textured in such a way that clicking on

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.849 
textured in such a way that clicking on
it<00:03:55.310> will<00:03:55.459> perform<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.299> desired<00:03:56.450> function<00:03:57.200> now

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
it will perform the desired function now

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.599 
it will perform the desired function now
the<00:03:58.400> gear<00:03:58.670> retracted<00:04:00.100> properly<00:04:01.100> so<00:04:01.400> this

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
the gear retracted properly so this

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.220 
the gear retracted properly so this
could<00:04:01.790> be<00:04:01.819> due<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.120> a<00:04:02.299> number<00:04:02.390> of<00:04:02.750> factors

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
could be due to a number of factors

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.259 
could be due to a number of factors
including<00:04:03.290> that<00:04:04.040> we<00:04:04.130> chose<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.519> wrong<00:04:04.910> data

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
including that we chose the wrong data

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.050 
including that we chose the wrong data
ref<00:04:05.600> for<00:04:05.840> this<00:04:06.260> particular<00:04:06.799> animation<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:07.970> we

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
ref for this particular animation so we

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.430 
ref for this particular animation so we
have<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.299> kind<00:04:08.480> of<00:04:08.600> go<00:04:08.720> back<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.170> drawing

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
have to kind of go back to the drawing

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.680 
have to kind of go back to the drawing
board<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:09.799> try<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:10.459> find<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.880> right<00:04:11.090> data<00:04:11.389> ref

board and try to find the right data ref

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.240 
board and try to find the right data ref
that<00:04:11.900> will<00:04:12.049> actually<00:04:12.440> end<00:04:12.590> up<00:04:12.680> moving<00:04:12.920> this

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
that will actually end up moving this

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.640 
that will actually end up moving this
letter<00:04:13.579> so<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:14.239> see<00:04:14.450> it's<00:04:14.810> kind<00:04:14.959> of<00:04:15.049> a<00:04:15.170> complex

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
letter so you see it's kind of a complex

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.159 
letter so you see it's kind of a complex
matter<00:04:16.039> to<00:04:16.729> get<00:04:16.910> all<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.209> cockpit<00:04:17.660> objects<00:04:18.049> to

matter to get all the cockpit objects to

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.319 
matter to get all the cockpit objects to
perform<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.769> way<00:04:18.889> you<00:04:18.919> want<00:04:19.280> them<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.489> so

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
perform the way you want them to so

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.390 
perform the way you want them to so
let's<00:04:20.510> go<00:04:20.630> back<00:04:20.660> to<00:04:20.810> blender<00:04:21.260> and<00:04:21.470> let's<00:04:22.280> go

back to the script go to object
excellent<00:04:26.140> animation<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:27.070> let's<00:04:27.820> see<00:04:27.970> if<00:04:28.000> we

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
excellent animation and let's see if we

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.680 
excellent animation and let's see if we
can<00:04:28.330> find<00:04:28.510> something<00:04:28.840> under<00:04:29.350> cockpit<00:04:30.010> and

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
can find something under cockpit and

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.890 
can find something under cockpit and

I<00:04:31.930> found<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.590> candidate<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:33.250> looks<00:04:33.670> actually

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
I found a candidate that looks actually

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.360 
I found a candidate that looks actually
very<00:04:34.240> promising<00:04:34.900> it's<00:04:35.260> called<00:04:35.500> gear<00:04:35.950> handle

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
very promising it's called gear handle

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.300 
very promising it's called gear handle
stats<00:04:36.760> let's<00:04:37.600> try<00:04:37.840> that<00:04:38.080> one<00:04:38.350> and<00:04:38.530> let's<00:04:39.250> just

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
stats let's try that one and let's just

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.600 
stats let's try that one and let's just
apply<00:04:39.760> it<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:40.680> save<00:04:41.680> an<00:04:41.860> exponent<00:04:44.310> go<00:04:45.310> back<00:04:45.460> to

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
apply it and save an exponent go back to

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.540 
apply it and save an exponent go back to
x-play<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.120> load<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.330> up<00:04:46.420> again<00:04:47.310> I'm<00:04:48.310> really

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
x-play and load it up again I'm really

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.310 
x-play and load it up again I'm really
curious<00:04:48.730> not<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.180> see<00:04:49.360> whether<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.810> handle

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
curious not to see whether the handle

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.580 
curious not to see whether the handle
will<00:04:50.440> move<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.910> yes<00:04:51.910> it<00:04:52.180> does<00:04:52.450> move<00:04:52.750> it<00:04:53.350> moves

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
will move and yes it does move it moves

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.710 
will move and yes it does move it moves
opposite<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.340> what<00:04:54.490> we<00:04:54.610> wanted<00:04:54.940> to<00:04:55.090> but<00:04:55.630> at

opposite of what we wanted to but at
least<00:04:55.840> we<00:04:56.080> see<00:04:56.320> that<00:04:56.470> it<00:04:56.620> moves<00:04:56.860> to<00:04:57.550> fix<00:04:57.790> the

least we see that it moves to fix the
opposite<00:04:58.510> thing<00:04:58.750> notice<00:04:59.080> that<00:04:59.350> if<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.710> handle

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.310 
opposite thing notice that if the handle
is<00:05:00.040> up<00:05:00.250> here<00:05:00.610> you<00:05:01.030> see<00:05:01.240> it's<00:05:01.360> down<00:05:01.750> in<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:01.960> 2d

it's up in the 2d cockpit but we can fix
that<00:05:06.730> let's<00:05:07.540> go<00:05:07.660> back<00:05:07.780> to<00:05:07.900> blender<00:05:08.230> and<00:05:09.000> we<00:05:10.000> can

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
that let's go back to blender and we can

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.330 
that let's go back to blender and we can
fix<00:05:10.300> it<00:05:10.480> in<00:05:10.600> one<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:10.810> two<00:05:11.170> ways<00:05:11.200> either<00:05:11.650> we

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
fix it in one of two ways either we

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.120 
fix it in one of two ways either we
inverse<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.150> animation<00:05:13.780> here<00:05:14.020> so<00:05:14.650> we<00:05:14.830> assign

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
inverse the animation here so we assign

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.310 
inverse the animation here so we assign

frame<00:05:17.590> 1<00:05:17.830> and<00:05:18.010> then<00:05:18.520> we<00:05:19.180> hit<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.870> i<00:05:19.900> key<00:05:20.380> to

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
frame 1 and then we hit the i key to

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.340 
frame 1 and then we hit the i key to
insert<00:05:21.070> a<00:05:21.250> rotational<00:05:21.970> keyframe<00:05:22.720> and<00:05:23.200> then<00:05:23.290> we

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
insert a rotational keyframe and then we

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.490 
insert a rotational keyframe and then we
go<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.530> curve<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:23.950> go<00:05:24.550> down<00:05:24.760> by<00:05:25.480> 60<00:05:25.870> degrees<00:05:25.900> and

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
go to curve to go down by 60 degrees and

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.070 
go to curve to go down by 60 degrees and
insert<00:05:26.800> another<00:05:27.010> keyframe<00:05:27.870> that's<00:05:28.870> one

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
insert another keyframe that's one

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.730 
insert another keyframe that's one
option<00:05:29.560> or<00:05:30.510> we<00:05:31.510> select<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.110> object<00:05:32.500> again

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740

we edit this script we say instead of

we edit this script we say instead of

frame 1 corresponding to 0 and frame to
correspond<00:05:41.770> to<00:05:41.950> 1<00:05:42.250> we<00:05:43.030> want<00:05:43.270> it<00:05:43.330> to<00:05:43.450> be<00:05:43.540> the

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
correspond to 1 we want it to be the

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.370 
correspond to 1 we want it to be the
other<00:05:43.780> way<00:05:43.990> around

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
other way around

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.860 
other way around
we<00:05:44.710> can<00:05:44.860> have<00:05:45.070> frame<00:05:45.460> 1<00:05:45.669> correspond<00:05:46.240> to<00:05:46.300> 1<00:05:46.600> and

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
we can have frame 1 correspond to 1 and

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.650 
we can have frame 1 correspond to 1 and
3<00:05:47.500> to<00:05:47.740> corresponds<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.400> 0<00:05:48.700> but<00:05:49.270> now<00:05:49.390> that<00:05:49.570> I've

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
3 to corresponds to 0 but now that I've

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.240 
3 to corresponds to 0 but now that I've
already<00:05:49.900> done<00:05:50.050> it<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.260> other<00:05:50.410> way<00:05:50.590> that<00:05:51.130> would

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
already done it the other way that would

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.620 
already done it the other way that would
be<00:05:51.280> a<00:05:51.400> redundant<00:05:51.820> thing<00:05:51.940> to<00:05:52.090> do<00:05:52.240> so<00:05:52.450> I'm<00:05:52.510> gonna

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
be a redundant thing to do so I'm gonna

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.570 
be a redundant thing to do so I'm gonna
go<00:05:52.750> ahead<00:05:52.810> and<00:05:52.900> cancel<00:05:53.200> that<00:05:53.530> again<00:05:54.400> let's

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
go ahead and cancel that again let's

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.130 
go ahead and cancel that again let's
save<00:05:54.790> this<00:05:55.020> export<00:05:56.020> it<00:05:57.419> reload<00:05:58.419> the<00:05:58.540> plane<00:05:58.810> go

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
save this export it reload the plane go

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.020 
save this export it reload the plane go

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
to a 3d cockpit mode and here we already

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.060 
to a 3d cockpit mode and here we already
see<00:06:01.360> something<00:06:01.690> promising<00:06:02.169> we<00:06:02.650> see<00:06:02.800> that<00:06:02.950> the

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
see something promising we see that the

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.370 
see something promising we see that the
gear<00:06:03.310> lever<00:06:03.700> is<00:06:03.790> down<00:06:04.240> whereas<00:06:04.630> in<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:04.930> 2d

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
gear lever is down whereas in the 2d

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.200 
gear lever is down whereas in the 2d
carpet<00:06:05.740> it<00:06:05.830> was<00:06:05.950> also<00:06:06.220> down<00:06:06.400> now<00:06:06.910> it<00:06:07.060> would

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
carpet it was also down now it would

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.570 
carpet it was also down now it would
click<00:06:07.480> on<00:06:07.630> it<00:06:07.750> it<00:06:07.870> goes<00:06:07.990> hot<00:06:08.290> all<00:06:08.800> right<00:06:09.220> now

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
click on it it goes hot all right now

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.570 
click on it it goes hot all right now
notice<00:06:10.060> also<00:06:10.330> the<00:06:11.140> animated<00:06:11.710> texture<00:06:12.370> that<00:06:12.490> we

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
notice also the animated texture that we

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.940 
notice also the animated texture that we
have<00:06:12.760> on<00:06:13.030> here<00:06:13.330> this<00:06:14.080> is<00:06:14.350> something<00:06:14.590> that<00:06:14.740> we

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
have on here this is something that we

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.800 
have on here this is something that we
can<00:06:15.130> tweak<00:06:15.460> in<00:06:15.700> Photoshop<00:06:16.270> just<00:06:16.570> the<00:06:16.690> way<00:06:16.780> I

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
can tweak in Photoshop just the way I

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.990 
can tweak in Photoshop just the way I
showed<00:06:17.140> you<00:06:17.169> how<00:06:17.470> we<00:06:17.500> tweaked<00:06:17.919> this<00:06:18.580> one<00:06:18.790> here

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
showed you how we tweaked this one here

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.060 
showed you how we tweaked this one here
in<00:06:19.120> Photoshop<00:06:19.300> and<00:06:19.840> we<00:06:20.500> can<00:06:20.650> use<00:06:20.830> different

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
in Photoshop and we can use different

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.220 
in Photoshop and we can use different
texturing<00:06:21.669> techniques<00:06:22.120> to<00:06:22.690> actually<00:06:23.050> make

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
texturing techniques to actually make

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.990 
texturing techniques to actually make
this<00:06:23.410> look<00:06:23.890> cool<00:06:24.310> like<00:06:24.340> we<00:06:24.640> could<00:06:24.790> for<00:06:24.970> example

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
this look cool like we could for example

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.330 
this look cool like we could for example
use<00:06:25.540> the<00:06:25.570> animated<00:06:26.260> textures<00:06:26.770> and<00:06:26.950> take

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
use the animated textures and take

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.950 
use the animated textures and take
advantage<00:06:27.550> of<00:06:27.850> the<00:06:28.000> fact<00:06:28.150> that<00:06:28.300> it<00:06:28.450> has<00:06:28.630> two

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
advantage of the fact that it has two

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.409 
advantage of the fact that it has two
animation<00:06:29.530> detents<00:06:30.220> to<00:06:30.730> program<00:06:31.150> something

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
animation detents to program something

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.750 
animation detents to program something
like<00:06:31.690> shading<00:06:32.169> into<00:06:32.350> it<00:06:32.650> so<00:06:32.919> the<00:06:33.250> lever<00:06:33.460> in<00:06:33.610> its

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
like shading into it so the lever in its

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.310 
like shading into it so the lever in its
up<00:06:33.910> position<00:06:34.390> will<00:06:34.510> have<00:06:34.660> a<00:06:34.690> different<00:06:35.080> shade

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
up position will have a different shade

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.080 
up position will have a different shade
then<00:06:35.950> if<00:06:36.070> it's<00:06:36.220> in<00:06:36.340> it<00:06:36.430> in<00:06:36.580> the<00:06:36.669> down<00:06:36.850> position

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
then if it's in it in the down position

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.790 
then if it's in it in the down position
to<00:06:37.840> reflect<00:06:38.200> sort<00:06:38.380> of<00:06:38.500> the<00:06:38.560> lighting

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
to reflect sort of the lighting

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.330 
to reflect sort of the lighting
conditions

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
conditions

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.920 
conditions
inside<00:06:39.639> the<00:06:39.760> cockpit<00:06:40.210> we<00:06:40.300> could<00:06:40.449> do<00:06:40.540> all<00:06:40.660> sorts

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
inside the cockpit we could do all sorts

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.230 
inside the cockpit we could do all sorts
of<00:06:41.020> stuff<00:06:41.260> okay<00:06:41.740> I<00:06:42.130> hope<00:06:42.340> this<00:06:42.430> was<00:06:42.730> clear<00:06:43.060> and

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
of stuff okay I hope this was clear and

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.270 
of stuff okay I hope this was clear and
interesting<00:06:43.480> enough<00:06:43.870> to<00:06:44.020> follow<00:06:44.199> along<00:06:44.500> now

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
interesting enough to follow along now

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.530 
interesting enough to follow along now
that<00:06:45.460> you<00:06:45.520> know<00:06:45.610> how<00:06:45.730> to<00:06:45.760> do<00:06:46.000> this

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
that you know how to do this

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.300 
that you know how to do this
the<00:06:46.840> sky's<00:06:47.110> the<00:06:47.139> limit<00:06:47.350> in<00:06:47.680> terms<00:06:47.710> of<00:06:48.100> what<00:06:48.220> you

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
the sky's the limit in terms of what you

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.010 
the sky's the limit in terms of what you
could<00:06:48.460> animate<00:06:48.790> inside<00:06:49.240> the<00:06:49.389> cockpit<00:06:49.600> so

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
could animate inside the cockpit so

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.780 
could animate inside the cockpit so
