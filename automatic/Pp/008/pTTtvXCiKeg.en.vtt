 [music] 

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:00.990
 [applause] 

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.629
 [music] 

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.629
 [applause] 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.070
 Hello everyone, welcome you to 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.740
 weather gamer channel in this video we 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.500
 review the shooter operations 7 and its 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.810
 autumn update 2012 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.779
 and I will do it a taxi and 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.460
 unique papas if anyone does not know what 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.410
 This is a game who will begin, perhaps, with 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.939
 description and primary 7 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.570
 multiplayer shooter from the first 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.130
 faces 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.110
 so fight to join 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.259
 mindless blockheads and the most real 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.120
 players from different parts of our country 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.980
 for example it is not necessary to go far brighter 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.469
 representatives of this genre counter-strike 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.660
 by the way with counter strike m the game is not related 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.059
 only gameplay but some cards 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.460
 particular you can find similar version 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.859
 famous cards etc. dos but the dynamics 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.320
 more like call of duty 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.879
 but do not think that 7 is primary 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.429
 mindless copy of the famous shooter 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.480
 guys from korean companies m game 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.969
 tried to glory 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.039
 have seen the new mode at the moment 6 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.440
 own maps and a number of features 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.199
 like customization of weapons and equipment 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.850
 character but the most important thing in the game is not 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.579
 this stupid division into bad ones 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.259
 good guys on the one hand is a minus 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.909
 so so lost at least some idea 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.860
 on the plot but don't have to wait 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.930
 opportunity to join your favorite team 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.390
 just take from the first minute we rush in 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.009
 the fact that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.920
 despite the release date of the game 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.540
 And this 2007 year developers continue 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.969
 give the project maximum attention 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.280
 update release at least once 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.320
 season 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.060
 words about the September 18 update on 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.340
 Russian game server has been installed 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.560
 the first is all not updates which 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.920
 brought a new card called fox 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.950
 Nora 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.009
 I do not know about you, but I personally have an atmosphere 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.500
 reminded stalker except rare bushes 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.500
 trenches and a pair of destroyed buildings on 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.810
 territory of little girls there 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.869
 I warn you immediately heels 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.420
 better not wear i climbed into the trenches 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.909
 half an hour could not get kabuki something 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.450
 fail but thanks to the developers 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.429
 we have a new suit not from exactly 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.340
 this suit is applied by priors throughout 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.410
 world well and for those who can't 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.480
 parting with cleavage developers species 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.000
 touched the court and yet I think 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.770
 girls agree with me open 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.020
 crawling across the field is uncomfortable 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.750
 and it is necessary to crawl because new 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.170
 the location on the one is actually calculated 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.740
 do we have trenches field but rare 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.080
 bushes 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.120
 so you have to shoot back lying 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.860
 sitting moving bellied 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.910
 just to get to the enemy position 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.580
 come off for a spoiled manicure that 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.710
 touches the weapon in my opinion and moved 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.690
 with him will give odds to many shooter besides 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.390
 simple weapons purchase here and there 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.070
 all sorts of things, dryuchki for them but how 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.870
 known technique in the hands of a woman is 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.900
 a pile of metal so it's better about that 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.820
 tell papas because i also 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.580
 what's not to like here is this little red one 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.390
 this sight is very arnica you nothing 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.150
 I can not say but the mind in arms this time 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.220
 became a submachine gun k1 and developed 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.530
 in south korea in the early 80s 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.360
 true in the 90s the coordinates of steel 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.130
 qualify as a shortened assault 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.290
 rifle and put into service in 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.300
 Senegal Indonesia and of course the most 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.670
 South Korea's author, he turned out pretty 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.980
 convenient powerful of a good sight and 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.660
 although he will find competitors to his neighbors 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.190
 well ranged but use it 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.870
 as a kind of universal option for 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.370
 different combat conditions can and should be 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.260
 secondary weapon replenished with a pistol 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.870
 with a rich history m to 23 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.060
 late 80s command of forces 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.250
 special operations us announced a tender 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.570
 to create offensive personal 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.459
 melee weapons but only in 1996 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.500
 year was released a small party 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.980
 pistols received official 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.900
 designation m to 23 gun not only 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.140
 which is convenient so also give odds days 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.970
 which main weapon and so we 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.400
