00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.090
 a new disaster let's see the bear 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.130
 pink is worth the pink tennis the truth that 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.260
 has a very handsome design hidden 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.510
 Now I'll see it, ok, let's teach 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.550
 a little the location is worth we are in 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.019
 old city you are seeing in the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.439
 more or less location where we would be 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.460
 it's worth it to focus jce we're here 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.040
 in the corner this is the nursery 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.510
 I'm here with balconies let's do what 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.340
 let's record it to upload them noval is 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.500
 the main thing we will come here to the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.610
 door we will open the door would need to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.260
 all the players that I am in the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.149
 session that will enter 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.420
 as in this case we have to enter the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.850
 two if we would not leave old city and 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.670
 good and once inside we go to the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.050
 front doors is very fast very 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.070
 simple we come here running to the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.829
 pink bear 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.369
 let's wait for actions and simply 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.369
 you should give it to activate the lip is worth 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.080
 you have to give him I have not counted them very well 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.050
 about 1 11 12 times ok let's go giving it 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.040
 until it runs out of batteries is 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.040
 practically that 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.730
 the lip 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.440
 follow with pillar 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.090
 and we keep pressing him 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.910
 this is like the most chic chorus in the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.620
 box fits him several times with 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.400
 what 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.370
 today it's already late so much the boyfriend says 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.660
 no longer answers me hate 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.660
 red eye red eye 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.289
 to take for good ass as you have seen 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.479
 He has burst and we have given I not 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.729
 counted about 11 or 12 times and here we 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.119
 would leave a design to the design is stasis 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.789
 project pro text file we take it and 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.880
 let's see what should be needed 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.610
 to be able to create it let's find it worth it 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.250
 here he tells me that it takes 20 mushrooms 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.670
 fluorescent and one of alcohol is worth 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.440
 I'm past with what I'm going to create and 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.850
 we will use it 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.500
 I'm going to create it 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.970
 you do not have space left for the inventory 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.180
 ok let's eliminate something in the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.069
 Inventory 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.999
 excalibur 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.999
 super katana 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.920
 design 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.310
 completely 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.120
 this filter tel 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.120
 we create 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.159
 Well, let's try it, let's go 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.849
 go out and let's look for a horde of 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.359
 zombies 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:56.299
 good and pretty to throw it and see the 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:58.939
 it makes good effect and after 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.439
 we have searched for an area where the truth 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.299
 that there are enough zombies we are going to try 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.639
 here for you to see is worth what 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.480
 they commented I have doubled it 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:10.760
 I had four unexplained I have 186 vale 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.500
 as I said it needed 20 zetas in 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.169
 one of which once you what 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.909
 have already it 's a matter of duplicating it and 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.189
 has all the cathedrals going to 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.230
 try it the first thing I have the hook 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.930
 equipped we are going to equip us 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.400
 you are faithful protector and once you 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.500
 we have equipped you are watching the zombies 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.770
 over there and well here we are going to throw a 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.180
 so you can see 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.920
 we watched the zombies go and bust 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.340
 so on 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.340
 I would die in the air 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.800
 it's not a 100% more thing to air worth 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.820
 goes by area goes by part now you are 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.820
 watching how he bursts them 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.280
 as he would already be dead is there in the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.600
 air because it would be dead ok I would not live 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.750
 you looking at grenade 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.160
