00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
twist this term on and I want this to
stand<00:01:40.380> straight<00:01:40.740> out<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.810> I'm<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.909> twist

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
stand straight out so I'm going to twist

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.399 
stand straight out so I'm going to twist
it<00:01:45.060> real<00:01:45.299> good<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:45.810> nice<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.020> tight<00:01:46.350> on

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
there and then let's add oh let's this

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:07.499 
there and then let's add oh let's this
is<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> little<00:01:56.820> flower<00:01:57.530> like<00:01:58.530> bead<00:01:58.890> cap

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:14.950 

and<00:02:08.509> another<00:02:09.080> flower<00:02:09.410> bead<00:02:09.800> cap<00:02:13.660> make<00:02:14.660> another

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
and another flower bead cap make another

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.570 
and another flower bead cap make another
loop

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.030 

twist

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
twist

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.369 
twist
so<00:02:23.640> now<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:23.849> have<00:02:24.239> one<00:02:24.510> two<00:02:24.629> three<00:02:24.659> four<00:02:24.870> loops

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
so now I have one two three four loops

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:32.000 
so now I have one two three four loops
I'm<00:02:25.680> going<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.890> cut<00:02:26.129> this<00:02:26.310> one<00:02:26.370> off<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:31.010> then

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
I'm going to cut this one off and then

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.410 
I'm going to cut this one off and then
now<00:02:32.280> what<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.579> can<00:02:32.730> do<00:02:32.819> with<00:02:32.939> your<00:02:33.030> loops<00:02:33.269> is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
now what you can do with your loops is

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.729 
now what you can do with your loops is
you<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:33.689> add<00:02:33.900> things<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.560> them<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:35.489> can<00:02:35.760> add

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
you can add things to them you can add

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.479

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.680 
flowers so I'm going to put a leaf right
here<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:56.760> twist<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:59.239> and<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.390> course

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
here and just twist it on and of course

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.910 
here and just twist it on and of course
on<00:03:00.870> those<00:03:01.109> loops<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.799> added<00:03:02.190> seashells<00:03:02.730> because

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
on those loops I added seashells because

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.710 
on those loops I added seashells because
the<00:03:04.920> theme<00:03:05.159> for<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.489> Lindy<00:03:05.730> stamping<00:03:06.209> contest

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
the theme for the Lindy stamping contest

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:34.320 
the theme for the Lindy stamping contest
is<00:03:06.900> under<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.290> sea<00:03:08.959> so<00:03:09.959> there's<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.260> leaf<00:03:10.500> there

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.780 

and<00:03:35.330> now<00:03:35.660> I<00:03:36.080> can<00:03:36.920> add<00:03:37.069> just<00:03:37.280> these<00:03:37.520> little

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
and now I can add just these little

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:46.080 
and now I can add just these little
flowers<00:03:38.360> these<00:03:38.599> little<00:03:38.930> Daisy<00:03:39.200> flowers<00:03:44.890> and

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
flowers these little Daisy flowers and

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.500 
flowers these little Daisy flowers and
you<00:03:47.090> can<00:03:47.239> add<00:03:47.420> like<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.830> couple<00:03:49.300> let's<00:03:50.300> do<00:03:50.480> a

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
you can add like a couple let's do a

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.390 
you can add like a couple let's do a
little<00:03:50.750> mini<00:03:51.050> bunch<00:03:53.260> just<00:03:54.260> like<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.830> those

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
little mini bunch just like that those

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:06.230 
little mini bunch just like that those
three<00:03:55.670> together<00:03:55.819> twist<00:03:56.660> it

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.930 

and<00:04:06.530> you<00:04:07.530> can<00:04:07.680> hot<00:04:07.920> glue<00:04:07.950> this<00:04:08.370> on<00:04:08.550> or<00:04:08.880> just

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
and you can hot glue this on or just

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.500 
and you can hot glue this on or just
whap<00:04:10.250> whap<00:04:11.540> whap<00:04:12.540> them<00:04:14.180> wrap<00:04:15.180> your<00:04:15.480> wire

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
whap whap whap them wrap your wire

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.000 
whap whap whap them wrap your wire
around<00:04:17.270> and<00:04:18.270> of<00:04:19.050> course<00:04:19.290> it's<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.620> leaf<00:04:19.800> is

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
around and of course it's the leaf is

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.620 
around and of course it's the leaf is
pink<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.550> flowers<00:04:20.910> are<00:04:21.060> pink<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.420> would

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
pink and the flowers are pink I would

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.900 
pink and the flowers are pink I would
probably<00:04:21.870> use<00:04:22.170> my<00:04:22.590> Lindy's<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.190> color<00:04:23.430> them<00:04:23.730> up

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
probably use my Lindy's to color them up

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:40.439 
probably use my Lindy's to color them up
one<00:04:24.420> or<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.660> other

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:49.140 

you<00:04:41.050> can<00:04:42.840> take<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:43.870> butterfly<00:04:45.569> that<00:04:46.569> uh<00:04:48.150> and

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
you can take a butterfly that uh and

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.629 
you can take a butterfly that uh and
then<00:04:49.330> because<00:04:49.689> this<00:04:49.870> is<00:04:50.050> wire<00:04:50.319> you<00:04:50.650> can<00:04:50.860> bend

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
then because this is wire you can bend

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:58.980 
then because this is wire you can bend
it<00:04:51.789> and<00:04:51.909> move<00:04:52.089> it<00:04:52.240> any<00:04:52.360> way<00:04:52.539> you<00:04:52.569> want<00:04:57.749> and<00:04:58.749> of

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
it and move it any way you want and of

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.230 
it and move it any way you want and of
course<00:04:59.229> this<00:04:59.409> isn't<00:04:59.589> gonna<00:04:59.830> be<00:04:59.979> a<00:05:00.129> very<00:05:00.400> pretty

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
course this isn't gonna be a very pretty

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.489 
course this isn't gonna be a very pretty
spray<00:05:01.839> because<00:05:02.110> I'm<00:05:02.439> showing<00:05:02.680> you<00:05:02.830> a<00:05:04.499> few

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:05.499 
spray because I'm showing you a few

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:07.230 
spray because I'm showing you a few
different<00:05:05.680> things<00:05:05.979> you<00:05:06.189> can<00:05:06.339> do<00:05:06.520> with<00:05:06.729> it<00:05:06.939> and

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
different things you can do with it and

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.679 
different things you can do with it and
so<00:05:08.729> I'm<00:05:09.729> not<00:05:09.849> gonna<00:05:09.999> use<00:05:10.210> this<00:05:10.300> on<00:05:10.479> a<00:05:10.509> project

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
so I'm not gonna use this on a project

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:12.420 
so I'm not gonna use this on a project
or<00:05:11.050> anything<00:05:11.259> but<00:05:11.529> I'm<00:05:11.650> not<00:05:11.740> wasting<00:05:12.219> anything

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
or anything but I'm not wasting anything

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.439 
or anything but I'm not wasting anything
because<00:05:13.089> I<00:05:13.360> can<00:05:13.930> pop<00:05:14.110> this<00:05:14.319> back<00:05:14.589> off<00:05:15.089> and<00:05:16.089> all

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
because I can pop this back off and all

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.100 
because I can pop this back off and all
this<00:05:16.599> stuff<00:05:16.839> I<00:05:16.960> can<00:05:17.110> just<00:05:17.289> cut<00:05:17.439> the<00:05:17.560> wires<00:05:19.110> so

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
this stuff I can just cut the wires so

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.969 
this stuff I can just cut the wires so
let's<00:05:20.740> see<00:05:21.189> what<00:05:21.789> would<00:05:22.060> go<00:05:22.810> here<00:05:23.319> maybe<00:05:23.830> a

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
let's see what would go here maybe a

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:35.279 
let's see what would go here maybe a
button<00:05:25.710> or<00:05:26.849> a<00:05:28.800> big<00:05:29.800> round<00:05:30.039> Bleen<00:05:32.249> and<00:05:34.080> then<00:05:35.080> you

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
button or a big round Bleen and then you

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.119 
button or a big round Bleen and then you
can<00:05:35.529> if<00:05:35.949> you<00:05:36.189> want<00:05:36.399> it<00:05:36.550> bigger<00:05:36.729> and<00:05:36.939> thicker

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 
can if you want it bigger and thicker

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:47.010 
can if you want it bigger and thicker
you<00:05:39.129> can<00:05:39.159> just<00:05:39.580> take<00:05:40.469> your<00:05:41.469> wire<00:05:42.249> and<00:05:45.839> you<00:05:46.839> can

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
you can just take your wire and you can

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.399 
you can just take your wire and you can
start<00:05:47.259> making<00:05:47.560> OH<00:05:47.949> not<00:05:48.399> the<00:05:48.460> fire<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:50.229> make

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
start making OH not the fire to make

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:57.559 
start making OH not the fire to make
some<00:05:50.770> bead<00:05:51.490> candy<00:05:53.159> take<00:05:54.159> some<00:05:54.370> 28<00:05:54.879> gauge<00:05:55.180> wire

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:57.569 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.249 

and<00:05:58.949> if<00:05:59.949> you've<00:06:00.069> seen<00:06:00.099> my<00:06:00.399> tutorial<00:06:01.110> if<00:06:02.110> you

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
and if you've seen my tutorial if you

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:03.809 
and if you've seen my tutorial if you
haven't<00:06:02.620> seen<00:06:02.770> it<00:06:02.889> go<00:06:03.009> take<00:06:03.279> a<00:06:03.310> look<00:06:03.520> at<00:06:03.610> that

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:03.819 
haven't seen it go take a look at that

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:11.189 
haven't seen it go take a look at that
so<00:06:04.810> for<00:06:04.959> your<00:06:05.050> bead<00:06:05.229> can<00:06:05.499> you<00:06:05.680> just<00:06:09.930> this<00:06:10.930> is<00:06:11.169> a

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
so for your bead can you just this is a

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:16.320 
so for your bead can you just this is a
very<00:06:11.830> thin<00:06:12.249> wire<00:06:12.430> so<00:06:12.789> very<00:06:13.389> easy<00:06:13.810> to<00:06:14.939> twist<00:06:15.939> and

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
very thin wire so very easy to twist and

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.019 
very thin wire so very easy to twist and
turn<00:06:16.629> and<00:06:16.930> because<00:06:17.709> this<00:06:17.949> leaf<00:06:18.279> you<00:06:18.909> know

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:19.029 
turn and because this leaf you know

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:20.459 
turn and because this leaf you know
isn't<00:06:19.180> going<00:06:19.360> to<00:06:19.479> sit<00:06:19.719> right<00:06:19.749> I<00:06:19.959> would<00:06:20.259> hot

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.469 
isn't going to sit right I would hot

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.019 
isn't going to sit right I would hot
glue<00:06:20.680> this<00:06:20.860> in<00:06:21.069> the<00:06:21.159> position<00:06:21.580> I<00:06:21.669> would<00:06:21.819> want

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:22.029 
glue this in the position I would want

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:26.790 
glue this in the position I would want
it<00:06:22.209> and<00:06:22.749> then<00:06:23.610> add<00:06:24.610> something<00:06:25.389> else<00:06:25.810> let's<00:06:26.529> see

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
it and then add something else let's see

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.050 
it and then add something else let's see
a<00:06:27.279> little<00:06:27.819> pearl

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.939 

and<00:06:34.060> then<00:06:34.660> wherever<00:06:34.960> you<00:06:35.080> want<00:06:35.259> that<00:06:35.440> to<00:06:35.590> sit

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
and then wherever you want that to sit

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:53.570 
and then wherever you want that to sit
twist<00:06:38.949> your<00:06:39.160> pearl<00:06:39.430> and<00:06:39.850> the<00:06:40.030> wire

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:06.830 

Christel

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.230 

then<00:07:07.410> you<00:07:07.560> would<00:07:07.680> just<00:07:07.830> continue<00:07:07.980> all<00:07:08.550> the<00:07:09.090> way

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 
then you would just continue all the way
