00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.379
 cordial greeting how are we doing what 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.570
 to be working with the new wii the 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:15.059
 10.240 that possible candidate to be rtm o 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.680
 final version of windows 10 not nothing 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.259
 I hope everything goes perfect 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.150
 everything is working correctly that 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.800
 do not have any kind of problem and in 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.119
 this video is related to what I 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.130
 I told them in the previous video that 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.749
 it was a walk through this preliminary in this 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.980
 case I told them if they had any 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:32.310
 problem with the activation that to me 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.760
 had happened how to do to activate the 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.290
 windows 10 easy and simple in this case 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.030
 this video related to that topic but 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.220
 before starting I will make a 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.830
 small rectification a small 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.480
 clarification in the case of in this video 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.880
 I commented that he had disappeared 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.220
 application test wing or in task view 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.540
 we see that it has not disappeared 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.360
 just the rush to want to do 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.070
 a video of this preliminary I made the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.230
 error that in the taskbar 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.270
 we give him right mouse button had 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.740
 unchecked show task view button 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 so that's why I did not go out, I did not think 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.000
 I came and I mentioned it through a 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.770
 user who realized that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.770
 I had said as you see here 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.790
 white told me the tesvino has 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.170
 disappeared and now quickly you 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.910
 I commented hello a proper greeting thank you 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.190
 for clarification had unchecked the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.500
 option to show task views apart 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.680
 in this video I also put a note for 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.050
 what 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.640
 see that it has not disappeared noble and I 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.680
 I simply told them that by pressing 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.260
 windows symbol the tabulator appeared 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.630
 the test win good simply because 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.620
 I wanted to clarify that otherwise I know that I 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.240
 I'm going to roll up I know there are a lot of people 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.250
 which says that my videos hurt a lot 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.420
 but I want to make it very clear some 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.820
 user also tells me if this 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.470
 version is the final well then I do not 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.700
 I will pronounce on the subject one thing 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.440
 I do not know I can not say yes it is 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.600
 the final version and that it is not 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.580
 so in this case I 'm not going to 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.140
 comment on yes or no 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.910
 many pages that mention 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.860
 this topic and also good I have taken a 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.540
 randomly from pc word since they inform 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.640
 that you must inform that the wheel version 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.770
 10,240 of windows 10 will be the one 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.259
 microsoft sends to pc manufacturers 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.500
 and submit for official release 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.500
 on July 29 they also commented that 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.750
 will continue to send through windows 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.280
 update updates to correct 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.950
 possible errors that have been in 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.390
 will I want to tell you that yes 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.130
 I know the mistakes I think it's not 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.720
 there is my personal opinion that is not 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.850
 prepared for its final approach 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.400
 better I'm wrong and yes it is but 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.959
 good in my case I have several errors 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.640
 that many of you also 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.400
 they will have there are people who have mistakes 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.470
 depending on the equipment in this case 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.079
 Well, I wanted to clarify these two 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.400
 issues not said which for now if 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.600
 we start with the video that if I do not go 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.190
 to roll up 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.440
 The first thing I'm going to do is open 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.150
 cortana and I'm going to write that just like 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.250
 in the previous video win 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.470
 see in the application above but 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.320
 let's run to see 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.570
 about windows windows 10 version 10.0 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.590
 compilation 10,240 well this had already 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.360
 done in the other video but if someone 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.440
 I had not seen the previous video 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.700
 good to see it now no 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.110
 in the video script I'm going to 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.790
 leave everything related to the subject 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.020
 to activate the viewing in the event that 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.250
 have the problem if they do not have that 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.740
 problem then he has nothing to do 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.390
 everything perfect that is the best thing that 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.310
 It would have to be everything perfect 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.280
 well in this case in the exception of 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.110
 video will have all the information 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.570
 let's copy the first button command 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.920
 of the right mouse and we copied but before 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.570
 we need to open the command prompt 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.830
 cmd we will go to the search for 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.540
 cortana we wrote cmd and in symbol 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.370
 system the top button mouse button 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.420
 right execute as administrator for 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.730
 so it works 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.140
 he will ask us for permission we give him yes and 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.370
 new open the system symbol a 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.170
 Once we have opened the symbol of the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.300
 right mouse button system what we have 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.070
 copied and we will give you intro 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.650
 will not open a new window where 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.390
 will inform us about our windows 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.150
 in this case the name of windows inter 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.980
 prediction key description of 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.520
 partial products state license 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.050
 with license with license sorry 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.580
 expiration of activation days and 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.790
 everything else we do not accept 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.560
 all right if we did not have it 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.840
 activated I would not put it as well 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.070
 second I'm going to do this do not have 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.390
 what do you do? 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.040
 because what I'm going to do is remove my 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.320
 serial to see that yes you can 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.420
 activate without any problem not everything 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.060
 I'm going to copy the second command what 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.530
 he selected right mouse and we copied him 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.180
 I'm going to give 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.730
 I throw a right mouse in the sign of the 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.410
 system and paste we will give intro 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.850
 this what I'm going to do is remove my 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.169
 serial of the team I'm going to eliminate the 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.270
 serial will open a window where it says 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.280
 that the product key was installed 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.450
 correctly well once we have 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.010
 done this I'm going to do it myself 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.130
 personally to see that it works 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.530
 perfectly now I will see if it is 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.160
 activated the windows or is not active we 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.990
 we will go 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.790
 to the activity center we will not go to 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.060
 all the configurations we give a click 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.820
 we are going to go to 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.010
 the option of updating and 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.750
 security we give you a click and we're going to 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.150
 go to the activation option we are going to 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.520
 click on it and we see that windows do not 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.320
 is activated, it activates good 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.389
 change product key well we see 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.220
 that I no longer have the windows activated 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.840
 now yes now what they do have 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.210
 what you do is the following what 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.440
 first we need the serial and a 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.480
 description of the video in the case that 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.930
 they need to tell me about it and I'll leave you 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.550
 serial that corresponds in this case my 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.280
 version is the interpreter I need serial 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.780
 interprise will copy here what 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.240
 we have to do is copy this command 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.440
 followed with the key space of 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.510
 Our product we select 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.560
 we select right mouse button and 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:41.030
 we copy open the command prompt 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.460
 right mouse button we paste 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.280
 will open a new window where 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.230
 it tells us that it has been copied correctly 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.290
 the serial or the correct installation was 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.240
 Product key we give in accept 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.890
 next step you know what is growing 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.980
 the video will have it selected 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.140
 second command we copy we're going 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.910
 new symbol of the system for a whole 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.450
 right mouse 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.450
 we give him 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.400
 the key management service 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:13.420
 was established correctly 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.460
 kms xs spachs point yn we give in 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.350
 accept and now to finish we copy 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.200
 the last command we select the button 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:24.000
 right mouse we copy and paste symbol 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.000
 of system again we give 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.600
 we will wait for him to open us again 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.600
 window 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.800
 it no longer tells us that activated 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.450
 windows is reinterpreted edition on 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.860
 product was properly activated it 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.050
 let's accept it right ok we have 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.200
 our product given our windows 10 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.350
 again activated to check from 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.320
 new we return to activity center 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:53.500
 all configurations 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.980
 update and security click we go 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.170
 to activation and if there is no problem 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.210
 windows is activated windows 10 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.890
 interprise we see that there is no 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.000
 problem that is easy and simple what 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.280
 only that depending on the version that 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.190
 you have need then the cable 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.140
 the corresponding key in the case of 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:14.200
 that they do not have or that does not work 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.460
 any of the ones you can find 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.340
 simply because we would have to wait 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.140
 to microsoft to release the iso with its 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.390
 corresponding key to be able 

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.980
 activate the no in this case you see that it is 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.450
 easy and simple for nothing decided to do 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.510

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.980
 great help good friends just 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.410
 with nothing that they continue commenting that has 

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:35.590
 similar if they agree with what 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.510
 issue of whether to leave and is will 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.830
 is already the definitive one if it is not if they know 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.120
 some information that I do not have then 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.370
 also that they comment it because always 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.200
 we can all help each other, not because 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.400
 nothing more friends until the next one a 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.400
 cordial greeting chau
