here<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.350> 12<00:03:27.680> glass<00:03:28.130> transparent<00:03:28.549> I<00:03:29.470> simply

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
here is a 12 glass transparent I simply

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.319 
here is a 12 glass transparent I simply
find<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.860> correct<00:03:31.160> material<00:03:31.700> on<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.000> model

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
find the correct material on the model

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.630 
find the correct material on the model
then<00:03:32.600> adjust<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.110> opacity<00:03:33.250> this<00:03:34.250> will<00:03:34.430> only

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
then adjust the opacity this will only

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.000 
then adjust the opacity this will only
change<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.329> opacity<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.019> glass<00:03:36.260> not<00:03:36.829> the

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
change the opacity of the glass not the

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.160 
change the opacity of the glass not the
entire<00:03:37.130> model<00:03:37.519> now<00:03:38.390> let's<00:03:38.630> add<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.870> white

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
entire model now let's add a white

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.289 
entire model now let's add a white
background<00:03:39.380> in<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:40.040> drop<00:03:40.280> shadow<00:03:40.549> and<00:03:40.700> I'm<00:03:40.970> done

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.660 
background in a drop shadow and I'm done
looks<00:03:42.049> pretty<00:03:42.320> good<00:03:42.620> for<00:03:42.890> 2<00:03:43.100> minutes<00:03:43.280> worth<00:03:43.549> of

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.370 

okay<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.120> now<00:03:47.450> let's<00:03:47.480> see<00:03:47.840> what<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.200> can

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
okay so now let's see what you can

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.410 
okay so now let's see what you can
