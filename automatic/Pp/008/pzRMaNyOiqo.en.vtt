00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.230
 welcome to another video of the defendant 45 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.420
 work of ricardo azevedo and thales 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.600
 on the video today we'll talk about 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.369
 Grade-level hip bearing is not 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.260
 only the rotating trunk but also the 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.150
 hip that should rotate in the same direction 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.379
 and simultaneously with the rotation of the tron 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.379
 to minimize resistance 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.440
 funny interned in the picture imagine 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.120
 the body divided into upper and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.739
 bottom to improve the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.989
 rotating performance of the trunk 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.879
 the top has to be simultaneous and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.980
 in the same direction of hip rotation 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.900
 lower arms assist in the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.059
 trunk bearing and legs help 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.890
 in the cellular hip bearing but 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.210
 hugged to the right will turn to the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.890
 right and isolated themselves in the stroke 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.890
 Left will join left 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.590
 If we isolate the left leg, we will 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.450
 back to the left and isolate ourselves 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:35.790
 right leg will turn to the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:37.320
 right coordination of arms and legs 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.390
 knowing that the arms help in the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.430
 bearing of the upper and lower legs 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.260
 of the lower arms and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.240
 legs have to be coordinated so that 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.400
 the trunk and hip bearing to happen the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.710
 same time in the same sense 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.600
 embraced left that rotates the trunk to 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.610
 the left has to be simultaneous with the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.310
 left leg that rotates the hip to the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.680
 left a stride for an arm stroke 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.110
 two leg we have for each stroke 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.150
 Left does only one left leg 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.610
 for each right arm stroke makes only one 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.830
 the right leg in this way the bearing 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.880
 trunk hip happen at the same time 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.290
 and in the same direction 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.290
 improving the efficiency 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.970
 two strokes for an arm stroke 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.130
 four times 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.140
 add two more penalties per cycle 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.030
 now there are four boarding schools for each 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.830
 two knots and so that the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.050
 coordination between leg and blind arm 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.790
 same moment of embracing the left one 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.190
 left leg at the moment stroke 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.810
 Right One See Nothing Right Bearing 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.730
 of comics continues to be simultaneous with 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.590
 trunk improving donato efficiency 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.280
 only now increasing propulsion with 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.280
 two more days 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.600
 three sets for one arm leg 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.640
 six times 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.410
 add two more strides again 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.190
 being six days for each two 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.200
 strokes 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.600
 although the speed of the leg is very 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.940
 the greater the blind coordination even at the beginning 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.980
 from the left to the left you make the leg 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.060
 left at the beginning of the right 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.060
 does the right leg 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.030
 notice the right embraced start with the 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.030
 right leg 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.219
 materials even knowing the importance of 

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:44.869
 of the hip-bearing leg you have 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:46.459
 to learn to vote without her help. 

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:47.779
 for this we will show some materials 

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:53.209
 that nobody hospitalized 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:55.099
 we will first use the float godoy 

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.479
 Goya placed between the legs with 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.579
 purpose of maintaining buoyancy 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.379
 hip inhibiting the stride 

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:02.599
 this way you can concentrate 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:05.839
 only on bearing without the aid of 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.669
 leg but notice that in spite of the people 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:09.469
 show the leg it still leaves the leg 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.459
 may also serve as a 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.459
 balance for the bearing 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.949
 now also use the elastic 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:25.399
 put the elastic on the ankles like this 

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:27.079
 he will learn his legs and prevent 

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:30.429
 they help in hip-bearing 

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:30.429
 making it even harder 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.860
 if you do not have a rubber band there is no 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.930
 problem you simply put the public 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.910
 and legs ankles that way you 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.010
 will continue with your hip floating and 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.030
 also with the legs together making it difficult 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.030
 the hip bearing 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.509
 and finally the board 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.150
 serving the same purpose of 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.650
 maintain the buoyancy of the hip but 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.690
 inhibiting the leg leaving the two 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.610
 united legs 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.320
 This way it gets easier too. 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.300
 hip-bearing repair 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.560
 repair with the top of the board 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.490
 which is running so far to the left 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.490
 to the right 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.840
 the hip-bearing stretch this will 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.120
 improve your efficiency 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.010
 this is it people liked it click liked it 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.020
 this new channel and enjoys swimming if 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.760
 also inscribes short and shares with 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.450
 your friends the video on our 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.520
 Facebook 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.710
 the link is just below so you will 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.000
 follow all our posts without 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.320
 talk that this helps a lot in the disclosure 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.060
 of our work 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.830
 We hope you have enjoyed it until 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.830
