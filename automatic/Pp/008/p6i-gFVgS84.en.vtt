00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello good you will see all this song 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.680
 I come to bring you another one called 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.590
 experience lives and well then by following 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.640
 I do not like this one much because in 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:22.279
 how much fluency is very good 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.279
 and can continue paint can see 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.680
 well let's analyze it a bit I think 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.510
 that it's not going to be a performance first 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.900
 everything to see how it goes 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.970
 is based on android 2.3 points 6 I think 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.090
 and it's very good the truth is that very 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.090
 good 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.900
 books I think it does not have 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.000
 but I also want to do a reviews 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.520
 about games with this rom is going to try 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.520
 one of would go up to see how it went down 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.620
 I do not finish now 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.780
 says 1647 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.979
 I think it's a very good option 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.979
 and so you can see it 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.380
 but good here they put it your device 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:52.719
 in 1647 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.719
 good all a system information 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.310
 3.6 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.130
 always as analyzed also some 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.450
 things came to see how the wifi goes 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.450
 3g let's go all right 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.110
 I have written 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.790
 the keyboard also of the basic ones 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.790
 from android 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.650
 and I know but it's good 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.610
 is a bit of brightness like that is 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.260
 - ingrid I think 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.030
 here you have to have more 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.030
 I do not know what happened here android 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.540
 Well, I do not know, I think it's very 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.420
 good 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.420
 the wallpaper the widgets 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.610
 a screen that has funds Spain 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.370
 with stool 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.530
 experience funds 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.770
 it's fine I do not know if I was influenced by what 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:42.450
 and how fast is the speed that is with 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:46.069
 the one that moves everything is very well 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.069
 well then try
