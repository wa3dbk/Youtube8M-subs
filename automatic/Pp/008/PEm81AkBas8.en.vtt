 they have signed 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.400

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.670
 as for example the agreement with 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.570

 there is an orange color 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:17.829
 that this is long 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.739
 very important 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.819
 for example in August 2009 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:26.390
 here they met to carry out the first monitoring phase 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.659

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.069
 in the rematch it will be terrible 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:15.349
