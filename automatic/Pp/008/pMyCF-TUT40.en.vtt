00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.810
 I explain how to install a game of 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.460
 pc in hyper espn the first thing that you have to 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.330
 have is the files that we need 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:16.280
 that is the game the dm the wild and the video 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.800
 I have some games installed in a 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.930
 unit in a different unit than does 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.770
 that the usual installed them in another 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.630
 HDD 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.150
 and in this case how will not be urged to 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.080
 games is simply a folder I leave 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.080
 the folder in this unit 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.650
 I copy to the cursed folder castilla and the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.700
 I copy where I have my games 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.910
 installed 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:46.000
 once left inside what I do is 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.000
 take direct access to the executable 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.960
 in this case it is the cursed by the 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:57.570
 Castilla copied it 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.570
 and it is left in hyper espn 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.160
 and mulattoes 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.590
 sometimes game 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:13.619
 lynn lnk what I do is paste a 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.619
 direct access to the executable of the game 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.320
 and modified his name to leave it as 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.420
 it's going to look like water that is cursed 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.710
 Castilla is important that the practices 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.260
 let's respect the capitals and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.310
 lowercase in this case I put the m 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.479
 capital letter and the capital C also 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.479
 once I have it 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.390
 the next thing I'm going to do 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.600
 is to put the media files I'm going to 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.600
 the middle folder of game 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.170
 I modify the names so that all 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.170
 match 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.880
 and left everything in its place I leave the dm 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.850
 in the month folder left the wild in the 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.160
 folder images wheel 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.170
 and the video in its corresponding folder 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.450
 and I remind you that they have to match 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.400
 the names including the capitals and 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.470
 the lowercase in this case already as os 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.010
 I commented before it's capital M neither c 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.010
 capital letter 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.610
 here I leave the will 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.900
 I did it in a little while 10 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.210
 minutes therefore it's a bit a bit 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.380
 trash but good for the example of 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.570
 tutorial we are worth 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.820
 and we leave the video also matches 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.820
 damn castilla m uppercase c 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.190
 and once we've done this what 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.110
 we have to add is the game to the base 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.710
 of data in this case we are going to pc 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.200
 games we edit the pc games xml file 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.360
 with the notebook itself and I what 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.250
 we will do when you install a game if it is 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.680
 one only, what I do is copy 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.910
 any other approximately in the 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.910
 same order in the same 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.290
 What I've done is to copy more 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.290
 more game 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.710
 I have duplicated it in the xml 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.890
 and then I deleted one of them 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.710
 old name of more and I've put more 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:06.330
 Castile lens uppercase 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.330
 and in the description the same 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.810
 and we save the file 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.030
 and if we have done everything right it should 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.259
 be already added to the first press 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.259
 we execute and pre of espn 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.610
 we go to the wild of the systems of 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.610
 pc games I have it for pc games 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.080
 we go to the m 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.800
 and here it appears us will appear 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.830
 the dm and we see the whole video 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.780
 correctly 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.670
 if we execute then it should work 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.130
 correctly in this case it's not going to 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.250
 work because I have not configured it 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.480
 before and I have not modified the 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.980
 settings to open the screen 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.890
 complete therefore does not open 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.830
 but good now what we will do is the 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.320
 high of all life 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.980
 and we see that the game is executed from 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.980
 background 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.330
 we observe the splash with a high f 4 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.540
 and there we have the game running 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.790
 Well that's all the game has 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.400
 executed is quite simple all of 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.449
 do 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.449
 and nothing more
