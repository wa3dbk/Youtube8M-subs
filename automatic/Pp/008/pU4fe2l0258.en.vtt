00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
for Taekwondo but it was one minor thing

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.830 
for Taekwondo but it was one minor thing
I<00:02:49.620> know<00:02:50.620> Tae<00:02:51.130> Kwon<00:02:51.340> Do<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:51.940> closed<00:02:52.480> right<00:02:52.780> now

but<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:55.260> lights<00:02:56.260> um<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.790> chipped<00:02:58.300> away<00:02:58.420> the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.910 
but the lights um I chipped away the
sandstone<00:02:59.440> so<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.070> put<00:03:00.370> glass<00:03:00.610> instead<00:03:01.210> so<00:03:01.660> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
sandstone so I put glass instead so the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.550 
sandstone so I put glass instead so the
sunlight<00:03:02.920> would<00:03:03.160> go<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:03.640> there<00:03:03.990> so<00:03:04.990> that<00:03:05.020> is

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
sunlight would go in there so that is

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.790 
sunlight would go in there so that is
pretty<00:03:05.860> much<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.460> end<00:03:06.490> of<00:03:06.820> my<00:03:06.970> video<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.900> happy
