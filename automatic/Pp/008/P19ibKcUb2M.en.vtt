00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.870
 This is the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.840
 long ago in a very distant country 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.729
 there was a young man whose name was his team 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:16.999
 zayas and that he had a skull 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.960
 since he marked a before and after 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.310
 the change of technology 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.310
 171 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.289
 if we saw airs talking about what is last with loans of June 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.319
 its definition 

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:36.260
 and for this it is very easy we just have to consider that a text that 

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:40.189
 originally it was conceptualized to make a book ends in format 

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:43.639
 In this regard, it would be necessary to understand the definition of the 

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:47.479
 leading shark that is nothing more than the one that contains the pivots for 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.949
 to be able to transform them into accessible files either through the text today 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.359
 author is one of the reasons why people do not 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.489
 He usually consumes many digital books for this ancestral discussion 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.430
 respect to which the leader of a screen 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.370
 tired and the other is not used to it 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.950
 shindo is a product that came to solve this matter a little 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.680
 the famous design of the digital ink the digital ink is nothing more than 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.020
 the place the matte color the contrast between the letters the backgrounds of the same 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.639
 way that the books have already done so far 

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:26.389
 well a tad a river that even audiobooks are nothing more than 

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:30.600
 a way to show how the general concept of the book has been transformed 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.210
 amunt on the basis of new technological advances in access to 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.830
 information 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.810
 this does not take us more than the need to investigate a little more 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.820
 hungry for knowledge and wisdom 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.850
 know that the city 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.250
 He undertook the search for personalities that could help him in 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.380
 his tibán vision 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.540
 then he found a marin cilic frame 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.600
 club victor boxing infighting or not 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.000
 who told him about the role of gdp in today's society 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.070
 one 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.530
 it's a myth sun a particular animal is not like music in a noble way 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.410
 according to your visit 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.739
 the northern states of the votes a little different 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.529
 I want to tell you the client a book everything else is a very different thing from 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:19.929
 a school book 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.359
 in that sense 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.299
 it does not matter if it is on paper etc 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.669
 it is clear that masks of salt to access more information can grow 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:31.519
 lidón can be useful for group typology since five days ago 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.219
 user 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.129
 I do not think that the weight is going to be the only way to access the content 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.149
 he also explained about the driving program 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.579
 who are implementing 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.819
 I think that the value-added we can see at the table 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.679
 discussion 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:52.519
 that is the first step this afternoon possibility to the thread expte the actor is 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.019
 giving 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:53.840
 almost 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.649
 or unknown can not be found easily 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:03:01.779
 to be found d by millions of people talks two words 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:06.629
 for walkers represent a big step the mysterious words of today are 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.469
 indexing psm chase bank the idea is to do something else than now 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:12.860
 the power to have 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.980
 direct access to each of the words that were selected as 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.150
 the boxes with the flags for whatever comes and grab a search in 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.810
 specific 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.020
 we talked a little about him like his purses just to expand the understanding of 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.169
 What are they doing 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:33.339
 a search engine usually what it does that is that it literally copied read the 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:37.459
 paragraphs of the text that on a web page that are exposed this even 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.779
 can also be done with any other text format that does not 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.379
 it is necessarily included in the web page 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.260
 wife then how do you take advantage of it to generate your search engine an engine 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.599
 of searches that exclusively in law in the texts of books that already 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.909
 they were digitized by themselves and that then allows you to find 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.280
 direct references of both emily quotes what you're looking for as 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.739
 dangerous alternates that could have was the same title with the same 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.060
 content so that then you can have direct references in your 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.780
 screen 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.060
 one of the great advantages that brussels offer I can physically tell you 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.499
 what way to physically seek it is to say 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:17.689
 you and he wants to be hydrogenera a click to help you find some 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:21.319
 store and it would throw an address near your zip code address 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.940
 to be able to then physically go for it if you wish 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:26.550
 sahin 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.419
 a lover of indexing the contents began to understand that the 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.699
 traditional book and the cti 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.400
 they were not fighting 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400
 but they are a complement to each other 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.840
 to form your conclusions 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.979
 according to citi following his life 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.310
 but from a writer's point of view 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.039
 this new invention that comes the l 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.490
 I tell you in the ituc but it sure is not this 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.490
 I've been to them but if it goes down if you 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:57.259
 I think 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.749
 the design of the book is probably the best design to read is a design 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:03.240
 perfect there is no 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.759
 There is no such thing as a book 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.460
 you get on a plane and you do not have to plug in anything or useless to pay 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.999
 when it takes off 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:11.990
 and the relationship 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.529
 yours with 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:15.650
 with the story they are telling 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.169
 It's fundamental 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.020
 Yes Yes what 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.749
 I do not know what happens 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:23.080
 at the end but 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.509
 I'm almost sure I would not buy 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.120
 this machine 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.320
 regardless of the romanticisms you have to think that there are digital books 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.490
 It has many advantages 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.009
 lohan something with what we know as the general council of the iepc 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.479
 the mainly for those who do not 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.210
 in the case of students and researchers that is in a good way 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.629
 they require for example the sitar exactly one author only copying 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:52.789
 and pasting and that the work is done in the end these things of 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.480
 ease for example too 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.320
 he believes that instead of charging 25 books, he charges a device that is less than 25 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.580
 books is also a big advantage our Andalusian book not only in 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.520
 the physical has its advantages also among them the matter that you can 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.390
 keep your information with security to what we refer zamorano 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.060
 between the books generally lasted thousands of years and the proof is in the 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.710
 so many museums that we have out there with so many books that have been described 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.080
 these ancestral times ea is much safer regarding conservation 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.830
 of costs on the other hand 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.840
 efe in the physical action of turning the few that allows you some way 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.960
 I felt a sense of time and space that lets you know that you're going 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.990
 advancing cubas behind as escorts the number of pages you go and endo 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.720
 who is also a large percentage can not acquire with a performance etc 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.730
 I despite being a lover of books and heavy technology lover 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.750
 thank the two 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.139
 I think I'll take the advantages of both 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:54.479
 maybe it's legitimate 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.479
 he lived happily ever after with his books 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:59.520
 public 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.740
 pilate audiobooks 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.610
 because all these mutations of the book 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.899
 They serve to meet different needs 

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:09.249
 by its nature 

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:12.519
 electronic is the lieutenant of that city 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:16.459
 and understood that the book would never lose its place 

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:24.699
 Murcia
