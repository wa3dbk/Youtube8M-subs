 There are manufacturers in many its people but there mean that was purchased in the junk that 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.980
 Is also the price 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.739
 11 yen 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.469

 The appearance is really distinctive 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.630
 It seems to be upside down 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.710
 Thus it came to be 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.990
 It looks like this 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.409

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.820

 What code is not enough I'm there is no 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:48.039
 It seems that you have turned off the power supply because you want to use the cable 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.039
 I will try to split the shell for the time being 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.910

 It's a story of where to source from, but it's not here 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.120
