neighborhood have no idea the last time
this<00:00:19.650> engine<00:00:20.039> was<00:00:20.160> even<00:00:20.460> running<00:00:21.320> here<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.439> go

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:59.030 

man

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.010 

let's<00:01:59.310> run<00:01:59.580> a<00:01:59.640> while<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
let's run a while to the

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:17.630 
let's run a while to the
or<00:02:02.079> APA<00:02:02.439> come

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.010 

so<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.700> added<00:02:18.849> a<00:02:18.970> little<00:02:19.000> bit<00:02:19.239> more<00:02:19.420> all<00:02:19.599> to<00:02:19.870> it

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
so I added a little bit more all to it

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.580 
so I added a little bit more all to it
it<00:02:20.200> was<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.890> little<00:02:21.099> bit<00:02:21.250> low<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:23.170> can<00:02:23.440> see

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
it was a little bit low but you can see

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.140 
it was a little bit low but you can see
most<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.040> this<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.340> just<00:02:24.370> being<00:02:24.730> burnt<00:02:25.000> off

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
most of this is just being burnt off

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.570 
most of this is just being burnt off
from<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.450> exhaust<00:02:26.099> going<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.190> start<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.489> back

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
from the exhaust going to start it back

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.949 
from the exhaust going to start it back
up<00:02:27.640> here<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.090> let<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.209> run<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> while<00:02:28.660> longer

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
up here and let it run a while longer

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.870 
up here and let it run a while longer
since<00:02:29.290> Al<00:02:29.590> Gore<00:02:29.830> hasn't<00:02:30.160> showed<00:02:30.310> up<00:02:30.340> yet

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
since Al Gore hasn't showed up yet

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.380 
since Al Gore hasn't showed up yet
I<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.190> smoking<00:02:33.610> will<00:02:33.790> stop<00:02:34.030> shortly

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
I think this smoking will stop shortly

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.630 
I think this smoking will stop shortly
sisa<00:02:35.080> starts<00:02:35.440> up<00:02:35.620> one<00:02:35.800> pole<00:02:36.010> like<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.459> did

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
sisa starts up one pole like it did

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:51.020 
sisa starts up one pole like it did
first<00:02:37.390> time

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.930
