 Oh 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.010
 the windsurfer sarah hÃ©bert was 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.569
 present at clm 10 it is recalled that 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.980
 damsel has challenged herself a little 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.800
 crazy a few months ago 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.120
 cross the Atlantic in windsurfing even 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.250
 if she could not go after 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.970
 hat down and we took the opportunity to 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.080
 come back with her on her adventure 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.060
 this monday watches for the whole day during 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.459
 six to eight hours a day and a 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.200
 catamaran was following at a distance and I 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.870
 join and at night to sleep his kata 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.130
 and the next day at the first hour I 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.739
 felt on my board and so I 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.790
 spent my days at sea soil with a 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.319
 only small mas in landmarks when we go 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.530
 launch an adventure like this 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.500
 we really risk his life since there my 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.230
 security depend and above all of my 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.840
 ability to communicate with my crew 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.640
 with a vhf and so you do not have to 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.290
 throw in there at random it takes 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.299
 really be very close to the physically 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.680
 and even under these conditions we will 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.680
 still takes big risks 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.450
 it's all about the weather and have like 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.460
 all records and it's always a 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.800
 Difficult to manage bet we can know 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.850
 the weather at four-five days 7 days 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.410
 but it can always change 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.970
 that's what happened to me with 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.680
 a wind that has turned to the east and so 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.150
 I was full wind 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.190
 full wind behind windsurfing 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.840
 it's extremely physical and see 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.910
 really impossible to hold as 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.260
 position for two hours so I 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.360
 all given all given I sailed 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.070
 for 12 days 8 hours a day 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.620
 and then one morning I went to the water 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.090
 with loss of consciousness all of 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.010
 the vision I simply reached my 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.070
 physical limits here I have arrived 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.690
 at the end of what I could give 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.440
 realized my dream I will remember 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.440
 just all my life what 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.440
 when robby naish kai lenny the kite 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.300
 surfer pros kevin jerry finds himself in 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.760
 alaska for a trip in stand up paddle 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.980
 in the middle of the icebergs and well it gives 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.100
 a trip well road and especially it gives 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.100
 desire 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.900
 m 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.139
 at 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.650
 I am rich eastern europe 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:52.639
 that's not all 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:57.460
 gouffran who do not have the floor 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.460
 the unique nascar sprint 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.990
 for dessert this week a little 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.810
 gift to make you forget the fall 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.850
 wet in our latitudes we go to 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:48.760
 Tahiti on the famous pipe pass 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:50.440
 skin a nice session between locals who 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.450
 reminds that the spot is not only 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.180
 that a violent wave of monstrous 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.160
 certainly kyoto and technical and selective 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.320
 but in these crystalline conditions one 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.810
 can all dream of the greenhouse made a day 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.730
 we leave you on these beautiful pictures to 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.480
