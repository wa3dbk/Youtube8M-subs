freezer so bring it to room temperature

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.150 
freezer so bring it to room temperature
you<00:01:09.780> add<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.290> into<00:01:10.470> your<00:01:10.590> bowl<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.980> have

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
you add that into your bowl so we have

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.710 
you add that into your bowl so we have
six<00:01:11.460> egg<00:01:11.610> whites<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.970> cup<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.300> a<00:01:12.360> half<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.660> sugar

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and a pinch of salt the salt helps break

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.650 
and a pinch of salt the salt helps break
down<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.170> albumin<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.250> egg<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.760> make<00:01:21.540> it

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
down the albumin in the egg and make it

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.780 
down the albumin in the egg and make it
a<00:01:21.690> little<00:01:21.960> less<00:01:22.200> Peggy<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:23.400> lack<00:01:23.550> of<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.760> better

such time as you actually feel the heat
coming<00:01:57.450> out<00:01:57.539> of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.689> egg<00:01:57.780> whites<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.350> gonna

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
coming out of the egg whites it's gonna
