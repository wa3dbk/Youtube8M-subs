00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
you how many times I've put all the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.129 
you how many times I've put all the
beads<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.300> realized<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> bead<00:00:12.929> cap

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
beads on and realized that the bead cap

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:13.879 
beads on and realized that the bead cap
wasn't<00:00:13.380> there

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
wasn't there

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.359 
wasn't there
first<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.969> tie<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> knot<00:00:15.920> the<00:00:16.920> thread<00:00:17.220> that

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
first you tie a knot the thread that

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.609 
first you tie a knot the thread that
you're<00:00:17.490> going<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.730> use<00:00:18.060> comes<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> needle

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
you're going to use comes with a needle

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.040 
you're going to use comes with a needle
on<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.850> which<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:20.880> just<00:00:21.029> as<00:00:21.390> well<00:00:21.420> because<00:00:21.600> it's

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
on it which is just as well because it's

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.689 
on it which is just as well because it's
almost<00:00:22.500> impossible<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.189> get<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> thread

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
almost impossible to get the thread

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.450 
almost impossible to get the thread
through<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.180> hole<00:00:24.539> without<00:00:24.930> doing<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.560> I'm

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
through that hole without doing it I'm

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.820 
through that hole without doing it I'm
doing<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.910> needle<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.590> is

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
doing it with a needle so what you do is

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.890 
doing it with a needle so what you do is
you<00:00:28.949> take<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.340> your<00:00:29.640> thread<00:00:30.480> there's<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.689> little

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
you take in your thread there's a little

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.380 
you take in your thread there's a little
hole<00:00:31.080> right<00:00:31.109> between<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.890> two<00:00:32.040> caps<00:00:32.390> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
hole right between the two caps and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.490 
hole right between the two caps and
that's<00:00:35.600> where<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.780> put<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.079> through<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.440> then

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that's where you put it through and then

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.400 
that's where you put it through and then
you're<00:00:37.680> going<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.570> pull<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.960> bead<00:00:40.170> cap

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
you're going to just pull that bead cap

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.069 
you're going to just pull that bead cap
all<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.070> way<00:00:41.190> down<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> thread<00:00:41.840> till<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.930> get

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
all the way down the thread till you get

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.619 
all the way down the thread till you get
to<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> very<00:00:43.469> end<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.059> then<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.360> start

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
to the very end and then you can start
to<00:00:45.809> thread<00:00:46.020> your<00:00:46.140> beads<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:51.660> next<00:00:52.020> step<00:00:52.969> I've

to thread your beads the next step I've

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.939 
to thread your beads the next step I've
threaded<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.690> beads<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.800> throw

the<00:01:04.949> necklace<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the necklace is going to be just a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.390 
the necklace is going to be just a
little<00:01:06.240> longer<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.380> cut<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:07.920> thread

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
possible to accommodate any of the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
possible to accommodate any of the
things<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.590> might<00:01:13.710> happen<00:01:13.860> while<00:01:14.130> you're

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
things that might happen while you're

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.950 
things that might happen while you're
knotting<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.960> you've<00:01:16.320> got<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:16.619> bead<00:01:16.799> cap<00:01:17.070> on

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
knotting so you've got your bead cap on

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.740 
knotting so you've got your bead cap on
so<00:01:18.960> I've<00:01:19.290> put<00:01:19.680> all<00:01:20.549> these<00:01:20.850> beads<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.390> then

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
so I've put all these beads on then

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.609 
so I've put all these beads on then
lampwork<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.270> I've<00:01:24.270> kept<00:01:24.659> every<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.110> and

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
lampwork and I've kept every one and

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
lampwork and I've kept every one and
then<00:01:26.610> I've<00:01:27.390> put<00:01:27.750> two<00:01:28.020> beads<00:01:28.820> between<00:01:29.820> them<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
then I've put two beads between them and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.770 
then I've put two beads between them and
the<00:01:30.869> knot<00:01:31.110> will<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.530> right<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.369> there<00:01:32.780> it's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the knot will go right in there it's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.420 
the knot will go right in there it's
just<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.229> chosen<00:01:34.650> design<00:01:34.799> across

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
just a chosen design across

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.330 
just a chosen design across
experimenting<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> way<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.340> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
experimenting is the way to go so the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.719 
experimenting is the way to go so the
first<00:01:38.579> thing<00:01:38.820> I'll<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.619> is<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:41.220> tie<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.460> first

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
first thing I'll do is to tie the first

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.730 
first thing I'll do is to tie the first
knot<00:01:42.060> right<00:01:42.600> here

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.569 

remember<00:01:47.700> how<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> did<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.570> cord

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
remember how I did that little cord

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.609 
remember how I did that little cord
necklace<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.049> few<00:01:52.200> beads<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.590> it

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
necklace with it just a few beads on it

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.170 
necklace with it just a few beads on it
it's<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.490> same<00:01:53.729> thing<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:55.170> make<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> ring<00:01:56.180> you

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
it's the same thing you make a ring you

weeny little piece of something there
and<00:04:43.439> I<00:04:43.529> can<00:04:43.740> certainly<00:04:43.979> cut<00:04:44.400> that<00:04:44.610> off

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:45.499

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
little bit of that of the thread just

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.329 
little bit of that of the thread just
cut<00:04:50.129> it<00:04:50.249> off<00:04:50.400> so<00:04:50.699> there<00:04:51.800> there<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.949> is

00:04:53.329 --> 00:04:53.339

clasps I think this one is purple
this<00:05:29.189> one<00:05:29.370> is<00:05:29.490> proportionate<00:05:31.789> and<00:05:32.789> I'm<00:05:33.180> going

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
this one is proportionate and I'm going

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.879 
this one is proportionate and I'm going
to<00:05:33.449> attach<00:05:33.749> it<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.169> this<00:05:34.379> ring<00:05:34.680> now<00:05:36.589> you<00:05:37.589> may

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.369 
to attach it to this ring now you may
have<00:05:37.979> come<00:05:38.069> across<00:05:38.360> necklaces<00:05:39.360> with<00:05:40.199> this

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:40.379 
have come across necklaces with this

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.010 
have come across necklaces with this
particular<00:05:40.709> attachment<00:05:41.389> in<00:05:42.389> your

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
particular attachment in your

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.290 
particular attachment in your
grandmother's<00:05:43.589> jewelry<00:05:44.370> box<00:05:44.729> where<00:05:45.120> this

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
grandmother's jewelry box where this

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.260 
grandmother's jewelry box where this
thing<00:05:45.569> is<00:05:45.689> broken<00:05:46.110> it<00:05:47.099> usually<00:05:47.879> happens

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
thing is broken it usually happens

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.389 
thing is broken it usually happens
because<00:05:48.719> somebody<00:05:49.259> has<00:05:49.409> opened<00:05:49.919> and<00:05:50.069> closed

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:50.399 
because somebody has opened and closed

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:53.149 
because somebody has opened and closed
it<00:05:50.639> several<00:05:51.060> times<00:05:51.360> if<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.349> only<00:05:52.620> close<00:05:53.009> it

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
it several times if you only close it

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.459 
it several times if you only close it
once<00:05:53.399> it's<00:05:53.729> strong<00:05:54.120> but<00:05:54.689> it<00:05:54.810> can<00:05:54.990> get<00:05:55.110> metal

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
once it's strong but it can get metal

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.100 
once it's strong but it can get metal
fatigue<00:05:55.589> very<00:05:56.159> quickly<00:05:56.509> so<00:05:57.509> you<00:05:57.539> have<00:05:57.839> to<00:05:57.990> do

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
fatigue very quickly so you have to do

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.209 
fatigue very quickly so you have to do
it<00:05:58.229> right<00:05:58.499> the<00:05:58.709> first<00:05:58.860> time

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
it right the first time

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.869 
it right the first time
so<00:06:00.120> the<00:06:00.240> clasp<00:06:00.539> is<00:06:00.779> in<00:06:00.930> there<00:06:01.409> and<00:06:02.399> I'm<00:06:02.669> going

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:02.879 
so the clasp is in there and I'm going

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:05.989 
so the clasp is in there and I'm going
to<00:06:02.939> take<00:06:03.120> my<00:06:03.300> my<00:06:04.229> round<00:06:04.979> nose<00:06:05.039> pliers<00:06:05.459> and<00:06:05.729> I'm

to take my my round nose pliers and I'm

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:13.339 
to take my my round nose pliers and I'm
just<00:06:06.270> gonna<00:06:07.339> curl<00:06:08.339> it<00:06:08.729> into<00:06:09.360> place<00:06:09.659> once<00:06:12.349> so

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
just gonna curl it into place once so

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.659 
just gonna curl it into place once so
now<00:06:13.499> it's<00:06:13.680> closed<00:06:14.039> and<00:06:14.370> its<00:06:15.059> strong<00:06:15.889> on<00:06:16.889> the

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
now it's closed and its strong on the

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.329 
now it's closed and its strong on the
other<00:06:17.849> side<00:06:18.209> it's<00:06:19.080> my<00:06:19.349> habit<00:06:19.589> to<00:06:19.740> take<00:06:20.129> some

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:20.339 
other side it's my habit to take some

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:23.929 
other side it's my habit to take some
chain<00:06:20.899> because<00:06:21.899> I<00:06:21.990> like<00:06:22.199> these<00:06:22.349> links<00:06:22.939> and

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:23.939 
chain because I like these links and

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:26.420 
chain because I like these links and
since<00:06:24.180> they<00:06:24.300> have<00:06:24.479> the<00:06:24.629> chain<00:06:24.870> anyway<00:06:25.399> it<00:06:26.399> just

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
since they have the chain anyway it just

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.339 
since they have the chain anyway it just
seems<00:06:26.819> like<00:06:26.999> an<00:06:27.180> easy<00:06:27.330> way<00:06:27.449> to<00:06:27.599> go<00:06:29.149> so<00:06:30.349> actually

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349 
seems like an easy way to go so actually

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.320 
seems like an easy way to go so actually
let's<00:06:31.979> do<00:06:32.189> it<00:06:32.279> this<00:06:32.370> way<00:06:32.580> it<00:06:32.729> handles<00:06:33.209> more

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
let's do it this way it handles more

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.869 
let's do it this way it handles more
easily<00:06:33.689> I'm<00:06:33.839> going<00:06:34.080> to<00:06:34.249> I'm<00:06:35.249> going<00:06:35.459> to<00:06:35.520> attach

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:35.879 
easily I'm going to I'm going to attach

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.510 
easily I'm going to I'm going to attach
it<00:06:36.110> while<00:06:37.110> it's<00:06:37.349> on<00:06:37.469> a<00:06:37.499> chain<00:06:37.620> just<00:06:38.129> because

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
it while it's on a chain just because

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.879 
it while it's on a chain just because
it's<00:06:38.669> easier<00:06:39.089> to<00:06:39.270> handle<00:06:40.199> and<00:06:40.349> then<00:06:40.469> cut<00:06:40.770> the

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
it's easier to handle and then cut the

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.179 
it's easier to handle and then cut the
ring<00:06:41.069> away<00:06:41.959> once<00:06:42.959> again<00:06:43.289> I<00:06:43.319> go<00:06:43.680> into<00:06:44.039> the

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:44.189 
ring away once again I go into the

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:47.280 
ring away once again I go into the
little<00:06:45.180> ring

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
little ring

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:55.320

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
and turn it into place then I'm going to

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:03.450 
and turn it into place then I'm going to
cut<00:06:55.770> this<00:06:56.770> ring<00:06:57.070> free
