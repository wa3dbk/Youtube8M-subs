ins of veteran mode I've been in games

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.160 
ins of veteran mode I've been in games
like<00:00:58.920> ease<00:00:59.370> I've<00:00:59.609> been<00:00:59.910> very<00:01:00.329> difficult<00:01:00.660> games

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
like ease I've been very difficult games

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.229 
like ease I've been very difficult games
but<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.039> game<00:01:02.250> took<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.699> step<00:01:02.730> further

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
but this game took it a step further

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.289 
but this game took it a step further
that<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:04.260> wasn't<00:01:04.439> necessary<00:01:05.180> if<00:01:06.180> you've

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
that really wasn't necessary if you've

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.000 
that really wasn't necessary if you've
played<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.570> falcone<00:01:07.140> game<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.830> their

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
played a falcone game you know their

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.980 
played a falcone game you know their
games<00:01:08.220> aren't<00:01:08.460> easy<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.030> working<00:01:09.479> designs

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
games aren't easy but working designs

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.109 
games aren't easy but working designs
made<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> big<00:01:10.920> boo-boo<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.880> game

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
made a big boo-boo here with this game

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.520 
made a big boo-boo here with this game
rather<00:01:12.659> than<00:01:12.869> keeping<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> original

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
rather than keeping the original

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.530 
rather than keeping the original
difficulty<00:01:14.340> he<00:01:14.700> decided<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
difficulty he decided to up the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.539 
difficulty he decided to up the
difficulty<00:01:15.900> considerably<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.430> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
difficulty considerably but you have to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.580 
difficulty considerably but you have to
consider<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.270> time<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.750> game<00:01:18.930> came<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
consider the time the game came out and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.149 
consider the time the game came out and
I<00:01:19.650> guess<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.189> 1994<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.479> really<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> pre<00:01:22.770> 3d

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
I guess in 1994 and really the pre 3d

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.100 
I guess in 1994 and really the pre 3d
era<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.610> games<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.420> games<00:01:24.600> weren't<00:01:24.900> really

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
era of games the games weren't really

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.140 
era of games the games weren't really
naturally<00:01:25.799> long<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.430> were<00:01:26.549> extended<00:01:27.119> by

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
naturally long but were extended by

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.840 
naturally long but were extended by
difficulty<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> most<00:01:28.890> part<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.700> can

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
difficulty for the most part you can

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.789 
difficulty for the most part you can
expect<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> same<00:01:30.329> with<00:01:30.689> popful<00:01:31.110> mail<00:01:31.140> only

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
expect the same with popful mail only

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
expect the same with popful mail only
way<00:01:31.979> more<00:01:32.340> you'll<00:01:32.970> die<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.420> three<00:01:33.630> hits<00:01:33.840> in

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
way more you'll die in three hits in

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.929 
way more you'll die in three hits in
this<00:01:34.110> game<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.890> only<00:01:35.040> saving<00:01:35.340> grace<00:01:35.490> is

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
this game and the only saving grace is

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
this game and the only saving grace is
that<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.780> buy<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:36.990> many<00:01:37.140> health<00:01:37.530> pots<00:01:37.799> in
