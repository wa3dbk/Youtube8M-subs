 we do as I said meant keese sauce 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.780
 because Germany plays ours today 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.180
 good football matches include beer and 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.370

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.370

 grams of butter made hot because made 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.250
 to us to start the roux the 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.420
 roux is almost the queen below 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.420
 the saucen basics 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.819
 There it comes in just like it spoons 

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:16.069
 and a teaspoon and now it says 

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:18.369
 first stir that no lumps 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:22.630
 arise 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.630
 that just does not burn anything too much 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.770
 which provides for the connection after the 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.210
 definitely need because we want today 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.870
 Have a perfect football evening in the evening 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:58.900
 and this includes as I said with chips 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:04.479
 cheese the wonderful one of my 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:10.380
 By the way, favorite is beautiful 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:19.420
 stir and now come in about 500 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:23.320
 milliliters of milk if I have something 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.980
 say were pretty much exactly 500 milliliters 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.980
 cold milk 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.020
 We are already stirring that together 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:47.170
 and spices come in our trap 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:50.380
 two teaspoons of paprika in half 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.130
 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and a half 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.130
 teaspoon of pepper 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.980
 we the nice one 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.620
 Now we wait until the whole cooks on 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.270
 the base of milk and roux 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.660
 starts to roar and bubble and 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:42.050
 Now it's time for berlin cheese 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.050
 to do 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.070
 first the heat a little down 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:58.470
 now I'm at three out of six and 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:04:01.520
 now come 200 grams of emmentaler in 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.520
 one to 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.090
 and melt down when melting and 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.769
 always stir the touch regularly 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.860
 I 've just said beer to him 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:32.340
 no matter who wants the cheese 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:35.340
 before bear and two grated grated 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.340
 Kauder 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.669
 who finds grated cheese or denner 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.660
 take cheese in the whole canton of Jetta cheese 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:52.750
 Oppendorf is always one of us 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:05:03.000
 a bit difficult that has to be done now 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:10.030
 melt and as soon as that reaches it 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.010
 I'll be back for so long 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.440
 I do not drink that in the meantime 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.020
 a bit here and you are there 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.520
 continue right away 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.410
 five to seven minutes later I have 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.639
 she looked at the clock I have children 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.110
 every now and then turned around and I have 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.729
 it spiced up with a few 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.500
 chiliflocken still a bit 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.479
 cayenne white only i still was 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.130
 But that is exactly the consistency of the 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:36.820
 wanted to have this as proof 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:44.099
 crackle of a lax pack and a 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:44.099
 macho gorgeous 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:54.020
 to be perfect 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.290
 apple a normal mason jar 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.480
 Jar 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.790
 then it will certainly last two weeks 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.620
 in the refrigerator but do not worry, the sauce 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.010
 it does not survive today's market 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:17.010
 with friends at football is great 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:22.320
 So that's it. See you
