 today for you I have prepared a lesson about 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.639
 hairstyle about styling but such a laying 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.380
 which you very often requested after 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.969

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.090
 I hope you all follow my 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.109
 instagram and there I was getting 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.359
 numerous inquiries about how to do 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.970
 This is the actual styling. 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.490
 my most favorite curls I adore them 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.230
 opportunities to do often i know what 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.660
 spoils hair but i don't care 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.460
 to get such a simple styling you 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.860
 need only curling 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.960
 hairspray volume foam and your 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.270
 the desire to get here is such a kuda 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.329
 make them very very simple and i 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.879
 I'm sure that we can proceed. I always 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.410
 I begin by separating half 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.930
 hair one half i am for a sorcerer to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.320
 she does not interfere with me from the other begins 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.320
 work 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.860
 I take my tongs to separate the small 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.350
 a strand of hair 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.200
 grow my fingers 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.990
 I put the tongs parallel to the ground and here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.220
 so twirl the strand on the tongs 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.890
 and wait for one more moment which I 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.900
 advised to take into account cheat 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.060
 hair from the roots and try to curl 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.950
 wind the roots as close as possible to 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.130
 as close as possible area of my hair 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.800
 the root touched the forceps when 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.259
 hairstyle get bigger and this 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.170
 emphasize the fun of this 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.009
 styling after you screwed up 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.110
 curl you shoot it in your palm and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.229
 in this way will hold it 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.820
 there let it cool in your hand so 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.720
 here he will keep his shape much 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.020
 longer 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.970
 very important moment you always need 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.009
 combed curls of course comb 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.100
 comb every logan is very long 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:01.170
 I just comb my fingers why am I 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.819
 I do to curl get more why 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.490
 I do this in order to curl 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.509
 It turned out more like to say well-groomed 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.130
 that it gets brighter outlined 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.410
 note that the left side 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.340
 I twisted my hair to the left that is 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.340
 they look me to the left 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.269
 now we will move on to the second 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.489
 head pieces 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.639
 dissolve hair that grew 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.379
 and now we will cheat to another 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:35.409
 the side that is now the curls will be 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:37.189
 look right take the tongs in your left hand 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.189
 right hand 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:43.810
 separating the sheath and curl and start 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.810
 wind it in the other direction 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.250
 absolutely accurate stations which 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:33.650
 you with me my order we them all in 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:38.210
 chaotic order to tighten up any 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.660
 one section of our hair is not left 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.660
 intact 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.370
 but now we need a little varnish 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.100
 and a little bit of foam for the volume I am very very 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:05.510
 plentifully will splash your you 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:09.380
 allah at first just top 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.540
 and now a little secret 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.670
 if you want volume to remain 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.609
 the roots should be like this 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.299
 lift hair and spray varnish 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.299
 the roots 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.160
 Alla Pugacheva studied 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.210
 next we take a bit of chips 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.020
 just a little bit 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:56.130
 and distribute the curls just to 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.630
 curls just to just for that 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.630
 to emphasize curls 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.180
 Now weâ€™ll wait a little while for the hair 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.550
 arrows then calm down a little and now 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.040
 what do the usual yar and usually here in 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.270
 so chaotic order combing 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.420
 hair with fingers 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.600
 not a brush, not a comb, but just a finger 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.230
 and 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.230
 to keep curls in effect 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:33.530
 That's the way I brush them too 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:36.350
 I can shake my head a little 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.950
 hair a little to the hair a little bit 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.950
 jumped 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.679
 in such a simple way with 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.229
 hairspray curlers 

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:49.209
 styling foam and our super fingers 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.979
