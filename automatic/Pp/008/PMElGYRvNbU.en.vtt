smackdown vs. raw actually that is what
it<00:00:29.980> is<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:31.529> by<00:00:32.529> THQ<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:33.789> same<00:00:34.030> smackdown<00:00:34.629> vs

it is this by THQ the same smackdown vs
raw<00:00:34.840> series<00:00:35.350> basically<00:00:36.280> got<00:00:36.399> a<00:00:36.430> facelift<00:00:36.820> and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
raw series basically got a facelift and

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.729 
raw series basically got a facelift and
no<00:00:37.510> longer<00:00:37.809> call<00:00:37.989> it<00:00:38.140> that<00:00:38.289> they<00:00:38.410> just<00:00:38.559> call<00:00:38.710> it

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
no longer call it that they just call it

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.340 
no longer call it that they just call it
WWE<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.640> then<00:00:39.879> well<00:00:40.629> so<00:00:40.929> the<00:00:41.050> year<00:00:41.199> that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
WWE and then well so the year that

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.869 
WWE and then well so the year that
they're<00:00:41.530> doing<00:00:41.649> it<00:00:41.890> I<00:00:42.039> think<00:00:42.399> that<00:00:42.519> makes<00:00:42.699> way

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
they're doing it I think that makes way

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.599 
they're doing it I think that makes way
more<00:00:42.909> sense<00:00:43.149> because<00:00:43.629> it's<00:00:44.399> Smackdown<00:00:45.399> and

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
more sense because it's Smackdown and

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.209 
more sense because it's Smackdown and
raw<00:00:45.760> don't<00:00:46.120> really<00:00:46.390> compete<00:00:46.780> I<00:00:47.050> mean<00:00:47.859> I<00:00:47.890> guess

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
raw don't really compete I mean I guess

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:49.319 
raw don't really compete I mean I guess
they<00:00:48.370> sort<00:00:48.579> of<00:00:48.640> do<00:00:48.730> but<00:00:48.879> that's<00:00:48.999> not<00:00:49.149> really

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
they sort of do but that's not really

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.169 
they sort of do but that's not really
the<00:00:49.480> point<00:00:49.510> of<00:00:49.719> it<00:00:49.839> so<00:00:50.319> this<00:00:50.530> is<00:00:50.559> the<00:00:50.800> new

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
the point of it so this is the new

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.729 
the point of it so this is the new
wrestling<00:00:52.179> game<00:00:52.420> that<00:00:52.659> I've<00:00:52.809> been<00:00:53.019> anxious<00:00:53.260> to

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
look at this one minute s is going to be

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.280 
look at this one minute s is going to be
different<00:02:59.910> chain<00:03:00.910> grapples<00:03:01.510> breaking<00:03:01.990> point

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
different chain grapples breaking point

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.800 
different chain grapples breaking point

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
now I was just like I said at eb games

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.300 
now I was just like I said at eb games
they<00:04:07.810> had<00:04:07.959> some<00:04:08.110> on<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.320> wall<00:04:08.560> like<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.130> ones

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
they had some on the wall like the ones

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.710 
they had some on the wall like the ones
that<00:04:09.370> they<00:04:09.520> don't<00:04:09.730> have<00:04:09.790> pre-orders<00:04:10.300> for<00:04:10.330> and

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
that they don't have pre-orders for and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.180 
that they don't have pre-orders for and
those<00:04:11.200> ones<00:04:11.440> could<00:04:11.560> get<00:04:11.709> it<00:04:11.830> too<00:04:11.950> so<00:04:12.100> I'm

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
those ones could get it too so I'm

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.670 
those ones could get it too so I'm
thinking<00:04:12.400> if<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:12.550> get<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.820> first<00:04:13.380> launch<00:04:14.380> one

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
thinking if you get the first launch one

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.890 
thinking if you get the first launch one
of<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:15.820> like<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.090> one<00:04:16.209> available<00:04:16.450> on<00:04:16.690> launch

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
of it like the one available on launch

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.840 
of it like the one available on launch
you<00:04:17.109> probably<00:04:17.470> will<00:04:17.620> get<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:18.190> rock<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:18.669> if<00:04:18.760> you

get<00:04:18.970> in<00:04:19.120> there<00:04:19.239> now<00:04:19.419> you<00:04:20.049> probably<00:04:20.230> be<00:04:20.410> able<00:04:20.470> to

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
look you've got like the liberal they

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.100 
look you've got like the liberal they
actually<00:05:39.580> brought<00:05:39.729> old<00:05:40.090> people<00:05:40.599> in<00:05:40.719> here<00:05:40.930> I

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
actually brought old people in here I

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.959 
actually brought old people in here I
didn't<00:05:41.590> get<00:05:41.680> that<00:05:41.740> Brock<00:05:42.190> Lesnar<00:05:42.669> in<00:05:42.819> this

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
didn't get that Brock Lesnar in this

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.839 
didn't get that Brock Lesnar in this
game<00:05:43.180> why<00:05:43.389> he's<00:05:43.930> been<00:05:44.080> a<00:05:44.110> UFC<00:05:44.500> for<00:05:44.919> years<00:05:45.370> he

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
game why he's been a UFC for years he

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.749 
game why he's been a UFC for years he
hasn't<00:05:46.060> been<00:05:46.180> in<00:05:46.240> WWE<00:05:46.599> since<00:05:46.900> like<00:05:47.229> 2004<00:05:48.039> so

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
hasn't been in WWE since like 2004 so

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.059 
hasn't been in WWE since like 2004 so
why<00:05:48.940> is<00:05:48.969> he<00:05:49.270> even<00:05:49.449> in<00:05:49.960> the<00:05:50.500> game<00:05:50.650> I<00:05:50.830> don't<00:05:50.979> know

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
why is he even in the game I don't know

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.469 
why is he even in the game I don't know
and<00:05:51.279> he's<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:51.699> he's<00:05:51.819> I<00:05:51.849> think<00:05:52.120> you<00:05:52.360> have<00:05:52.449> to

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
and he's and he's I think you have to

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.719 
and he's and he's I think you have to
unlock<00:05:52.810> him<00:05:53.050> which<00:05:53.680> kind<00:05:53.919> of<00:05:54.069> makes<00:05:54.190> sense<00:05:54.460> but

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
unlock him which kind of makes sense but

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.999 
unlock him which kind of makes sense but
Brock<00:05:54.940> Lesnar<00:05:55.270> now<00:05:55.509> is<00:05:55.839> viewed<00:05:56.169> as<00:05:56.289> a<00:05:56.349> UFC<00:05:56.680> guys

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
Brock Lesnar now is viewed as a UFC guys

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.300 
Brock Lesnar now is viewed as a UFC guys
so<00:05:57.839> it's<00:05:58.839> not<00:05:58.990> really<00:05:59.050> very<00:05:59.560> he's<00:06:00.159> not

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
so it's not really very he's not

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.969 
so it's not really very he's not
pertinent<00:06:00.550> to<00:06:00.819> the<00:06:00.909> WWE<00:06:01.449> series<00:06:01.690> but<00:06:02.500> at<00:06:02.710> any
