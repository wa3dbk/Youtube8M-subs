really<00:01:42.360> enjoy<00:01:42.630> those<00:01:43.110> as<00:01:44.009> much<00:01:44.430> they're<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> lot

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
really enjoy those as much they're a lot

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.420 
really enjoy those as much they're a lot
harder<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.720> watch<00:01:45.899> reactions<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.159> have

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
harder to watch reactions that do have

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.990 
harder to watch reactions that do have
video<00:01:47.850> are<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.840> much<00:01:49.430> more<00:01:50.430> enjoyable<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
video are so much more enjoyable to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.960 
video are so much more enjoyable to
watch<00:01:51.299> because<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> viewer<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:53.250> exactly

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
watch because I as a viewer know exactly

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.490 
watch because I as a viewer know exactly
what<00:01:54.360> they're<00:01:54.570> reacting<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> don't

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
what they're reacting to and I don't

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.399 
what they're reacting to and I don't
have<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.979> rely<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.610> audio<00:01:57.240> cues<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.110> make<00:01:58.259> that

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
have to rely on audio cues to make that

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.260 
have to rely on audio cues to make that
happen<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.860> all<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.250> us<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.790> watch<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
know we all had to memorize those audio

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.789 
know we all had to memorize those audio
clues<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.329> figure<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:06.899> what<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.649> on

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
clues to figure out what was going on

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.410 
clues to figure out what was going on
on-screen<00:02:08.459> which<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:09.000> be<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> little

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
on-screen which can be a little

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.150 
on-screen which can be a little
distracting<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.229> can't<00:02:10.470> really<00:02:10.770> enjoy

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
distracting and you can't really enjoy

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.820 
distracting and you can't really enjoy
watching<00:02:11.910> somebody<00:02:12.599> else<00:02:12.840> feel<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.470> emotion

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
watching somebody else feel the emotion

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.500 
watching somebody else feel the emotion
that<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.190> felt<00:02:14.460> at<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.580> time<00:02:14.730> which<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.330> what

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
that you felt at that time which is what

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.410 
that you felt at that time which is what
reaction<00:02:16.020> videos<00:02:16.320> are<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.860> that's<00:02:17.670> why<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.940> feel

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
reaction videos are so that's why I feel

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.470 
reaction videos are so that's why I feel
they're<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.230> much<00:02:19.410> fun<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.190> way<00:02:20.400> of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
they're so much fun it's a way of

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.390 
they're so much fun it's a way of
relating<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.810> another<00:02:22.110> person<00:02:22.650> seeing<00:02:23.010> them

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
relating to another person seeing them

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.760 
relating to another person seeing them
enjoy<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.970> same<00:02:24.180> story<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.900> enjoyed<00:02:25.320> anyway

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770

so<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.980> have<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.190> couple<00:02:26.400> solution<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.940> this

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
so I have a couple solution to this

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.240 
so I have a couple solution to this
problem<00:02:27.240> one<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.350> just<00:02:28.380> cut<00:02:28.950> down<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
problem one is I just cut down the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.330 
problem one is I just cut down the
long-form<00:02:29.730> video<00:02:30.030> format<00:02:30.630> we<00:02:31.110> go<00:02:31.350> from<00:02:31.710> what's

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
long-form video format we go from what's

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.610 
long-form video format we go from what's
usually<00:02:32.730> around<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.030> half-hour<00:02:33.480> down<00:02:33.960> to<00:02:34.290> you

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
usually around a half-hour down to you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.290 
usually around a half-hour down to you
know<00:02:34.740> less<00:02:34.950> than<00:02:35.160> 10<00:02:35.400> minutes<00:02:35.610> is<00:02:36.030> what

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
know less than 10 minutes is what

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.960 
know less than 10 minutes is what
apparently<00:02:36.600> HBO<00:02:37.170> will<00:02:37.470> allow<00:02:37.740> or<00:02:38.040> we<00:02:38.580> can<00:02:38.790> show

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
apparently HBO will allow or we can show

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.780 
apparently HBO will allow or we can show
the<00:02:39.270> entire<00:02:39.540> reaction<00:02:39.990> with<00:02:40.530> no<00:02:40.770> video<00:02:41.130> one<00:02:41.700> of

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
the entire reaction with no video one of

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.790 
the entire reaction with no video one of
my<00:02:41.910> ideas<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.360> maybe<00:02:42.540> we<00:02:42.720> do<00:02:42.840> both<00:02:43.080> maybe<00:02:43.560> we

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
my ideas is maybe we do both maybe we

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.500 
my ideas is maybe we do both maybe we
can<00:02:43.950> do<00:02:44.040> like<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.220> short<00:02:44.460> highlight<00:02:44.880> video<00:02:45.150> that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
can do like a short highlight video that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.660 
can do like a short highlight video that
does<00:02:45.780> our<00:02:45.960> usual<00:02:46.230> format<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.100> has<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
does our usual format that has a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.170 
does our usual format that has a
beginning<00:02:48.360> part<00:02:48.720> where<00:02:48.960> we<00:02:49.200> review<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.520> talk

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180

other people throwing around ideas
anyway<00:04:33.949> so<00:04:34.009> it<00:04:34.460> was<00:04:34.610> kind<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:35.000> low<00:04:35.150> blow<00:04:35.180> to

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
anyway so it was kind of a low blow to

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.719

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
us today when that all happens I mean

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.090
