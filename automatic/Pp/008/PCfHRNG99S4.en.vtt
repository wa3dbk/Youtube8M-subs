00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.600 
to show you I'm gonna apply it over this
just<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.070> get<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> feel<00:01:50.579> for

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
just so you can kind of get a feel for

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.920 
just so you can kind of get a feel for
that<00:01:51.530> but<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:53.640> inside<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> cap<00:01:54.509> has<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that but the inside of the cap has this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.350 
that but the inside of the cap has this
little<00:01:55.350> round<00:01:55.860> part<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.549> goes<00:01:56.700> directly

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
little round part that goes directly

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.380 
little round part that goes directly
over<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.320> hardly<00:01:58.979> messy<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.670> then

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
over it so it's hardly messy and then

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.300 
over it so it's hardly messy and then
you<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.689> take<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.899> brush<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.770> dip<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.219> in

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
you just take the brush you dip it in

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.700 
you just take the brush you dip it in
and<00:02:02.670> look<00:02:03.270> at<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.689> picks<00:02:03.990> up<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.320> product

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
and look at that it picks up the product

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.069 
and look at that it picks up the product
perfectly<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:06.060> then<00:02:06.180> my<00:02:06.299> nearest<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.840> right

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
perfectly and then my nearest is right

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.210 
perfectly and then my nearest is right
here<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.239> dab<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.649> where<00:02:11.099> you

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.260 
here so and you can dab it on where you
need<00:02:11.400> more<00:02:11.520> coverage<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.120> then<00:02:12.300> buff<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.660> out

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
need more coverage and then buff it out

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.210 
need more coverage and then buff it out
you<00:02:13.780> can<00:02:13.900> take<00:02:14.110> like<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.350> brush<00:02:14.590> like<00:02:14.770> this<00:02:14.980> I

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
recently did a review on this on my blog

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.120 
recently did a review on this on my blog
I<00:03:30.430> had<00:03:30.580> a<00:03:30.610> sample<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.270> I<00:03:31.360> said<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:31.600> probably

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
I had a sample and I said I probably

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.770 
I had a sample and I said I probably
went<00:03:33.130> by<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:34.180> full<00:03:34.630> size<00:03:34.930> because<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:37.510> didn't

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
went by the full size because it didn't

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.360 
went by the full size because it didn't
offer<00:03:37.930> enough<00:03:38.260> coverage<00:03:38.680> for<00:03:38.740> me

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
offer enough coverage for me

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.230 
offer enough coverage for me
however<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:41.010> have<00:03:42.010> used<00:03:42.250> this<00:03:42.400> one<00:03:42.640> day<00:03:42.910> the

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
however I have used this one day the

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.150 
however I have used this one day the
sample<00:03:43.660> jar<00:03:43.900> with<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:45.040> overtop<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:47.070> let<00:03:48.070> me

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
sample jar with this overtop and let me

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.870 
sample jar with this overtop and let me
tell<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:48.550> how<00:03:48.810> flawlessly<00:03:49.810> like<00:03:50.770> it<00:03:51.160> was<00:03:51.340> so
