00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:11.680
 hello friends with you anton tishchenko 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.920
 and in this video we will be with you 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.310
 test ram and so 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.609
 the test that described the most in his 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.960
 an article called mt 186 plus 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.900
 for some reason on my computer 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.820
 refuses to start 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.960
 it is with the disk that starts well with 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.059
 the towers do not start alive therefore 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.670
 we will test the RAM with 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.480
 using a little different test us test 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:46.420
 86 just no plus 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:53.079
 So go to the site with google and go 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:56.409
 On the site for a test 86 someone there is a click 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.339
 download and we are interested in the image for 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.479
 windows 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:05.340
 namely, for a flash drive, download it more 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:10.060
 the more megabyte it weighs so 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:13.719
 unpack the image open the daddy 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.939
 So we insert a flash drive and copy surveillance 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:19.659
 all important data as all information 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:24.570
 will be deleted here some empty 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:27.570
 done run the file and the ball and wherever 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.570
 there is 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:39.280
 then choose our flash drive and click 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:43.060
 record the works confirm and again 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.869
 We confirm a little bit and wait for the flash drive 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.990
 The image is successfully recorded. Click ok. 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.999
 close the program and do not go 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.270
 directly to the operational test 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:57.100
 memory and so go directly to 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.070
 memory testing 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.600
 we prepared a flash drive and inserted it into 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.469
 you need a computer 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.170
 reboot tobi boot from flash drive 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.330
 reboot reboot 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.170
 So you can download for flash in two 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.690
 ways the way the number of times to call the menu 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.230
 boot boot once with 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.900
 flash drives 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.300
 that, in principle, ideal here 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.250
 way number two over and go into bios and 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.770
 set 1 to boot the computer from 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.890
 flash drives at first but this method was not 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:37.930
 so we omit it and so on my 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:41.489
 computer means boot menu 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.200
 called with the f8 key 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.480
 here is exactly the same as when entering 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.780
 safe mode looks like this 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.269
 boot menu we choose sony here 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.830
 me 2 sony 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.870
 so maybe you will also have 2 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:02.799
 choose another one will not go later 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:06.989
 another one and press enter is aha here 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:10.030
 she's what we did and 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.660
 automatically went test operational 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.140
 of memory 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:18.640
 means that here you can see here 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:23.459
 You can see the processes that means 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.430
 the processor can be seen here 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.380
 cache speeds 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.049
 that's how much operational you have 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.519
 memory at what speed it works 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:39.340
 that's the most important thing you should 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.390
 watch it naturally here this line 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.959
 error 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.420
 mistakes if zero here means everything is good 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:51.310
 Here's how to determine that you also passed 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:54.069
 But in this it means you have 0 if zero 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.160
 then the test is still going night full cycle 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.489
 not yet passed if you pass 1 means 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.859
 The full test cycle has already passed and 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.069
 and if everything is alright then there are errors 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:10.859
 there is nothing red here means 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.859
 your memory is okay 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.690
 move on to testing others 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.550
 components but in principle everything 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.450
 Thanks for your attention with you was Anton 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.770
 Dyachenko 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.770
 see you in the next videos
