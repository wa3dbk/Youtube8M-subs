 hello, we present to your 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.380
 attention of motor-pumps of the company sadco 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.019
 for pumping small volumes 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.400
 fluids these motor pumps are suitable for 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.560
 watering gardens for pumping water from 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.079
 different tanks for pumping water 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.750
 from stark pools and small ones 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.360
 tanks for sale there are 4 options 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.079
 data motor pumps three of them push-pull 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.399
 these are models of sadko jpee 40 gp 4030 and 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.770
 job e34 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:41.109
 as well as four-stroke model sadko gps 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.940
 40 pump pumps from 8 to 19 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.699
 cubic meters of water per hour but in 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.399
 Basically it is pretty much it is from 8 to 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.019
 19 in fact that year 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.879
 motor pumps are very light so they are easy 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.519
 can be raised with one hand to move up 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.109
 necessary place they can be transported in 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.969
 trunk of the car to the cottage 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.390
 used for watering and places not 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.980
 takes very little up the series which with 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.159
 turquoise engines it 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.060
 ip40 two-stroke motor pump of flowers 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.110
 yellow is a four-stroke engine 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.850
 the advantage of two-stroke engines 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.770
 the fact that they are cheaper and these 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.960
 motor pump cheaper to produce 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.540
 respectively on sale 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.040
 motor pump with four-stroke engine 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.630
 cost a bit more however however 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.079
 four stroke engine it is more 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.049
 economical if you are interested in lifespan and 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:33.189
 gasoline consumption two-stroke motor-pump 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:36.310
 they are lighter in weight and cost less than 4 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.039
 on the same works a little quieter and she 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.329
 greater lifespan 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:46.659
 This is the smallest motor-pump sadko gps 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.579
 34 pumps 8 cubic meters of water per hour 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.920
 used for watering small 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.710
 space it is very compact and comfortable 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.189
 and easy, in principle, it can be raised 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.359
 two fingers means it is on it 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.679
 two-stroke engine power 11 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.619
 horsepower and refuel she 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:09.580
 fuel mixture of gasoline with a special 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.860
 two-stroke oil output at 34 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.480
 goes in principle fit all standard 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.460
 hoses it is very convenient because 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.020
 no extra hoses for you 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.380
 essentially buy 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.830
 which is this stage playground agera p-40 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.990
 she 's more powerful here goes the motor on 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.410
 two point one down on horse perfume 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.540
 forces as well as a starter and also 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.970
 refueling gasoline sound tact 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.680
 oil on it goes outputs on 40 that is 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.590
 principle, too, st is their standard 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.690
 quite easy to find a moto pump also 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.570
 widely used for watering and very 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.740
 like the lucky ones it is convenient and compact and 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.220
 small size 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.620
 this sadko gps 4030 motor pump model is 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.120
 newer model it is different from 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.930
 gt40 flower 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.910
 slightly increased pumping part 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.430
 slightly different filter principle here 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.110
 see here a little bit different here 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.150
 rendered gas control knob 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.710
 respectively 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.260
 the level of water supply on the forum means everything 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.060
 motor pump 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.480
 must be used this way first 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.300
 water is poured in here with 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.240
 special watering can or just from the bottle 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.100
 it is imperative that this whole pump be on an hour 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.770
 was filled after that you type 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.300
 water suction hose 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.950
 unplug it here at the end 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.930
 there must be a suction hose 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.500
 also a check valve which is not 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.590
 allows water to flow out after this only 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.750
 you start the engine this 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.800
 very important because if pumping 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.170
 part will be empty 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.520
 or the suction hose will be empty 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.370
 especially if there are several water 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.570
 meters then basically 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.700
 motor pump does not catch water and pump 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.040
 after work 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.520
 water can be drained using a special 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.540
 there is such a drain hole here 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.990
 the cover can be unscrewed and residues 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.060
 easy to pour out water 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.350
 complete with motor pumps are special 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.750
 hose clamps goes filter 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.989
 so as not to drag out different trash goes 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.960
 the key is everything you need to build 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.240
 for connecting hoses to all 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.940
 motor pump sadko given 1 year warranty 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.400
 they are mandatory checked 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.400
 at the factory here you can 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.710
 see stamped upside down and check date 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.290
 also with motor pumps they go very 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.100
 detailed instructions where in principle there is 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.900
 answers to all your questions 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.610
 motor pump is fueled with a mixture of gasoline and 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.320
 two stroke oil butter you can 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.930
 purchase complete with motor pump 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.420
 Here such here goes a liter bottle and and 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.090
 In principle, it will be enough for a long time she specifically 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.310
 developed by sadkov manufacturer 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.650
 motor pump suited to the entire push pull 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.010
 technology mesh work necessary 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.710
 add in one liter of gas somewhere 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.340
 35-40 grams of oil for running that is 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.630
 it's about there the first 10 hours of work 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.910
 it is recommended to add oil a little 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.530
 more so the engine has a better effect and 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.160
 piston with rings better priterlis 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.160
 each other
