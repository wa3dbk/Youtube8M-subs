00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
for example like this this green tile

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.980 
for example like this this green tile
right<00:02:29.820> here<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.120> not<00:02:30.210> in<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.420> instructions

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
right here is not in the instructions

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.750 
right here is not in the instructions
but<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> put<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.560> there<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.950> blue<00:02:32.130> tile<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.610> not

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
but I put it there that blue tile is not

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.040 
but I put it there that blue tile is not
in<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.910> instructions<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.540> put<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.870> there

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
in the instructions but I put it there

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.970 
in the instructions but I put it there
that<00:02:34.860> gray<00:02:35.100> tile<00:02:35.430> isn't<00:02:35.790> there<00:02:36.120> but<00:02:36.620> as<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.680> part

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
that gray tile isn't there but as a part

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.350 
that gray tile isn't there but as a part
of<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.160> instructions<00:02:38.700> but<00:02:38.820> it's<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:39.270> a

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
of the instructions but it's just a

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.910 
of the instructions but it's just a
natural<00:02:39.780> fit<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.020> thought<00:02:40.380> they<00:02:40.530> look<00:02:40.770> good

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
natural fit I thought they look good

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.240 
natural fit I thought they look good

know it's just a lot of good detail now
don't<00:03:31.680> be<00:03:31.860> fooled<00:03:32.100> this<00:03:32.280> thing<00:03:32.520> isn't<00:03:32.850> real

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
don't be fooled this thing isn't real

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.500 
don't be fooled this thing isn't real
stable<00:03:33.480> in<00:03:34.310> fact<00:03:35.310> if<00:03:35.910> it<00:03:36.180> sits<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.480> little

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
stable in fact if it sits a little

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.050 
stable in fact if it sits a little
top-heavy<00:03:37.020> actually<00:03:37.860> I<00:03:37.890> think<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.760> have<00:03:38.910> to

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
top-heavy actually I think you have to

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.790 
top-heavy actually I think you have to
you<00:03:39.660> have<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.900> really<00:03:40.080> work<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:40.470> get<00:03:40.590> him<00:03:40.740> to

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
you have to really work to get him to

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.260 
you have to really work to get him to
stand<00:03:41.040> there<00:03:41.340> right<00:03:41.550> otherwise<00:03:41.970> he's

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
stand there right otherwise he's

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.860 
stand there right otherwise he's
top-heavy<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.930> he<00:03:42.989> falls<00:03:43.230> over<00:03:44.360> okay<00:03:45.390> now<00:03:45.810> you

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
top-heavy and he falls over okay now you

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.160 
top-heavy and he falls over okay now you
can<00:03:46.230> take<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:48.090> can<00:03:48.300> take<00:03:48.330> his<00:03:48.750> shield

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
can take the you can take his shield

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.890 
can take the you can take his shield
here<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.830> it<00:03:50.820> mounts<00:03:50.940> on<00:03:51.239> his<00:03:51.390> back<00:03:51.630> right

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
here and it mounts on his back right

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.350 
here and it mounts on his back right
here<00:03:52.520> so<00:03:53.520> that<00:03:53.640> was<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.790> pretty<00:03:54.060> neat<00:03:54.239> little

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
here so that was a pretty neat little

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.930 
here so that was a pretty neat little
feature<00:03:54.660> but<00:03:55.280> now<00:03:56.280> one<00:03:56.520> of<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.700> primary
