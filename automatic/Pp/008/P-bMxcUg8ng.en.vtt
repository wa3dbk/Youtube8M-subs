00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.839 
second I'm Rick Lavigne we have both of
those<00:00:25.230> energies<00:00:25.740> cooking<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.340> mean<00:00:26.490> we<00:00:26.609> have

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
those energies cooking I mean we have

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.359 
those energies cooking I mean we have
some<00:00:27.330> real<00:00:27.599> fiery<00:00:27.960> energy<00:00:28.560> that's<00:00:28.949> that

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
some real fiery energy that's that

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.299 
some real fiery energy that's that
builds<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.359> us<00:00:30.390> all<00:00:30.720> day<00:00:31.070> but<00:00:32.070> you

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
builds and is with us all day but you

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.549 
builds and is with us all day but you
know<00:00:32.340> there's<00:00:32.700> also<00:00:33.120> some<00:00:33.630> indication<00:00:34.320> of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
know there's also some indication of

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.200 
know there's also some indication of
what<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.370> should<00:00:35.579> hold<00:00:35.820> things<00:00:36.090> back

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
what we really should hold things back

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.270 
what we really should hold things back
and<00:00:36.630> maybe<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.020> hits<00:00:37.260> earlier<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> day

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and maybe that hits earlier in the day

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.700 
and maybe that hits earlier in the day
but<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:40.110> shouldn't<00:00:40.290> express

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
but it but but we shouldn't express

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.709 
but it but but we shouldn't express
everything<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.280> know<00:00:41.489> that's<00:00:42.180> right<00:00:42.480> because

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
everything we know that's right because

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.200 
everything we know that's right because
the<00:00:43.170> moon<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.829> outgoing<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.640> occasionally

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
can take it or behind the camera but

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.680 
can take it or behind the camera but
sagittaria<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> sign<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.640> tends<00:00:54.449> to

sagittaria is this a sign that tends to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.540 
sagittaria is this a sign that tends to
want<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.899> speak<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> truth<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.920> you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
yet Venus a planet of sociability is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.920 
yet Venus a planet of sociability is
hooked<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> hard<00:01:02.730> aspect<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.420> Pluto<00:01:03.809> as

hooked up in a hard aspect with Pluto as

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.109 
hooked up in a hard aspect with Pluto as
you<00:01:04.019> pointed<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.890> morning<00:01:05.339> Rick<00:01:05.580> which

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
you pointed out this morning Rick which

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.050 
you pointed out this morning Rick which
means<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:07.049> react<00:01:07.670> intensely<00:01:08.670> two

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
means that we can react intensely two

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.300 
means that we can react intensely two
things<00:01:09.330> without<00:01:09.600> even<00:01:10.320> showing<00:01:10.470> those

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
things without even showing those

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.940 
things without even showing those
reactions<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.390> we'll<00:01:12.600> remember<00:01:12.960> yeah<00:01:13.710> we

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
reactions but we'll remember yeah we

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.490 
reactions but we'll remember yeah we
will<00:01:14.159> remember<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:15.180> good<00:01:15.420> news<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.020> even

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
will remember the good news is that even

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.710 
will remember the good news is that even
if<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.950> remember<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.729> think<00:01:18.000> we're<00:01:18.180> willing<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
if we remember I think we're willing to

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.950 
if we remember I think we're willing to
let<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.490> partly<00:01:20.490> because<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.360> moon<00:01:21.600> in

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
let it go partly because of that moon in

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.010 
let it go partly because of that moon in
sagittarius<00:01:22.680> has<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> short<00:01:24.030> memory<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:24.990> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
sagittarius has a short memory when it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
sagittarius has a short memory when it
comes<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> potential<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.310> what's<00:01:26.580> next

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
comes to the potential of what's next

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.840 
comes to the potential of what's next
and<00:01:27.210> today<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.259> moon<00:01:28.470> actually<00:01:29.100> makes<00:01:29.729> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
and today the moon actually makes a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.149 
and today the moon actually makes a
harmonious<00:01:30.360> trying<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.930> Jupiter<00:01:31.799> which<00:01:31.979> is

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
harmonious trying with Jupiter which is

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.370 
harmonious trying with Jupiter which is
Sagittarius<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.030> key<00:01:33.299> or<00:01:33.509> ruling<00:01:33.780> planet

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
Sagittarius is key or ruling planet

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.620 
Sagittarius is key or ruling planet
early<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.369> day<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.360> makes<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
early in the day and then it makes a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.649 
early in the day and then it makes a
harmonious<00:01:37.200> trying<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.829> Uranus<00:01:38.700> later<00:01:39.329> in

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
harmonious trying with Uranus later in

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.590 
harmonious trying with Uranus later in
the<00:01:39.810> day<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.710> Jupiter<00:01:41.250> Uranus<00:01:41.600> trying

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the day now this Jupiter Uranus trying

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.780 
the day now this Jupiter Uranus trying
is<00:01:42.899> building<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.799> through<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.399> middle

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
is building you know through the middle

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.399 
is building you know through the middle
of<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.060> month<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.509> building<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.079> month

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
of the month it's building this month

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.350 
of the month it's building this month
and<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.130> what<00:01:47.340> we're<00:01:47.490> doing<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.850> we're<00:01:48.090> getting

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
and so what we're doing is we're getting

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.749 
and so what we're doing is we're getting
an<00:01:48.479> early<00:01:48.750> wave<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.829> potential

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
an early wave of the potential

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.090 
an early wave of the potential
excitement<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.600> our<00:01:51.720> lives<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.470> some<00:01:52.920> new

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
excitement in our lives and and some new

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.100 
excitement in our lives and and some new
ideas<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.909> think<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.270> does<00:01:54.450> make<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.869> easier

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
ideas and I think it does make it easier

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.410 
ideas and I think it does make it easier
to<00:01:55.649> forget<00:01:56.189> about<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.640> emotional<00:01:57.270> weight

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to forget about the emotional weight

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.899 
to forget about the emotional weight
that<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:57.810> might<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.380> denial<00:01:58.759> well<00:01:59.759> we've

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that we might be in denial well we've

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.639 
that we might be in denial well we've
also<00:02:00.119> got<00:02:00.420> some<00:02:00.630> other<00:02:00.780> health<00:02:01.110> today<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649
