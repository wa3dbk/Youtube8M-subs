00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.610

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.700
 without a ticket okay bah then listen to that 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.290

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.290

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.710
 pinball finally if you cross it in full 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.210

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:05.869
 the beginning of the race it looks like it has 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.519
 not seem like a complicated race 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.890

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:15.720

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.010
 complicated is not complicated 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.370
 but we are losing 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.099
 money 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.870

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.340
 saw on the mini map 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.510

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:07.260
 Thursday I'm not bad either fat of the 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.900
 meinau answer i'm going i'm trying 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.709
 to miss me of course 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.810
 you are past it's good wow what camp you 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.190
 when you start rolling on the wall 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.970
 in fact do not get too inclined game 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.539
 seeker left what direct ok except that 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.030
 me he rolls not on the wall month he 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.830
 falls to the ground normal everything there is 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.960
 more banal and yet at the end of 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.490
 account once he or she wrinkles after 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.320
 It's finish 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.900
 okay okay, listen, you took the law like 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:42.210
 vehicle in titi ok well I see all 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:45.180
 the torno hatred blocked me I had not 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.780
 misheard otherwise I would have taken Banon 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.280
 but precisely will be false 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.940
 because we sent a small one 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.889
 turns aulas how a year but that's 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.680
 good it's like Thursday the room pretty 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:04.380
 often 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:06.300
 yeah I have talent it's ok 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.550
 okay Ben listen to me right now 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.199
 talented after it's a lack of 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.160
 luck 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:14.520
 yeah no and I think it was necessary 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.139
 maybe a little more delinquent when 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.789
 you take it when you take the flight 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.360
 wright I think it takes a little momentum 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.919
 still it's later avoids tutu va 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.000
 maybe skid because we tale 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:30.840
 arcand canton precisely we took over the 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.970
 spawn for the point that we did that 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.979
 we did not get enough momentum what's there 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:40.860
 I have just seen and barely an hour 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.930
 he direct approach good the race is 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.599
 not bad but it will take a little short 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.570
 really is the longest with 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.680
 wall ride longer also I'm going 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.430
 try to look at the social club 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:57.720
 if there is not a race like the buzz 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:59.550
 the world 'record' off the wall the ride 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.479
 races with that one of those in round that 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.520
 go up in the sky a dress to 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.050
 besides, I'm going to ask if anyone 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.949
 a race like that they put it 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.120
 in the comments of this video 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.800
 like that by testing it also has a 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.919
 really a wall ride but huge 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.580
 yeah ok well let's get on there 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.780
 yeah I think it'll do it 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.780
 ciao bella ciao
