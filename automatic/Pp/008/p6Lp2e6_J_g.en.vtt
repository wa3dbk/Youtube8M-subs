00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.410
 hello everyone this is oscar halls and this 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.020
 is cartridge inside or cartridge inside 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.190
 today our curio program 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.710
 where are we going to talk about different 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.230
 varied topics about different games 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.360
 or different curious facts about 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.820
 the video games and well let's grow 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.770
 with the first curious data evidently 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.030
 the first one is about the portal by 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.279
 that is that we have it in the background in the 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.500
 video so well we can directly 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.400
 start but first let's put data 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.460
 curious number one let's go 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.940
 as you will see the first video that about 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.900
 portal and the funny thing about all this is that 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.050
 what we are seeing is in the 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.990
 screen is a portal is a portal made 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.060
 for a follower and the best of all this 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.310
 is that this portal is not made for 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.380
 computers precisely and it's not 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.770
 made for no wearable device 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.320
 so to call it especially 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.300
 for video games or cell phones for nothing 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.250
 this video game you are watching a 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.470
 screen is made for calculators 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.630
 of course the creators did it 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.070
 I do not know if they will put in download but 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.270
 it is interesting to know what can be done 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.040
 get to do with a bit of 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.780
 computer and with a calculator 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.000
 it's probably not a remake but 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.190
 of a new portal but that has the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.680
 same topic not about portals and 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.210
 others and it's interesting to know it's very 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.190
 interesting here I leave the video for 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.720
 If you want to continue seeing or finding out 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.700
 If they want to know how to do the best 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.410
 You can explain them to me, I'm not 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.930
 sure but you can look more in the 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.350
 video and ask yourself 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.409
 looking for the video calculator portal game 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.090
 by such a calculator in google you owe them 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.939
 come out to appear some 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.020
 information referred to about this so 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.020
 let's go the second curious fact 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.520
 the second curious fact is about a 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.229
 Nintendo character calls government and 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.420
 probably everyone knows him 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.539
 It's a little bit bizarre 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.369
 because probably this one never is 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.219
 they have imagined it but well we are going to 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.769
 first to make a textual quote of what 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.200
 which wikipedia says at the beginning about 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.580
 bildu seeing is a fictional character 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.160
 that appears in the video game series 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.810
 of super mariobros doing his first 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.910
 appearance in super mario bros 2 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.590
 he has become a recurring character 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.660
 in titles of the series of mario parte 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.540
 but if we read a little more 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.190
 below or rather below that there 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.380
 a controversy that refers to the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.660
 true gender of vido is to say that no 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.849
 you know how to live is not a man or a woman anymore 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.489
 that in America is considered a woman and in 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.620
 Japan is considered a man however in 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.450
 the launch of super mario bros 2 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.700
 established that wine was sexually 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.860
 confused and that therefore he preferred 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.300
 be called big data what you located 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.299
 open as the first character 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.580
 transgender in video games however 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.370
 there is also the doubt of whether in fact 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.590
 he lived in George's girlfriend and he is not or 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.450
 if it's really a woman and we do not 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.790
 we already know that if we in a 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.950
 analysis a little deep about that not 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.319
 a little bit deep for an analysis a 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.880
 a little more direct a little bit more 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.950
 elaborated we can see that I have to 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.260
 hatch the eggs you have to put the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.160
 Eggs I do not know what etc. etc. 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.019
 etcetera and seeing is not exactly that 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.330
 if it is not the one that spits eggs out of the mouth 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.130
 I do not know if that will have anything to do with the 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.620
 what or yes 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.320
 It is curious the data and so I can 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.830
 conclude it can be said that seeing is 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.740
 man and that is not a woman the fact that 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.930
 has become a woman was 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.150
 thanks to the American censorship and 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.160
 through that it expanded to the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.230
 Latin translations and so on more or less 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.510
 the three European options were expanded 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.420
 and more elements so you can 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:52.930
 conclude that I actually lose is a 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.930
 male character and is not female 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.120
 this other data is very curious and very 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.220
 strange and is that nintendo owns a 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.230
 baseball team in the united states 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.000
 called did they keep up and if I did not 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.160
 they believe they can easily go to wikipedia 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.870
 place the name of the team and see that 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.970
 the sounders in the owners appears 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.400
 nintendo to the best of dissolved intent 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.150
 to earn income in parallel not 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.280
 only of the video games of his company of 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.900
 technology but it will also fill 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.550
 through sports have some 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.640
 extra income but the case that 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.669
 Nintendo owns this team and wins 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.210
 income for everything that develops 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.210
 inside him 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.280
 the door of time the sky work sort 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.750
 it looks very similar to what 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.669
 which is the mirror of twilight in 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.860
 twilight princess the host that the 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.860
 muscle is the current mirror and where is it going to 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.680
 misnÃ¡ to his world to his true universe 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.960
 and these two objects have a one 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.630
 symbolic similarity very similar but not 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.400
 identical in both games appears a 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.320
 hand protruding from the toilet and with these 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.290
 both games I mean older ones more and 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.450
 current princess forgiveness and skyward sword 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.270
 where in both solos appears a hand 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.740
 of the toilet inside the toilet inside 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.340
 of the toilet as you want to say 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.240
 and he gave us a letter for personal use 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.400
 obviously I think that this is more of a 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.770
 cameo and has nothing related to the 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.990
 story or anything like that and how 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.940
 last data the symbol that appears in the 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.310
 Temple of Darkness in Ocarina of 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.460
 time on the ground at the beginning of the temple 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.410
 it is identical its symbology is identical to 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.800
 mirror of the portal of twilight princess 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.479
 to the current mirror and so this is a 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.220
 little curious since it can be that both 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.590
 the temple of darkness and the world 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.750
 current and have a certain relationship 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.610
 this is much more interesting when 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.920
 we see the timeline since ocarina 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.680
 of time was first that twilight 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.480
 princess so I really leave it 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.560
 here you analyze it a little more and 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.560
 take it to another level 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.780
 the following data is a bit bizarre 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.030
 but at the same time it is very interesting 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.760
 it's about that in the games of mario 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.710
 Bros in our beloved boxer when 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.760
 invaded of course the mouscron kingdom 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.350
 he turned all the people into the blocks 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.020
 that we break while we pass 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:14.200
 the mario bros of course is a bit 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.700
 strange is a bit bizarre in the sense 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.050
 that when we break a block in 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.300
 We are actually killing a person 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.280
 but it does not have to be that way it forces 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.710
 obligated month and I get to understand not 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.150
 it has to be like that to swear since it can 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.620
 be that that was an initial idea 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.360
 when I called cough that already call 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.310
 a little more serious a little more mature 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.230
 now mario has become a 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.510
 Very tender figure a much more figure 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.490
 childish but I imagine that the beginning 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.920
 miyamoto did not have those plans with 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.170
 regarding May and he wanted some sense to 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.720
 everything that was around did not 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:46.090
 course nowadays I think that that 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.660
 data is not real that is to say it is no longer taken 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.670
 in mind but nonetheless those people 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.580
 in the first games of mario if 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.380
 they were turned into blocks and what 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.790
 we broke were people however not 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.470
 we know if the blocks actually had 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.970
 they simply became a blog 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:06.250
 inanimate I have no idea but that is 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.380
 the curious fact and it's very interesting and 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.660
 at the same time a little bizarre so 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.160
 good if they have some some data 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.420
 curious people who want to share with 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.340
 you can send us for the 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.100
 next video I would like to hear it 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.680
 would like to read them but if possible in 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:24.130
 well those by mail to the next one that 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.780
 I put them in the description so good 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.880
 see you in the next video of these 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.160
 curious this is oscar zones and this is 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.140
 carl craig instant or cartridge inside 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.460
 I hope you see the video you like it and 

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.460
 put you favorites until then
