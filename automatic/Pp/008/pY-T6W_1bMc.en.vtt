today<00:00:17.390> we'd<00:00:17.570> like<00:00:17.600> to<00:00:17.900> talk<00:00:18.080> about<00:00:18.380> how<00:00:18.560> to

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
today we'd like to talk about how to

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:28.390 
today we'd like to talk about how to
properly<00:00:18.890> store<00:00:19.490> your<00:00:19.939> batteries<00:00:27.250> one<00:00:28.250> of<00:00:28.340> the

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
properly store your batteries one of the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.240 
properly store your batteries one of the
most<00:00:28.610> common<00:00:29.150> failure<00:00:29.539> of<00:00:30.220> batteries<00:00:31.220> that

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
most common failure of batteries that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.600 
most common failure of batteries that
are<00:00:31.609> stored<00:00:32.119> over<00:00:32.750> long<00:00:33.110> periods<00:00:33.770> of<00:00:33.980> non-use

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
are stored over long periods of non-use

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.590 
are stored over long periods of non-use
is<00:00:35.150> that<00:00:35.840> they<00:00:36.020> start<00:00:36.620> to<00:00:36.800> discharge<00:00:37.400> on<00:00:37.760> their

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
is that they start to discharge on their

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.510 
is that they start to discharge on their
own<00:00:38.780> or<00:00:39.110> if<00:00:39.620> they're<00:00:39.800> hooked<00:00:39.980> up<00:00:40.160> into<00:00:40.370> a

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
own or if they're hooked up into a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.670 
own or if they're hooked up into a
vehicle<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:41.239> then<00:00:41.630> they<00:00:41.750> start<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.200> sulfate

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
vehicle and then they start to sulfate

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.370 
vehicle and then they start to sulfate
so<00:00:43.579> our<00:00:43.760> challenge<00:00:44.059> here<00:00:44.540> is<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.870> try<00:00:45.020> to<00:00:45.140> keep

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
so our challenge here is to try to keep

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.709 
so our challenge here is to try to keep
the<00:00:45.530> batteries<00:00:45.950> as<00:00:46.340> fully<00:00:46.700> charged<00:00:47.030> as<00:00:47.239> we<00:00:47.420> can

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
the batteries as fully charged as we can

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:57.270 
the batteries as fully charged as we can
during<00:00:48.110> long<00:00:48.440> periods<00:00:48.770> of<00:00:49.340> storage

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.009 

so<00:00:58.280> there's<00:00:58.429> really<00:00:58.579> two<00:00:59.269> ways<00:00:59.300> to<00:00:59.660> properly

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
so there's really two ways to properly

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.520 
so there's really two ways to properly
store<00:01:00.379> battery<00:01:01.510> if<00:01:02.510> it's<00:01:02.750> for<00:01:03.170> shorter

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
store battery if it's for shorter

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.429 
store battery if it's for shorter
periods<00:01:03.769> like<00:01:04.159> seasonal<00:01:04.640> use<00:01:04.909> you<00:01:05.600> can<00:01:05.899> put<00:01:06.409> a

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
periods like seasonal use you can put a

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.190 
periods like seasonal use you can put a
fully<00:01:06.770> charged<00:01:07.130> battery<00:01:07.220> away<00:01:07.939> for<00:01:08.659> a<00:01:08.689> season

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
fully charged battery away for a season

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.929 
fully charged battery away for a season
and<00:01:09.380> then<00:01:09.649> expect<00:01:10.040> it<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:10.250> operate<00:01:10.640> properly

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
and then expect it to operate properly

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.969 
and then expect it to operate properly
when<00:01:11.330> you're<00:01:11.479> ready<00:01:11.659> to<00:01:11.810> use<00:01:11.990> it<00:01:12.020> however<00:01:12.890> you

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
when you're ready to use it however you

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.529 
when you're ready to use it however you
want<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.190> make<00:01:13.310> sure<00:01:13.340> it's<00:01:13.640> again<00:01:14.210> fully

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
want to make sure it's again fully

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.380 
want to make sure it's again fully
charged<00:01:15.460> disconnected<00:01:16.460> from<00:01:16.640> anything<00:01:17.060> that

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
charged disconnected from anything that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.330 
charged disconnected from anything that
might<00:01:17.539> have<00:01:17.720> any<00:01:18.020> kind<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.440> draw<00:01:18.680> on<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:19.039> so

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
might have any kind of a draw on it so

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.580 
might have any kind of a draw on it so
that<00:01:19.490> means<00:01:19.759> not<00:01:20.149> just<00:01:20.509> your<00:01:20.659> key<00:01:20.899> off<00:01:21.110> on<00:01:21.439> your

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
that means not just your key off on your

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.050 
that means not just your key off on your
car<00:01:21.799> that<00:01:22.009> means<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.460> cables<00:01:22.850> are

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
car that means the cables are

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.539 
car that means the cables are
disconnected<00:01:23.810> then<00:01:24.530> when<00:01:24.740> you<00:01:24.860> come<00:01:25.070> back<00:01:25.100> and

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
disconnected then when you come back and

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.850 
disconnected then when you come back and
the<00:01:25.670> season's<00:01:26.090> ready<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:26.539> go<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.350> and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
the season's ready to go and and and

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.800 
the season's ready to go and and and
you're<00:01:27.979> ready<00:01:28.159> to<00:01:28.310> use<00:01:28.490> your<00:01:28.670> car<00:01:28.939> or<00:01:29.210> boat

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
you're ready to use your car or boat

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.080 
you're ready to use your car or boat
again<00:01:30.220> you've<00:01:31.220> got<00:01:31.369> to<00:01:31.490> fully<00:01:31.640> charge<00:01:31.789> the

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
again you've got to fully charge the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.960 
again you've got to fully charge the
battery<00:01:32.300> okay<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:33.920> probably<00:01:34.700> didn't

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
battery okay it probably didn't

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.210 
battery okay it probably didn't
discharge<00:01:35.179> enough<00:01:36.170> not<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.740> start<00:01:37.039> your

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
discharge enough not to start your

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.039 
discharge enough not to start your
vehicle<00:01:37.460> but<00:01:37.970> don't<00:01:38.119> use<00:01:38.299> your<00:01:38.330> alternators

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
vehicle but don't use your alternators

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.990 
vehicle but don't use your alternators
start<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.619> or<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.250> recharge<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:40.789> battery

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
start the or to recharge that battery

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.330 
start the or to recharge that battery
use<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.659> good<00:01:42.110> battery<00:01:42.470> charger<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:42.979> fully

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
use a good battery charger and fully

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.740 
use a good battery charger and fully
charge<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.700> battery<00:01:43.850> before<00:01:44.299> you<00:01:44.569> use<00:01:44.720> it

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
charge the battery before you use it

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.080 
charge the battery before you use it
again<00:01:45.159> second<00:01:46.159> technique<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.819> one<00:01:46.970> that

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
again second technique and the one that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.910 
again second technique and the one that
I<00:01:47.119> like<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.569> best<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:48.049> to<00:01:48.259> use<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.530> battery

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
I like the best is to use a battery

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.160 
I like the best is to use a battery
maintainer<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.450> means<00:01:50.630> when<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:50.959> pull

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
maintainer so that means when you pull

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.600 
maintainer so that means when you pull
your<00:01:51.200> battery<00:01:51.679> or<00:01:51.799> your<00:01:52.009> vehicle<00:01:52.399> in<00:01:52.580> for

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
your battery or your vehicle in for

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.270 
your battery or your vehicle in for
storage<00:01:53.299> all<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.959> have<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.200> do<00:01:54.319> is<00:01:54.530> get<00:01:55.100> access

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
storage all you have to do is get access

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.430 
storage all you have to do is get access
to<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.789> battery<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.330> hook<00:01:56.899> up<00:01:57.049> these<00:01:57.200> little

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
to the battery and hook up these little

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.380 
to the battery and hook up these little
leads<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:57.979> maintainer<00:01:58.490> here's<00:01:59.270> an

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
leads to the maintainer here's an

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.660 
leads to the maintainer here's an
example<00:01:59.690> of<00:01:59.899> one<00:02:00.110> right<00:02:00.289> here<00:02:00.649> so<00:02:01.369> this<00:02:01.520> will

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
example of one right here so this will

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.940 
example of one right here so this will
these<00:02:01.939> little<00:02:02.210> eye<00:02:02.930> terminals<00:02:03.649> that<00:02:03.829> are

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
these little eye terminals that are

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.499 
these little eye terminals that are
little<00:02:04.159> ring<00:02:04.310> terminals<00:02:04.789> will<00:02:04.969> actually<00:02:05.329> hook

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
little ring terminals will actually hook

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.020 
little ring terminals will actually hook
up<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:05.840> your<00:02:05.890> battery<00:02:06.890> your<00:02:07.250> OE<00:02:07.460> battery

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
up to your battery your OE battery

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.289 
up to your battery your OE battery
terminals<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:10.280> can<00:02:10.429> actually<00:02:10.640> stretch<00:02:11.090> out

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
terminals you can actually stretch out

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.030 
terminals you can actually stretch out
this<00:02:11.480> cable<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.079> have<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.350> poking<00:02:12.920> out
