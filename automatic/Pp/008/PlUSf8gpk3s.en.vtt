00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:15.910
 In I think that I want to introduce the completed form of the two-handed backhand stroke 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:16.599
 Referring now becomes necessary correct footwork in order to take the point's the right because it is both hands 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.210
 I think 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:26.279
 You can swing from here and at the end of the chair you did at work 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.279
 If this is the ideal let's do it 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.130
 This becomes back say Nde from here and my feet go as it collapses is RBI 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.360
 That's right 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.840
 from here 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.530
 I will do without footwork that will be like this 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.430
 Then do to this child fire keep 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:58.170
 Because it will have become impossible at all to say a firm swing 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:02.960
 Here I want to use a solid anostow 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:09.230
 From the last and sit on the chair and hit 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:13.730
 This is the completed form of the backhand and that both hands backhand stroke 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:16.539
 Then I think that I want to practice the completed form using a pulse shop owner 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.840
 Take takeback from there 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.950
 The back is fishing and the water is a little fixed at the end 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.610
 Until the end Un' 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.710
 Min move the color to the left Shinako 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.290
 Basically footwork also put seems to put in only once 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.450
 Before it finally falls 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.840
 Therefore from 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.840
 I hope before you 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.340
 Four 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.299
 until now 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:55.570
 Although I announced backhand and came backhand stroke 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:02:02.270
 It is not received well if the batting point collapses next time to say mother who learned the correct way 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:06.979
 It is the most regrettable thing that 8 batts were broken when actually going to go 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.060
 Here, using the slip and work on the assumption you it a it Toki to practice in the Miracle case 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.150
 Practice a little from back 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:19.380
 It falls a little from the back 2 from the front 2 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.380
 I think that it is good to go while imaging the repetition
