00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.150
 the case is what you yourself do and you 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.530

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.459
 happiness is a choice it is not your choice 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.260
 nothing was yours understood nothing at all 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.020

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.940
 important time then go away 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.360

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:18.710

 everything 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.060

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.970
 we must fight to the end to get something 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.920
 what do you want and maybe not impossible 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.580
 is that whatever you do 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.900
 sadly not achieved what we want well damn 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.660
