pretty<00:01:07.140> nice<00:01:07.350> titles<00:01:07.830> i'm<00:01:08.010> not<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> best

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
pretty nice titles i'm not the best

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
pretty nice titles i'm not the best
titles<00:01:09.090> gold<00:01:09.360> obviously<00:01:09.869> has<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> best

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
titles gold obviously has the best

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.560 
titles gold obviously has the best
titles<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.729> games<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.240> get<00:01:12.420> are

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
titles but the games you can get are

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.969 
titles but the games you can get are
actually<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> hundred<00:01:13.380> dollars<00:01:13.799> in

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
actually up to a hundred dollars in

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.649 
actually up to a hundred dollars in
value<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> same<00:01:15.150> cost<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
value so that's the same cost of the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.200 
value so that's the same cost of the
graphics<00:01:16.080> card<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.710> 260x<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.580> my<00:01:17.700> opinion<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
graphics card the 260x in my opinion is

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.730 
graphics card the 260x in my opinion is
the<00:01:18.330> best<00:01:18.360> budget<00:01:18.810> graphics<00:01:19.409> card<00:01:19.650> available

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the best budget graphics card available

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.590 
the best budget graphics card available
right<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.939> i<00:01:21.060> said<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.390> only<00:01:21.479> a

graphics<00:01:30.420> card<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:30.900> something<00:01:31.380> like

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
graphics card in there something like

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.969 
graphics card in there something like
this<00:01:31.680> would<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.100> pretty<00:01:32.430> good<00:01:32.720> maybe<00:01:33.720> r7<00:01:34.439> 250x

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
this would do pretty good maybe r7 250x

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.859 
this would do pretty good maybe r7 250x
would<00:01:35.369> also<00:01:35.520> fit<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:35.970> category<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.630> in

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
would also fit in that category but in

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.870 
would also fit in that category but in
my<00:01:37.020> opinion<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.470> 260x<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.549> little<00:01:38.759> bit

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
my opinion the 260x is just a little bit

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.910 
my opinion the 260x is just a little bit
better<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.049> also<00:01:40.229> still

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
better just because it's also still

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.560 
better just because it's also still
incredibly<00:01:41.430> cheap<00:01:41.790> you're<00:01:42.299> not<00:01:42.390> gonna<00:01:42.479> be

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
incredibly cheap you're not gonna be

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.510 
incredibly cheap you're not gonna be
running<00:01:42.869> games<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.200> Battlefield<00:01:43.680> 4<00:01:43.950> metro

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
running games like Battlefield 4 metro

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.340 
running games like Battlefield 4 metro
last<00:01:44.640> light<00:01:44.820> maxed<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.659> even<00:01:45.990> at<00:01:46.079> 1080p

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
last light maxed out but even at 1080p

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.990 
last light maxed out but even at 1080p
you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.860> run<00:01:47.009> titles<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.670> know<00:01:47.790> which

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
you can run titles like you know which

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.910 
you can run titles like you know which
are<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.360> add<00:01:48.570> medium<00:01:49.049> settings<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.530> 30fps

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
are to add medium settings at 30fps

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920 
are to add medium settings at 30fps
which<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.909> pretty<00:01:51.090> good<00:01:51.329> considering<00:01:51.780> you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
which is pretty good considering you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.780 
which is pretty good considering you
know<00:01:52.049> that's<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> console<00:01:53.579> the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.690 
anti-aliasing and a couple things like
that<00:03:12.959> but<00:03:13.260> for<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.829> most<00:03:14.010> part<00:03:14.129> this<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.459> going

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
that but for the most part this is going

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.890 
that but for the most part this is going
to<00:03:14.760> be<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:14.970> kind<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.209> graphics<00:03:15.569> card<00:03:15.750> that's

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
to be the kind of graphics card that's

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.089 
to be the kind of graphics card that's
going<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.139> compete<00:03:16.470> with<00:03:16.500> your<00:03:16.799> next-gen

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
going to compete with your next-gen

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.339 
going to compete with your next-gen
consoles<00:03:17.639> your<00:03:17.790> ps4<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.359> your<00:03:18.480> Xbox<00:03:18.810> one's<00:03:19.079> and

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
consoles your ps4 is your Xbox one's and

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.589 
consoles your ps4 is your Xbox one's and
it's<00:03:20.250> gonna<00:03:20.430> hold<00:03:20.639> up<00:03:20.849> pretty<00:03:21.030> well<00:03:21.180> actually

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
it's gonna hold up pretty well actually

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.839 
it's gonna hold up pretty well actually
I<00:03:21.870> would<00:03:22.079> say<00:03:22.199> the<00:03:22.319> 270x<00:03:22.980> currently<00:03:23.549> would<00:03:23.730> do

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
I would say the 270x currently would do

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.339 
I would say the 270x currently would do
a<00:03:23.879> little<00:03:24.150> bit<00:03:24.329> better<00:03:24.510> than<00:03:24.720> what<00:03:25.260> the

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
a little bit better than what the

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.710 
a little bit better than what the
next-gen<00:03:25.799> consoles<00:03:26.340> are<00:03:26.459> offering<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.150> my

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
next-gen consoles are offering so my

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.750 
next-gen consoles are offering so my
opinion<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.169> a<00:03:28.230> really<00:03:28.620> great<00:03:28.739> graphics<00:03:29.579> card

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
opinion is a really great graphics card

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.979 
opinion is a really great graphics card

the graphics card you decide to go with

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.640 
the graphics card you decide to go with
now<00:04:48.240> we've<00:04:48.480> come<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:48.990> soul<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.410> video

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
card on the list I kind of threw this

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.270 
card on the list I kind of threw this
out<00:04:51.240> for<00:04:51.480> sheer<00:04:51.690> guilt<00:04:52.080> factor<00:04:52.350> but<00:04:52.740> well<00:04:53.190> with

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
out for sheer guilt factor but well with

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.300 
out for sheer guilt factor but well with
the<00:04:53.400> msi<00:04:53.790> gtx<00:04:54.270> 770<00:04:55.170> now<00:04:55.350> this<00:04:55.620> is<00:04:55.830> not<00:04:56.010> as<00:04:56.160> good

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
the msi gtx 770 now this is not as good

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.580 
the msi gtx 770 now this is not as good
as<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.550> r9<00:04:56.910> 280x<00:04:57.390> as<00:04:57.660> well<00:04:57.870> as<00:04:58.050> far<00:04:58.470> as<00:04:58.500> value

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
as the r9 280x as well as far as value

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.800 
as the r9 280x as well as far as value
is<00:04:59.040> concerned<00:04:59.520> as<00:04:59.880> far<00:05:00.000> as<00:05:00.180> performance<00:05:00.360> they

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
is concerned as far as performance they

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.660 
is concerned as far as performance they
seem<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.080> perform<00:05:01.590> pretty<00:05:01.800> similarly<00:05:02.250> some

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
seem to perform pretty similarly some

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.970 
seem to perform pretty similarly some
titles<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.150> 770<00:05:03.840> edges<00:05:04.200> out<00:05:04.320> some<00:05:04.560> titles<00:05:04.860> of

titles the 770 edges out some titles of

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.610 
titles the 770 edges out some titles of
280x<00:05:05.430> edges<00:05:05.820> out<00:05:05.940> but<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:06.750> 280x<00:05:07.170> obviously

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
280x edges out but the 280x obviously

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.040 
280x edges out but the 280x obviously

I<00:05:11.850> just<00:05:12.060> don't<00:05:12.210> think<00:05:12.420> that's<00:05:12.570> as<00:05:12.720> good<00:05:12.930> as

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
I just don't think that's as good as

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.560 
I just don't think that's as good as
what<00:05:13.320> AMD<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:13.740> offering<00:05:14.220> in<00:05:14.820> my<00:05:15.060> opinion<00:05:15.330> also

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
what AMD is offering in my opinion also

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.290 
what AMD is offering in my opinion also
watch<00:05:15.840> dogs<00:05:16.080> is<00:05:16.200> a<00:05:16.260> pretty<00:05:16.470> mediocre<00:05:16.980> game<00:05:17.640> I

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
watch dogs is a pretty mediocre game I

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.790 
watch dogs is a pretty mediocre game I
might<00:05:18.720> get<00:05:18.810> some<00:05:18.990> flak<00:05:19.200> for<00:05:19.380> that<00:05:19.440> but<00:05:19.770> uh

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
might get some flak for that but uh

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.320 
might get some flak for that but uh
that's<00:05:20.340> just<00:05:20.430> my<00:05:20.610> opinion<00:05:20.640> I<00:05:21.000> didn't<00:05:21.210> like

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
that's just my opinion I didn't like

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330 
that's just my opinion I didn't like
that<00:05:21.480> game<00:05:21.660> too<00:05:21.900> much<00:05:22.050> but<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.830> wanted<00:05:23.100> to<00:05:23.190> throw

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
that game too much but I wanted to throw

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.920 
that game too much but I wanted to throw
this<00:05:23.610> in<00:05:23.790> video<00:05:24.000> card<00:05:24.270> on<00:05:24.390> there<00:05:24.570> because<00:05:24.810> in

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
this in video card on there because in

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.930 
this in video card on there because in
my<00:05:25.050> opinion<00:05:25.170> is<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:25.650> best<00:05:25.680> value<00:05:26.190> oriented

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
my opinion is the best value oriented

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.960 
my opinion is the best value oriented
and<00:05:27.150> that<00:05:27.570> a<00:05:27.600> card<00:05:27.990> that<00:05:28.140> nvidia<00:05:28.500> has<00:05:28.560> in<00:05:29.490> terms

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
and that a card that nvidia has in terms

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.890 
and that a card that nvidia has in terms
of<00:05:30.150> performance<00:05:30.390> to<00:05:30.930> price<00:05:31.370> also<00:05:32.370> in<00:05:33.120> video<00:05:33.570> is

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
of performance to price also in video is

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.170 
of performance to price also in video is
definitely<00:05:34.710> beating<00:05:35.220> AMD<00:05:35.670> as<00:05:35.820> far<00:05:36.060> as

card<00:05:48.210> I<00:05:48.270> think<00:05:48.480> shadow<00:05:48.780> play<00:05:49.080> is<00:05:49.110> one<00:05:49.350> of<00:05:49.410> the

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
card I think shadow play is one of the

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.320 
card I think shadow play is one of the
big<00:05:49.650> reasons<00:05:49.680> for<00:05:50.370> that<00:05:50.460> because<00:05:50.940> so<00:05:51.240> many

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
into YouTube and live streaming so an

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.370 
into YouTube and live streaming so an
nvidia<00:06:20.910> card<00:06:21.150> makes<00:06:21.360> it<00:06:21.480> a<00:06:21.510> lot<00:06:21.600> easier<00:06:21.840> to<00:06:22.140> do

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
nvidia card makes it a lot easier to do

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.190 
nvidia card makes it a lot easier to do
that<00:06:22.530> obviously<00:06:23.150> AMD<00:06:24.150> you<00:06:24.600> can<00:06:24.780> get<00:06:24.930> something

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
that obviously AMD you can get something

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.020 
that obviously AMD you can get something
like<00:06:25.350> exploit<00:06:25.980> but<00:06:26.190> in<00:06:26.370> my<00:06:26.520> opinion<00:06:26.640> shadow

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
like exploit but in my opinion shadow

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.670 
like exploit but in my opinion shadow
place<00:06:27.240> you're<00:06:27.420> so<00:06:27.630> much<00:06:27.840> better<00:06:27.960> than<00:06:28.080> exploit

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
place you're so much better than exploit

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.850 
place you're so much better than exploit
and<00:06:29.490> it's<00:06:30.300> free<00:06:30.600> xsplit<00:06:31.080> you<00:06:31.170> gotta<00:06:31.320> pay<00:06:31.500> 15

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
and it's free xsplit you gotta pay 15

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.200 
and it's free xsplit you gotta pay 15
bucks<00:06:32.040> every<00:06:32.190> three<00:06:32.460> months<00:06:32.670> obviously<00:06:33.090> you

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
bucks every three months obviously you

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.120 
bucks every three months obviously you
can<00:06:33.360> do<00:06:33.480> piracy<00:06:34.050> but<00:06:34.260> let's<00:06:34.710> not<00:06:34.770> get<00:06:35.010> into

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
can do piracy but let's not get into

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.310 
can do piracy but let's not get into
that<00:06:35.280> what<00:06:35.880> we're<00:06:36.090> talking<00:06:36.570> legal<00:06:36.870> stuff<00:06:37.080> here

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
that what we're talking legal stuff here

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.700 
that what we're talking legal stuff here
you<00:06:37.350> can<00:06:37.560> pirate<00:06:37.710> games<00:06:38.360> 24<00:06:39.360> mb's<00:06:39.900> promotions

you can pirate games 24 mb's promotions

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.190 
you can pirate games 24 mb's promotions
let's<00:06:41.220> not<00:06:41.370> get<00:06:41.520> into<00:06:41.640> that<00:06:41.790> but<00:06:42.150> yeah<00:06:42.780> that's

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
let's not get into that but yeah that's

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.750 
let's not get into that but yeah that's
why<00:06:43.380> I<00:06:43.410> want<00:06:43.620> to<00:06:43.680> throw<00:06:43.830> the<00:06:43.980> 770<00:06:44.580> and<00:06:44.670> there

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
why I want to throw the 770 and there

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.310 
why I want to throw the 770 and there
just<00:06:44.790> because<00:06:45.150> of<00:06:45.390> things<00:06:45.570> like<00:06:45.630> shadow<00:06:45.990> play

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
just because of things like shadow play

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.710 
just because of things like shadow play
I<00:06:46.500> just<00:06:46.710> and<00:06:46.980> adaptive<00:06:47.790> vsync<00:06:47.940> I<00:06:48.270> also<00:06:48.480> think

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
I just and adaptive vsync I also think

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.930 
I just and adaptive vsync I also think
is<00:06:48.870> a<00:06:48.900> killer<00:06:49.140> feature<00:06:49.440> I<00:06:49.800> just<00:06:50.520> wanted<00:06:50.730> throw

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
is a killer feature I just wanted throw

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.750 
is a killer feature I just wanted throw
the<00:06:51.030> 770<00:06:51.660> in<00:06:51.810> there<00:06:51.990> for<00:06:52.170> that<00:06:52.410> reason<00:06:52.740> I<00:06:53.130> don't

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
the 770 in there for that reason I don't

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.130 
the 770 in there for that reason I don't
think<00:06:53.970> those<00:06:54.120> features<00:06:54.480> are<00:06:54.570> enough<00:06:54.960> to

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.140 
think those features are enough to

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.630 
think those features are enough to
outweigh<00:06:55.500> the<00:06:55.650> benefits<00:06:56.070> of<00:06:56.190> the<00:06:56.310> AMD

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:56.640 
outweigh the benefits of the AMD

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.820 
outweigh the benefits of the AMD
graphics<00:06:56.790> cards<00:06:57.330> though<00:06:57.510> as<00:06:58.260> far<00:06:58.470> as<00:06:58.590> the<00:06:58.680> free

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
graphics cards though as far as the free

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.680 
graphics cards though as far as the free
games<00:06:59.100> go<00:06:59.280> but<00:06:59.490> that's<00:06:59.670> just<00:06:59.820> my<00:07:00.000> opinion<00:07:00.030> some

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
games go but that's just my opinion some

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.900 
games go but that's just my opinion some
people<00:07:00.990> will<00:07:01.140> see<00:07:01.320> it<00:07:01.350> differently<00:07:01.700> so<00:07:02.700> yeah

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:02.910 
people will see it differently so yeah

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.030 
people will see it differently so yeah
