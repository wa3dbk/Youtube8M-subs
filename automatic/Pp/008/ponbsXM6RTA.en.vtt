00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.130
 although it is difficult to believe that someone 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.840
 can sleep with that the fans words do not 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.480
 they knew who was letting out the 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.070
 dog every night the aliens the 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.070
 animal protectors the cat 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.700
 world fans will never know it because if 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.110
 can sleep with this noise can 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.110
 sleep hearing anything 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.140
 Medusa does not have problems to lower the 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.210
 tree ball what is amazing 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.719
 since its owner has no idea how 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.719
 bat 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.780
 when he's not looking for bad shots 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.380
 in the trees he is looking for the frisbee 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.380
 above the ceiling 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.860
 well done 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.860
 when I arrive at the birthday party 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.540
 it's like that shadow promised that he would be 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.120
 who would break the piÃ±ata the next 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.330
 year and started training as soon as I arrived 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.330
 to home 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.140
 the luck is 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.750
 maybe it's small and slow but that's not 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.229
 it prevents my staff from combining a day 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.229
 in the nba 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.270
 nobody told him that small dogs do not 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.270
 can score 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.409
 after seeing this gigantic ball of 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.969
 exercises in a night infomercial the 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.520
 full breast and decided to leave aside 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.049
 ice cream and pick up the phone by 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.700
 Unfortunately, this is the first time 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.030
 out of the box since it is arriving ago 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.030
 seven months 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.320
 where is jenny's mom in 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.439
 packing a liter of ice cream 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.439
 chocolate 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.460
 wimbledon is full of traditions not 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.670
 it was until 1977 that they introduced 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.230
 the collectors in 1980 was allowed the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.860
 First mixed team of boys and girls 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.319
 In 1985 the girls managed to collect 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.060
 get to the center court but how 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.380
 the traditionalists will react when 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.940
 the officers manage to change them 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.390
 rigorism without producing dogs 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.920
 collectors and even more important how 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.510
 players will react when 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.510
 dogs are worth the balls 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.099
 if it is true that the docile will inherit 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.200
 the earth then meet the new ones 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.000
 landowners rents are cheap the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.469
 Security deposit is low but if 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.870
 they need to be fixed something in 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:45.200
 you will have to fix them 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.200
 same 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.569
 some call them commercial but I 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.310
 I think of them as very movies 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.879
 short that star articles 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.879
 specific without the boring argument 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.879
 let's enjoy 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.580
 when returning a black off the goat 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.930
 decided that the chair is very soft and 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.750
 he realized he's in the story 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.090
 wrong 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.090
 a horse tries to catch a dog 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.870
 and a rabbit plays in my backyard 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.120
 around the bitch roses 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.260
 when we return to the animals more 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.310
 funny from the totally new planet 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.040
 we continue with the animals more 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.040
 funny from the totally new planet 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.239
 remember that song about the ant and 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.849
 the rubber plant the ant never gets 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.909
 he surrendered but in any way he wants 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.409
 an ant with a rubber plant here 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.120
 there are some animals that have never been 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.120
 reentry treats and tries again 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.200
 in an ironic twist of life this 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.650
 hamster was so smart as to invent 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.650
 that wheel 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.599
 but not enough to put him 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.599
 a brake 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.920
 how 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.269
 hey hey what's going on here mouse 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.039
 Rat food goes well thanks 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.539
 trying to overcome the humiliation by 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.009
 never having finished the maze in the 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.530
 Eighth year science class of the 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.479
 Miss March Maclovio was going to put that 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.979
 nut through the correct hole without 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.979
 import how many times I tried it 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.390
 or not 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.820
 or not 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.780
 you just need to beat the hen in the 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.780
 game of snakes and stairs 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.669
 that's how you make a cat take off 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.669
 of your way 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.880
 keep stinging the tail until it 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.950
 Realize that you are only about 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.430
 centimeters of being a strong pain of 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.430
 rear 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.480
 normally this goat would only try 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.160
 once climb the recliner but 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.870
 wants to have a good seat to see the 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.940
 award-winning documentary on television 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.940
 open on the net the kid goat 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.670
 it must be the week of the promises 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.690
 love our open television 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.690
 bags are so rich 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.830
 not good that a boy leave his best 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.930
 friend for a girl 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.520
 the only reason why jimmy was going 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.210
 before the beach was to play with 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.009
 brock 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.600
 now the girl enters the scene and 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.600
 it seems that blog did not exist 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:02.350
 do not be so obvious friends and no blog is going to 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.350
 drop the soup on that disadvantage 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.690
 that is a good way 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.860
 although he's been watching the cowboys 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.010
 for two years and still do not know how 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.010
 throw 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.490
 however you know several songs in 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.490
 the harmonica 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.550
 a rodeo horse am 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.320
 and now let's review the animal mail 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.280
 occurs or animal 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.470
 here we have a large peninsula letter 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.030
 iowa and says dear keegan michael is 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.750
 true that some fish do not know how to swim 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.580
 sign your biggest fan in all iowa larry 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.680
 maggiolo weeks 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.330
 thanks for your concise note larry to the 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.610
 people find it hard to believe this but 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.440
 some fish can not swim and it seems 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.860
 that others forget to do it on average 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.860
 armful
