00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.859 
they sound way better than anything that
I<00:01:46.409> expected<00:01:47.070> them<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.220> sound<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.759> let's<00:01:48.659> put

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
I expected them to sound like let's put

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.780 
I expected them to sound like let's put
this<00:01:48.930> into<00:01:49.110> perspective<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:50.460> little

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
this into perspective this little

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.460 
this into perspective this little
speaker<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.299> about<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.720> size<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
speaker is about the size of one of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.120 
speaker is about the size of one of
those<00:01:52.710> woofers<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.470> 30<00:01:55.470> bucks<00:01:55.710> this

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
those woofers and this is 30 bucks this

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.490 
those woofers and this is 30 bucks this
is<00:01:56.340> 50<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.570> about<00:01:57.719> one<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.140> half<00:01:58.170> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
is 50 so for about one and a half you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.830 
is 50 so for about one and a half you
can<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> sub<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.790> poly<00:02:00.000> carbon<00:02:00.420> sub<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
can get a sub it's a poly carbon sub and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.020 
can get a sub it's a poly carbon sub and
then<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.200> get<00:02:01.380> two<00:02:02.030> directional

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
then you can get two directional

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.429 
then you can get two directional
speakers<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:05.610> has<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> 62<00:02:06.509> watt<00:02:06.750> total<00:02:07.140> system

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
speakers it has a 62 watt total system

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.309 
speakers it has a 62 watt total system
peak<00:02:07.619> power<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:09.060> sub<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> 30<00:02:09.750> Watts<00:02:10.050> up

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
peak power and the sub is a 30 Watts up

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.050 
peak power and the sub is a 30 Watts up
I<00:02:10.500> believe<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:11.280> pretty<00:02:11.580> pump

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
I believe it's pretty pump

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.870 
I believe it's pretty pump
considering<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.720> price<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.730> there's<00:02:14.730> not

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
considering the price so there's not

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.610 
considering the price so there's not
much<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.180> say<00:02:15.599> other<00:02:15.810> than<00:02:15.959> demo<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:16.590> and

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
much I can say other than demo it and

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.140 
much I can say other than demo it and
show<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.069> future<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.610> let's<00:02:17.790> do<00:02:17.970> that

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
show you the future so let's do that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.089 
show you the future so let's do that
right<00:02:18.360> now<00:02:18.390> first<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.349> all<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.709> what<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:19.980> the

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
right now first of all and what is the

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.680 
right now first of all and what is the
most<00:02:20.310> noticeable<00:02:20.670> thing<00:02:21.060> about<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.450> device

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
most noticeable thing about the device

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.630 
most noticeable thing about the device
which<00:02:21.930> i<00:02:22.050> think<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.349> designed<00:02:22.770> very<00:02:22.980> well<00:02:23.430> is

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
which i think is designed very well is

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.360 
which i think is designed very well is
this<00:02:24.180> hockey<00:02:24.569> puck<00:02:24.930> controller<00:02:25.470> now<00:02:26.099> it<00:02:26.220> has<00:02:26.340> a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
this hockey puck controller now it has a

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.860 
this hockey puck controller now it has a
little<00:02:26.670> rubber<00:02:26.849> feet<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.270> bottom<00:02:27.390> and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
little rubber feet on the bottom and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.960 
little rubber feet on the bottom and
then<00:02:28.470> they're<00:02:28.709> actually<00:02:29.010> foam<00:02:29.250> foam<00:02:29.580> feet<00:02:29.849> on

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
then they're actually foam foam feet on

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.640 
then they're actually foam foam feet on
the<00:02:30.120> bottom<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.599> then<00:02:30.870> you're<00:02:31.290> going<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.440> see

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
the bottom and then you're going to see

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.860 
the bottom and then you're going to see
this<00:02:31.800> little<00:02:32.239> directional<00:02:33.239> pad<00:02:33.420> with<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.690> bunch

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
this little directional pad with a bunch

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.540 
this little directional pad with a bunch
of<00:02:33.959> different<00:02:34.290> nifty<00:02:34.769> utilities<00:02:35.340> now<00:02:35.489> I'm

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
of different nifty utilities now I'm

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.220 
of different nifty utilities now I'm
gonna<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:35.849> into<00:02:36.030> these<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.209> specific<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.080> show

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
gonna go into these in specific and show

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.530 
gonna go into these in specific and show
you<00:02:37.290> exactly<00:02:37.709> what<00:02:38.069> they<00:02:38.220> do<00:02:38.280> first<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.300> all<00:02:39.360> if

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
you exactly what they do first of all if

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.089 
you exactly what they do first of all if
you<00:02:39.630> see<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:39.900> little<00:02:39.959> nub<00:02:40.500> that's

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
you see this little nub that's

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.979 
you see this little nub that's
rotational<00:02:41.819> for<00:02:42.030> about<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.480> much<00:02:42.720> distance

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
rotational for about that much distance

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.900 
rotational for about that much distance
and<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.470> allows<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.069> control<00:02:44.370> volume

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and that allows you to control volume

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.600 
and that allows you to control volume
now<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.660> glossy<00:02:46.230> as<00:02:46.470> are<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.130> actual

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
now it is glossy as are the actual

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.960 
now it is glossy as are the actual
satellites<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:50.100> will<00:02:50.250> notice<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.790> at

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
satellites so you will notice that at

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.340 
satellites so you will notice that at
fingerprints<00:02:51.420> pretty<00:02:51.720> easy<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.140> that's<00:02:52.260> a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
fingerprints pretty easy and that's a

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.229 
fingerprints pretty easy and that's a
bit<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:52.860> turn-off<00:02:53.100> but<00:02:53.340> considering<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
bit of a turn-off but considering the

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.710 
bit of a turn-off but considering the
price<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.660> really<00:02:54.959> can't<00:02:55.200> complain<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:57.150> as<00:02:57.540> we

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
price you really can't complain so as we

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.410 
price you really can't complain so as we
noted<00:02:58.019> earlier<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.739> rotates<00:02:59.280> for<00:02:59.910> volume<00:03:00.120> on

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
noted earlier this rotates for volume on

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.780 
noted earlier this rotates for volume on
the<00:03:00.930> side<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.319> are<00:03:01.349> going<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.739> find<00:03:01.980> an<00:03:02.190> on-off

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
the side we are going to find an on-off

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.789 
the side we are going to find an on-off
switch<00:03:02.959> when<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:03.989> turn<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.290> on<00:03:04.410> switch<00:03:04.530> on

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
switch when you turn the on switch on

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.830 
switch when you turn the on switch on
it'll<00:03:05.250> turn<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.519> speaker's<00:03:05.880> on<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.690> whole

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
it'll turn the speaker's on the whole

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.089 
it'll turn the speaker's on the whole
thing<00:03:07.049> I<00:03:07.200> mean<00:03:07.349> there's<00:03:07.500> not<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:07.980> the

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
thing I mean there's not this is the

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.210 
thing I mean there's not this is the
only<00:03:08.250> power<00:03:08.519> switch<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.920> can<00:03:11.069> actually

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
only power switch so you can actually

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.130 
only power switch so you can actually
physically<00:03:11.730> turn<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.150> off<00:03:12.269> unlike<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.660> lot<00:03:13.049> of

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
physically turn it off unlike a lot of

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.449 
physically turn it off unlike a lot of
computer<00:03:13.530> speakers<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:14.069> just<00:03:14.250> stay<00:03:14.430> on

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
computer speakers that just stay on

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.449 
computer speakers that just stay on
because<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.239> power<00:03:15.989> switch<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.380> an<00:03:16.530> obscure

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
because the power switch is an obscure

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.400 
because the power switch is an obscure
spot<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.239> can<00:03:18.359> completely<00:03:18.840> turn<00:03:19.049> these<00:03:19.230> off

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
spot you can completely turn these off

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.750 
spot you can completely turn these off
and<00:03:19.590> they<00:03:19.680> don't<00:03:19.769> consume<00:03:20.100> any<00:03:20.280> power<00:03:20.609> when

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
and they don't consume any power when

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.039 
and they don't consume any power when
you're<00:03:20.910> not<00:03:21.030> using<00:03:21.269> them<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:21.660> that's<00:03:21.840> kind<00:03:22.019> of

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
you're not using them so that's kind of

little

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:03.809 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:06.269 

so<00:05:04.809> I<00:05:04.839> cranked<00:05:05.169> that<00:05:05.349> up<00:05:05.499> really<00:05:05.860> loud<00:05:05.979> you<00:05:06.039> can

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
so you can do the whole spectrum but

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:15.189 
doesn't this store mostly because it

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:16.799 
doesn't this store mostly because it
