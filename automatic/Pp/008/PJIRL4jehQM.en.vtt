00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.219
 to 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.650
 ah 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.880
 and that people mean them 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.590
 welcome to this new video in this 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.350
 occasion I bring you a solution to 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.440
 minecraft that maybe some have 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.080
 some not as you can see here is this 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.170
 the error in the minecraft launcher that 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.910
 it appears I do not name you of inflated delay 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.550
 game and although you want to give input 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.440
 gain they give login it hurts to send the 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.949
 error and even if you want to give it in 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.129
 photoshop 'date give login and it's the same 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.940
 that here the only good solution is 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:55.860
 solution that I have found is 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.690
 download this upgradeable minecraft and 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.989
 as you can see if they know they know that 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.659
 open app data they will vote the folder 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.240
 but there's nothing that makes it not 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.890
 is downloaded ok what we have to 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.409
 to do is download this minecraft 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.409
 updatable we execute it 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.640
 open up 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.440
 is 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.550
 now since it is executed we put a 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.130
 Username 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.350
 we put the one we use but this one does not 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.070
 we will serve design so for this one 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.380
 do not worry you get in force update and 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.420
 they give interdin 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.759
 now as you can see it is already 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.939
 downloading the necessary packages or 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.390
 be everything you need minecraft to 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:49.780
 that we can play now just 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.890
 let's wait for it to finish downloading 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.520
 the minecraft and we continue to explain them 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.520
 what follows 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.370
 this error is a bit weird very few 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.960
 Sometimes it appears but when it seems it is 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.940
 half annoyed because you stay and 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.100
 formative development my computer and 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.640
 I wanted to install minecraft and now how 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.680
 I do it but as you can see there is already 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.180
 they installed and he installed this 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.330
 minecraft that is updatable as 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.960
 can see and is 1.4 point 6 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.870
 as you can see here simply 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.440
 a username does not appear 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.800
 they can use whatever it is and do not use 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.710
 your legitimate minecraft account ok now 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.830
 what they have to do is this already 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.560
 we can forget we do not listen to him and 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.640
 we have to open our and our 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.460
 manchester which we occupy that is this 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.510
 for the one who teaches them to download the 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.000
 I leave here the link to be seen and 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:00.370
 how can you see to see what is schuster 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.370
 proxy now we open it 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.800
 and here it appears that he was already 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.060
 preloaded because as you can see if 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.390
 we open another arrope data 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.150
 our things are already there 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.290
 our minecraft downloaded all 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.049
 our files that we need 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.370
 and ok now as I was about to determine 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.700
 this user name we simply put 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.020
 mean our account our password 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.870
 we have to remember 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.420
 if we want we will give it a force rate again 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.700
 we give you in login and as you can see another 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.030
 Once it is updating us more than 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.260
 nothing to update according to the 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.110
 client that we are using that is the 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.140
 minister 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.340
 and again wait for the download to 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.319
 that we can start 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.900
 and this is how this problem is solved 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.569
 the truth I was looking for it and not what 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.510
 I found I could not find the solution and 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:04.530
 well that's not like something the truth is that 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.930
 i had to Imogene and see that it is 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.540
 solve the problem based on another 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.469
 Minecraft 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.989
 ok and well as you can see we have already opened 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:17.720
 our minecraft is already without problems 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.450
 And the only thing that remains is 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.090
 To return to 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.370
 and play if we already have our worlds 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.420
 here saved as for example me here 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.980
 I already had about three that does not session 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.390
 a backup we do not usually go here to our 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.020
 our minecraft not our folder 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.020
 installation 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.849
 we hit 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.360
 and as you can see here are our 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.360
 worlds 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.720
 and to see if it is that they have to 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:54.660
 convert good 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:58.490
 and how can you see here oh god 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:03.600
