00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
that I really don't think there's

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.900 
that I really don't think there's
anything<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.350> can<00:02:30.560> do<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:31.010> prevent<00:02:31.310> injury<00:02:31.820> I

anything you can do to prevent injury I

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.550 
anything you can do to prevent injury I
think<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.180> only<00:02:32.270> thing<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.540> can<00:02:32.720> do<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.170> be

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
think the only thing you can do is to be

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.980 
think the only thing you can do is to be
real<00:02:33.770> conditions<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.700> be<00:02:34.790> fit<00:02:35.030> for<00:02:35.720> if<00:02:35.840> your

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
real conditions in to be fit for if your

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.170 
real conditions in to be fit for if your
muscles<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.440> trained<00:02:36.740> well<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.670> if<00:02:38.060> they

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
muscles is trained well and if they

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.970 
muscles is trained well and if they
movement<00:02:38.660> range<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:39.020> movement<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.530> good<00:02:39.740> so<00:02:39.950> I

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
movement range of movement is good so I

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.830 
movement range of movement is good so I
think<00:02:40.070> flexibility<00:02:40.850> is<00:02:40.940> also<00:02:41.180> very<00:02:41.270> important

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
think flexibility is also very important

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.570 
think flexibility is also very important
and<00:02:42.050> how<00:02:42.320> much<00:02:42.500> time<00:02:42.770> do<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.010> spend<00:02:43.100> on

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
and how much time do you spend on

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.640 
and how much time do you spend on
flexibility<00:02:44.330> training<00:02:44.540> we<00:02:45.230> do<00:02:45.380> our<00:02:45.500> normal

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650
