had so much of this wire from those
signs<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.960> drilled<00:01:52.950> some<00:01:53.240> really<00:01:54.240> 5/8<00:01:54.689> inch

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
signs I drilled some really 5/8 inch

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380 
signs I drilled some really 5/8 inch
holes<00:01:55.189> but<00:01:56.189> actually<00:01:56.640> they're<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:56.850> 5/8

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
holes but actually they're not 5/8

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.630 
holes but actually they're not 5/8
they're<00:01:59.329> to<00:02:00.329> accommodate<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.590> then<00:02:02.490> I'm

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
they're to accommodate this and then I'm

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.929 
they're to accommodate this and then I'm
wrapping<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.420> around<00:02:04.369> some<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.520> those<00:02:05.670> so

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
wrapping that around some of those so

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.969 
wrapping that around some of those so
I'll<00:02:06.030> continue<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.600> do<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:07.890> I

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
I'll continue to do that and then I

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.680 
I'll continue to do that and then I
looks<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:08.910> they're<00:02:09.090> how<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.239> make<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> beer

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
