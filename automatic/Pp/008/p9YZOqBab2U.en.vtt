00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.920
 and 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.240
 hi friends, how are you? 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.250
 of the best and welcome to a new 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.400
 minecraft video in which I bring you 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.980
 a how-to tutorial how to do 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.890
 how to build a closet a closet a 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.160
 wardrobe then good they are practically 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.160
 synonyms then then here we have it 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.170
 As you can see it looks very good on 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.699
 everything to have it in your little house and put 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.980
 a little more seasoning where you keep 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.040
 we have two armor hung 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.899
 and below we have a big chest in the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.390
 which can I put more armors if 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.239
 they want or because and other types of items 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.250
 then you can wash yourself pretty well 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.930
 my opinion and best of all is that no 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.340
 It is only in this style closet can 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.170
 there are many designs that we will be 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.570
 seeing the first thing we're going to need 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.059
 they are four doors of which you want 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.890
 in this case use oak doors then 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.979
 two chests two supports for armors 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.960
 two wooden trapdoor six planks 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.009
 wood of which you want in the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.360
 tools with which we are going to 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.369
 work in this case because I have a 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.470
 ax and a piquito and good these 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.880
 planks that I have and this way normal 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.100
 and the quartz pillar then practically 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.440
 I have nothing for the fund, not for the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.120
 type of decoration this and for the floor 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.670
 then that is not very important 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.640
 It's also to your liking and well let's 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.890
 start what we need is to break in 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.050
 two blocks milestones like this in 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.900
 the ground and then good to say no 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.520
 I have to break wool with nobody but 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.330
 good what I have now and what there is 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.780
 then we break it and we take everything 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.670
 also this this sand we remove it and 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.000
 now we put the six wooden of this 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.740
 way to them 16 then they have to 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.590
 to be something like that more or less and both 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.940
 We put them here below, then the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.850
 four doors we're going to put 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.490
 around this very simple way the 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.500
 true and good now as health but for 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.440
 here and now we put the trapdoors of 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.060
 wood up here and then obviously the 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.410
 supports for the armor in here 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.270
 how are they going to get down there is where is 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.270
 the chest and voilà 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.209
 one of the infinite possibilities that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.850
 they have to combine this type of cabinets 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.980
 It would be good if we change the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.440
 doors we put here a plank of 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.340
 the milestones to be able to put some doors 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.230
 from fence up here we open them that go 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.959
 to be more or less like the hooks that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.600
 they hang the clothes is the idea not and then 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.470
 wooden slabs above to make it the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.810
 type of roof covering because 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.120
 the trap doors, because practically no 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.350
 they would combine because nothing else we have of 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.820
 these and iron then 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.430
 unfortunately we do not have all 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.560
 the woods which would be beautiful but 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.810
 well at the moment there is no good then 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.450
 the finished thing we can put frames of items 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.120
 and then we put this block would be something 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.390
 inside that part and it looks very 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.850
 well the truth is this closet has 162 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.100
 spaces to store things then 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.040
 they are super beautiful as a conversion 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.230
 three chests then as if in addition it 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.660
 we close and sebastián the ones that are best seen 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.480
 it's one that those who really see it 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.829
 towards the distance and if this is a closet 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.670
 definitely and well too 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.590
 they can change 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.989
 background so why does it fit more with 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.360
 what would be your wardrobe then I would 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.920
 I think there are quite a few combinations that 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.140
 you can get to do with 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.790
 these cabinets that I bring you then 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.319
 well, practically I think it has 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.209
 been all before the video term 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.610

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.100

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.890
 the installer in the mods because the 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.320
 installers come out with that icon in the 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.030
 measure of the times then well if 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.940
 you just have to open it so that 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.230
 you get out then the installation menu does not 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.570
 it's not a book that you have to put the 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.950
 folder maybe that helps you see in 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.990

 read most but surely out there 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.180
 I missed one or the other but in 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.850
 twitter I believe that there I do not know 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.860
 nothing escapes because it is so much better 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.960

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.000

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.400
 simple to make closets or closets 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.870
 trade of said closets then then 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.240
 I do not know to me it makes me that they are very well 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.039
 and then it is definitely a decoration 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.509
 excellent to take in clear then 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.190
 but Greece has been useful if it was 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.530
 well do not forget about ham like that 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.180
 it helps a lot and if you want and that 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.220
 they want more tutorials on how to build 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.830
 epic things we see each other until the 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.830
