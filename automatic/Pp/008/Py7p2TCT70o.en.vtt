woods this kind of gray yellow you

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.770 
woods this kind of gray yellow you
really<00:00:37.469> lend<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.160> some<00:00:38.399> interesting<00:00:39.000> stain

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
patterns once you put a clear coat on it

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.430 
patterns once you put a clear coat on it
the<00:00:42.090> finish<00:00:42.420> really<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.260> look

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the finish really can can look

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.869 
the finish really can can look
outstanding<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> depth<00:00:44.550> you've<00:00:44.760> got<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
outstanding with the depth you've got a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.750 
outstanding with the depth you've got a
lot<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.149> depth<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:46.100> Buckeye<00:00:47.100> burl<00:00:47.370> which<00:00:47.640> I

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
lot of depth in Buckeye burl which I

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.549 
lot of depth in Buckeye burl which I
really<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.780> go<00:00:48.930> through<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.230> start

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
really like as you go through and start

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.840 
really like as you go through and start
playing<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.070> different<00:00:50.430> pieces<00:00:50.579> I

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
playing with the different pieces I

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.470 
playing with the different pieces I
actually<00:00:51.030> think<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:52.530> probably<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.949> best

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
actually think this is probably the best

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.090 
actually think this is probably the best
flame<00:00:54.480> pattern<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.350> because<00:00:55.739> you've<00:00:55.920> got

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
flame pattern here because you've got

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.220 
flame pattern here because you've got
flame<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.539> got<00:00:57.690> flame<00:00:57.899> running

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
flame here you got flame running

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.110 
flame here you got flame running
throughout<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.649> whole<00:00:58.800> body<00:00:58.980> then<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.000> got

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
throughout the whole body then you got

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.490 
throughout the whole body then you got
the<00:01:00.239> coloring<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.870> outside<00:01:01.289> I'll

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the coloring on the outside I'll

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.020 
the coloring on the outside I'll
probably<00:01:01.710> go<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.730> terms<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
probably go with this in terms of

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539 
probably go with this in terms of
workability<00:01:03.680> Buckeye<00:01:04.680> burl<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.430> bit

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
workability Buckeye burl is a little bit

along those lines but it's it's a really

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.440 
along those lines but it's it's a really
nice<00:01:27.720> piece<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.650> wood<00:01:28.970> in<00:01:29.970> terms<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
nice piece of wood in terms of

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.539 
nice piece of wood in terms of
workability<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.500> doesn't<00:01:31.829> scratch<00:01:32.369> up

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
workability it really doesn't scratch up

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.100 
workability it really doesn't scratch up
your<00:01:32.700> tools<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.150> want<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.420> clean<00:01:33.659> off<00:01:33.840> this

your tools you want to clean off this

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.600 
your tools you want to clean off this
it'll<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> little<00:01:34.950> bit<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.189> sanding

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it'll just be a little bit of sanding

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.630 
it'll just be a little bit of sanding
sands<00:01:36.540> very<00:01:36.840> well<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.799> know<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.100> soft

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
sands very well you know this soft

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.490 
sands very well you know this soft
I'd<00:01:38.729> say<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.090> somewhat<00:01:39.420> comparable<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
I'd say it's somewhat comparable to a

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.550 
I'd say it's somewhat comparable to a
hard<00:01:41.250> piece<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.549> spalted<00:01:42.210> maple<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:43.140> terms<00:01:43.409> of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
hard piece of spalted maple in terms of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.590 
hard piece of spalted maple in terms of
kind<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> feel<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.490> would<00:01:44.610> say<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.240> know

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
kind of the feel I would say you know

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.569 
kind of the feel I would say you know
faulted<00:01:46.079> maple<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.590> lot<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.070> spongy<00:01:47.490> at

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
faulted maple is a lot more spongy at

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.389 
faulted maple is a lot more spongy at
times<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> think<00:01:48.270> there's<00:01:48.450> certain<00:01:49.399> pieces

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
times and I think there's certain pieces

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
times and I think there's certain pieces
of<00:01:50.579> Buckeye<00:01:51.119> burl<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.869> that

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
of Buckeye burl that you can get that

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.800 
of Buckeye burl that you can get that
can<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.470> spongy<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:54.210> wood<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.479> definitely

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
can be spongy so this wood is definitely

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.209 
can be spongy so this wood is definitely
not<00:01:54.899> for<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.049> faint<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.380> heart<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.979> probably

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
not for the faint of heart it's probably

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.499 
not for the faint of heart it's probably
easier<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.520> work<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.729> than<00:01:57.000> spalted<00:01:57.479> maple

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
easier to work with than spalted maple

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.260 
easier to work with than spalted maple
but<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.590> will<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.860> some<00:01:58.920> spongy<00:01:59.880> pieces

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
but you will get some spongy pieces

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.880 
but you will get some spongy pieces
every<00:02:00.869> once<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.170> while<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.560> got<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.799> be

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
every once in while that you got to be

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.980 
every once in while that you got to be
aware<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.790> buy<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.509> know

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
aware of that if you buy this you know

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.139 
aware of that if you buy this you know
it<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.140> very<00:02:04.290> expensive<00:02:04.740> for<00:02:05.490> guitar<00:02:05.880> table

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
it is very expensive for guitar table

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.290 
it is very expensive for guitar table
terms<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.200> tap<00:02:07.380> tone<00:02:07.680> now<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.759> being<00:02:09.000> said

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
terms of tap tone now that being said

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.190 
terms of tap tone now that being said
it's<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.989> tad<00:02:10.229> spongy<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.890> piece<00:02:11.069> actually

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
it's a tad spongy this piece actually

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.430 
it's a tad spongy this piece actually
sounds<00:02:13.200> pretty<00:02:13.350> good<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.959> say<00:02:15.959> it's<00:02:16.110> brighter

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
sounds pretty good I say it's brighter

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.960 
sounds pretty good I say it's brighter
than<00:02:16.800> some<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.280> other<00:02:17.430> pieces<00:02:17.670> I've

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
than some of the other pieces I've

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.490 
than some of the other pieces I've
played<00:02:18.750> with<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.410> pretty<00:02:19.770> solid

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.680 

so<00:02:25.500> really<00:02:25.800> have<00:02:26.150> don't<00:02:27.150> have<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.270> whole<00:02:27.480> lot<00:02:27.660> of

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
so really have don't have a whole lot of

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.880 
so really have don't have a whole lot of
it<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:28.170> really<00:02:28.350> don't<00:02:28.410> have<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.620> whole<00:02:28.680> lot<00:02:28.800> of

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
it we really don't have a whole lot of

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.949 
it we really don't have a whole lot of
worries<00:02:29.250> with<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.610> piece<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.569> know<00:02:30.630> even

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
worries with this piece you know even

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.990 
worries with this piece you know even
with<00:02:31.080> some<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.590> run<00:02:32.069> out<00:02:32.250> here<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.850> some

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
with some of the run out here and some

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.150 
with some of the run out here and some
of<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.120> natural<00:02:33.300> edges<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.170> think<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:34.950> will

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
of the natural edges I think this will

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.130 
of the natural edges I think this will
make<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.430> pretty<00:02:35.610> good<00:02:35.910> tap<00:02:36.390> not<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:36.840> sure<00:02:37.020> what

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
make a pretty good tap not so sure what

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.210 
make a pretty good tap not so sure what
I'm<00:02:37.200> gonna<00:02:37.319> do<00:02:37.500> with<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.890> actually<00:02:38.040> a

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
I'm gonna do with it is actually a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.020 
I'm gonna do with it is actually a
pretty<00:02:38.459> big<00:02:38.640> piece<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:40.370> no<00:02:41.370> bulkhead<00:02:41.700> bar<00:02:41.940> well

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
pretty big piece so no bulkhead bar well

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.160 
pretty big piece so no bulkhead bar well
it's<00:02:42.180> definitely<00:02:42.510> interesting<00:02:42.630> piece<00:02:42.989> of

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
it's definitely interesting piece of

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.449 
it's definitely interesting piece of
wood<00:02:43.319> it's<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.500> little<00:02:43.680> bit<00:02:43.770> expensive<00:02:44.250> for

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
wood it's a little bit expensive for

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.850 
wood it's a little bit expensive for
what<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.060> do<00:02:45.269> but<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:45.959> figured<00:02:46.350> I'd<00:02:46.470> buy

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
what I like to do but I figured I'd buy

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.900 
what I like to do but I figured I'd buy
a<00:02:46.890> PC<00:02:47.310> off<00:02:47.459> eBay<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.030> do<00:02:48.480> review
