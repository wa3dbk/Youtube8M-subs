00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.490 
who's always been my personal mentor
since<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.220> was<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.400> little<00:02:21.610> girl<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.500> she

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
since I was a little girl and she

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.040 
since I was a little girl and she
although<00:02:24.310> they<00:02:24.520> never<00:02:24.700> call<00:02:25.510> she<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.810> Victor

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
although they never call she and Victor

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.620 
although they never call she and Victor
Kratz<00:02:26.290> never<00:02:26.560> won<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.489> Olympic<00:02:27.880> gold<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.360> think

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
Kratz never won the Olympic gold I think

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.760 
Kratz never won the Olympic gold I think
that<00:02:28.810> they<00:02:28.989> really<00:02:29.790> embody<00:02:30.790> what<00:02:31.770> Canadian

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
that they really embody what Canadian

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.740 
that they really embody what Canadian
athletes<00:02:33.580> should<00:02:33.910> really<00:02:34.150> be<00:02:34.300> like<00:02:34.510> they're

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
athletes should really be like they're

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.430 
athletes should really be like they're
always<00:02:34.989> positive<00:02:35.860> and

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
always positive and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.490 
always positive and
energetic<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.520> they<00:02:38.300> represent<00:02:38.810> Canada<00:02:38.990> so

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
energetic and they represent Canada so

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.400 
energetic and they represent Canada so
well<00:02:39.770> with<00:02:40.730> how<00:02:41.120> nice<00:02:41.480> they<00:02:41.690> are<00:02:41.750> kind<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.490> and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
well with how nice they are kind and and

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.750 
well with how nice they are kind and and
they<00:02:45.410> have<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.650> competitive<00:02:46.160> spirit<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:46.730> I

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
they have the competitive spirit so I

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.150 
they have the competitive spirit so I
think<00:02:46.880> that<00:02:47.270> they<00:02:47.840> really<00:02:48.230> are<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.770> best<00:02:48.980> in

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
think that they really are the best in

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.580 
think that they really are the best in
my<00:02:49.340> brain
