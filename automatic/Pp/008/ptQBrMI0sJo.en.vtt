00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 if a bottom cake was prepared but 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.319
 you were not very satisfied with the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.360
 result because it is too dry to give you 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.099
 an interesting idea to follow 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.620
 today in fact we will see how it does 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.900
 literally reborn a tourist is 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.210
 kind of dry oven like a delicious one 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.449
 custard filling the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.279
 chocolate let's find out together for 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.250
 prepare the custard cream the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.550
 chocolate requires 500 milliliters 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.949
 of whole semi-skimmed milk 5 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.090
 grams of bitter cocoa powder a 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.550
 pinch of salt 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.739
 a sachet of vanillin is indispensable 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.690
 or an aroma cove alla 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.140
 vanilla 4 egg yolks 90 grams of sugar 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.469
 granulated 40 grams of white flour of 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.539
 type 00 or any other starch 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:58.309
 so ample maize starch thus rendered 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.309
 of and 100 grams of chocolate purchases 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.210
 first we think a part of 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.420
 about 400 milliliters milk therefore almost 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.520
 everything in a small casserole we feel from 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.649
 part a little because we will need it in a 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.380
 second in a beater 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.380
 electric instead we pour the yolks 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:29.409
 then add the granulated sugar 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:32.850
 vanillin and a small piece of salt e 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.850
 we work in full cream 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.340
 as long as our electric mixer 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.360
 keep working now we can 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.930
 pour the dark chocolate cut 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:53.149
 pieces in very hot milk and with a 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:56.560
 postman we choose it well then 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.240
 we mix muscles on a moderate flame 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.659
 otherwise the chocolate sticks to the 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.259
 bottom of the container 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:11.450
 in the meantime we lower it as it calls it 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:16.370
 if we make flour and chocolate or 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:20.060
 better bitter cocoa in a bowl e 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.100
 now we can slowly add the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.060
 our flour mixture then of 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.970
 egg and sugar cream powders 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.580
 however, adding the remaining milk 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.170
 so as not to create a fuss and 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.370
 we continue in this way up to 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.370
 free errors of ingredients 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.510
 now our sugar egg custard 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.989
 and cocoa is ready and we can think of it 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:53.000
 in the same saucepan as the milk with the 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:55.850
 chocolate that now has melted us 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.640
 we help with a spatula to remove 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:04.100
 all the cream every now and then we mix 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.900
 so ok and now we just have to 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.600
 proceed as a classic cream 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.310
 therefore I recommend pastry 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.680
 watch out for the flame and don't do it 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.660
 otherwise boil the eggs in fact alone 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.510
 because the egg proteins I don't know 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.220
 coagulan we always continue to mix 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.049
 a foam will initially form 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.910
 superficial but then as the 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.209
 you will see that the mixture thickens 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.579
 foam disappears after a few minutes 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.500
 you will see that our cream is almost there 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.970
 perfectly equipped 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.160
 now we can also remove it from 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.200
 fire we mix another so now 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.260
 we can also let it cool to 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.030
 room temperature 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.980
 to avoid the formation of 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.709
 superficial crust 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.450
 I advise you to place a sheet 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.480
 of transparent film just a 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.790
 direct contact with your cream e 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.540
 then once cold, remove the 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.340
 film is your cream all mail 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.379
 the cakes will put the smile with 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.599
 this exquisite that they have pastry the 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.519
 chocolate you can use it precisely 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.620
 to stuff cakes or nothing 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.450
 you can also serve it as simple 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.069
 call it simple where there was the 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.560
 spoon in the latter case vi 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.510
 I advise you to mix your cream 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.799
 chocolate pastry with a part 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.799
 of karma candle
