00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
hello this presentation is going to

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.299 
hello this presentation is going to
cover<00:00:12.590> the<00:00:12.920> teaching<00:00:13.519> of<00:00:13.820> productive<00:00:14.570> skills

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
cover the teaching of productive skills

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.339 
cover the teaching of productive skills
to<00:00:16.309> start<00:00:16.520> with<00:00:16.759> if<00:00:17.180> we<00:00:17.420> think<00:00:17.660> about<00:00:17.840> the<00:00:18.200> way

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
to start with if we think about the way

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.980 
to start with if we think about the way
in<00:00:18.650> which<00:00:18.680> you<00:00:19.070> learned<00:00:19.369> your<00:00:19.970> first<00:00:20.000> language

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
in which you learned your first language

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.200 
in which you learned your first language
most<00:00:21.830> of<00:00:22.040> us<00:00:22.189> go<00:00:22.340> through<00:00:22.369> a<00:00:22.759> particular

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
most of us go through a particular

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.470 
most of us go through a particular
process<00:00:23.960> firstly<00:00:24.890> we<00:00:25.640> listen<00:00:26.060> to<00:00:26.330> those

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
process firstly we listen to those

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:43.389 
process firstly we listen to those
around<00:00:26.900> us<00:00:40.420> after<00:00:41.420> that<00:00:41.540> first<00:00:42.170> silent<00:00:42.950> period

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
around us after that first silent period

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.090 
around us after that first silent period
of<00:00:43.550> listening<00:00:43.969> to<00:00:44.239> other<00:00:44.870> people<00:00:45.379> but<00:00:45.860> then<00:00:45.980> we

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
of listening to other people but then we

00:00:46.100 --> 00:01:01.779 
of listening to other people but then we
start<00:00:46.430> to<00:00:46.640> make<00:00:47.059> utterances<00:01:00.520> having<00:01:01.520> learned

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
start to make utterances having learned

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.749 
start to make utterances having learned
to<00:01:01.969> speak<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:02.870> a<00:01:02.899> certain<00:01:03.350> extent<00:01:03.739> at<00:01:03.920> least<00:01:04.160> we

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
to speak to a certain extent at least we

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.719 
to speak to a certain extent at least we
then<00:01:04.970> go<00:01:05.149> on<00:01:05.330> to<00:01:05.600> learn<00:01:06.259> how<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.590> read<00:01:07.039> and<00:01:07.310> to

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
then go on to learn how to read and to

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:25.690 
then go on to learn how to read and to
write

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.060 

and<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:27.090> process<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:27.990> go<00:01:28.020> through<00:01:28.229> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and this process that we go through is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.880 
and this process that we go through is
actually<00:01:29.580> covering<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.300> four<00:01:30.600> skills<00:01:31.110> that

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
actually covering the four skills that

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.700 
actually covering the four skills that
we're<00:01:32.070> trying<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.490> teach<00:01:32.910> with<00:01:33.750> our<00:01:34.110> English

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
we're trying to teach with our English

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.410 
we're trying to teach with our English
students<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.330> have<00:01:36.540> listening<00:01:37.290> speaking

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
students so we have listening speaking

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.920 
students so we have listening speaking
reading<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.869> writing<00:01:41.150> if<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.390> group<00:01:42.659> those

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
reading and writing if we group those

00:01:42.930 --> 00:02:01.600 
reading and writing if we group those
skills<00:01:43.350> into<00:01:43.619> their<00:01:43.860> different<00:01:44.280> types

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.060 

then<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.789> two<00:02:02.969> skills<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.719> reading<00:02:04.619> and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
then the two skills of reading and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:16.910 
then the two skills of reading and
listening<00:02:05.369> are<00:02:05.820> known<00:02:06.360> as<00:02:06.799> receptive<00:02:07.799> skills

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.530 

whereas<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.069> skills<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.670> speaking<00:02:19.269> and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
whereas the skills of speaking and

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:29.270 
whereas the skills of speaking and
writing<00:02:19.870> are<00:02:20.319> known<00:02:20.920> as<00:02:21.280> productive<00:02:21.940> skills

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.460 

in<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.549> session<00:02:30.849> we're<00:02:31.299> going<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.569> focus<00:02:31.959> on

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
in this session we're going to focus on

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.949 
in this session we're going to focus on
the<00:02:32.680> production<00:02:33.069> skills<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:34.000> have<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.480> look<00:02:34.720> at
