00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.829
 I finally have 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.890
 more you 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.890
 let's go again 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.989
 or the chair with his schnauzi I'm super 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.790
 happy because of attractive figure 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.500
 is with questions and answers 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.030
 enough logse in channel but now 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.949
 flight with this is because it has a 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.840
 game that you like a lot and that is 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.730
 talking with strawberry trans whopper 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.250
 guys some cheese background is already 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.350
 that game that because I bought it 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.260
 for the xbox they go back not celestial 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.790
 before and well and good because it is the unit 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.000
 against next in which I have and that also 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.580
 the person of the t4 and you are because 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.170
 it comes so many times but first let 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.660
 I always present you in the background is a 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.430
 reflex layer of collecting a macro of 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.259
 the accessories that they chase is with 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.420
 some gusts also a rachita 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.780
 hidden from the map that is only in 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.190
 this map touches me in a package help 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.810
 nothing that's all about champion is not a 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.590
 great battle but for those who judge 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.960
 game 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.070
 you know what divides take out a great game 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.369
 so a screen like these 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.429
 consensus and normality but of course the 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.039
 nuclear in white as this will happen 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:39.570
 rather bad template but I do not know 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:42.930
 what is it worth is not worth games 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.479
 it has its value so nothing that I wanted 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.370
 to say he had to say that you have to 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.180
 explain why I have so much of 11 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.100
 games already left on Monday and such and why 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.620
 or for the 10th edition and because 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.330
 I bring after a week the 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.800
 last week and it's tight on 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.900
 exams for I had lots of 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.510
 exams I did not want to buy praiseworthy the 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.830
 temptation to study coronary try it 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.580
 start a little bit I did not buy it 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.540
 when all the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.820
 exams and so that I could 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.290
 concentrate the studies and well I do that 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.120
 you will not have liked much but 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.959
 only sometimes the news in others 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.090
 channels and like that and now well I 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.920
 I bring what they offer you here to offer 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.630
 for now it 's still normal, not a 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.050
 pretty good game 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.360
 and soon I will bring you a great 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.550
 starting in the ex urban mode that the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.250
 I really liked it, it was the 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.050
 better than I expected and I do not know if 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.970
 I'm even going to part of the better that 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.430
 zombies or long way because I already 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.400
 you know that in the end it was the subject of what 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.350
 that they are going to put in that they are only 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.350
 dads dedicated to zombies as well 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.350
 that 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:03.610
 nothing to say to give my first 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.970
 expressions that when they have already played 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.370
 as I do not know a few hours 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.740
 and soon this prestige and soon 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.660
 be happy even if there are 15 vestiges and 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.460
 in as much time it is only going to be one that 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.310
 I have not done it yet, although it still has to be done 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.940
 but not even forty-something I'm 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.580
 well enough level and what I had 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.709
 double dots music imagined to climb 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.040
 of level 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.660
 but the game impressions very good 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.130
 game be it changes the gameplay of 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.530
 known and completely but for 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.030
 villain is still having that essence of 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.000
 color always other more possibilities 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.459
 more strategies more of everything and forgiven 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.459
 a moment now retired on the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:56.049
 particular that is the idea is fine and 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.950
 such of blacos but without so much damage already 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.769
 it's quite killing enemies and so 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.010
 apart from that it overheats and so 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.750
 but they are not as wrong or if I think 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.370
 that would have put an improvement or 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.690
 I would have killed more but yes you have to 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.819
 admit that the gusts in this game do not 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.130
 things are very well that have their part 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.290
 good and its bad part of the magician is that 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.739
 good if it took you so much to get this 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.289
 damn streak of course clear it helps you 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.360
 the good part is that it does not kill too much 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.639
 and makes higher dishes here is the 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.370
 hidden streak of this map that is called 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.330
 collected but clear to the children of the sun 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.460
 project is like 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:41.990
 x did not trust himself but something giant is 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.479
 something like that only the radios or the action 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.189
 of notes but much later then 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.680
 I moved here for each other and not 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:52.099
 he gave nothing the real crap of 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.960
 streak but good and if you're talking to me 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.240
 of my first game impressions 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.000
 like the weapons then simply flip 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.009
 the speed the frontage that Ã¡lex or 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.750
 suit on these medium maps that that 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.240
 half the small one with the lame but 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.770
 what did I get there is a frantic and 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.659
 incredible speed and it's also a lot 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.190
 strategic with the city now 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:14.630
 write to do much more movements 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:17.570
 to avoid bullets and 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.500
 then melee attacks body to 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.050
 body 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.060
 I'm fine, but it will not be 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.610
 just flipping and water back the 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.830
 emblem editor mode league now and 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.730
 character customization has gotten 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.730
 almost all of the two the marches after 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.590
 you can improve them after creating classes 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.200
 basically telling the COFUPRO 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.660
 the streaks have gotten the medal of 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.580
 nuclear that is now more fierce but 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.220
 but he has also gotten something is like 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.190
 love called adn boom or both 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.440
 then he mounted the coptos and water mode 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.420
 on top of modern warfare 3 every time 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.360
 so I mean infected game modes and 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.210
 is such that is it is or psychological 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.830
 short and perfect and with criticize more 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.000
 will be exported this is not what I say or 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.830
 be 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.660
 It is confirmed that it took two years in 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:14.410
 a better year that will stay for a long time 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.810
 time what happens that has that 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.580
 disadvantage that they do not have subscribed and is 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.770
 it's very easy to mess up the streak 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.480
 a person who is playing well because 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:29.060
 with the suit it is very easy to cross in the 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.710
 map side by side or in your connection 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.320
 costume of a few saints and these 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:37.640
 appears on the back to a guy who 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.290
 better is on a run of 29 and so far 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.419
 the streak 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.540
 the guy is playing well and I hope 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:46.780
 good maybe they're arrested I do not know 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.910
 but I think that as 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.030
 It is these people who try very hard in 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.560
 do the game well and do it like the 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.630
 people like it has been saying up 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.360
 now individual to poke became 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.040
 after christian until now then I 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.360
 I think that also the rational hands if 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.360
 they will continue to do so they will 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.430
 update or I know but I know 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.800
 will slip something is every this people that 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:12.430
 so for me they have already created the best 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.380
 short of the story and I listen to it and 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.210
 nothing if you liked this video give it to 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.430
 like do not forget to subscribe if not yet 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.380
 you are and if you guys this has been all 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.780
 what they had to wear or express themselves 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:27.270
 liked as I said and nothing we 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.270
 we see in the next video bye bye 

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.020
 Y
