Prix and later on of course you would
definitely<00:00:37.920> want<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.220> horse<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.670> double

bits the normal snaffle bridle has one

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.819 
bits the normal snaffle bridle has one
bit<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.390> course<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.110> normal<00:00:46.380> snaffle

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
bit so of course the normal snaffle

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.290 
bit so of course the normal snaffle
bridle<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.480> case<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.969> I'll<00:00:50.969> show

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
bridle in this case is just I'll show

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.489 
bridle in this case is just I'll show
you<00:00:51.359> the<00:00:51.570> bit<00:00:51.750> has<00:00:53.390> loose<00:00:54.390> ring<00:00:54.749> at<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.260> side

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:55.499 
you the bit has loose ring at the side

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:57.860 
you the bit has loose ring at the side
that<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:55.920> Rings<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.309> able<00:00:56.609> to<00:00:56.640> move<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that the Rings are able to move and it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.779 
that the Rings are able to move and it
has<00:00:58.019> a<00:00:58.050> French<00:00:58.469> link<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> middle<00:00:59.280> which

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
has a French link in the middle which

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.910 
has a French link in the middle which
allows<00:01:00.089> the<00:01:00.269> horse<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:01.079> chew<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> little<00:01:01.769> bit

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
allows the horse to chew a little bit

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.739 
allows the horse to chew a little bit
more<00:01:02.159> it's<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.579> little<00:01:02.789> bit<00:01:02.940> thicker<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.570> bit

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
more it's a little bit thicker of a bit

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.070 
more it's a little bit thicker of a bit
so<00:01:04.400> this<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> very<00:01:06.030> normal<00:01:06.420> ordinary

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
so this is a very normal ordinary

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.560 
so this is a very normal ordinary
snaffle<00:01:08.040> bit<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.760> would<00:01:08.909> want<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.240> put

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
snaffle bit that you would want to put

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.540 
snaffle bit that you would want to put
in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.720> horse's<00:01:10.080> mouth<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.830> has<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.070> fairly

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
in the horse's mouth that has a fairly

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.460 
in the horse's mouth that has a fairly
normal<00:01:11.700> mouth<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.270> course<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.900> your<00:01:13.050> horse<00:01:13.170> has

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
normal mouth of course if your horse has

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.830 
normal mouth of course if your horse has
a<00:01:13.770> little<00:01:14.190> is<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.370> little<00:01:14.490> bit<00:01:14.790> stronger<00:01:15.150> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
a little is a little bit stronger you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.020 
a little is a little bit stronger you
probably<00:01:16.590> wanted<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.040> use<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> little<00:01:17.580> bit<00:01:17.760> of<00:01:17.909> a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
probably wanted to use a little bit of a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.950 
probably wanted to use a little bit of a
thinner<00:01:19.020> bit<00:01:19.550> whereas<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.150> thicker<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
thinner bit whereas the the thicker the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.040 
thinner bit whereas the the thicker the
bit<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.830> less<00:01:23.220> severe<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.790> bit<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.300> this<00:01:24.870> is<00:01:25.020> a

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
bit the less severe the bit so this is a

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.680 
bit the less severe the bit so this is a
nice<00:01:25.350> kind<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.010> bit<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.210> get<00:01:27.360> your<00:01:27.510> horse

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
nice kind of a bit to get your horse

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.900 
nice kind of a bit to get your horse
started<00:01:28.110> off<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.590> dressage<00:01:28.980> and<00:01:29.010> it's<00:01:29.670> very

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
started off in dressage and it's very

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.640 
started off in dressage and it's very
important<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.330> experiment<00:01:31.050> with<00:01:31.200> bits<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
important to experiment with bits and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.620 
important to experiment with bits and
see<00:01:31.860> what<00:01:32.100> works<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.520> each<00:01:32.730> horse<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.240> well<00:01:33.450> as

best<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.180> also<00:01:39.510> want<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.870> make<00:01:40.050> sure<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
best you also want to make sure that the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.390 
best you also want to make sure that the
bits<00:01:41.970> are<00:01:42.240> long<00:01:42.840> enough<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.800> too<00:01:44.100> short

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
bits are long enough and not too short

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.280 
bits are long enough and not too short
on<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.880> side<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> horse's<00:01:45.510> mouth<00:01:45.750> that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
on the side of the horse's mouth that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.930 
on the side of the horse's mouth that
it's<00:01:46.440> not<00:01:46.620> going<00:01:46.830> to<00:01:46.920> cut<00:01:47.160> them<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:47.760> that

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
it's not going to cut them and that

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.630 
it's not going to cut them and that
there's<00:01:48.120> enough<00:01:48.420> room

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
there's enough room

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.550 
there's enough room
by<00:01:50.640> measuring<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.270> horse's<00:01:51.570> mouth<00:01:51.600> from<00:01:52.320> side

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
by measuring the horse's mouth from side

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.910 
by measuring the horse's mouth from side
to<00:01:52.590> side<00:01:52.830> as<00:01:53.280> well<00:01:53.940> as<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> bit<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.530> also

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
to side as well as that the bit is also

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.950 
to side as well as that the bit is also
not<00:01:56.100> too<00:01:56.310> large<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:56.970> either<00:01:57.360> way<00:01:57.660> it

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
not too large because either way it

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.750 
not too large because either way it
could<00:01:58.170> cause<00:01:58.350> some<00:01:58.680> issues<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.490> your<00:01:59.580> horse

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
could cause some issues for your horse

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.820 
could cause some issues for your horse
costume<00:02:00.030> discomfort<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.470> want<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.710> make

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
costume discomfort so you want to make

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.490 
costume discomfort so you want to make
sure<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.370> size<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:03.000> very<00:02:03.260> important<00:02:04.260> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
sure that the size is very important the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.639 
sure that the size is very important the
fitting<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.250> bit<00:02:07.099> we<00:02:08.099> also<00:02:08.129> have<00:02:09.649> thank

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
fitting of the bit we also have thank

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.520 
fitting of the bit we also have thank
you<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> loose<00:02:12.120> ring<00:02:12.420> snaffle<00:02:12.750> which

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
you this is a loose ring snaffle which

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.880 
you this is a loose ring snaffle which
is<00:02:13.800> very<00:02:14.220> similar<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:16.650> showed

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
is very similar to the one I just showed

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.009 
is very similar to the one I just showed
you<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.459> just<00:02:17.670> does<00:02:17.849> not<00:02:17.879> have<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.599> link<00:02:18.870> in

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
you it just does not have the link in

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.500 
you it just does not have the link in
the<00:02:19.140> centre<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.300> probably<00:02:21.300> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the centre here so this is probably the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.649 
the centre here so this is probably the
most<00:02:21.750> common<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.560> your<00:02:22.739> snaffle<00:02:23.249> bits<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.480> a

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
most common of your snaffle bits it's a

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.959 
most common of your snaffle bits it's a
loose<00:02:25.019> ring<00:02:25.290> snaffle<00:02:25.560> which<00:02:25.920> means<00:02:26.159> that<00:02:26.430> the

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:26.969 
loose ring snaffle which means that the

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:28.450 
loose ring snaffle which means that the
Rings<00:02:27.209> are<00:02:27.450> able<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.930> move

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
Rings are able to move

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.580 
Rings are able to move
really<00:02:28.730> on<00:02:28.850> either<00:02:29.060> side<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.780> bit<00:02:29.930> some

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
really on either side of the bit some

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.060 
really on either side of the bit some
bits<00:02:30.890> have<00:02:31.660> they're<00:02:32.660> attached<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.440> bit<00:02:33.620> so

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
bits have they're attached to the bit so

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.980 
bits have they're attached to the bit so
they<00:02:34.250> are<00:02:34.310> not<00:02:34.580> able<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:35.030> move<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.690> just

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
they are not able to move this just

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.300 
they are not able to move this just
allows<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.260> little<00:02:36.560> bit<00:02:36.680> more<00:02:36.830> freedom<00:02:37.100> of

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
allows a little bit more freedom of

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.520 
allows a little bit more freedom of
movement
