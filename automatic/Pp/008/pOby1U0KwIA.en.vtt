00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.840
 continue to blame everyone for no reason 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.869

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.490

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.619

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.039
 subordinates 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.549

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.549
 nothing terrible 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.820
 fire department managers 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.160
 they want everyone to leave the building immediately 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.170
 if a fire happens, many won't find 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.840
 exit and die in a crush but the rest 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.580

 what creators create 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.880
