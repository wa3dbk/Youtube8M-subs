you<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.150> see<00:03:39.390> how<00:03:39.599> with<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:41.060> vaporizing<00:03:42.060> gas

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
you can see how with the vaporizing gas

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.110 
you can see how with the vaporizing gas
liquids<00:03:43.079> like<00:03:43.260> co2<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:44.010> Halon<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
liquids like co2 and Halon and the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.750 
liquids like co2 and Halon and the
powder<00:03:45.420> chemicals<00:03:46.110> all<00:03:46.560> those<00:03:46.860> are<00:03:47.040> very<00:03:47.430> very

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
powder chemicals all those are very very

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.490 
powder chemicals all those are very very
effective<00:03:48.180> tools<00:03:48.689> but<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.019> got<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.260> get<00:03:49.379> up

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
effective tools but you got to get up

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.080 
effective tools but you got to get up
close<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.829> then<00:03:50.159> there's<00:03:50.340> no<00:03:50.489> refashion

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
close and then there's no refashion

close and then there's no refashion
reflashed<00:03:51.720> protection<00:03:52.470> once<00:03:53.189> I<00:03:53.370> get<00:03:53.579> this

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
reflashed protection once I get this

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.119 
reflashed protection once I get this

fire out with this he can go back over
with<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.519> one<00:03:56.849> and<00:03:57.269> he<00:03:57.390> won't<00:03:57.599> be<00:03:57.750> able<00:03:57.840> to

just be a corn or something you can

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.170 
just be a corn or something you can
easily<00:04:01.200> knock<00:04:01.709> out<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.640> I'm<00:04:02.760> going<00:04:02.879> to<00:04:02.909> stand

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
easily knock out so I'm going to stand

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.380 
easily knock out so I'm going to stand
back<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.780> make<00:04:04.319> my<00:04:04.530> initial<00:04:04.950> attack<00:04:05.310> from<00:04:06.269> the

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
back and make my initial attack from the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.910 
back and make my initial attack from the
distance<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.049> then<00:04:07.140> when<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.349> fire<00:04:07.560> starts

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
distance and then when the fire starts

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.649 
distance and then when the fire starts
subsiding<00:04:08.370> I'll<00:04:08.670> walk<00:04:08.879> up<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.329> from<00:04:09.480> it's

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
subsiding I'll walk up to it from it's

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.280 
subsiding I'll walk up to it from it's
safe<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:10.019> do<00:04:10.170> so

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.199 

with<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.709> most<00:04:13.950> charge<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.700> would<00:04:14.819> hold<00:04:15.060> it

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
with the most charge you would hold it

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.699 
with the most charge you would hold it
in<00:04:15.360> each<00:04:15.480> one<00:04:15.510> of<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.870> guys<00:04:16.049> can<00:04:16.320> play<00:04:16.530> with

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
in each one of you guys can play with

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.680 
in each one of you guys can play with
this<00:04:16.829> a<00:04:16.889> little<00:04:17.070> bit<00:04:17.220> both<00:04:17.850> holes<00:04:18.150> charts

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
this a little bit both holes charts

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.110 
this a little bit both holes charts
you'd<00:04:19.470> hold<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:19.889> here<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.790> just<00:04:22.850> you<00:04:23.850> can<00:04:23.910> see

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
you'd hold it here and just you can see

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.850 
you'd hold it here and just you can see
there's<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.690> goodly<00:04:24.990> amount<00:04:25.139> of<00:04:25.530> distance

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
there's a goodly amount of distance

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.520 
there's a goodly amount of distance
discharged<00:04:26.490> it's<00:04:26.760> shooting<00:04:27.060> about<00:04:27.210> 350<00:04:28.020> GPM

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
discharged it's shooting about 350 GPM

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.189 
discharged it's shooting about 350 GPM
which<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:28.949> a<00:04:28.979> good<00:04:29.250> amount<00:04:29.490> you've<00:04:30.120> got<00:04:30.389> about

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
which is a good amount you've got about

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.590 
which is a good amount you've got about
a<00:04:31.260> minute<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:31.830> 45<00:04:32.400> seconds<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:33.030> duration<00:04:33.330> if

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
a minute and 45 seconds of duration if

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.930 
a minute and 45 seconds of duration if
you<00:04:33.690> just<00:04:33.840> turn<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.199> on<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.620> let<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.070> run<00:04:35.280> that

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
you just turn it on and let it run that

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.150 
you just turn it on and let it run that
would<00:04:36.090> be<00:04:36.210> an<00:04:36.300> inappropriate<00:04:36.570> way<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.350> operate

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
would be an inappropriate way to operate

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.800 
would be an inappropriate way to operate
it<00:04:38.310> we<00:04:38.520> normally<00:04:38.940> use<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.270> in<00:04:39.360> about<00:04:39.510> five

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
it we normally use it in about five

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.010 
it we normally use it in about five
seconds<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:40.889> as<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:42.000> fire<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.300> starting<00:04:42.900> to

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
seconds and as the fire is starting to

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.870 
seconds and as the fire is starting to
have<00:04:43.229> a<00:04:43.260> you<00:04:43.979> know<00:04:44.100> like<00:04:44.280> they<00:04:44.430> say<00:04:44.610> you<00:04:44.729> want

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
have a you know like they say you want

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.360 
have a you know like they say you want
to<00:04:45.030> be<00:04:45.120> up<00:04:45.240> on<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.449> upwind<00:04:45.870> side<00:04:46.199> but<00:04:46.979> as<00:04:47.160> the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
to be up on the upwind side but as the

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.460 
to be up on the upwind side but as the
fire<00:04:47.580> is<00:04:47.610> starting<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.270> diminish<00:04:48.600> you<00:04:49.350> would

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
fire is starting to diminish you would

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.930 
fire is starting to diminish you would
take<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:49.680> different<00:04:49.919> angle<00:04:50.280> on<00:04:50.580> because<00:04:50.850> I

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
take a different angle on because I

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.760 
take a different angle on because I
won't<00:04:51.120> be<00:04:51.240> able<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.539> put<00:04:51.780> foam<00:04:52.080> in<00:04:52.350> to<00:04:52.650> the

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
won't be able to put foam in to the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.250 
won't be able to put foam in to the
upwind<00:04:53.070> side<00:04:53.400> of<00:04:53.639> it<00:04:53.729> here<00:04:53.940> I'll<00:04:54.780> have<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.110> take

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
upwind side of it here I'll have to take

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:40.940 
upwind side of it here I'll have to take
a<00:04:55.320> different<00:04:55.650> angle<00:04:55.830> so

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.159 

like

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
like

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.469 
like
this<00:05:43.860> is<00:05:44.009> a<00:05:44.039> great<00:05:44.280> thing<00:05:44.490> about<00:05:44.610> using<00:05:44.999> small

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
this is a great thing about using small

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:51.860 
this is a great thing about using small
make<00:05:45.780> triple<00:05:46.050> a<00:05:46.289> threesome

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.480 

so<00:05:52.080> you<00:05:52.139> can<00:05:52.380> screw<00:05:52.710> that<00:05:52.860> in<00:05:53.040> and<00:05:53.280> strike

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
so you can screw that in and strike

00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:00.420 
so you can screw that in and strike
right<00:05:53.699> here<00:05:54.030> a<00:05:55.550> little<00:05:56.550> bit

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.840 

okay

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.200 

Clarence<00:06:09.240> they<00:06:09.780> had<00:06:09.930> put<00:06:10.170> him<00:06:10.320> out<00:06:10.940> but<00:06:11.940> the

so<00:06:21.000> foam<00:06:21.600> is<00:06:22.140> basically<00:06:22.860> water<00:06:23.490> in<00:06:23.730> air<00:06:24.060> and<00:06:24.300> so

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
so foam is basically water in air and so

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.140 
so foam is basically water in air and so
it<00:06:24.900> will<00:06:25.110> not<00:06:25.410> only<00:06:25.830> put<00:06:26.160> fire<00:06:26.550> off<00:06:26.820> but<00:06:27.030> it

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
it will not only put fire off but it

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.850 
it will not only put fire off but it

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.500 

there's<00:06:43.980> an<00:06:44.100> update<00:06:44.400> triple-a<00:06:44.880> in<00:06:45.150> there<00:06:45.330> that

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
there's an update triple-a in there that

00:06:45.510 --> 00:07:07.180 
there's an update triple-a in there that
we<00:06:45.600> are

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:15.320 

over<00:07:08.190> it<00:07:08.310> do<00:07:08.670> this<00:07:08.850> number<00:07:09.090> here

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.420 

yeah<00:07:15.810> at<00:07:16.080> home<00:07:16.259> we'll<00:07:16.440> take<00:07:16.650> flak<00:07:17.069> you<00:07:17.250> later

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
yeah at home we'll take flak you later

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.909 
yeah at home we'll take flak you later
on<00:07:17.580> it<00:07:17.729> on<00:07:18.479> a<00:07:18.539> fuel<00:07:18.900> spill<00:07:19.110> with<00:07:19.440> this<00:07:19.620> little

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 
on it on a fuel spill with this little

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:25.939 
on it on a fuel spill with this little
unit<00:07:20.280> you<00:07:21.270> can<00:07:21.419> take<00:07:21.629> and<00:07:21.840> stand<00:07:22.680> off<00:07:22.889> here<00:07:24.949> not

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:25.949 
unit you can take and stand off here not

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:28.790 
unit you can take and stand off here not
good<00:07:26.190> enough<00:07:26.310> to<00:07:26.610> seal<00:07:27.419> off<00:07:27.659> the<00:07:27.870> vapors<00:07:28.319> then

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
good enough to seal off the vapors then

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:38.300 
good enough to seal off the vapors then
you<00:07:28.919> can<00:07:29.069> reinforce<00:07:29.520> it<00:07:36.830> so<00:07:37.830> at<00:07:37.919> that<00:07:38.039> point

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
you can reinforce it so at that point

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.909 
you can reinforce it so at that point
there<00:07:38.669> if<00:07:39.030> there<00:07:39.240> was<00:07:39.360> fuel<00:07:39.659> on<00:07:39.930> the<00:07:40.169> asphalt

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 
there if there was fuel on the asphalt

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.499 
there if there was fuel on the asphalt
it<00:07:41.009> would<00:07:41.129> not<00:07:41.280> be<00:07:41.340> flammable<00:07:41.789> any<00:07:42.150> longer

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:42.509 
it would not be flammable any longer

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:44.210 
it would not be flammable any longer
because<00:07:42.599> the<00:07:42.870> foam<00:07:43.139> is<00:07:43.530> sealing<00:07:44.039> off<00:07:44.190> the

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 
because the foam is sealing off the

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.709 
because the foam is sealing off the
vapors<00:07:44.789> and<00:07:45.770> that<00:07:46.770> will<00:07:47.009> last<00:07:47.250> there<00:07:47.699> and<00:07:48.360> know

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:48.719 
vapors and that will last there and know

00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:50.270 
vapors and that will last there and know
eighty<00:07:49.169> ninety<00:07:49.590> three<00:07:49.650> temperatures

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280

in case of tacking real fire an accident

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.290 
in case of tacking real fire an accident
now<00:08:00.930> you<00:08:00.990> can<00:08:01.319> extract<00:08:01.770> people<00:08:02.430> and<00:08:03.030> the

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.300 
now you can extract people and the

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.350 
now you can extract people and the
flight<00:08:03.509> crews<00:08:03.840> and<00:08:04.969> you<00:08:05.969> can<00:08:06.120> always
