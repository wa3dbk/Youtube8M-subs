shreds next you want to add coconut oil
you<00:01:30.810> don't<00:01:31.140> need<00:01:31.350> very<00:01:31.500> much<00:01:31.740> maybe<00:01:32.040> just

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you don't need very much maybe just

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.580 
you don't need very much maybe just
about<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> teaspoon<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.390> promise<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.409> what

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
about a teaspoon I promise this is what

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.800 
about a teaspoon I promise this is what
again<00:01:34.979> helps<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.790> caramel<00:01:36.420> flavor

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
again helps with that caramel flavor

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.780 
again helps with that caramel flavor
without<00:01:37.079> actually<00:01:37.710> adding<00:01:37.829> caramel<00:01:38.460> which<00:01:38.640> we

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
without actually adding caramel which we

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.030 
without actually adding caramel which we
know<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.060> full<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.450> refined<00:01:39.810> sugar<00:01:40.140> next<00:01:40.860> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
know is full of refined sugar next you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.859 
know is full of refined sugar next you
want<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.250> add<00:01:41.340> vanilla<00:01:41.670> extract<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.570> thought

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
want to add vanilla extract I thought

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.080 
want to add vanilla extract I thought
about<00:01:42.960> using<00:01:43.229> vanilla<00:01:43.710> bean<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.729> pretty

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
about using vanilla bean but it's pretty

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.760 
about using vanilla bean but it's pretty
pricey<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.869> always<00:01:46.079> want<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.560> give<00:01:46.680> you

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you and pretty affordable so vanilla

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.219 
you and pretty affordable so vanilla
extract<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.180> fine<00:01:51.420> make<00:01:51.780> sure<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.990> read<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
extract is fine make sure you read the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.389 
extract is fine make sure you read the
bottle<00:01:52.500> though<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:52.979> want<00:01:53.040> something

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
bottle though you don't want something

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.179 
bottle though you don't want something
that<00:01:53.549> has<00:01:53.850> additional<00:01:54.420> sugar<00:01:55.320> added<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.979> want

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
that has additional sugar added you want

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.270 
that has additional sugar added you want
vanilla<00:01:56.670> flavor<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.450> alcohol<00:01:58.049> that's<00:01:58.290> it

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.140 

so<00:02:02.280> now<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.520> you've<00:02:02.730> added<00:02:02.880> all<00:02:03.090> your

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
so now that you've added all your

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.870 
so now that you've added all your
ingredients<00:02:03.900> blend<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.620> high<00:02:04.680> until<00:02:05.370> smooth

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
ingredients blend on high until smooth

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
ingredients blend on high until smooth
that<00:02:06.240> should<00:02:06.480> be<00:02:06.600> about<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.260> two<00:02:07.290> minutes

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that should be about one to two minutes

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.139 
that should be about one to two minutes
just<00:02:07.920> make<00:02:08.100> sure<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.399> smooth<00:02:08.640> though<00:02:08.910> dates

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
just make sure it's smooth though dates

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.850 
just make sure it's smooth though dates
will<00:02:09.300> probably<00:02:09.750> be<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.080> hardest<00:02:10.110> part<00:02:10.530> to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
will probably be the hardest part to

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.070 
will probably be the hardest part to
blend<00:02:11.100> once<00:02:12.090> you've<00:02:12.330> blended<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.780> until

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
blend once you've blended it until

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.170 
blend once you've blended it until
smooth<00:02:13.410> go<00:02:13.680> ahead<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.040> add<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.550> cup<00:02:14.910> or

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
smooth go ahead and add it to a cup or

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.120 
smooth go ahead and add it to a cup or
