00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.600
 pulled with the aforementioned of all the stuff 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.710

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:49.340
 put here you turn the pasta in a little 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:51.620
 so that everything is well mixed and then 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.719

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:01.460
 big young there is a big scare 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:06.139
 ok it's 45 primary tomatoes passing by 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.509
 and rudy crudy lipsticks made of 40 

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:10.789
 for them we can develop with the shirt 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.450
 it may be true we were written to 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:19.189
 hand that casts the prices first and of the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.700
 piero you put the pime pepper how much 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.579
 and who just does not want it, and his seed 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.619
 and little to do little account that a 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:32.270
 little bit of pepper just for a discovery 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.520
 ok then thought in abundance beautiful one 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.840
 beautiful shore life must go to 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.139

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.950
 then take the raw mussels here 

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:44.950
 come on let's go on 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.300
 he excludes himself only with the warmth of his 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.820
 fund when we go to mind 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.960
 will open will open think will cook 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.380
 releasing the liquid that will give a 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.080
 exceptional taste and then towards last yes 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.150
 finish putting the stuff that is enough for you 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.640
 and then slowly he will put everything in the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.760
 above that brother with stuff 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.380
 stop and the abundant now is he who 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.180
 he appears to me he has less is more 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.910
 abundant but we do miss it 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.820
 nothing therefore practically which explodes 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:36.290
 it is a triumph this is not what it is 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.600
 a triumph of the sea and then already yes 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.690
 were prepared first with the aforementioned yes 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.000
 put the changes that we are because we are 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.880
 there is a bit of a polluter 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.370
 especially for us who are working 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.230

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.480
