00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.290
 Hey guys, how are you? I'm joÃ£o da 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.910
 team up with dot com 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.360
 I'm here to bring one more tip to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.970
 You guys today are going to give us a 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.000
 how to properly put the line too 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.890
 filament at its limit is the first 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.600
 step I 'll explain to you why 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.640
 one should not put the line one 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.660
 direct detachment on the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.579
 Aluminum're going there I will explain to 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.160
 to make this comparison 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.710
 I'm going to use both multifilament and 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.710
 in the monofilament the name simple gallows 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.430
 see the very foundation line it 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.329
 does not generate friction with the aluminum cartel 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.059
 that is, if you suddenly need it 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.090
 during a fight that the flexion works 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.359
 the line it can generate in block around 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.189
 of the reel since in the ninth the filament 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.880
 we can see that she sticks with 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.890
 easier to reach the cartel 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.950
 bending work we're going to do 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.040
 Now we go there a few meters in the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.009
 more than ten meters, creating a 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.830
 bed to make the amendment of the multi 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.220
 I'm going to use our simple run 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.009
 you can use other nodes like nobreak 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.790
 or not blood 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.920
 simply to make this amendment 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.369
 the line provides evidence she already has a 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.189
 packaging designed to assist the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.140
 fisherman on the line placement that 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.399
 system is called expelled 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.950
 I'll show you how it is that 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.180
 works with this system 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.180
 you can regulate the pressure through the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.270
 tension on the spool releasing 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.210
 pressing 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.650
 I'm already here between my legs. 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.600
 I'll finish collecting the rest of 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.620
 monkey that is missing here and now look at the 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.040
 beginning 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.380
 to leave beautiful the reel with this drawing 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.080
 of the line ds of this mosaic goes 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.310
 forming shows how the line is 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.480
 wrapped in x 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:30.170
 This will stop her from ending up in 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:35.930
 Landa digging right so no pressure is 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:38.900
 just ask here oh, I just seeing here 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.510
 I can make color only then the reel 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.060
 stay tight tight you're going to squeeze the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.830
 friction at the limit and will continue 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.810
 collecting with his expulsion of the fish 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.459
 generating a pressure between the brt line 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.730
 she got well compacted 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.850
 it gets to be hard ok because for 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.680
 because of the attention paid to the 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.360
 Reel filling a tip 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.800
 important is to check if the line is 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.780
 dick is pro I have the cgk warranty seal 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.760
 cgk is official importer of power line 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.550
 next year in brazil remembering the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.190
 Products you've seen here for reel 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.140
 Shimano accessories you BetClic 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.900
 find on this site that the following chat 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.989
 dot com bar the party goes in there talk 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.769
 with people and people are going to fish, 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.769
 thanks
