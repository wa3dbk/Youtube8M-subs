00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
in both health then into a bowl we want

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.420 
in both health then into a bowl we want
to<00:01:27.390> crack<00:01:27.630> one<00:01:28.140> egg<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.740> want<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> separate

you want to use the egg white to stick
the<00:01:56.340> two<00:01:56.369> ships<00:01:56.820> together<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.840> get

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the two ships together so that you get

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.510 
the two ships together so that you get
extra<00:01:58.110> height<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.680> pinwheel<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.280> they're<00:01:59.430> not

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
extra height in pinwheel and they're not

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.609 
extra height in pinwheel and they're not
little<00:01:59.790> tiny<00:01:59.969> nuts<00:02:00.210> that's<00:02:01.079> what<00:02:01.290> we're<00:02:01.439> going

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
little tiny nuts that's what we're going

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:01.819 
little tiny nuts that's what we're going
for

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
for

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.480 
for
so<00:02:02.479> everything<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.689> about<00:02:03.899> size<00:02:04.409> guys<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
so everything is about size guys the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.680 
so everything is about size guys the
girls<00:02:05.700> aligned<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.299> you

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
girls aligned to you

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.380 
girls aligned to you
then<00:02:07.260> you<00:02:07.770> want<00:02:07.980> to<00:02:08.070> get<00:02:08.310> your<00:02:08.580> other<00:02:08.850> sheet<00:02:09.180> of

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
then you want to get your other sheet of

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.750 
then you want to get your other sheet of
puff<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.050> whack<00:02:10.350> it<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.650> top<00:02:11.010> so<00:02:11.490> we

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
puff and whack it on top so we

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.790 
puff and whack it on top so we
essentially<00:02:12.060> doubled<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.630> doing<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.590> with<00:02:13.770> a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
essentially doubled it doing this with a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.450 
essentially doubled it doing this with a
rolling<00:02:14.070> pin

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
rolling pin

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.950 
rolling pin
I<00:02:14.640> wouldn't<00:02:15.030> recommend<00:02:15.150> because<00:02:15.810> you're

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
I wouldn't recommend because you're

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.610 
I wouldn't recommend because you're
gonna<00:02:16.080> lose<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.860> height<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:21.620> then

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
gonna lose the height so just then

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.350 
gonna lose the height so just then
domain<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.100> feeling<00:02:23.520> we<00:02:23.700> essentially<00:02:23.970> just

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
domain and feeling we essentially just

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.030 
domain and feeling we essentially just
need<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.570> mix<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.990> all<00:02:25.170> together<00:02:25.290> with<00:02:25.830> a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
need to mix this all together with a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.190 
need to mix this all together with a
spatula<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:27.030> you're<00:02:27.210> finding<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:27.690> spatula

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
spatula if you're finding your spatula

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.630 
spatula if you're finding your spatula
isn't<00:02:28.650> getting<00:02:28.920> through<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.520> not

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
isn't getting through and it's not

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.540 
isn't getting through and it's not
really<00:02:30.300> combining<00:02:30.690> into<00:02:30.960> a<00:02:31.020> nice<00:02:31.200> paste

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550
