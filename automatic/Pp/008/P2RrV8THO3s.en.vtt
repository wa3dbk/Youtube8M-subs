00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.719
 gp for dry we are at toshiba in 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.550
 dÃ¼sseldorf and the new equipment of 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:19.189
 toshiba to the windows 8 devices and 29 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:22.010
 and 89 40 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.550
 but best we ask that 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.130
 product manager duly here you can 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.470
 give us a bit of info about the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.870
 new products from toshiba yes hello we 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.290
 have two new ultrabooks that is one 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.680
 an entry- level device a 14 inch ultrabook 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.280
 device is ultrabook is in ours 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.640
 Nice new design and yes offers all 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.629
 values of a normal ultrabooks courage of 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.790
 connection diversity and also the 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.239
 possibility to change the battery 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:59.750
 well I so again away I very 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:01.580
 hard batteries also have access panels and 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.379
 Although not directly thought but yes it 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.689
 here you can do it relatively theoretically 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.119
 That would not be the case with all ultrabooks 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.130
 otherwise have any combination of 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.049
 a small ssd with a big one 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:18.289
 hard disk and we use systems with 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:23.630
 internet graphic processors generation 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:26.780
 of course the ones used here and 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.859
 13 inches or 14 24 sessions red 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.240
 not so at 1.7 kilograms weight that 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.359
 weight slightly higher we have of course 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.090
 also very light little ultrabooks the 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:41.450
 only one ssd are functional z 39 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.960
 and I know then about high speed 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.499
 umts have anti-reflective displays that 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.380
 go there 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:50.749
 we have a very wide ultrabook 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.880
 range up to a tea device for 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.710
 the business area in the book sector is 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.899
 that also not self-evident 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.819
 we also have those like that 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.709
 is our multimedia ultrabook with a lot 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.179
 good harman cardon speakers and 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.909
 This device completes the whole range 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.880
 then down that's the one 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.800
 Entry area in our notebook 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.750
 Area 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.670
 The keyboard backgrounds illuminates the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.710
 keyboard is backlit ok 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.710
 and let's go a bit fast 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:29.120
 bypass her micro sd usb 3 hdmi ethernet 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.470
 current and then on the other side is 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.280
 not much we have to sink very much 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.400
 and still brand a sps operation 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.460
 interface and to the different ones 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.690
 models can say what the exact yes 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.450
 model have yet to be defined 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.520
 we announce you to windows 8 state 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.930
 will have an entry level variant with 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:54.770
 a processor 4 gigabytes and 1 5 with 8 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.660
 Operative memory gigabyte ok then to the 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.780
 next 29 t 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.300
 yes, that's a whole new concept 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.440
 We also have this concept 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.390
 built ultrabook 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.010
 this is a full-blown ultrabook 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:13.010
 this ultrabook is then too 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.450
 Technically, that means I can do it 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.970
 very easy by a slider 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.030
 open mechanism and then have a 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.580
 full-blown ultrabook compared to 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.890
 I have other constructions too 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.750
 the possibility that i have my display 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.209
 can adjust in the angle and so one 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.519
 optimal working environment cable 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.800
 I have a palm rest and have 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.690
 a full-fledged good keyboard 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.930
 that means it is a full one 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:44.500
 Ultrabook that I easily for the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.360
 slider mechanism in a win 8 tablet 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.070
 and can change 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.830
 Who me a combined audio one 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.760
 output for headphones microphone with a 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.720
 a covered sd card slot 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.760
 Here we continue with hdmi and usb 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.030
 Here we have the entrance for the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.090
 power supply and on this page 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.820
 The settings are a switch-off louder 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.000
 quieter the possibility of auto rotation 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:18.370
 and another usb 3.0 port is 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.020
 quite interesting in 2010 grew fast 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.020
 below, no decent battery will be ok 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.430
 great engineering performance certainly with 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.490
 provided the mechanism because that must 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.070
 robust and light we are 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.050
 Here at a device at a good 145 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.480
 kilogram for that is a full one 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.880
 Ultrabook is with a 12.5 inch 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.250
 display up the weight quite in 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:51.610
 order and the technology behind it 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:54.400
 is certainly fascinating because 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.840
 We need to be in this bracket once 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.340
 the display of course over the device 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.980
 We have to load on the other side 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.410
 so stable that we have the 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.710
 Just imagine the angle of inclination here 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.230
 Can I have the opportunity if I can 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.570
 the device a bit high drive that 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:22.169
 Here, the camera comes out out can 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:22.169
 So I also join pictures here 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:32.550
 yes if a hd display this hd display 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:35.919
 has a resolution wages 13 66 x 768 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.960
 image points hd resolution so it as 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.860
 we can use it 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:45.930
 provided with a gorilla glass and 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.940
 This makes it quite scratch resistant 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:56.050
 and very good for everyday use 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:06:00.340
 suitable and read today 55 55 55 inches 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.740
 and is an ips display in the tablet mut 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.940
 i can now of ok is a sign 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.940
 more good 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.350
 It's fun to talk to him then too 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:16.270
 in tablet mode to work on the 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:19.300
 a page to look at data 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.230
 but to look at multimedia content 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.150
 on the other side if I am 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.350
 I would like to write e-mails 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.730
 would I then again 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:34.090
 full- blown ultrabook okay that's the ones 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:41.230
 new satellite products the 940 so 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:43.460
 entry device and the 29 tablet hybrid 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.310
 do you know that about the price and 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.560
 magstadt yes we think too to the windows 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:52.940
 8 start shortly thereafter device available 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:55.160
 We will be around 11 190 euro 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:06.140
 with the entry-level device in this area 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:08.360
 at the 21 and the 949 is also eight 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.130
 what you 40 will come with windows 8 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.120
 also relatively soon to the market start 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.440
 be available 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.420
 Here the price is not accurate 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.310
 fixed okay but thank you world 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.310
 thank you for the time and
