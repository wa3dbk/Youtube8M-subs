00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.189
 Y 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.280
 acertáis see that you have come touch 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.380
 speak or the burgos as possibly already 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.670
 you guessed by that subtle and small 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.989
 advertising also integrated here in the 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.820
 Gothic setting of the Cathedral of 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:24.640
 barcelona today the protagonist is the 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.720
 new samsung galaxy s six hits but 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.279
 calm because we're not going to talk about 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.570
 processor cores systems 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.790
 operatives of all these rolls we're going to 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.079
 speak of course of your camera a 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.130
 camera that we have already been able to prove that 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.600
 he gave us some very good first 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.460
 impressions so now let's do 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.649
 something much better we are going to compare it with 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.789
 iphone 6 camera to try 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.500
 answer that question that a lot of people 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.239
 is being done has finally got 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.250
 samsung equalize or even exceed in 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.449
 image quality to the iphone that's what 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.839
 that we are going to see we are going to 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.839
 check it 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.020
 at this point, surely you already know the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.510
 memory benefits but in plan 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.970
 quick review we will say that the 6 s 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.130
 It has a 5 - inch screen in 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.600
 iphone 6 4.7 inch case though already 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.630
 you know that there is a plus version with 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.180
 5.5 inches screen the camera's 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.550
 galaxy s 6 is 16 megapixels and one 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.470
 front of 5 megapixels in the case of 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.650
 iphone 6 we have 8 megapixels and one 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.300
 front of only 12 megapixel optics 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.979
 it's also quite different in this 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.960
 case we have a 28 minutes 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.300
 efe 19 very interesting to the university 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.690
 in the case of the iphone a 29 mm 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.729
 efe 2 with 2 and apart the samsung galaxy s 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.920
 6 can give 4k video in the case of 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.320
 iphone 6 we have to settle for full 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.610
 hd to 60 p to compare the two cameras 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.080
 let's do one thing let's take out 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.820
 photos in the typical situations in the 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.770
 that we would use a mobile phone 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.450
 starting with this with the typical postcard 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.159
 with good light everything very simple yes 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.229
 you have to keep in mind that the focal 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.560
 it's different a 29 millimeters in the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.600
 iphone 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.369
 here but that especially the format of the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.409
 sensor is different here we have a 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.210
 Panoramic format sensor with which 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:17.510
 the images are going to be giving us a 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:18.709
 feeling of greater amplitude we are going to 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.360
 take a picture also this alley that 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.190
 besides being very nice there are enough 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.959
 lights and shadows to be able to check what 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.620
 such walk dynamic range and hdr the 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.620
 two telephones 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.350
 at this point no tacos let's explain 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.790
 nothing from the camera's interface 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.530
 iphone because it is well known the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.900
 fast unlocking you know we move 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.430
 and the controls that we have very 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.100
 simple but they make it the driving 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.930
 very simple and very fast remember that 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.490
 although the original application of the iphone 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.470
 does not have manual controls through 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.140
 third applications thanks to ios 8 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.080
 we can also have little access 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.730
 that see the roles of galaxy s 6 is the 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.280
 click is also very fast double click 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.690
 and we are already in the camera and the options 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.300
 they are much older especially if 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.420
 we work in the so-called mode but where 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.530
 we see that we have control of the smooth one 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.330
 white balance control too 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.590
 we can adjust the exposure we do not have 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.570
 direct manual controls but if 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.040
 we can compensate the exhibition here 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.290
 the same thing happens through third parties 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.430
 applications we can also have 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.440
 total controls that is to say we can count 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.730
 control the speed and although it does not have 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.020
 direct recording of raw 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.910
 Many people insist on saying it but not 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.770
 it's like this again if we use some 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.050
 third-party application we can record the 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.430
 raw 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.930
 what are the cameras of the 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.280
 mobile for many to take out 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.990
 food photos so good we already have 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:56.900
 excuse to stop a moment and take us 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:58.820
 a coffee you see we have chosen a bar 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.050
 those who like an authentic bar is 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.390
 difficult to find them in this area of 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.280
 barcelona but good to the subject we do the 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.480
 same photo with the iphone a photo of 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.750
 these zenith is the activity that 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.780
 hang all in Instagram 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.130
 there we have it and we repeat trying 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.360
 match it to the maximum possible we have already 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.590
 fact that you complicated by the different 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.000
 sensor format with galaxy s 6 and 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.170
 well there you have the results so that 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.170
 you can compare them to see what you think 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.210
 let's try what's also the photo 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.160
 of detail we are going to approach the maximum 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.780
 taking advantage of these precious souvenirs 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.220
 that says they are inspired by gaudí 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.580
 eye that we have found in the 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.580
 ramblas of barcelona 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.669
 r 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:51.580
 r 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.580
 once 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.280
 and you see that Apple also boasts and 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.990
 how great the quality of your iphone 6 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.370
 and to prove how they behave 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.840
 interiors nothing better than our 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.520
 dear market of the boquería that like 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.520
 you can see it is as empty as ever 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.099
 you know we're not very close friends 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.999
 actually nothing friends of the celtics but 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.370
 it is true that more and more people 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:42.539
 they use the front camera so let's go 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.919
 to compare them also what is the 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.240
 really almost no need or compare 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.249
 because we can imagine the result what 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.560
 we have said before the galaxy s 6 has 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:52.650
 a 5 megapixel front camera and the 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.029
 iphone complies with 12 megapixels of 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.620
 any any we put the photos 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.699
 so that you yourselves value the 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.289
 results certainly in the case of 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.089
 galaxy s 6 a curiosity 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.009
 and that is if we activate the front camera 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:04.469
 we can shoot simply by zooming 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:20.219
 the finger to the rear sensor the truth that 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:21.180
 it's quite common and now that 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:24.060
 you have been able to compare the results 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.259
 with which you stay galaxy s 6 or iphone 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.419
 6 The good news is that both are 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.889
 excellent we are possibly facing the 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.360
 two best cameras in the smartphone the 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.250
 market not in benefits is true 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.779
 but yes in results in agility in 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.529
 ease of management that in the end 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.599
 is 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:38.579
 it does not matter how light the results 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.719
 they are very similar in the case of the galaxy 

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:41.489
 we have a little more 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:43.019
 processed warmer very nice to 

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:44.609
 the view the iphone 6 gives us some 

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:46.229
 more realistic results but with 

00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:47.639
 any two we are not going to have any 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:48.809
 problem of things change a little and 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.669
 we have the clearest differences 

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:53.369
 When there is little light it is not that the sensor 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:54.629
 of the galaxy s 6 is better is that he carries 

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:56.339
 to image stabilizer and an optics 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:58.439
 a little bit brighter which gives you 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:00.359
 certain advantage then when we have a 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:01.529
 low light scene so answering 

00:07:00.359 --> 00:07:03.269
 to the question we asked ourselves 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:05.219
 principle has got samsung equalize 

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:07.709
 or exceed the image quality of 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:09.239
 iphone 6 with its new galaxy s 6 yes yes 

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:10.529
 we have been able to verify it so now 

00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:12.029
 you know you can take any of these 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:14.929
 two in your pocket and you have no excuse 

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:14.929
 to make bad photos
