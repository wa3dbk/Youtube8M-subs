yes<00:00:21.890> I<00:00:22.279> know<00:00:23.980> people<00:00:24.980> have<00:00:25.130> been<00:00:25.160> bashing<00:00:25.520> this

yes I know people have been bashing this

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.250 
yes I know people have been bashing this
figure<00:00:26.419> but<00:00:26.930> I<00:00:27.110> think<00:00:27.650> this<00:00:28.400> is<00:00:28.640> some<00:00:29.260> this

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
figure but I think this is some this

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.799 
figure but I think this is some this
potential<00:00:30.949> in<00:00:31.070> here<00:00:31.279> that<00:00:31.730> I<00:00:31.760> will<00:00:32.000> find<00:00:32.269> that

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
potential in here that I will find that

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.680 
potential in here that I will find that
will<00:00:32.900> make<00:00:33.050> this<00:00:33.230> figure<00:00:33.620> absolutely<00:00:34.400> awesome

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
will make this figure absolutely awesome

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.420 
will make this figure absolutely awesome
so<00:00:35.690> here<00:00:36.379> we<00:00:36.500> go<00:00:36.680> I'm<00:00:36.800> we're<00:00:36.920> about<00:00:37.040> to<00:00:37.190> prove

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
so here we go I'm we're about to prove

everyone<00:00:37.820> wrong<00:00:38.000> that<00:00:38.809> this<00:00:38.989> figure<00:00:39.230> is<00:00:39.530> great

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
everyone wrong that this figure is great

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.759 
everyone wrong that this figure is great
with<00:00:40.699> this<00:00:40.910> review<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:41.510> let's<00:00:41.540> just<00:00:41.960> get<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:42.320> it

Megatron<00:00:47.329> that's<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.350> tank<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:48.980> if<00:00:49.850> I'm

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
Megatron that's a tank and if I'm

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.819 
Megatron that's a tank and if I'm
remembering<00:00:50.510> correctly<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:51.140> is<00:00:51.200> original

remembering correctly this is original

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.690 
remembering correctly this is original
design<00:00:52.190> designed<00:00:53.180> by<00:00:53.360> Don<00:00:54.020> Figueroa<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.010> if

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
design designed by Don Figueroa and if

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.930 
design designed by Don Figueroa and if
he<00:00:55.820> designed<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:56.300> it<00:00:56.449> must<00:00:56.840> be<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.110> bad<00:00:57.440> ass

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
he designed it it must be a bad ass

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.139 
he designed it it must be a bad ass
figure<00:00:58.940> all<00:00:59.719> right<00:00:59.870> so<00:00:59.989> he's<00:01:00.110> a<00:01:00.140> tank<00:01:00.530> you<00:01:00.800> know

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
figure all right so he's a tank you know

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.439 
figure all right so he's a tank you know
and<00:01:03.220> he's<00:01:04.220> heavy<00:01:04.550> and<00:01:04.940> well<00:01:05.059> you<00:01:05.119> know<00:01:05.149> if

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
and he's heavy and well you know if

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.550 
and he's heavy and well you know if
you're<00:01:05.600> gonna<00:01:05.690> make<00:01:05.899> a<00:01:05.930> tank<00:01:06.200> you've<00:01:06.350> gotta

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
you're gonna make a tank you've gotta

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.999 
you're gonna make a tank you've gotta
make<00:01:06.740> it<00:01:06.860> heavy<00:01:07.039> right<00:01:07.550> right<00:01:08.000> yeah<00:01:08.300> and<00:01:09.009> he

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
make it heavy right right yeah and he

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.779 
make it heavy right right yeah and he
can<00:01:10.190> move<00:01:10.310> his<00:01:10.369> tank<00:01:12.160> barrel<00:01:13.160> up<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:13.580> down

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
can move his tank barrel up and down

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:20.109 
can move his tank barrel up and down
even<00:01:14.240> though<00:01:14.539> that's<00:01:15.520> illogical<00:01:17.830> he<00:01:18.880> it<00:01:19.880> could

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
even though that's illogical he it could

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.779 
even though that's illogical he it could
separate<00:01:22.179> that's<00:01:23.179> okay<00:01:23.479> that's<00:01:23.660> okay<00:01:23.840> um

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
separate that's okay that's okay um

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.309 
separate that's okay that's okay um
gunner<00:01:25.789> turn<00:01:26.030> can<00:01:26.300> turn<00:01:26.660> all<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.899> way<00:01:26.990> around

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
gunner turn can turn all the way around

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:33.480 
gunner turn can turn all the way around
even<00:01:27.560> though<00:01:28.550> there's<00:01:28.819> really<00:01:29.060> no<00:01:29.599> need<00:01:30.530> uh

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
anyways all right let's just go into the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.580 
anyways all right let's just go into the
transmission<00:02:02.599> shall<00:02:02.959> we<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.259> I'm<00:02:03.349> putting

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
transmission shall we and I'm putting

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.469 
transmission shall we and I'm putting
this<00:02:03.800> figure<00:02:04.190> transformation<00:02:05.149> wise<00:02:05.300> it's

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
this figure transformation wise it's

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.350 
this figure transformation wise it's
gonna<00:02:05.599> be<00:02:05.780> awesome<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.380> epic<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:07.369> what<00:02:08.270> we're

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
gonna be awesome and epic so what we're

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.619 
gonna be awesome and epic so what we're
gonna<00:02:08.479> do<00:02:08.629> is<00:02:08.780> just<00:02:08.899> separate<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.500> legs<00:02:10.629> right

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
gonna do is just separate the legs right

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.670 
gonna do is just separate the legs right
there<00:02:11.800> think<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.489> just<00:02:14.680> connect

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
there think of that and just connect

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.580 
there think of that and just connect
them<00:02:15.830> like<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:17.530> bring<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.650> little<00:02:18.770> feet<00:02:19.069> down
