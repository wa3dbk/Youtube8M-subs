00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.240 
and you have a hard time understanding
what<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:48.510> say<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.110> it's<00:03:49.410> easier<00:03:49.860> when<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.190> can

what I say and it's easier when you can

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.960 
what I say and it's easier when you can
also<00:03:50.549> read<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.000> but<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.590> might<00:03:52.829> also<00:03:52.860> be<00:03:53.280> that

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
also read it but it might also be that

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.210 
also read it but it might also be that
you're<00:03:54.510> an<00:03:54.660> environment<00:03:55.260> where<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.680> can<00:03:56.010> only
