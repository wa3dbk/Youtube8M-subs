00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.390
 beautiful hello how are you I hope that very 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.450
 very well and thanks to you who give me 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.070
 ideas because in instagram last days 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.720
 I put a little photo and written that said that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.189
 If I was left with no idea, it's 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.230
 disorganized and I told them that 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.599
 like to see in the following videos and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.369
 you told me how good they told me 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.380
 a lot of things are true and I'm going to try 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.119
 do all your videos but then for the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.789
 moment envelopes can be bought with a 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.270
 truth to start with I can not do 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.060
 many at the same time and then what is the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.160
 they are my favorite shoes and I'm going 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.530
 to teach what I'm using right now 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.170
 a lot and the truth that I hope you will last me 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.900
 all my life because they are charming me 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.720
 I will be crouching because the 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.740
 I have like here but another one of those 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.740
 sneaky places 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.550
 no it does not look sneaky but good 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.140
 let's start beautiful and the first ones are 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.290
 that I think I already have a previous video 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.050
 from favorite shoes if you like idea 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.460
 take a look, I think some 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.550
 they are going to repeat because they have lasted me 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.770
 much then it may be that they repeat themselves 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.290
 and there will be nine other successes clear that what 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.930
 you know then the first ones are these 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.119
 the ones that when I think a lot of them 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.520
 they have seen them are a flash that 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.950
 I bought many years ago I do not know how much 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.690
 in general I love them they love they are 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.850
 all aguad milestones i like super 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.130
 cheap I do not know and I do not understand how it is 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.410
 that have lasted me so much some of 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.930
 you wonder what the 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.869
 I put them in the rain or something like that if 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.640
 I've done that episode puddles and it's 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.399
 a chaos and we have on all feet 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.500
 because this is pure cloth but now it 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.060
 threw in the washing machine and notice that I have 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.890
 done with many times the washing machine me 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.840
 Visits are good as new and I do not know 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.470
 they have broken me or nothing this is fine 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.250
 tough floor was very good buy 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.170
 another thing I'm going to be crouched are 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.610
 These sandals that I also bought do not 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.150
 agreement when but I think there are 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.150
 are some rails 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.270
 these signs that cost me like a 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.420
 dollar or two dollars I do not look outside 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.400
 Berton just because they were in 50 50 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.030
 extra percent in the things of 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.850
 clarence then I do not know with the bun 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.770
 color is super combinable image is not 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.500
 describes using a bunch heap lot 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.300
 a lot because I do not know what makes me 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.370
 they are super cute then they are my 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.080
 favorite missionary favorites of 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.060
 moment 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:39.150
 continuing with platforms are these not 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.519
 I know by the color for the structure 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.370
 Well, it makes me combine you with everything 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.180
 I do not know much about denim where everything goes 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.500
 everything everything besides that they are super comfortable 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.910
 so these are also my other 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.590
 favorites 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.959
 continuing with 13 forms 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.640
 I do not know I also use in winter 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.730
 when they say it is so hot because 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.550
 They are like a leopard, so it stays and then 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.290
 also in spring summer mercedes 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.750
 because they are so open but like that 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.450
 everything gives as a touch of color is not 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.549
 you can put on like super simple 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.019
 of the clothes and me when I wear these 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.360
 as well as everyone asks me 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.650
 where I bought them because I love them 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.400
 and they are my favorite see, that is, they are 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.480
 very beautiful 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.819
 continued and it is these shoes that also 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.590
 wrote a lot I do not know the color the 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.560
 color I love I love me 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.680
 love and also that the peak shape does not 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.870
 it makes me feel like the feet me 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.390
 makes the super nice foot move and 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.350
 I do not know how the cars I wear it 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.440
 It gives them like 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.210
 a touch of formality I do not know I love them 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.210
 I love them I love them then 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.400
 they are my other favorites and I'm just going 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.739
 to put two more 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.439
 you're not feeling that they give you 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.209
 as I softly touch color the 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:06.890
 legs look like I'm tanned 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.840
 You are more golden I loved them 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.310
 truly see them although I want to say that 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.470
 with this lighting you can not see 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.959
 exactly the color but I already have a 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.820
 outfit with these then come to 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.670
 check it so they really see how it is 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:25.690
 that shines and color and finally 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:29.200
 finally see this these are others 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.240
 favorites and my last favorites I do not know 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.830
 the color is beautiful to me it makes me 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.660
 which is the color of the season I 've 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.600
 I've seen a lot, I already have a 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.300
 bag I love how they are buckled 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.470
 but danced from this 'stock' is to narrow 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.330
 that cost me 11 dollars from the others 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.930
 of the last price because they are already like 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.229
 that something digital is used after 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.600
 I do not remember the price but these are 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.090
 like the most recent ones and they're like 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.610
 that of the style that is being used to 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.840
 this spring I do not always know the 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.060
 I want to put them I want to combine 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.180
 then beautiful because this video was 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.220

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.400
 I liked those are my shoes 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.550
