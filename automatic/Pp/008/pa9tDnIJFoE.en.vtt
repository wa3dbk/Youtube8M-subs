00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
said I try to just build it like a

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.160 
said I try to just build it like a
normal<00:03:25.470> deck<00:03:25.950> like<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.360> know<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.780> triple<00:03:28.080> good

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
normal deck like you know to triple good

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.630 
normal deck like you know to triple good
spirits<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:29.489> good<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:31.440> may<00:03:31.590> not<00:03:31.739> see<00:03:32.130> any<00:03:32.160> and

spirits is good you may not see any and

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.150 
spirits is good you may not see any and
you<00:03:32.700> can<00:03:32.940> still<00:03:33.209> make<00:03:33.360> this<00:03:33.510> deck<00:03:33.780> work<00:03:34.049> if<00:03:34.980> you

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
you can still make this deck work if you

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.949 
you can still make this deck work if you
drop<00:03:35.459> those<00:03:35.670> triple<00:03:36.060> good<00:03:36.239> spirits<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.810> you

had say two of the amp and path mages I

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.860 
had say two of the amp and path mages I
think<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.100> deck<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.370> just<00:03:41.880> as<00:03:42.060> good<00:03:42.269> like<00:03:42.690> if

that<00:05:16.660> turn<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.650> frog<00:05:17.979> maybe<00:05:18.220> if<00:05:18.940> you<00:05:19.090> get<00:05:19.330> a

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
that turn to frog maybe if you get a

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.400 
that turn to frog maybe if you get a
couple<00:05:20.740> I'm<00:05:21.010> color<00:05:21.340> rares<00:05:22.229> you<00:05:23.229> know<00:05:23.350> you

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
couple I'm color rares you know you

handle<00:05:24.040> things<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.370> lot<00:05:24.520> easier<00:05:24.690> but<00:05:25.690> this<00:05:26.080> is

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
handle things a lot easier but this is

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.800 
handle things a lot easier but this is
an<00:05:26.350> example<00:05:26.680> of<00:05:27.130> a<00:05:27.310> blue-white<00:05:28.090> build<00:05:28.570> that<00:05:28.720> I

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
an example of a blue-white build that I

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.550 
an example of a blue-white build that I
think<00:05:29.080> would<00:05:29.350> be<00:05:29.530> competitive<00:05:30.100> in<00:05:31.290> your<00:05:32.290> draft

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
think would be competitive in your draft

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.000 
think would be competitive in your draft
