00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.430 
alright now we're going to type in
straight<00:01:49.090> floor<00:01:49.420> elevation<00:01:49.750> true<00:01:50.110> so<00:01:50.350> it

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
straight floor elevation true so it

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.160 
straight floor elevation true so it
stays<00:01:50.710> like<00:01:50.950> that<00:01:50.980> for<00:01:51.160> good<00:01:51.690> now<00:01:52.690> we<00:01:52.750> get<00:01:53.080> to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
there you go guys an infinity pool well

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.210 
there you go guys an infinity pool well
that's<00:02:18.550> how<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:19.180> think<00:02:19.690> it's<00:02:20.470> supposed<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.040> be
