I'm<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.059> sure<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.360> sure<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.840> has<00:00:39.930> been<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
I'm not sure for sure this has been a

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.979 
I'm not sure for sure this has been a
game<00:00:41.579> from<00:00:41.760> about<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> week<00:00:42.300> ago<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.840> also

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
game from about a week ago and also

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.770 
game from about a week ago and also
marathon<00:00:43.559> kind<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.700> half<00:00:45.239> tues<00:00:45.539> if

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.299 
marathon kind of like the half tues if
you<00:00:45.899> want<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.170> run<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.649> gun<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.070> should

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
you want to run and gun but you should

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
you want to run and gun but you should
probably<00:00:47.340> use<00:00:47.730> lightweight<00:00:48.110> now<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
probably use lightweight now I know a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.020 
probably use lightweight now I know a
lot<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.739> people<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.550> map<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
lot of people don't like this map and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
lot of people don't like this map and
that's<00:00:51.180> fine<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:51.930> say<00:00:52.199> the

that's fine it you know they say the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.560 
that's fine it you know they say the
spawns<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.399> whatever<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.120> know<00:00:54.239> in

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
spawns or whatever but you know in

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.479 
spawns or whatever but you know in
hidden<00:00:55.289> feelings<00:00:55.530> are<00:00:55.800> probably<00:00:56.070> they<00:00:56.280> can't

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489

thoughts<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:49.080> being<00:04:49.259> good<00:04:49.469> but<00:04:49.680> that's<00:04:49.830> just

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
thoughts of being good but that's just

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.649 
thoughts of being good but that's just
not<00:04:50.129> me<00:04:50.310> I'm<00:04:50.639> never<00:04:50.969> going<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.210> play<00:04:51.240> like<00:04:51.509> that

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
not me I'm never going to play like that

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.209 
not me I'm never going to play like that
I<00:04:51.870> would<00:04:52.080> have<00:04:52.199> to<00:04:52.289> kill<00:04:52.319> myself<00:04:52.680> if<00:04:52.949> I<00:04:53.069> did

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219 
I would have to kill myself if I did

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.270 
I would have to kill myself if I did
play<00:04:53.400> like<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.759> and<00:04:54.719> I<00:04:55.469> don't<00:04:55.500> understand

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
play like that and I don't understand

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.089 
play like that and I don't understand
how<00:04:56.370> people<00:04:56.430> can<00:04:56.759> play<00:04:57.180> like<00:04:57.360> that<00:04:58.069> but<00:04:59.069> uh

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
how people can play like that but uh

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.149 
how people can play like that but uh
hopefully<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:01.020> spawns<00:05:01.349> will<00:05:01.710> help<00:05:01.919> you<00:05:02.009> out

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:02.159 
hopefully the spawns will help you out

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:03.499 
hopefully the spawns will help you out
learning<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.580> spawns<00:05:02.849> I<00:05:03.090> knew<00:05:03.210> there'd<00:05:03.389> be<00:05:03.389> a

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
learning the spawns I knew there'd be a

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.219 
learning the spawns I knew there'd be a
spawn<00:05:03.810> there<00:05:04.050> so<00:05:04.349> I<00:05:05.150> think<00:05:06.150> it's<00:05:06.360> a<00:05:06.449> car<00:05:06.659> here<00:05:07.199> I

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
spawn there so I think it's a car here I

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.649 
spawn there so I think it's a car here I
shoot<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.830> speed<00:05:08.099> off<00:05:08.250> nope<00:05:08.580> not<00:05:09.180> him<00:05:09.419> I<00:05:09.509> thought

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
shoot a speed off nope not him I thought

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.839 
shoot a speed off nope not him I thought
it<00:05:09.750> was<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.870> car<00:05:10.139> there<00:05:10.319> but<00:05:11.009> I<00:05:11.039> shot<00:05:11.250> his<00:05:11.430> ankles

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
it was a car there but I shot his ankles

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.480 
it was a car there but I shot his ankles
off<00:05:12.000> anyway<00:05:12.590> just<00:05:13.590> know<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.889> spawns<00:05:14.159> if<00:05:14.370> I'm

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490
