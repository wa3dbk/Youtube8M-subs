00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
middle finger and then that causes

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.449 
middle finger and then that causes
almost<00:01:21.659> an<00:01:21.780> immediate<00:01:22.200> hotspot<00:01:22.799> or<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.039> can<00:01:23.280> try

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:23.459
