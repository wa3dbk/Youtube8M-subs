00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.830 
to an hour just to keep the legs loose
ok<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.500> i<00:03:59.769> instead<00:04:00.459> of<00:04:00.519> doing<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:01.150> higher<00:04:01.570> end

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
ok so i instead of doing that higher end

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.680 
ok so i instead of doing that higher end
workout<00:04:02.230> I<00:04:02.440> backed<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.190> off<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.610> I<00:04:04.269> did<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.480> low

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
workout I backed it off and I did a low

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.770 
workout I backed it off and I did a low
intensity<00:04:05.110> workout<00:04:05.590> but<00:04:06.070> my<00:04:07.060> point<00:04:07.330> is<00:04:07.450> had<00:04:07.750> I

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
intensity workout but my point is had I

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.960 
intensity workout but my point is had I
tried<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.320> do<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.470> higher<00:04:08.739> intensity<00:04:09.220> workout<00:04:09.760> I

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
tried to do a higher intensity workout I

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.610 
tried to do a higher intensity workout I
never<00:04:10.450> would<00:04:10.660> have<00:04:10.690> been<00:04:10.930> able<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.230> accomplish

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
never would have been able to accomplish

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.000 
never would have been able to accomplish
my<00:04:12.430> goals<00:04:12.730> anyway<00:04:13.330> my<00:04:13.780> power<00:04:14.050> goals<00:04:14.380> hitting

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
my goals anyway my power goals hitting

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.560 
my goals anyway my power goals hitting
those<00:04:15.130> zones<00:04:15.459> it<00:04:15.760> never<00:04:16.030> would<00:04:16.209> happen

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
those zones it never would happen

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.120 
those zones it never would happen
because<00:04:16.690> my<00:04:16.959> legs<00:04:17.229> just<00:04:17.320> weren't<00:04:17.590> there<00:04:17.830> for

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
because my legs just weren't there for

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.509 
because my legs just weren't there for
it<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:20.049> point<00:04:20.290> is<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:20.769> need<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.280> make<00:04:21.459> sure

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
it so the point is you need to make sure

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.659 
it so the point is you need to make sure
that<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.660> adjust<00:04:23.169> your<00:04:23.410> schedule<00:04:23.680> depending

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
that you adjust your schedule depending

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.340 
that you adjust your schedule depending
on how<00:04:25.210> you're<00:04:25.450> feeling<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:25.990> how<00:04:26.169> you're

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
on how you're feeling and how you're

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.110 
on how you're feeling and how you're
recovering<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:27.010> makes<00:04:27.460> no<00:04:27.760> sense<00:04:27.790> whatsoever

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
recovering it makes no sense whatsoever

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.020 
recovering it makes no sense whatsoever
to<00:04:28.840> try<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.350> do<00:04:29.560> quality<00:04:30.100> work<00:04:30.130> if<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:30.820> don't

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
to try to do quality work if you don't

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.790 
to try to do quality work if you don't
have<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.360> legs<00:04:31.600> for<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:31.930> or<00:04:32.290> if<00:04:32.440> your<00:04:32.560> heart

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
have the legs for it or if your heart

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.730 
have the legs for it or if your heart
rate<00:04:32.979> can't<00:04:33.520> get<00:04:33.669> elevated<00:04:34.030> it<00:04:34.330> doesn't<00:04:35.020> make

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
rate can't get elevated it doesn't make

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.440 
rate can't get elevated it doesn't make
any<00:04:35.950> sense<00:04:36.160> it's<00:04:36.400> not<00:04:36.610> going<00:04:36.789> to<00:04:36.850> benefit<00:04:37.270> you

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
any sense it's not going to benefit you

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.870 
any sense it's not going to benefit you
you're<00:04:37.840> better<00:04:38.110> off<00:04:38.200> having<00:04:38.919> a<00:04:39.130> recovery<00:04:39.610> type

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
you're better off having a recovery type

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.940 
you're better off having a recovery type
day<00:04:40.120> active<00:04:40.600> recovery<00:04:40.870> workout<00:04:41.440> or<00:04:41.740> me
