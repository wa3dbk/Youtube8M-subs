 hi there, this is the channel of peaks and with you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.359
 I am a programmer and today I would like you 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.059
 show so very simple and pretty 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.040
 still an interesting mechanism using 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.620
 which can do about here 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.750
 such things we see here such 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.449
 big mouth tree no leverage 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.420
 we have nothing here just one stump 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.750
 is seen and impersonating that he is something 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.359
 can do to open on our 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.390
 secret door behind this tree 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.740
 is let's say let's say the base is well 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.140
 or just some room 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.030
 the secret and to get us there 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.989
 we need to take any absolutely thing 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.879
 come up and throw on the toyota's block here and 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.680
 we open our door we can 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.300
 go and take back our snowball like me 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.579
 already said the mechanism is very simple 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.530
 and build his survival in a minute a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.309
 maybe even better and will be 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.590
 no work 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.190
 Mechanism looks like this 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.770
 and for its construction we need 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.899
 just blocks comparator trolley with 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.580
 funnel ejector funnels shore 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.560
 with 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.630
 beginning to retreat to the desired height 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.000
 which we will build our mechanism 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.510
 for example here and here we will throw our 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.750
 blocks 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.640
 to activate the system under this 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.030
 building the very top block here 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.659
 Here we put the figure in any direction 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.030
 funnel tearing all the blocks except the very 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.810
 top 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:35.810
 we put rails on rails on a funnel 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.810
 put the cart further connect 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.030
 comparator 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.060
 so that our trolley does not fall to 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:51.170
 the comparator read the signal from 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:58.590
 funnels and continue with repeaters 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:00.150
 our simple network still remains 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.979
 connect to the funnel in that direction where 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.100
 she looks ejector and basically 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.200
 the system is ready let's check we throw 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.480
 here any block we have a signal 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.940
 let's for example put it with a piston 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.940
 throw something wrong here 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.480
 Here we have activated pistons as you 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.689
 saw me in the preview is redstone 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.700
 signal to be connected to ti3 heroes what 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:33.870
 allowed to use this heart tone 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.909
 signal as a lever this system can 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.930
 connect to absolutely any mechanism and 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.069
 use as soon as you want 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.290
 limited in principle only to your 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.930
 by fantasy 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.650
 then you can connect here when we 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.700
 throw here 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.030
 some block it falls into our trolley 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.489
 with the funnel, then the boot is transferred 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.250
 funnel over here and now our funnel 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.170
 hands over the ejector and our items 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.180
 but of course the ejector is very small 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.299
 cells that can put something 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.370
 and therefore it is possible to further it somehow 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.500
 continue to the chests to lead or something 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.340
 still for example as you saw again 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.739
 I have a preview 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.980
 I had this system connected to 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:20.129
 the trolley system that is when here 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.959
 something was falling up here another 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:26.340
 funnel trolley 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:31.109
 all loaded and left to the point where I 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.790
 came and unloaded all the items in 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.400
 Principle on this all with you I was 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.629
 programmer and channel topics 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.150
 subscribe to the topic channel as well 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.150
 my all until all the luck
