00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
concept is pretty simple you just tap

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.230 
concept is pretty simple you just tap
your<00:00:04.799> screen<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.520> make<00:00:05.609> your<00:00:05.790> little<00:00:06.060> bird

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
your screen to make your little bird

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
flap and you try to go between all the

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.440 
flap and you try to go between all the
pipes<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:08.670> that<00:00:08.700> way<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:08.940> can<00:00:09.179> continue

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
pipes so that way you can continue

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.799 
pipes so that way you can continue
flapping<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.200> increasing<00:00:10.620> points<00:00:10.950> however

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
flapping and increasing points however

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
was really really very invigorating

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.270 
was really really very invigorating
I<00:01:29.880> mean<00:01:30.329> I'm<00:01:30.540> figuring<00:01:30.900> angering<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.159> he

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
I mean I'm figuring angering and he

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.760 
I mean I'm figuring angering and he
started<00:01:32.490> swearing<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.119> cursing<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.990> bad<00:01:34.259> he

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
started swearing and cursing is bad he

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
started swearing and cursing is bad he

was actually taken away by other
officers<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> guess<00:01:36.990> he<00:01:37.110> was<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.290> kind<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
officers but I guess he was just kind of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.310 
officers but I guess he was just kind of
shaking<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:38.070> Gary<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.360> accused<00:01:39.780> actually

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
shaking up Gary the accused actually

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.649 
shaking up Gary the accused actually
said<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.890> anyone<00:01:41.759> who<00:01:41.939> played<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.479> game

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.899 
said that anyone who played the game
themselves<00:01:43.049> would<00:01:43.710> probably<00:01:44.369> understand<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
themselves would probably understand the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.450 
themselves would probably understand the
reason<00:01:45.210> he<00:01:45.360> did<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.950> but<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> next<00:01:47.220> time

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
reason he did that but the next time

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.980 
reason he did that but the next time
someone<00:01:47.790> tells<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> game<00:01:48.780> was

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
