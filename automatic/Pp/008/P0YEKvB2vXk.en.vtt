design<00:00:39.750> challenge<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.469> us<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.160> that

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
design challenge for us and that is that

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.930 
design challenge for us and that is that
we<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:42.899> retractable<00:00:43.500> gear<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.489> need<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
we have retractable gear so we need to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.729 
we have retractable gear so we need to
get<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.239> wheel<00:00:45.510> back<00:00:45.539> up<00:00:46.079> inside<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
get that wheel back up inside of the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.889 
get that wheel back up inside of the
well<00:00:46.950> when<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.489> want<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.910> land<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> water

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
well when we want to land on the water

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.200 
well when we want to land on the water
or<00:00:49.260> when<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.559> laughter<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.219> take<00:00:50.430> off<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.180> that

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
or when we laughter we take off so that

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
or when we laughter we take off so that
wheel<00:00:51.510> can't<00:00:51.870> be<00:00:51.960> cocked<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> side<00:00:52.500> one

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
wheel can't be cocked to the side one

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.670 
wheel can't be cocked to the side one
side<00:00:53.219> or<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> other<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:55.170> developed<00:00:55.559> an

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
side or the other so we developed an

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.520 
side or the other so we developed an
innovative<00:00:56.190> little<00:00:56.520> mechanism<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.960> you'll

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
innovative little mechanism that you'll

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.260 
innovative little mechanism that you'll
see<00:00:58.739> up<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> slide<00:00:59.579> between<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
see up there on the slide between the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
see up there on the slide between the
nose<00:01:00.539> gear<00:01:00.750> door<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> strut<00:01:01.710> you'll<00:01:01.949> see

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
nose gear door and the strut you'll see

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.899 
nose gear door and the strut you'll see
that<00:01:03.110> aluminum<00:01:04.110> gas<00:01:05.040> strut<00:01:05.430> that's<00:01:05.700> there

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
that aluminum gas strut that's there

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.429 
that aluminum gas strut that's there
actually<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> spring<00:01:06.689> strut<00:01:06.990> right<00:01:07.229> there

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
actually it's a spring strut right there

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.710 
actually it's a spring strut right there
and<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.979> rides<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> little<00:01:08.850> cam<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.390> that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
and that rides on a little cam on that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.109 
and that rides on a little cam on that
nose<00:01:10.560> wheel<00:01:10.799> mechanism<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:11.729> soon<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
nose wheel mechanism so as soon as the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
nose wheel mechanism so as soon as the
weights<00:01:12.299> off<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> nose<00:01:13.049> wheel<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.920> cam

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
weights off of the nose wheel that cam

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
weights off of the nose wheel that cam
rotates<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.119> gear<00:01:15.360> around<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.869> centers

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
rotates that gear around it centers

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.840 
rotates that gear around it centers
itself<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.680> perfectly<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.189> when<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> retract

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
itself up perfectly so when you retract

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.429 
itself up perfectly so when you retract
it<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.150> goes<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.750> into<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.080> wheel<00:01:19.200> well

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
it it goes right up into the wheel well

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.609 
it it goes right up into the wheel well
and<00:01:19.880> retraction<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.210> airplane<00:01:21.619> turned

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
and retraction on this airplane turned

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.859 
and retraction on this airplane turned
out<00:01:22.799> very<00:01:22.830> nice<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.759> only<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.090> seven<00:01:24.479> second

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
out very nice it's only a seven second

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.260 
out very nice it's only a seven second
retract<00:01:25.350> or<00:01:25.530> extend<00:01:25.890> cycle<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.549> you'll<00:01:27.090> really

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
retract or extend cycle so you'll really

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.550 
retract or extend cycle so you'll really
appreciate<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.110> forgot<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> put

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
appreciate that if you forgot to put

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.840 
appreciate that if you forgot to put
your<00:01:28.680> gear<00:01:28.770> down<00:01:29.009> until<00:01:29.280> you're<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.579> short

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
your gear down until you're on short

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.160 
your gear down until you're on short
final<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.450> still<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.869> down<00:01:31.020> with

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
final you can still get it down with

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.630 
final you can still get it down with
plenty<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.530> time<00:01:31.710> before<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.159> touch<00:01:32.369> down

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
plenty of time before you touch down

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.090 
plenty of time before you touch down
since<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.810> an<00:01:33.960> afib<00:01:34.229> YZ<00:01:34.350> aircraft<00:01:34.829> of

course landing gear up or down is really

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.010 
course landing gear up or down is really
important<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.060> depending<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.720> whether<00:01:39.900> you

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
important right depending on whether you

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.990 
important right depending on whether you
land<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.619> land<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:41.220> whether<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.670> land<00:01:41.850> on

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
land on a land or whether you land on

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.740 
land on a land or whether you land on
water<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.810> designed<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:44.310> interior<00:01:45.240> such

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
water so we designed the interior such

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
water so we designed the interior such
that<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.259> actually<00:01:46.530> designed<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.979> are<00:01:47.100> out<00:01:47.189> of

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
that we actually designed it are out of

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.160 
that we actually designed it are out of
procedure<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.240> procedure<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.810> something

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
procedure the procedure is something

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.399 
procedure the procedure is something
that<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.439> want<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> always<00:01:49.860> repeat<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
that you want to always repeat so the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.960 
that you want to always repeat so the
way<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.710> works<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> inside<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.729> you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
way that works is on the inside and you

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.260 
way that works is on the inside and you
can<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.680> slide<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:56.130> there<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.909> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
can see on this slide up there we have a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.300 
can see on this slide up there we have a
very<00:01:57.950> exposed

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
very exposed

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.730 
very exposed
landing<00:02:00.060> gear<00:02:00.270> lever<00:02:00.750> that's<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.469> most

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
landing gear lever that's the most

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740 
landing gear lever that's the most
prominent<00:02:02.280> lever<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> cockpit<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.509> that

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
prominent lever in the cockpit so that

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.530 
prominent lever in the cockpit so that
when<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:05.100> know<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.610> rush<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.360> can

when you you know are in a rush you can

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.330 
when you you know are in a rush you can
find<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.960> instantly<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.710> has<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> certain

straight landing strip there what you do

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.610 
straight landing strip there what you do
is<00:02:37.859> you<00:02:38.010> socio<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.609> select<00:02:39.090> your<00:02:39.720> landing

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
is you socio you select your landing

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.740 
is you socio you select your landing
gear<00:02:40.650> position<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.640> check<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> light

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
gear position you check that the light

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.729 
gear position you check that the light
is<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.079> and<00:02:43.439> then<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.670> see<00:02:45.260> for<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.560> few

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
is on and then you see for the few

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.110 
is on and then you see for the few
people<00:02:46.769> here<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.459> see<00:02:47.639> it<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.940> wing

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
people here you can see it in the wing

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.089 
people here you can see it in the wing
there's<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.480> wing<00:02:48.659> cuff<00:02:48.959> inside<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.920> wing

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
there's the wing cuff inside the wing

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.099 
there's the wing cuff inside the wing
cuff<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.730> think<00:02:51.209> we<00:02:51.299> have<00:02:51.389> a<00:02:51.420> slide<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.959> as

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
cuff I think we have a slide on that as

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.920 
cuff I think we have a slide on that as
well<00:02:52.319> inside<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.459> wing<00:02:53.639> covers<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:53.970> small<00:02:54.150> set

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
well inside the wing covers a small set

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.319 
well inside the wing covers a small set
of<00:02:54.959> mirrors<00:02:55.409> they're<00:02:55.950> exactly<00:02:56.790> curved<00:02:57.120> to

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
of mirrors they're exactly curved to

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.179 
of mirrors they're exactly curved to
show<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:57.629> where<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.139> gear<00:02:58.409> is<00:02:58.590> with<00:02:58.859> it's<00:02:59.040> in

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
show you where the gear is with it's in

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.830 
show you where the gear is with it's in
down<00:02:59.370> position<00:02:59.939> so<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.180> double<00:03:00.629> check

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
down position so you double check

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.929 
down position so you double check
whether<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.829> mirror<00:03:02.099> shows<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.639> that<00:03:02.790> the

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
whether the mirror shows you that the

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.080 
whether the mirror shows you that the
gear<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.269> where<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:03.569> supposed<00:03:03.629> to<00:03:04.019> be<00:03:05.090> so

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
gear is where it's supposed to be so

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.629 
gear is where it's supposed to be so
that<00:03:06.329> way<00:03:06.569> we<00:03:06.900> continue<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.799> always<00:03:08.370> follow

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
that way we continue to always follow

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.429 
that way we continue to always follow
that<00:03:08.909> procedure<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.510> should<00:03:09.540> be<00:03:09.900> able<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.200> be

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
that procedure you should be able to be

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.960 
that procedure you should be able to be
able<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.650> be<00:03:10.889> very<00:03:11.129> sure<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.549> where<00:03:11.760> that

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
able to be very sure of where that

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.349 
able to be very sure of where that
landing<00:03:12.540> gear<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:13.459> yeah<00:03:14.459> another<00:03:14.939> feature<00:03:15.209> of

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
landing gear is yeah another feature of

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.330 
landing gear is yeah another feature of
the<00:03:15.689> the<00:03:16.230> landing<00:03:16.530> gear<00:03:16.709> Oh<00:03:16.739> talk<00:03:16.980> about<00:03:17.220> the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
the the landing gear Oh talk about the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.740 
the the landing gear Oh talk about the
nose<00:03:17.519> gear<00:03:17.699> doors<00:03:17.940> for<00:03:18.239> just<00:03:18.419> a<00:03:18.510> minute

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.720 
because it is a seaplane the gear doors
are<00:03:22.169> actually<00:03:22.530> very<00:03:22.829> robust<00:03:23.280> part<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:23.639> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
are actually very robust part of the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.490 
are actually very robust part of the
structure<00:03:24.090> actually<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.629> hull<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:25.079> probably

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
structure actually the hull is probably

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.259 
structure actually the hull is probably
one<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.919> most<00:03:26.190> robust<00:03:26.609> parts<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.150> a

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
one of the most robust parts of a

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.439 
one of the most robust parts of a
seaplane<00:03:27.660> in<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.930> first<00:03:28.139> place<00:03:28.409> so<00:03:29.419> how<00:03:30.419> that

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
seaplane in the first place so how that

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.390 
seaplane in the first place so how that
suits<00:03:30.840> us<00:03:31.019> very<00:03:31.049> well<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.680> those<00:03:31.949> gear<00:03:32.159> doors

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
suits us very well is those gear doors

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.789 
suits us very well is those gear doors
take<00:03:32.639> so<00:03:32.879> much<00:03:33.090> hydrodynamic<00:03:33.780> pressure<00:03:33.930> that

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
take so much hydrodynamic pressure that

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.920 
take so much hydrodynamic pressure that
they're<00:03:35.340> very<00:03:35.549> well<00:03:35.819> suited<00:03:36.239> when<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.810> go

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
they're very well suited when you go

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.869 
they're very well suited when you go
ahead<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.290> Beach<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:37.709> airplane<00:03:38.190> on<00:03:38.370> the

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
ahead and Beach this airplane on the

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.229 
ahead and Beach this airplane on the
shore<00:03:39.199> not<00:03:40.199> on<00:03:40.349> a<00:03:40.379> rock<00:03:40.680> but<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.729> shore<00:03:41.970> you

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
shore not on a rock but on the shore you

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.210 
shore not on a rock but on the shore you
can<00:03:42.540> go<00:03:42.750> ahead<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.019> those<00:03:43.650> doors<00:03:43.919> are<00:03:44.099> going

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
can go ahead and those doors are going

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.240 
can go ahead and those doors are going
to<00:03:44.310> support<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.790> just<00:03:45.150> fine<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.139> that<00:03:47.010> works

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
to support you just fine so that works

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.390 
to support you just fine so that works
so<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:47.849> works<00:03:48.269> really<00:03:48.479> well<00:03:48.659> for<00:03:48.720> us<00:03:49.139> and

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
so that works really well for us and

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.559 
so that works really well for us and
there's<00:03:50.400> one<00:03:50.639> other<00:03:50.790> feature<00:03:51.030> that's<00:03:51.449> a

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
there's one other feature that's a

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.180 
there's one other feature that's a
little<00:03:51.780> bit<00:03:51.930> hard<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.169> see<00:03:52.229> here<00:03:52.769> but<00:03:52.949> you'll

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
little bit hard to see here but you'll

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.159 
little bit hard to see here but you'll
see<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.459> up<00:03:53.579> there<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.090> slide<00:03:54.419> so<00:03:54.870> just

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
see it up there and that slide so just

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.770 
see it up there and that slide so just
on<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.409> front<00:03:55.620> edge<00:03:55.889> of<00:03:56.069> these<00:03:56.280> doors<00:03:56.780> there

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
on the front edge of these doors there

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.509 
on the front edge of these doors there
is<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.959> gap<00:03:58.319> that's<00:03:58.560> opened<00:03:58.979> up<00:03:59.040> when<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.340> gear

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
is a gap that's opened up when the gear

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.509 
is a gap that's opened up when the gear
door<00:03:59.729> is<00:03:59.819> open<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:00.479> when<00:04:01.319> we<00:04:01.979> took<00:04:02.340> our

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
door is open and when we took our

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.490 
door is open and when we took our
proof-of-concept<00:04:02.879> airplane<00:04:03.540> taxied<00:04:04.019> it<00:04:04.139> into

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
proof-of-concept airplane taxied it into

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.589 
proof-of-concept airplane taxied it into
some<00:04:05.220> seaweed<00:04:05.459> filled<00:04:05.849> water<00:04:06.150> we<00:04:06.479> actually

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
some seaweed filled water we actually

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.490 
some seaweed filled water we actually
did<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:06.959> down<00:04:07.290> here<00:04:07.680> when<00:04:08.609> lake<00:04:08.970> winnebago

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
did that down here when lake winnebago

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.839 
did that down here when lake winnebago
all<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.680> seaweed<00:04:10.979> got<00:04:11.159> trapped<00:04:11.489> right<00:04:11.729> in

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
all the seaweed got trapped right in

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.879 
all the seaweed got trapped right in
that<00:04:11.940> hinge<00:04:12.209> line<00:04:12.449> really<00:04:13.229> annoying<00:04:13.530> because

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
that hinge line really annoying because

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.170 
that hinge line really annoying because
then<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.129> got<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.310> shut<00:04:14.459> down<00:04:14.669> you<00:04:14.819> got<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:14.970> get

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
then you got to shut down you got to get

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.849 
then you got to shut down you got to get
out<00:04:15.329> and<00:04:15.359> get<00:04:15.659> it<00:04:15.810> take<00:04:15.989> that<00:04:16.139> seaweed<00:04:16.500> out<00:04:16.709> of

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
out and get it take that seaweed out of

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:17.120 
out and get it take that seaweed out of
there

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
there

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.250 
there
so<00:04:17.579> these<00:04:17.729> shark<00:04:18.060> fins<00:04:18.329> is<00:04:18.630> we<00:04:18.810> call<00:04:19.049> them

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
so these shark fins is we call them

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.319 
so these shark fins is we call them
placed<00:04:19.799> strategically<00:04:20.220> right<00:04:20.909> in<00:04:21.000> front<00:04:21.209> of

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
placed strategically right in front of

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.209 
placed strategically right in front of
that<00:04:21.389> gap<00:04:21.779> will<00:04:22.380> actually<00:04:22.650> deflect<00:04:23.070> the

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
that gap will actually deflect the

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:24.649 
that gap will actually deflect the
seaweed<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:23.760> that<00:04:23.909> doesn't<00:04:24.150> get<00:04:24.300> caught<00:04:24.539> in

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
seaweed so that doesn't get caught in

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:25.310 
seaweed so that doesn't get caught in
that<00:04:24.690> gear<00:04:24.990> door

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
that gear door

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.350 
that gear door
and<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.800> gear<00:04:26.010> comes<00:04:26.280> up<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.700> heats<00:04:27.210> itself

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
and the gear comes up and heats itself

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.240 
and the gear comes up and heats itself
nicely<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.140> get<00:04:28.320> gear<00:04:28.530> up<00:04:28.680> indication

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
nicely so you get gear up indication

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.720 
nicely so you get gear up indication
then<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:29.460> can<00:04:29.640> go<00:04:29.820> taxi<00:04:30.600> out<00:04:30.870> for<00:04:31.080> takeoff

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
then you can go taxi out for takeoff

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.040 
then you can go taxi out for takeoff
yeah<00:04:32.730> so<00:04:33.060> or<00:04:33.210> if<00:04:33.420> you<00:04:33.570> go<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.840> other<00:04:33.960> way

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
yeah so or if you go the other way

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.870 
yeah so or if you go the other way
around<00:04:34.440> if<00:04:34.650> you're<00:04:34.860> let's<00:04:35.160> say<00:04:35.220> landed<00:04:35.670> in<00:04:35.790> the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
around if you're let's say landed in the

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.690 
around if you're let's say landed in the
lake<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.390> gotta<00:04:36.690> go<00:04:37.470> up<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.770> ramp<00:04:37.980> so<00:04:38.640> you

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
lake and you gotta go up a ramp so you

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.300 
lake and you gotta go up a ramp so you
put<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.180> gear<00:04:39.360> down<00:04:39.600> go<00:04:40.320> up<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.590> ramp<00:04:40.740> now<00:04:41.130> of

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
put the gear down go up the ramp now of

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.380 
put the gear down go up the ramp now of
course<00:04:41.490> what<00:04:41.730> are<00:04:41.820> you<00:04:41.880> going<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.030> do<00:04:42.180> you're

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
course what are you going to do you're

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.760 
course what are you going to do you're
loaning<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.840> aircraft<00:04:43.230> right<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.530> have<00:04:43.650> the

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
loaning the aircraft right you have the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.770 
loaning the aircraft right you have the
feet<00:04:43.980> on<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.220> brake<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:45.150> got<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.420> stop<00:04:45.630> the

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
feet on the brake you got to stop the

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.570 
feet on the brake you got to stop the
air<00:04:45.900> core<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:46.230> put<00:04:46.380> socks<00:04:46.590> on<00:04:46.860> so<00:04:47.190> we<00:04:47.370> have

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
air core and put socks on so we have

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.700 
air core and put socks on so we have
actually<00:04:47.910> if<00:04:48.210> a<00:04:48.510> little<00:04:48.840> lever<00:04:49.110> that's<00:04:49.470> right

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
actually if a little lever that's right

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.800 
actually if a little lever that's right
next<00:04:50.070> to<00:04:50.160> your<00:04:50.250> seat<00:04:50.550> so<00:04:51.240> with<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.600> feet<00:04:51.750> on

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
next to your seat so with the feet on

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.240 
next to your seat so with the feet on
the<00:04:51.990> brake<00:04:52.200> you<00:04:52.410> let<00:04:52.740> move<00:04:52.920> that<00:04:53.100> lever

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
the brake you let move that lever
