that's<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.950> final<00:00:14.370> animation<00:00:14.700> we<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:15.839> see

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
that's the final animation we can see

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.760 
that's the final animation we can see
together<00:00:16.529> how<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.190> looks<00:00:18.020> you<00:00:19.020> see<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.650> have

rendering<00:00:52.170> effects<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:54.000> different

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
rendering effects we have different

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.380 
rendering effects we have different
scene<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.370> local<00:00:56.850> scene<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
scene so we have the local scene to

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.229 
scene so we have the local scene to
prepare<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> 3d<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.309> logo<00:00:59.520> gases

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
prepare the 3d we have the logo gases

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.870 
prepare the 3d we have the logo gases
where<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.050> use<00:01:02.390> fume<00:01:03.390> effects<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.680> create<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
where we use fume effects to create the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.810 
where we use fume effects to create the
simulation<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:08.220> gas<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.390> loading<00:01:10.820> so

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
simulation for the gas it is loading so

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.960 
simulation for the gas it is loading so
you<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.570> will<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.080> simulation<00:01:13.970> for

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
you see we will have to simulation for

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.219 
you see we will have to simulation for
our<00:01:15.860> gases<00:01:17.869> effects<00:01:19.610> that<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:20.850> create<00:01:21.229> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
our gases effects that will create the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.690 
our gases effects that will create the
3d<00:01:22.259> logo<00:01:24.380> will<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.560> use<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.890> fume<00:01:26.100> effects<00:01:26.460> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
3d logo will you use the fume effects to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.330 
3d logo will you use the fume effects to
make<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> dynamic<00:01:27.720> simulation<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.409> smoke<00:01:29.130> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
make a dynamic simulation of smoke and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
make a dynamic simulation of smoke and
fire<00:01:29.520> constraint<00:01:30.210> inside<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.710> Lobo<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.550 
fire constraint inside the Lobo a
spherical<00:01:32.670> logo<00:01:32.880> will<00:01:33.570> use<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.020> wavelet

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
spherical logo will use the wavelet

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.890 
spherical logo will use the wavelet
turbulence<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.340> obtain<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> better<00:01:36.060> result<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
turbulence to obtain a better result and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.999 
turbulence to obtain a better result and
we<00:01:37.280> let<00:01:38.280> also<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.880> animation<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.650> logo

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
we let also the animation of the logo

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.600 
we let also the animation of the logo
when<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.090> use<00:01:42.770> particle<00:01:43.770> flow<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.310> make<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
when we use particle flow to make it

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.630 
when we use particle flow to make it
appear<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:46.200> number<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.430> we

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
appear the number for you see that we

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.260 
appear the number for you see that we
have<00:01:47.670> animation<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.270> fluid

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
have animation and we have a fluid

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.249 
have animation and we have a fluid
creation<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:53.490> four<00:01:55.430> mesh<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.110> we<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
creation of the four mesh and we have a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.480 
creation of the four mesh and we have a
nice<00:01:58.560> tap<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.430> air<00:01:59.579> down<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.180> particle<00:02:00.780> flow

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
nice tap the air down in particle flow

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.580 
nice tap the air down in particle flow
it<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.520> pretty<00:02:03.119> simple<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.810> see<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.290> are<00:02:04.380> using

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it is pretty simple you see we are using

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.249 
it is pretty simple you see we are using
just<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.130> bird<00:02:05.369> texture<00:02:05.969> with<00:02:06.570> an<00:02:06.689> animated

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
just a bird texture with an animated

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.650 
just a bird texture with an animated
texture<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.069> control<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.910> particles<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
texture to control the particles and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.200 
texture to control the particles and
then<00:02:10.289> we'll<00:02:10.590> use<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.819> blob<00:02:12.360> mesh<00:02:12.629> to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
then we'll use the blob mesh to

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.530 
then we'll use the blob mesh to
the<00:02:13.390> fluids<00:02:14.100> everything<00:02:15.100> will<00:02:15.340> be<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.790> compass

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
the fluids everything will be a compass

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.080 
the fluids everything will be a compass
I<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:19.080> fusion<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.770> see<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.280> we<00:02:21.520> have<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.790> more

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
I in fusion you see that we have a more

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.950 
I in fusion you see that we have a more
complex<00:02:22.510> scene<00:02:22.890> than<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.340> other<00:02:24.670> time<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.720> we

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
complex scene than the other time so we

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.370 
complex scene than the other time so we
have<00:02:26.080> different<00:02:26.440> steps<00:02:27.070> as<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:29.020> see<00:02:29.260> that's

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
have different steps as you see that's

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.530 
have different steps as you see that's
one<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.740> frame<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.680> see<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.250> have

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
one of the frame so you see we have

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.860 
one of the frame so you see we have
various<00:02:37.540> passes<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.820> control<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.060> animation

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
various passes to control the animation

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.590 
various passes to control the animation
and<00:02:41.080> control<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.860> look<00:02:42.030> we<00:02:43.030> have<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.360> same

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
and control the look we have the same

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.420 
and control the look we have the same
for<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.170> other<00:02:44.500> passes<00:02:45.210> so<00:02:46.210> you<00:02:46.270> see<00:02:46.750> we<00:02:46.960> have

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
