00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
well it's Saturday morning and the motor

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.759 
well it's Saturday morning and the motor
is<00:00:07.830> up<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.160> dyno<00:00:08.460> this<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.450> where<00:00:09.710> this<00:00:10.710> is

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
is up on the dyno this is where this is

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.290 
is up on the dyno this is where this is
where<00:00:10.950> we<00:00:11.070> find<00:00:11.219> out<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.429> truth<00:00:11.730> whether<00:00:12.179> or

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
where we find out the truth whether or

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.419 
where we find out the truth whether or
not<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.509> motor<00:00:12.690> does<00:00:12.870> what<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.139> wanted<00:00:13.469> we're

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
not the motor does what we wanted we're

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.670 
not the motor does what we wanted we're
really<00:00:15.269> looking<00:00:15.450> for<00:00:15.780> just<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.020> nice<00:00:16.260> Street

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
really looking for just a nice Street

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.870 
really looking for just a nice Street
engine<00:00:18.020> we'll<00:00:19.020> see<00:00:19.199> what<00:00:19.320> happens<00:00:19.640> it<00:00:20.640> really

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
engine we'll see what happens it really

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.429 
engine we'll see what happens it really
turned<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.240> aesthetically<00:00:21.779> pretty<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.199> think

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
turned out aesthetically pretty I think

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.540 
turned out aesthetically pretty I think
it's<00:00:22.529> going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> be<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> good<00:00:22.949> looking<00:00:23.220> motor<00:00:23.400> in

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
it's going to be a good looking motor in

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.700 
it's going to be a good looking motor in
the<00:00:23.640> car<00:00:23.670> once<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:24.539> painted<00:00:24.750> that's<00:00:25.470> up<00:00:25.680> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the car once it's painted that's up to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:38.049 
the car once it's painted that's up to
John<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:29.609> truth<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.179> about<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.810> be<00:00:30.929> known

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.340 

well<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> key<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.570> chose<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> Lunati

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
well the key we chose is the Lunati

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.010 
well the key we chose is the Lunati
voodoo<00:00:40.770> series<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.250> cams<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.840> went

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
voodoo series of cams the one we went

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.709 
voodoo series of cams the one we went
with<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> ground<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.190> 114<00:00:45.000> degrees<00:00:45.210> lobe

with is a ground on 114 degrees lobe
separation<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.100> 554<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> intake<00:00:48.710> 575

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
separation it's a 554 on the intake 575

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
on the exhaust this cam almost sounds

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.170 
on the exhaust this cam almost sounds
like<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.649> would<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.859> big<00:00:59.070> if<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.309> was<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.579> 454

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
like it would be big if it was in a 454

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.360 
like it would be big if it was in a 454
but<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.260> about<00:01:01.500> 50<00:01:01.710> cubes<00:01:02.129> bigger

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
but because it's about 50 cubes bigger

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
but because it's about 50 cubes bigger
than<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> 454<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.989> give<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
than a 454 it's going to give the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.820 
than a 454 it's going to give the
illusion<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> mild<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:06.830> we

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
illusion that it's a mild or can we

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
illusion that it's a mild or can we
chose<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.310> put<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.580> cam<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.970> two<00:01:09.450> degrees

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
chose to put the cam in two degrees

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.440 
chose to put the cam in two degrees
farther<00:01:10.229> advanced<00:01:10.770> than<00:01:11.070> its<00:01:11.250> ground<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.150> what

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
farther advanced than its ground so what

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.810 
farther advanced than its ground so what
I<00:01:12.479> mean<00:01:12.720> by<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.590> cams<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.979> 114<00:01:14.610> lobe

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
I mean by that is this cams a 114 lobe

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.510 
I mean by that is this cams a 114 lobe
separation<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.960> ground<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.430> you

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
separation it's ground so that if you

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.920 
separation it's ground so that if you
put<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.850> straight<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.509> would<00:01:18.630> come<00:01:18.810> in

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
put it in straight up it would come in

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.130 
put it in straight up it would come in
at<00:01:19.080> 105<00:01:19.799> sorry<00:01:20.070> 112<00:01:20.840> intake<00:01:21.840> mobile

centerline<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:23.250> chose<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.610> advance<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.270> two

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.999 
centerline we chose to advance it two
degrees<00:01:24.659> from<00:01:24.689> there<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.500> now<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
degrees from there so now it's the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
degrees from there so now it's the
intake<00:01:26.220> mobile<00:01:26.460> center<00:01:26.670> line<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.479> 110

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.289 
intake mobile center line is in at 110
that<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:28.740> sounds<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.100> lot<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> bunch<00:01:30.210> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that all sounds a lot like a bunch of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.330 
that all sounds a lot like a bunch of
technical<00:01:30.750> stuff<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.380> from<00:01:31.560> experience<00:01:31.680> we

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
technical stuff but from experience we

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.399 
technical stuff but from experience we
find<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.850> these<00:01:33.689> motors<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> have

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
find that these motors like to have

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.520 
find that these motors like to have
their<00:01:34.560> cams<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.979> around<00:01:35.540> 110<00:01:36.540> degrees<00:01:36.930> no

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
their cams in around 110 degrees no

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.069 
their cams in around 110 degrees no
matter<00:01:37.710> what<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.670> actually<00:01:38.850> funny<00:01:39.270> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
matter what it's actually funny you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.270 
matter what it's actually funny you
advance<00:01:40.380> them<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> little<00:01:40.650> bit<00:01:40.829> more<00:01:40.950> they<00:01:41.070> tend

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
advance them a little bit more they tend

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.440 
advance them a little bit more they tend
to<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> little<00:01:41.579> bit<00:01:41.729> more<00:01:41.850> torque<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to have a little bit more torque and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.030 
to have a little bit more torque and
just<00:01:42.720> everything<00:01:42.899> seemed<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.380> happier

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
just everything seemed to be happier

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.249 
just everything seemed to be happier
obviously<00:01:44.820> that's<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> dinos<00:01:45.509> for<00:01:45.780> we're

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
obviously that's what a dinos for we're

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.590 
obviously that's what a dinos for we're
going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.439> find<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:46.829> we're<00:01:46.979> wrong<00:01:47.600> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
going to find out if we're wrong the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
going to find out if we're wrong the
goal<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.110> say<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.439> goal<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.799> this

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
goal like I say the goal is for this

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.160 
goal like I say the goal is for this
thing<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> idle<00:01:50.640> nice<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.090> think<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.930> cam

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
thing to idle nice I think that this cam

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.530 
thing to idle nice I think that this cam
will<00:01:52.320> make<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> idle<00:01:52.860> nice<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.270> going<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
will make it idle nice it's not going to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.870 
will make it idle nice it's not going to

lifters<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:10.030> Lunati<00:02:10.420> sent<00:02:10.720> us<00:02:10.869> I'm<00:02:11.970> used<00:02:12.970> to

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
lifters that Lunati sent us I'm used to

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.750 
lifters that Lunati sent us I'm used to
running<00:02:13.120> big<00:02:14.020> race<00:02:14.560> car<00:02:14.830> stuff<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:15.340> know<00:02:15.430> the

see these lifters or really nice-looking
pieces<00:02:22.450> they<00:02:22.930> weren't<00:02:23.230> some<00:02:23.470> chintzy<00:02:23.860> looking

junk<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.840> thought<00:02:26.110> would<00:02:26.260> fall<00:02:26.530> apart<00:02:26.860> if

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
junk that I thought would fall apart if

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.949 
junk that I thought would fall apart if
you<00:02:27.700> want<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.030> run<00:02:28.240> this<00:02:28.390> thing<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.720> mean<00:02:28.840> they

you want to run this thing I mean they

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.510 
you want to run this thing I mean they
were<00:02:29.020> nice<00:02:29.380> looking<00:02:29.770> hydraulic<00:02:30.280> roller

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
were nice looking hydraulic roller

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.550 
were nice looking hydraulic roller
lifters<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:31.480> that's<00:02:32.020> one<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.320> things<00:02:32.350> I

that<00:02:35.590> there<00:02:35.770> were<00:02:35.860> nice<00:02:36.100> lifters<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:36.990> I'm

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
that there were nice lifters and I'm

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.470 
that there were nice lifters and I'm
actually<00:02:38.650> really<00:02:38.950> happy<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.970> see<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.120> linate

actually really happy to see that linate
and<00:02:40.690> is<00:02:41.080> making<00:02:41.410> stuff<00:02:41.709> like<00:02:41.860> this<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.100> way

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
and is making stuff like this the way

00:02:42.190 --> 00:03:07.070 
and is making stuff like this the way
the<00:02:42.340> way<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.520> looks

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.710 

what's<00:03:08.080> this<00:03:08.200> deal<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.440> little<00:03:08.590> bow<00:03:09.629> what<00:03:10.629> is

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
what's this deal a little bow what is

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.369 
what's this deal a little bow what is
this<00:03:10.870> all<00:03:11.080> about<00:03:11.110> yep<00:03:12.269> this<00:03:13.269> is<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.450> spring<00:03:14.019> that

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
this all about yep this is a spring that

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.320 
this all about yep this is a spring that
controls<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.580> rate<00:03:15.790> at<00:03:15.970> which<00:03:16.000> your

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
controls the rate at which your

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.570 
controls the rate at which your
secondary<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:17.260> open<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.769> fart<00:03:18.010> by<00:03:18.129> vacuum

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
secondary is open it and fart by vacuum

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.830 
secondary is open it and fart by vacuum
the<00:03:18.730> light<00:03:18.879> of<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.030> spring<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.540> cliq<00:03:19.690> are

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
the light of the spring the cliq are

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.449 
the light of the spring the cliq are
they<00:03:19.930> open<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:20.800> what<00:03:20.950> are<00:03:20.980> we<00:03:21.099> putting<00:03:21.310> in

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
they open so what are we putting in

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.330 
they open so what are we putting in
we're<00:03:21.910> going<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.090> put<00:03:22.209> in<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.920> latest<00:03:23.920> spring

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
we're going to put in the latest spring

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.780 
we're going to put in the latest spring
we<00:03:24.459> can<00:03:24.640> get<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:25.090> then<00:03:25.330> it's<00:03:25.480> been<00:03:25.629> modified

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
we can get and then it's been modified

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.740 
we can get and then it's been modified
so<00:03:27.790> what<00:03:27.940> are<00:03:28.090> we<00:03:28.180> starting<00:03:28.569> with<00:03:28.690> the

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
so what are we starting with the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.080 
so what are we starting with the
lightest<00:03:29.110> one<00:03:29.260> in<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:29.500> mode<00:03:29.940> usually<00:03:30.940> on<00:03:31.000> the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
lightest one in this mode usually on the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.430 
lightest one in this mode usually on the
dyno<00:03:31.299> you<00:03:31.420> don't<00:03:31.660> need<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> really<00:03:32.170> heavy

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
dyno you don't need a really heavy

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.259 
dyno you don't need a really heavy
spring<00:03:32.860> because<00:03:33.519> by<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.730> time<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:34.060> falls

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
spring because by the time the falls

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.759 
spring because by the time the falls
over<00:03:34.629> the<00:03:34.660> bathroom<00:03:34.989> second<00:03:35.379> of<00:03:35.470> these<00:03:35.530> aren't

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
over the bathroom second of these aren't

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.819 
over the bathroom second of these aren't
open<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:36.690> we've<00:03:37.690> gone<00:03:37.840> from<00:03:38.049> this<00:03:38.200> spring<00:03:38.530> to

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
open so we've gone from this spring to

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.839 
open so we've gone from this spring to
this<00:03:38.980> spring<00:03:41.220> well<00:03:42.220> how's<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.489> going<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.700> be<00:03:42.760> on

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
this spring well how's it going to be on

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.449 
this spring well how's it going to be on
the<00:03:42.940> street<00:03:43.209> then<00:03:43.829> since<00:03:44.829> this<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:45.069> such<00:03:45.099> a<00:03:45.190> big

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
the street then since this is such a big

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.630 
the street then since this is such a big
engine<00:03:45.610> it's<00:03:45.880> not<00:03:46.060> going<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.269> be<00:03:46.360> an<00:03:46.480> issue<00:03:47.640> it

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
engine it's not going to be an issue it

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.369 
engine it's not going to be an issue it
definitely<00:03:49.150> could<00:03:49.390> use<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.780> secondaries

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
definitely could use the secondaries

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.200 
definitely could use the secondaries
being<00:03:50.590> open<00:03:50.890> quicker<00:03:51.870> so

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.310 

we're<00:03:55.780> gonna<00:03:57.600> put<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.690> light<00:03:58.870> spring<00:03:59.200> in

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
we're gonna put the light spring in

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.480 
we're gonna put the light spring in
there<00:03:59.500> and<00:03:59.740> it's<00:04:00.640> going<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.820> like<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:03.310> it's

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
there and it's going to like it and it's

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.140 
there and it's going to like it and it's
going<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:03.670> make<00:04:03.790> millions<00:04:04.090> of<00:04:04.360> those<00:04:04.510> pants
