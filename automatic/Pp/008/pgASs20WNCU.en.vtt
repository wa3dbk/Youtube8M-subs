00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
hello again friends we got a short video

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.949 
hello again friends we got a short video
today<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.610> demonstrate<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:03.179> new<00:00:03.300> designation

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
today to demonstrate the new designation

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.539 
today to demonstrate the new designation
and<00:00:04.080> layout<00:00:04.380> systems<00:00:04.799> which<00:00:05.460> are

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
and layout systems which are

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.690 
and layout systems which are
specifically<00:00:05.970> important<00:00:06.390> for<00:00:06.480> building

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
specifically important for building

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.620 
specifically important for building
buildings<00:00:08.700> going<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.880> be<00:00:08.970> an<00:00:09.090> obviously

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
buildings going to be an obviously

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.850 
buildings going to be an obviously
important<00:00:10.019> feature<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.349> game<00:00:10.500> so<00:00:10.830> I

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
important feature of the game so I

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.339 
important feature of the game so I
wanted<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.309> make<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.700> as<00:00:11.870> easy<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.139> quick<00:00:13.320> as

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
wanted to make it as easy and quick as

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.600 
wanted to make it as easy and quick as
possible<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.920> make<00:00:14.009> these<00:00:14.190> layout<00:00:14.490> and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
possible to make these layout and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.630 
possible to make these layout and
designations<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.389> here<00:00:15.780> we<00:00:15.870> go<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.550> went<00:00:17.550> ahead

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
designations so here we go I went ahead

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.460 
designations so here we go I went ahead
and<00:00:17.880> hit<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.210> all<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.420> train<00:00:18.690> vegetation<00:00:19.320> so

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
and hit in all the train vegetation so

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.990 
and hit in all the train vegetation so
you<00:00:19.560> guys<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.830> see<00:00:19.890> exactly<00:00:20.310> what<00:00:20.609> I'm<00:00:20.699> doing

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
you guys can see exactly what I'm doing

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.269 
you guys can see exactly what I'm doing
and<00:00:21.240> that's<00:00:21.600> why<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.840> looks<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.050> barren<00:00:22.470> so

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
and that's why it looks so barren so

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.070 
and that's why it looks so barren so
let's<00:00:23.460> design<00:00:23.730> some<00:00:23.910> structures<00:00:24.300> here<00:00:24.480> if<00:00:24.930> you

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
let's design some structures here if you

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.599 
let's design some structures here if you
watch<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.470> first<00:00:25.650> video<00:00:25.800> more<00:00:26.130> than<00:00:26.279> once<00:00:26.460> you

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
watch the first video more than once you

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.890 
watch the first video more than once you
might<00:00:26.789> immediately<00:00:27.000> notice<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.689> there's<00:00:27.840> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
might immediately notice that there's a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.540 
might immediately notice that there's a
new<00:00:28.019> tool<00:00:28.289> tip<00:00:28.529> showing<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.949> width<00:00:29.160> length

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
new tool tip showing the width length

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.009 
new tool tip showing the width length
and<00:00:29.849> height<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.240> what<00:00:30.359> I'm<00:00:30.449> selecting<00:00:30.810> here

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
and height of what I'm selecting here

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.600 
and height of what I'm selecting here
hopefully<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.920> will<00:00:32.009> help<00:00:32.130> those<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.489> you

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
hopefully this will help those of you

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.130 
hopefully this will help those of you
who<00:00:32.730> don't<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.090> hand<00:00:33.300> counting<00:00:33.570> blocks<00:00:33.809> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
who don't like hand counting blocks and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.810 
who don't like hand counting blocks and
I'm<00:00:34.680> using<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.340> down<00:00:35.489> arrow<00:00:35.730> keys

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
I'm using the up and down arrow keys

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.209 
I'm using the up and down arrow keys
here<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.390> adjust<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.719> height<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:38.100> now

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
here to adjust the height of this so now

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.979 
here to adjust the height of this so now
we<00:00:38.280> won't<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> build<00:00:38.910> towers<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.750> height

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
we won't have to build towers one height

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.080 
we won't have to build towers one height
layer<00:00:40.230> at<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.469> time<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.340> i'll<00:00:41.489> turn<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.790> camera

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
layer at a time and i'll turn the camera

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.250 
layer at a time and i'll turn the camera
a<00:00:42.149> little<00:00:42.180> bit<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.600> guys<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.930> see<00:00:43.079> that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
a little bit so you guys can see that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.720 
a little bit so you guys can see that
this<00:00:43.350> incredibly<00:00:43.800> epic<00:00:43.980> design<00:00:44.430> will<00:00:44.640> be

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
this incredibly epic design will be

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.180 
this incredibly epic design will be
built<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> height<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.360> three<00:00:45.690> blocks<00:00:46.190> next

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
built with a height of three blocks next

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.560 
built with a height of three blocks next
i'll<00:00:47.309> demonstrate<00:00:47.430> how<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> modifier<00:00:48.300> keys

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
i'll demonstrate how the modifier keys

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.450 
i'll demonstrate how the modifier keys
affect<00:00:48.960> designing<00:00:49.440> i'll<00:00:49.980> start<00:00:50.250> by<00:00:50.280> building

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
affect designing i'll start by building

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.700 
affect designing i'll start by building
the<00:00:50.730> exterior<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.390> small<00:00:51.629> house<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:52.620> I'll

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the exterior of a small house what I'll

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.930 
the exterior of a small house what I'll
do<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.160> hold<00:00:53.340> down<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.579> Alt<00:00:53.699> key<00:00:53.820> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
do here is hold down the Alt key and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.630 
do here is hold down the Alt key and
that<00:00:54.090> makes<00:00:54.390> my<00:00:54.570> selection<00:00:55.020> hollow<00:00:55.489> that<00:00:56.489> way

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
that makes my selection hollow that way

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.770 
that makes my selection hollow that way
we<00:00:56.760> don't<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.030> build<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.570> these

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
we don't have to build it for these

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.689 
we don't have to build it for these
walls<00:00:58.050> individually<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.980> mean<00:00:59.280> bada-boom

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
walls individually I mean bada-boom

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.830 
walls individually I mean bada-boom
bada-bing<00:01:00.120> we're<00:01:00.300> saving<00:01:00.510> time<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:00.780> other

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
bada-bing we're saving time for other

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
bada-bing we're saving time for other
things<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.800> think<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.070> want<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> make<00:01:02.399> this

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
things and I think I want to make this

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.570 
things and I think I want to make this
10<00:01:02.789> x<00:01:02.910> 9<00:01:03.120> x<00:01:03.149> 5<00:01:03.920> rotate<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> camera<00:01:05.159> again<00:01:05.339> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
10 x 9 x 5 rotate the camera again to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.370 
10 x 9 x 5 rotate the camera again to
you<00:01:05.640> guys<00:01:05.760> take<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> better<00:01:06.210> look<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.049> that's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
you guys take a better look and that's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.780 
you guys take a better look and that's
not<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.710> bad<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.040> let's<00:01:08.220> move<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> next

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
not so bad so let's move on to the next

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.060 
not so bad so let's move on to the next
modifier<00:01:09.360> key<00:01:09.570> which<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.780> shift<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.439> you're<00:01:11.010> at

all<00:01:11.100> familiar<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:11.640> Photoshop<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.510> might

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
all familiar with Photoshop this might

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.270 
all familiar with Photoshop this might
come<00:01:12.869> naturally<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.040> shift

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
come naturally to you but what the shift

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
come naturally to you but what the shift
key<00:01:14.490> will<00:01:14.670> do<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.090> allow<00:01:15.119> me<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.540> create<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.869> line

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
key will do is allow me to create a line

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.950 
key will do is allow me to create a line
no<00:01:17.009> matter<00:01:17.250> how<00:01:17.490> far<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:17.939> cursor<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.750> shift

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
no matter how far my cursor is the shift

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.749 
no matter how far my cursor is the shift
key<00:01:19.140> will<00:01:19.320> essentially<00:01:19.740> limit<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> thickness

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
key will essentially limit the thickness

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.670 
key will essentially limit the thickness
of<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.420> designation<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> single<00:01:22.530> box

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.600 
online in the X and Y axis this will
obviously<00:01:25.350> help<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.950> laying<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.369> walls

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
obviously help with laying out walls

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.920 
obviously help with laying out walls
especially<00:01:26.880> while<00:01:27.240> your<00:01:27.360> camera<00:01:27.689> isn't

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.960 
especially while your camera isn't
really<00:01:28.259> far<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.369> at<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.520> point<00:01:29.820> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
really far out so at this point you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.310 
really far out so at this point you
might<00:01:30.090> be<00:01:30.240> asking<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.900> remove<00:01:31.170> or
