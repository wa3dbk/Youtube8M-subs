meters<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:42.120> haven't<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.660> haven't<00:00:42.780> gone<00:00:42.960> that

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
meters we haven't we haven't gone that

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.569 
meters we haven't we haven't gone that
far<00:00:43.170> we've<00:00:43.559> tossed<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.980> against<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> desk<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
far we've tossed it against the desk a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.279 
far we've tossed it against the desk a
couple<00:00:44.610> times<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.360> dropped<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.960> from<00:00:46.079> about<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
couple times and dropped it from about a

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.229 
couple times and dropped it from about a
meter<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.829> still<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.219> strong<00:00:47.460> it's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
meter and it's still going strong it's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.700 
meter and it's still going strong it's
also<00:00:48.360> water<00:00:48.690> resistance<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.410> while<00:00:49.559> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
also water resistance so while you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.869 
also water resistance so while you
probably<00:00:49.950> won't<00:00:50.100> want<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.340> take<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.760> your

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
probably won't want to take this in your

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.760 
probably won't want to take this in your
swimming<00:00:51.120> pool<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.170> spill<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> cup<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
swimming pool if you spill a cup of

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.470 
swimming pool if you spill a cup of
coffee<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:53.489> around<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.059> should<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.329> just

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
coffee on or around it it should be just

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.080 
coffee on or around it it should be just
fine<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:56.160> take<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> quick<00:00:56.520> look<00:00:56.730> at<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.879> device

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
fine so take a quick look at the device

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.810 
fine so take a quick look at the device
itself<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.350> nice<00:00:58.820> textured

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
itself you can see it's a nice textured

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060 
itself you can see it's a nice textured
material<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> top<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
material on the top here this is the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.590 
material on the top here this is the
hard<00:01:02.309> drive<00:01:02.489> access<00:01:02.910> light<00:01:03.120> that'll<00:01:03.390> let<00:01:03.510> you

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
hard drive access light that'll let you

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.050 
hard drive access light that'll let you
know<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> drives<00:01:04.530> doing<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.610> light<00:01:05.909> up

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
know what the drives doing and light up

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.969 
know what the drives doing and light up
when<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.360> powered<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.049> will<00:01:07.350> flash<00:01:07.680> when

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
when it's powered on and will flash when

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.670 
when it's powered on and will flash when
it's<00:01:08.130> reading<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:08.880> writing<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:10.140> take<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> quick

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
it's reading or writing so take a quick

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.310 
it's reading or writing so take a quick
look<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> side<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.840> got

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
look on the side you can see it's got

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.490 
look on the side you can see it's got
rails<00:01:13.580> these<00:01:14.580> are<00:01:14.790> rubberized<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.439> we

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
rails these are rubberized and if we

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.289 
rails these are rubberized and if we
take<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.770> look<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> back<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.850> see<00:01:18.000> this

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
take a look on the back we can see this

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.960 
take a look on the back we can see this
is<00:01:18.450> where<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> USB<00:01:19.229> cable<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.650> nested<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.700> pull

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
is where the USB cable is nested so pull

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.270 
is where the USB cable is nested so pull
that<00:01:21.060> out<00:01:21.560> now<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.860> think<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
that out now this I think this is a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
that out now this I think this is a
really<00:01:23.490> neat<00:01:23.640> feature<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> drive<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.900> USB

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
really neat feature of the drive the USB

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.719 
really neat feature of the drive the USB
cable<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.710> always<00:01:26.009> attached<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.520> don't<00:01:26.640> have

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
cable is always attached you don't have

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.310 
cable is always attached you don't have
to<00:01:26.790> worry<00:01:26.970> about<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.720> provides<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
to worry about it this provides the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.679 
to worry about it this provides the
power<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> data<00:01:29.070> communication<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.630> I'm

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
power and the data communication so I'm

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.600 
power and the data communication so I'm
just<00:01:30.900> throw<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.770> your<00:01:31.860> bag<00:01:32.040> obviously

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
just throw this in your bag obviously

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.920 
just throw this in your bag obviously
given<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.360> throw<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.630> against<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
given that we can throw it against the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.929 
given that we can throw it against the
desk<00:01:34.110> it'll<00:01:34.439> withstand<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.220> rigors<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.520> of
