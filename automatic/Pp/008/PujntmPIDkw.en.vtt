00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
found all of the necessary textures that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.080 
found all of the necessary textures that
I<00:01:22.500> could<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.040> including<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.759> things<00:01:23.970> like

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
I could not including like things like

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.210 
I could not including like things like
forests<00:01:24.420> trees<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.259> there<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:25.979> still

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220

forests trees and so on there are still
some<00:01:26.460> things<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:27.450> not<00:01:27.750> yet<00:01:27.780> been

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
some things that have not yet been

that I did not so as opposed to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.620 
that I did not so as opposed to
continuously<00:01:41.280> updating<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:41.880> own<00:01:42.090> texture

between his texture pack and what I was

between his texture pack and what I was
doing<00:02:06.299> before<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.350> new<00:02:07.619> one<00:02:07.649> actually<00:02:08.459> uses

smaller textures this is very technical

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.820

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.150 
detail but
my<00:02:14.240> original<00:02:15.240> usage<00:02:15.900> or<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.590> original

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
my original usage or the original

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.500 
my original usage or the original
textures<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.670> was<00:02:17.820> using<00:02:18.000> was<00:02:18.180> actually<00:02:18.480> a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
textures that I was using was actually a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
textures that I was using was actually a
128<00:02:19.260> by<00:02:19.440> 128<00:02:19.650> pixel<00:02:20.370> textures<00:02:20.820> while<00:02:21.720> he<00:02:22.260> is

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
128 by 128 pixel textures while he is

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.040 
128 by 128 pixel textures while he is
actually<00:02:22.740> using<00:02:22.920> 64<00:02:23.670> by<00:02:23.790> 64<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.750> textures

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
actually using 64 by 64 so the textures

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.590 
actually using 64 by 64 so the textures
are<00:02:25.200> smaller<00:02:25.530> which<00:02:26.490> means<00:02:26.520> two<00:02:27.060> things<00:02:27.330> one

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
are smaller which means two things one

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.240 
are smaller which means two things one
they're<00:02:27.960> going<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.230> be<00:02:28.350> slightly<00:02:29.040> slightly

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
they're going to be slightly slightly

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.330 
they're going to be slightly slightly
slightly<00:02:29.400> more<00:02:30.440> pixelated<00:02:31.440> than<00:02:31.710> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
slightly more pixelated than the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.220 
slightly more pixelated than the
textures<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.270> are<00:02:33.390> previously<00:02:33.870> seeing

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
textures that you are previously seeing

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.080 
textures that you are previously seeing
although<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:35.070> YouTube<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.670> don't<00:02:35.820> think<00:02:35.940> that's

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
although on YouTube I don't think that's

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.700 
although on YouTube I don't think that's
gonna<00:02:36.180> make<00:02:36.330> such<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> big<00:02:36.720> deal<00:02:36.900> or<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.530> big

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
gonna make such a big deal or a big

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.550 
gonna make such a big deal or a big
difference<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.970> other<00:02:39.150> difference<00:02:39.960> being<00:02:40.260> it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
difference the other difference being it

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.390 
difference the other difference being it
actually<00:02:41.070> uses<00:02:41.430> up<00:02:41.580> less<00:02:42.980> memory<00:02:43.980> less

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
actually uses up less memory less

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.370 
actually uses up less memory less
resources<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.270> my<00:02:45.510> system<00:02:45.870> which<00:02:46.080> means<00:02:46.260> that

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
resources on my system which means that

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.980 
resources on my system which means that
my<00:02:46.560> game<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.950> likely<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.730> run<00:02:47.940> ever<00:02:48.570> so

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
my game is likely to run ever so

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.480 
my game is likely to run ever so
slightly<00:02:49.320> better<00:02:49.590> than<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.520> was<00:02:50.850> before<00:02:51.350> so

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
slightly better than it was before so

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.110 
slightly better than it was before so
good<00:02:53.490> news<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.790> all<00:02:53.910> ends<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:55.350> I<00:02:55.800> have<00:02:56.310> decided

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
good news on all ends so I have decided

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.650 
good news on all ends so I have decided
to<00:02:57.209> stop<00:02:57.420> updating<00:02:58.320> my<00:02:58.410> own<00:02:58.590> texture<00:02:59.040> pack<00:02:59.250> and

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
to stop updating my own texture pack and

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.560 
to stop updating my own texture pack and
using<00:03:00.660> his<00:03:00.870> with<00:03:01.290> any<00:03:01.620> additional<00:03:02.570> textures

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
using his with any additional textures

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.670 
using his with any additional textures
that<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:04.200> find<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.830> are<00:03:05.040> not<00:03:05.270> previously

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680

over<00:03:09.690> there<00:03:10.070> cool<00:03:11.810> let's<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:12.959> what<00:03:13.500> my

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
over there cool let's see what my

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.800 
over there cool let's see what my
spyglass<00:03:15.300> says<00:03:16.490> yes<00:03:17.490> yellow<00:03:17.760> chocobo<00:03:18.150> how

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810

about<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.380> wonder<00:03:20.160> if<00:03:20.190> that's<00:03:20.370> Dave's

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
about that I wonder if that's Dave's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.930 
about that I wonder if that's Dave's
might<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.260> never<00:03:22.410> know<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.860> that's<00:03:23.760> all

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
might be you never know so that's all

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.540 
might be you never know so that's all
that<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.120> really<00:03:24.330> had<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.480> say<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:25.500> hope<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.190> you

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
that I really had to say I hope that you

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.790 
that I really had to say I hope that you
continue<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.180> enjoy<00:03:27.630> my<00:03:28.019> videos<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.410> there's

I'm probably going to have to do it
