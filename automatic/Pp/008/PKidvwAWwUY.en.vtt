 the data of public hospitals in 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.729
 our country analyzing an information

 among the objectives that the plan intends 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.180
 of disarmament , the decrease in 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.610
 use of firearms information and 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.920
 prisons the reduction of accidents and 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.319
 acts of violence caused by their 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.970
 manipulation and awareness of the 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.970
 risks involved in a firearm 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.349
 65% of homicides occur between 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.510
 well-known familiar neighbors or 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.950
 street discussions main task 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.260
 in this in this program and the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.510
 accompaniment to the state is trying to 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.010
 generate awareness and sensitize the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.220
 the population of the risk that the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.780
 family house weapons because the laws 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.430
 they can be but if there is not one after 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.610
 awareness to fulfill it in 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.349
 take it forward we really were 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.760
 stuck in this this is a one 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.010
 claim we make to society 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.349
 us that if we want to build a 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.239
 quieter society more peaceful with 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.650
 less violent violence and where the 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.230
 conflicts are resolved peacefully 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.360
 and not through weapons we have 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.920
 have to start sitting down and we like 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.319
 citizens to start analyzing if 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.599
 we want that society at this stage of 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.459
 program decentralization is a 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.950
 key point for the success of disarmament 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.690
 the weapons can be delivered in all 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.849
 the delegations that Renar has in 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.829
 the country to which the posts are added 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.599
 mobile phones that rotate all over the 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.360
 national territory 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.530
 in Argentina there are 1,300,000 weapons 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.170
