00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.650
 chat without noticing that there are many 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.619
 travel in my new video today 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.349
 I carry a quite strange 51 gastric 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.579
 my opinion because as you can see 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.890
 this video 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.010
 I have just stated this because why 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.440
 because many of you obviously don't 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.860
 they will know I am a very person to me 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.640
 nice I don't know the identity of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.129
 my favor done knots 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.190
 resetting the profile to be on black ops 2 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:53.460
 that out of three is obviously me on 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.500
 usual or type 85.000 kill e 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.000
 I was at the master and mass stereo radio and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.710
 so we are all the referees of the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.260
 classes I wanted and I on principle 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 precisely decided not to go back with that 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.800
 master because if then anyway me 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.860
 they would have reset me 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.090
 really broken the boxes here and 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.830
 anyway also because then there is no she 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.360
 I would not have wanted us to even really want 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.940
 to return masses but since 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.300
 since the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.210
 being obviously the first prestige le 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.180
 only 5 classes were available 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.790
 and honestly they came back very badly and I have 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.650
 decided to re- prestige areas is therefore 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.810
 this game player came out right away 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.250
 level 8 I think with a weapon a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.390
 how much more the earth is not there 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.159
 a jackal 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.319
 I had unlocked that prestige point 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.850
 laughter and is using smoke attack 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.240
 because I didn't have it available yet 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.770
 in the amp and against the web so really 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.299
 51 really very strange and gastric 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.579
 also because it was not supported 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.159
 virtually no one saw that 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.719
 dragons is playing with me had you just 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.899
 created another account of which it was 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.329
 level 1 and therefore could not at most 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.020
 This time's web there are classes 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:08.390
 pre finite to try to keep rate or 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.340
 667 here in short and therefore supported me 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.780
 only john who called 2 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.920
 then attack 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.099
 I hope you break me 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.410
 boxes because of many times for the 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.810
 kind then come to me to say 1 it is 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.310
 took the usual two it was 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.770
 all supported is a bullshit far 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.810
 gameplay genre with the bus at always 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.640
 Active girls and the problem 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.650
 your gameplay that you all do 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.770
 able to make them I have not yet seen one 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.810
 so i'm sorry but 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.040
 men continue to propose too 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.750
 because many people like it 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.930
 and also because they are very beautiful gameplay 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.519
 and more run then anyway not me 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.920
 they really thought about the mode 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.220
 because I proposed that extra day 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.960
 practically nothing 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.150
 what a private robben proposal I rather 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.050
 planets and areas of those Mondays you will see 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.800
 the last episode and then now vi 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.620
 I propose however play had accustomed us 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.940
 to propose you law of the genus and nothing to me 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.440
 I'm dwelling a little too much boys 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.540
 because I have a lot to tell you 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.330
 important or that like many of you 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.480
 will have already seen I came to do 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.390
 part of the clan of the gta clan e sono 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.890
 became an enlister of the su 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.080
 playstation 3 because for those who don't 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:29.580
 he knew nardo the hand only box them 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.580
 smart on xbox ever seen that 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.150
 be part of it 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.650
 ten points to expand also on 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.540
 playstation 3 since 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.430
 we are enough you will have wines here and there 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.379
 they saw that we were the first and 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.239
 since they consider us people 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.870
 reliable but we're not 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.360
 obviously and have decided to note 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.069
 make us become system owners 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.980
 playstation 3 so for those who want 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.379
 entering will have to write as a message 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.500
 personal to me or brothers way though 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.750
 undertaker who wants to participate but vi 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.849
 I warn you that the requirements are really 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.920
 very high for years have been listed 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.450
 in the video that prices rise in description 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.420
 his igt note to the clan 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.280
 their channel and why they are requirements 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.319
 many high complained 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.940
 obviously there were many slides 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.160
 those videos because people eat that a 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.470
 my opinion why can't enter here 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.520
 but because really high requirements 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.069
 because a lot of people can now do 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.930
 any person can do a simple one 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:32.389
 a hundred plus a simple core on this 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.259
 game is seen that then still has closed 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:38.150
 with capital you don't really go to 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.099
 understand if a person is strong if he deserves 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.199
 to enter and therefore have decided 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:45.680
 however, consider the requirements of the acts referred to 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.509
 I so my friend and we can a 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.240
 respect them that's why we play the 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:53.599
 kind so don't complain if i 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.360
 requirements are very high ie enough 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:58.789
 tosti here, however, if it is not enough 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.880
 that play with those requirements and you will find 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:04.550
 to have obvious enough and then after that 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.960
 you will have shown me who puts us 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.180
 google her 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.310
 of a certain level you will have to do maybe 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.860
 a Libyan pro match because you can't 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.070
 never know if maybe you were 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.780
 Europeans posted genre however boys 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.570
 the commander came a little bad but who 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.500
 He cares just as sciallo says 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.940
 under and boys I hope the gameplay will 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.470
 both liked I hope you would comment 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.490
 it was probably stored if so 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.040
 left a nice I like 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.810
 commented please reply to this 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.940
 he asks why when I do live 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.770
 many of you can't hear the 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.720
 volume from some devices 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.460
 I tell you for video purposes as much as in that 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.950
 don't forget it 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.360
 with these yards convinced this me 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.360
 like to join that me 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:50.490
 my god what a game
