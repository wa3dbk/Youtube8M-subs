the negative side and put us on a he

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.810 
the negative side and put us on a he
behave<00:02:09.880> pressure<00:02:10.210> we<00:02:10.390> accept<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.750> but<00:02:11.820> you

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
so yeah it's frustrating towards the end

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.140 
so yeah it's frustrating towards the end
we<00:03:16.870> just<00:03:17.020> couldn't<00:03:17.230> get<00:03:17.320> certain<00:03:17.860> things

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
right and we're trying force things

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.080 
right and we're trying force things
towards<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.620> end<00:03:20.770> a<00:03:20.860> little<00:03:20.920> bit<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:24.090> we've

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
towards the end a little bit but we've

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.520 
towards the end a little bit but we've
gotta<00:03:25.300> move<00:03:25.390> on<00:03:25.570> we've<00:03:26.050> got<00:03:26.200> to<00:03:26.230> take<00:03:26.380> the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530

things<00:03:26.680> that<00:03:26.830> went<00:03:27.100> well<00:03:27.340> or<00:03:27.700> better<00:03:28.410> work<00:03:29.410> on

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
things that went well or better work on

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.290 
things that went well or better work on
things<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.890> didn't<00:03:30.190> go<00:03:30.250> quite<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:30.880> well<00:03:31.030> and

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300

and I was at the championship in Joburg

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.520 
and I was at the championship in Joburg
the<00:04:38.440> watch<00:04:38.590> New<00:04:38.950> Zealand<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.460> South<00:04:39.550> Africa<00:04:39.910> I

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
the watch New Zealand and South Africa I

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.230 
the watch New Zealand and South Africa I
don't<00:04:41.530> think<00:04:41.650> there's<00:04:41.980> much<00:04:42.160> between<00:04:42.520> any<00:04:43.060> of

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
don't think there's much between any of

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.270 
don't think there's much between any of
the<00:04:43.420> any<00:04:43.720> of<00:04:43.870> those<00:04:43.960> sides<00:04:44.290> I<00:04:44.470> don't<00:04:44.680> I<00:04:44.890> think

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
the any of those sides I don't I think

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.490 
the any of those sides I don't I think
New<00:04:46.000> Zealand's<00:04:46.330> got<00:04:46.450> a<00:04:46.480> potent<00:04:47.140> run<00:04:47.290> at<00:04:47.410> the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
New Zealand's got a potent run at the

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.920 
New Zealand's got a potent run at the
moment<00:04:47.920> they<00:04:48.040> got<00:04:48.250> a<00:04:48.280> confident<00:04:48.880> team<00:04:49.150> they're

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
moment they got a confident team they're

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.360 
moment they got a confident team they're
well-coached<00:04:50.170> well<00:04:51.100> drilled<00:04:51.660> but<00:04:53.250> sides<00:04:54.250> are

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
well-coached well drilled but sides are

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.530 
well-coached well drilled but sides are
kept<00:04:54.490> moving<00:04:54.850> closer<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.300> I<00:04:56.520> think<00:04:57.520> all<00:04:58.300> those

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
kept moving closer to I think all those

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.060 
kept moving closer to I think all those
sides<00:04:58.900> on<00:04:59.050> any<00:04:59.230> given<00:04:59.350> day<00:04:59.530> can<00:04:59.800> build<00:04:59.980> each

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
sides on any given day can build each

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:06.920 
sides on any given day can build each
other<00:05:00.280> that's<00:05:00.610> what<00:05:00.730> we<00:05:00.820> want<00:05:01.000> my<00:05:01.150> sport<00:05:01.450> I

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.020 

thought<00:05:07.930> look<00:05:08.740> you<00:05:09.070> know<00:05:09.190> you<00:05:09.250> have<00:05:09.760> a<00:05:09.790> look

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
thought look you know you have a look

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.980 
thought look you know you have a look
and<00:05:10.240> we<00:05:10.450> had<00:05:10.660> I<00:05:11.020> think<00:05:12.270> 78<00:05:13.270> tackles<00:05:13.540> in<00:05:13.900> the

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
and we had I think 78 tackles in the

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.980 
and we had I think 78 tackles in the
first<00:05:14.200> half<00:05:15.090> that's<00:05:16.090> what<00:05:16.270> we<00:05:16.360> had<00:05:16.510> i<00:05:16.540> think<00:05:16.660> to

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
first half that's what we had i think to

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.460 
first half that's what we had i think to
this<00:05:17.140> 20<00:05:17.680> or<00:05:17.800> something<00:05:18.130> it<00:05:18.280> was<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:19.720> when<00:05:20.440> you

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
this 20 or something it was and when you

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.840 
this 20 or something it was and when you
look<00:05:20.650> at<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.830> tribes<00:05:21.070> that<00:05:21.280> were<00:05:21.340> considered

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
look at the tribes that were considered

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.880 
look at the tribes that were considered
one<00:05:22.000> off<00:05:22.120> a<00:05:22.150> mall<00:05:22.480> and<00:05:22.810> like<00:05:22.990> i<00:05:23.080> said<00:05:23.140> one<00:05:23.770> off

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
one off a mall and like i said one off

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.050 
one off a mall and like i said one off
our<00:05:24.100> play<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.640> i<00:05:25.590> thought<00:05:26.590> that<00:05:26.890> the<00:05:27.610> defense

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
our play and i thought that the defense

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.990 
our play and i thought that the defense
held<00:05:28.390> i<00:05:28.630> think<00:05:28.870> it<00:05:28.990> was<00:05:29.490> resolute<00:05:30.490> if<00:05:30.670> you<00:05:30.790> like

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
held i think it was resolute if you like

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.730 
held i think it was resolute if you like
and<00:05:31.270> it's<00:05:31.840> a<00:05:32.020> funny<00:05:32.230> thing<00:05:32.320> to<00:05:32.470> say<00:05:32.560> when

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
and it's a funny thing to say when

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.190 
and it's a funny thing to say when
you're<00:05:33.040> let<00:05:33.250> him<00:05:33.370> for<00:05:33.580> tries<00:05:33.850> but<00:05:34.150> that<00:05:34.990> game

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
you're let him for tries but that game

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.290 
you're let him for tries but that game
could<00:05:35.470> have<00:05:35.560> gone<00:05:35.740> with<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.950> amount<00:05:36.100> of

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
could have gone with the amount of

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.510 
could have gone with the amount of
possession<00:05:37.300> they<00:05:37.600> had<00:05:37.810> i<00:05:37.840> could<00:05:38.050> have<00:05:38.140> gone

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
possession they had i could have gone

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.040 
possession they had i could have gone
now<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:39.550> different<00:05:39.820> path<00:05:40.210> of<00:05:40.390> further<00:05:40.540> bath<00:05:40.870> if

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
now a different path of further bath if

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.360 
now a different path of further bath if
you<00:05:41.140> like<00:05:41.320> so<00:05:41.740> i<00:05:41.770> thought<00:05:41.980> that<00:05:42.040> was<00:05:42.190> great

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
you like so i thought that was great

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.610 
you like so i thought that was great
resolving<00:05:42.940> defense<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:43.570> it<00:05:44.050> just<00:05:44.290> goes<00:05:44.440> to

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
resolving defense and it just goes to

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.470 
resolving defense and it just goes to
show<00:05:44.680> when<00:05:45.010> we<00:05:45.100> get<00:05:45.280> our<00:05:45.430> stuff<00:05:45.700> right<00:05:46.030> and<00:05:46.330> we

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
show when we get our stuff right and we

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.970 
show when we get our stuff right and we
starve<00:05:46.810> them<00:05:46.990> a<00:05:47.020> bit<00:05:47.380> of<00:05:47.500> possession<00:05:47.890> in<00:05:47.950> the

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
starve them a bit of possession in the

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.460 
starve them a bit of possession in the
second<00:05:48.340> half<00:05:48.550> yeah<00:05:49.480> they<00:05:49.660> scored<00:05:49.960> early<00:05:50.290> but

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
second half yeah they scored early but

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.230 
second half yeah they scored early but
they<00:05:50.590> you<00:05:51.070> know<00:05:51.100> they<00:05:51.220> didn't<00:05:51.670> threaten<00:05:51.850> after

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
they you know they didn't threaten after

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.380 
they you know they didn't threaten after
that<00:05:52.360> because<00:05:52.480> we<00:05:52.660> got<00:05:52.810> our<00:05:52.930> part<00:05:53.230> right<00:05:53.580> so<00:05:54.580> it

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
that because we got our part right so it

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.590 
that because we got our part right so it
just<00:05:55.690> highlights<00:05:56.230> the<00:05:56.560> fact<00:05:56.590> that<00:05:57.480> most<00:05:58.480> of

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
just highlights the fact that most of

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.500 
just highlights the fact that most of
our<00:05:58.750> issues<00:05:59.110> are<00:05:59.580> completely<00:06:00.580> that<00:06:00.760> ours<00:06:01.120> and

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
our issues are completely that ours and

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.090 
our issues are completely that ours and
ours<00:06:02.050> alone<00:06:02.170> and<00:06:02.530> they're<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:02.710> ones<00:06:02.740> with

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
ours alone and they're the ones with

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.490 
ours alone and they're the ones with
effects
