don't worry about that extract open up

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.760 
don't worry about that extract open up
the<00:04:43.670> gauges<00:04:44.120> extract<00:04:44.570> with<00:04:44.750> gauges<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.260> it

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
the gauges extract with gauges to it

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.580 
the gauges extract with gauges to it
gauges<00:04:46.310> folder<00:04:46.660> open<00:04:47.660> up<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.840> aircraft<00:04:48.350> and

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
gauges folder open up the aircraft and

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.340 
gauges folder open up the aircraft and
extract<00:04:49.100> this<00:04:49.340> to<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.090> aircraft<00:04:50.450> folder<00:04:53.350> okay

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
extract this to the aircraft folder okay

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.710 
extract this to the aircraft folder okay
so<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:54.860> will<00:04:54.980> be<00:04:55.010> installed<00:04:55.700> but<00:04:56.390> you<00:04:56.480> won't<00:04:56.570> be

the<00:06:11.180> default<00:06:11.690> panel<00:06:12.080> for<00:06:12.260> these<00:06:12.410> though

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
the default panel for these though

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.610 
the default panel for these though
because<00:06:13.810> that's<00:06:14.810> one<00:06:15.050> thing<00:06:15.230> that<00:06:15.440> doesn't

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
because that's one thing that doesn't

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.640
