let's<00:01:09.270> start<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.689> finial<00:01:10.080> right<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:10.799> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
let's start of the finial right there it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.830 
let's start of the finial right there it
looks<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.520> magnet<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.299> think<00:01:12.720> when

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
looks like a little magnet I think when

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.539 
looks like a little magnet I think when
I<00:01:12.869> was<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> kid<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.439> had<00:01:13.650> Magnus<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.220> book<00:01:14.369> like

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
I was a kid I had Magnus a book like

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.420 
I was a kid I had Magnus a book like
that<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.880> play<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.770> right

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that to play with and then we have right

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.510 
that to play with and then we have right
there<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.240> clip<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.290> clip<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:20.340> has

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
there the clip and the clip I think has

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.570 
there the clip and the clip I think has
a<00:01:20.549> very<00:01:20.820> interesting<00:01:21.439> shape<00:01:22.439> with<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> little

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
a very interesting shape with a little

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.850 
a very interesting shape with a little
open<00:01:24.210> bit<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.659> then<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.140> ends<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.650> sort<00:01:25.830> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
open bit and then it ends in a sort of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.730 
open bit and then it ends in a sort of
ski<00:01:26.220> slope<00:01:26.580> which<00:01:27.119> gives<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.720> nice<00:01:28.080> bit<00:01:28.590> of

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
ski slope which gives it a nice bit of

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.929 
ski slope which gives it a nice bit of
spring<00:01:30.320> what<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.350> also<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.729> this

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
spring what I also really like is this

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.510 
spring what I also really like is this
texture<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.640> gnarled<00:01:35.640> texture<00:01:36.299> at<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.740> top

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
texture this gnarled texture at the top

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.080 
texture this gnarled texture at the top
of<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> cap<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.390> then<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.430> see<00:01:41.729> there

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
of the cap and then as you can see there

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.789 
of the cap and then as you can see there
probably<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.500> says<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.790> think<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.049> says<00:01:46.229> tornado

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
probably it says I think it says tornado

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.149 
probably it says I think it says tornado
let<00:01:47.159> me<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.610> little<00:01:48.090> hard<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> read<00:01:48.979> yes<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
retro 1951 okay now I think this should

give<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.579> pretty<00:02:02.790> good<00:02:03.000> overview<00:02:03.360> off<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
give you pretty good overview off the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.709 
give you pretty good overview off the
very<00:02:04.770> nice<00:02:05.009> finish<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.790> really<00:02:06.180> fell<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.540> love

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
very nice finish I really fell in love

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.270 
very nice finish I really fell in love
with<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.079> because<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.710> really<00:02:08.009> does<00:02:08.250> look

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
with that because it really does look

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.170 
with that because it really does look
like<00:02:08.489> empty<00:02:09.030> brass

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
like empty brass

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.610 
like empty brass
okay<00:02:11.180> then<00:02:11.390> we<00:02:11.450> have<00:02:11.569> little<00:02:11.810> sent<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.290> band

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
okay then we have little sent a band

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.330 
right there and then we go down the
barrel<00:02:17.420> tape<00:02:17.660> us<00:02:17.900> nicely<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.590> then<00:02:19.069> there's

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
barrel tape us nicely and then there's

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.820 
barrel tape us nicely and then there's
an<00:02:19.610> end<00:02:20.440> cap<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:23.090> looks<00:02:23.300> like<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.690> okay<00:02:24.200> now

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
an end cap that looks like that okay now

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.350 
an end cap that looks like that okay now
what<00:02:25.099> I<00:02:25.130> also<00:02:25.190> like<00:02:25.670> about<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:26.060> pendant

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
what I also like about this pendant

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.590 
what I also like about this pendant
doesn't<00:02:26.810> doesn't<00:02:26.959> have<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.530> snap<00:02:28.400> cap<00:02:28.940> it

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
doesn't doesn't have a snap cap it

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.520 
doesn't doesn't have a snap cap it
actually<00:02:30.140> unscrews<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.510> cap<00:02:32.510> posts<00:02:33.200> quite

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
actually unscrews the cap posts quite

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.770 
actually unscrews the cap posts quite
securely<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.370> then<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.300> this<00:02:35.540> nice

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
securely and then you have this nice

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.290 
securely and then you have this nice
section<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> section<00:02:36.800> is<00:02:37.010> plastic<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:38.120> can

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
section the section is plastic you can

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.900 
section the section is plastic you can
see<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.630> threads<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.890> has<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.069> pretty<00:02:40.489> big

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
see the threads and it has a pretty big

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.990 
see the threads and it has a pretty big
nib<00:02:41.420> which<00:02:41.840> looks<00:02:42.170> fairly<00:02:42.500> nice<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:43.100> think<00:02:43.160> it

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
nib which looks fairly nice I think it

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.080 
nib which looks fairly nice I think it
is<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.420> Schmidt<00:02:45.080> nib<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.400> says<00:02:46.640> Schmidt

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
is a Schmidt nib that it says Schmidt

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.270 
is a Schmidt nib that it says Schmidt
Iranian<00:02:47.569> point<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.290> has<00:02:48.410> an<00:02:48.530> M<00:02:48.769> on<00:02:49.010> there<00:02:49.250> I

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
Iranian point and it has an M on there I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.860 
Iranian point and it has an M on there I
don't<00:02:49.370> know<00:02:49.610> why<00:02:49.790> because<00:02:50.060> neither<00:02:50.450> Schmidt

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
don't know why because neither Schmidt

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.050 
don't know why because neither Schmidt
nor<00:02:51.080> retro<00:02:51.470> have<00:02:51.799> an<00:02:52.100> M<00:02:52.489> in<00:02:52.670> there<00:02:52.850> but

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
nor retro have an M in there but

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.470 
nor retro have an M in there but
whatever<00:02:53.810> all<00:02:54.760> those<00:02:55.760> tricky<00:02:56.120> speaking

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
whatever all those tricky speaking

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.900 
whatever all those tricky speaking
Schmidt<00:02:56.900> has<00:02:57.110> an<00:02:57.290> M<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:58.010> but<00:02:58.519> it's<00:02:58.640> not<00:02:58.790> the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
Schmidt has an M in it but it's not the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.759 
Schmidt has an M in it but it's not the
first<00:02:59.150> letter<00:02:59.330> so<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.350> doesn't<00:03:00.530> make<00:03:00.620> any

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
first letter so it doesn't make any

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.190 
first letter so it doesn't make any
sense<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.480> my<00:03:02.480> experience<00:03:02.870> with<00:03:02.989> Schmidt

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
sense and my experience with Schmidt

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.130 
sense and my experience with Schmidt
nibs<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:03.830> that<00:03:04.130> they<00:03:04.310> are<00:03:04.580> relatively<00:03:05.390> hard

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
nibs is that they are relatively hard

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.080 
nibs is that they are relatively hard
and<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:06.890> can<00:03:07.069> squeeze<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.459> little<00:03:07.610> bit<00:03:07.850> of<00:03:07.940> lime

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
and you can squeeze a little bit of lime

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.410 
and you can squeeze a little bit of lime
variation<00:03:08.690> out<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:09.049> this<00:03:09.790> nib<00:03:10.790> but<00:03:11.030> not<00:03:11.390> a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
variation out of this nib but not a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.800 
variation out of this nib but not a
whole<00:03:11.840> lot<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:12.799> I<00:03:13.299> would<00:03:14.299> say<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.510> get<00:03:14.750> a

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
whole lot so I would say you get a

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.680 
whole lot so I would say you get a
fairly<00:03:15.140> hard<00:03:15.590> nib<00:03:15.980> don't<00:03:16.940> expect<00:03:17.329> a<00:03:17.480> whole<00:03:17.630> lot

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
fairly hard nib don't expect a whole lot

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.080 
fairly hard nib don't expect a whole lot
of<00:03:17.959> lime<00:03:18.170> variation<00:03:18.920> okay<00:03:19.609> as<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.940> this

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
of lime variation okay as to this

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.880 
of lime variation okay as to this
section<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:21.079> is<00:03:21.230> hard<00:03:21.560> black<00:03:22.430> plastic<00:03:22.940> and

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
section it is hard black plastic and

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.400 
section it is hard black plastic and
that<00:03:24.890> can<00:03:25.370> get<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:26.090> little<00:03:26.450> slippery<00:03:26.870> if<00:03:27.260> you

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
that can get a little slippery if you

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.530 
that can get a little slippery if you
write<00:03:27.680> with<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:27.980> for<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.190> very<00:03:28.370> long<00:03:28.519> time<00:03:28.730> but

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
write with it for a very long time but

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.210 
write with it for a very long time but
in<00:03:29.630> principle<00:03:30.109> I<00:03:30.200> didn't<00:03:30.410> really<00:03:30.590> have<00:03:30.769> a<00:03:30.829> lot

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
in principle I didn't really have a lot

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.370 
in principle I didn't really have a lot
of<00:03:31.340> issues<00:03:31.489> with<00:03:31.820> it<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.090> be<00:03:32.120> honest<00:03:32.510> the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
of issues with it to be honest the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.160 
of issues with it to be honest the
threads<00:03:33.829> I<00:03:34.220> did<00:03:34.970> not<00:03:35.209> find<00:03:35.600> them<00:03:35.780> particularly

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
threads I did not find them particularly

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.870 
threads I did not find them particularly
sharp<00:03:36.709> even<00:03:37.070> though<00:03:37.160> there<00:03:37.310> are<00:03:37.340> metal

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880

sharp even though there are metal
threads<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.630> will<00:03:38.900> feel<00:03:39.230> them<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.620> didn't

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
threads and you will feel them I didn't

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.090 
threads and you will feel them I didn't
feel<00:03:40.400> like<00:03:40.549> they<00:03:40.700> were<00:03:40.730> cutting<00:03:41.090> into<00:03:41.390> my<00:03:41.540> skin

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
feel like they were cutting into my skin

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.300 
feel like they were cutting into my skin
okay

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
okay

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.729 
okay
as<00:03:43.519> I<00:03:43.700> said<00:03:44.000> post<00:03:44.570> securely<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:45.350> that<00:03:45.410> makes

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
as I said post securely and that makes

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.039 
as I said post securely and that makes
for<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:45.980> pretty<00:03:46.130> big<00:03:46.489> pen<00:03:46.820> but<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:47.780> can<00:03:47.900> also

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
for a pretty big pen but you can also

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.039 
for a pretty big pen but you can also
use<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.500> unposted<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.760> then<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.390> think<00:03:50.720> it's<00:03:50.840> a

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
use it unposted and then I think it's a

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.490 
use it unposted and then I think it's a
very<00:03:51.410> nice<00:03:51.709> decent<00:03:52.220> size<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:53.569> pen<00:03:53.780> comes<00:03:54.079> with

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
very nice decent size the pen comes with

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.400 
very nice decent size the pen comes with
a<00:03:54.769> converter<00:03:55.430> very<00:03:56.180> standard<00:03:56.810> type<00:03:56.989> converter

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
a converter very standard type converter

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.690 
a converter very standard type converter
there<00:03:57.650> isn't<00:03:57.829> a<00:03:57.890> whole<00:03:58.069> lot<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.459> say<00:03:58.489> about

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
there isn't a whole lot to say about

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.750 
there isn't a whole lot to say about
that<00:03:59.590> but<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.769> works<00:04:00.980> very<00:04:01.130> well<00:04:01.250> I<00:04:01.430> didn't

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
that but it works very well I didn't

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.240 
that but it works very well I didn't
have<00:04:01.850> any<00:04:02.120> issues<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.319> draws<00:04:03.680> up<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:03.980> decent

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
have any issues and it draws up a decent

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.009 
have any issues and it draws up a decent
amount<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.519> ink<00:04:04.730> which<00:04:04.970> is<00:04:05.000> also<00:04:05.269> very<00:04:05.390> nice

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
amount of ink which is also very nice

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.949 
amount of ink which is also very nice
okay<00:04:06.950> mal<00:04:07.250> screws<00:04:07.549> back<00:04:07.730> in<00:04:07.940> place<00:04:07.970> I<00:04:08.450> think<00:04:08.900> we

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
okay mal screws back in place I think we

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.270 
okay mal screws back in place I think we
should<00:04:09.139> talk<00:04:09.230> about<00:04:09.290> what<00:04:09.620> I<00:04:09.650> like<00:04:09.920> about<00:04:10.069> the

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
should talk about what I like about the

smooth writing experience okay things I
don't<00:04:57.430> like<00:04:57.640> about<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:58.150> for<00:04:58.360> me<00:04:58.540> when<00:04:58.810> I<00:04:58.870> posted

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380

it<00:04:59.560> gets<00:04:59.800> a<00:04:59.890> little<00:05:00.010> too<00:05:00.280> big<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:00.670> a<00:05:00.700> big<00:05:00.880> bit

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
it gets a little too big and a big bit

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.140 
it gets a little too big and a big bit
top-heavy<00:05:02.460> especially<00:05:03.460> since<00:05:03.700> the<00:05:03.820> cap<00:05:04.000> is

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
top-heavy especially since the cap is

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.210 
top-heavy especially since the cap is
all<00:05:04.270> metal<00:05:04.560> that's<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.680> bit<00:05:05.800> of<00:05:05.890> an<00:05:05.980> issue

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
all metal that's a bit of an issue

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.490 
all metal that's a bit of an issue
and<00:05:06.400> again<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.330> hardness<00:05:07.660> of<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.900> nib<00:05:08.110> some

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
and again the hardness of the nib some

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.140 
and again the hardness of the nib some
people<00:05:08.830> really<00:05:09.010> like<00:05:09.220> that<00:05:09.490> some<00:05:09.760> people<00:05:09.790> like

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
people really like that some people like

some<00:05:10.450> more<00:05:10.690> give<00:05:11.530> when<00:05:11.830> they<00:05:11.980> write<00:05:12.190> I<00:05:12.490> tend<00:05:13.150> to

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
some more give when they write I tend to

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.940 
some more give when they write I tend to
form<00:05:13.480> that<00:05:13.660> category<00:05:14.170> so<00:05:14.380> for<00:05:14.530> me<00:05:14.620> I<00:05:14.650> noticed

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
form that category so for me I noticed

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.060 
form that category so for me I noticed
the<00:05:15.220> Hartness<00:05:15.640> but<00:05:15.880> didn't<00:05:16.420> read<00:05:16.540> the<00:05:16.660> strike

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
the Hartness but didn't read the strike

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.130 
the Hartness but didn't read the strike
alright<00:05:18.070> so<00:05:18.400> there<00:05:18.550> we<00:05:18.580> have<00:05:18.790> it<00:05:18.940> retro<00:05:19.510> 51

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
alright so there we have it retro 51

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.990 
alright so there we have it retro 51

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
ink in there but I have 34 grams so it's

ink in there but I have 34 grams so it's
not<00:06:02.320> a<00:06:02.380> superlight<00:06:02.980> pen<00:06:03.310> but<00:06:03.970> I've<00:06:04.120> used

not a superlight pen but I've used
considerably<00:06:04.840> heavier<00:06:05.080> pens<00:06:05.590> -<00:06:05.860> especially

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:11.920 
let's do a writing sample I hope this

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.560 
let's do a writing sample I hope this
