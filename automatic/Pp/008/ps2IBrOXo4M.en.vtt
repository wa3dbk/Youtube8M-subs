00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Hello Indesit, I want to load you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.850
 to the world of sushi 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.429
 the world is about sushi preparation and so to speak 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.769
 The restaurant business is a game called 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.170
 Sushi Shop 2 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.240
 I could say this is a game. 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.420
 quite attractive in general 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.160
 quite attractive actually 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.810
 she's a pretty simple toy but she 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.400
 distracts like a year I don’t know this world 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.880
 explain but just helps to relax 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.099
 curtains 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.529
 that is, a little weird stuff that's what 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.450
 this is now clear 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.300
 throw and all guessing is not as useless 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.000
 function but but it is so it doesn't care 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.710
 we actually pour coffee making sushi 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.450
 prescription in principle, nothing complicated but 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.140
 actually some one has a little 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.920
 relaxes 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.629
 but one okay so his tricks by the way I 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.020
 no idea what we give that is like 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.329
 no sort of like a money bonus 1 well 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.820
 it doesn't seem like it gives the game a go away 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.940
 you still give it no no no no no 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.609
 so sushi sushi make sushi sushi done 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.630
 quite easy to have a recipe they 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.860
 gradually added coffee coffee on 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.439
 don't really understand at one point she 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.119
 just ends and then no longer 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.770
 wants to go here I don't quite understand 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.400
 how she works gave us a lot again 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.340
 need a flight 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.680
 once again the legs turned over so times 2 3 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.150
 so here it came out this roll yes 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.650
 and I did not forget 23 was done one more exactly i 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.610
 I'll show you how it is done later. 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.860
 present level 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.329
 This toy has already passed somewhere. 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.470
 true in the first version is now out 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.820
 second and they are in principle very similar and in 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.159
 general really relax and 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.460
 distract you just do not think about any of 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.860
 than 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.729
 seekers useless stuff this here 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.200
 what is it for me for example is not clear but 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.050
 it is also yes I do not understand maybe you 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.090
 know what it is for 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.340
 here is something somehow and yet so to me 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.560
 very definitely not all the same no 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.830
 absolutely everything that is what men are 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.750
 woman just with different hairstyles but 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.050
 dacha give you so I have a boat at all 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.100
 little left so okay I have quite 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:16.030
 given to the prince that that damn well but damn 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.459

 clients are such clients though at some 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.250
 version I remember you could still furnish 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.230
 the restaurant that brought you more money 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.150
 I don't know how I like that 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.320
 distracting and all these new games went there 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.600
 Well, no, very interesting, but the fact that he does not 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.580
 I know how not completely distracting what it is 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.360
 I, for example, last played the game 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.750
 it was completely I do not even remember when 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.360
 probably two months ago and this was 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.640
 men of war which was new and who is not 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.630
 probably knows and does not know how it is bromine 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.910
 said that this is one of mine 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.650
 favorite games in general of all time 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.390
 peoples 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:16.810
 well but it's interesting interesting and by the way I 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.180

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.670

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.610
 time and a timer of some but she would not 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.890
 affects this and salt strongly somehow 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.680
 it doesn’t affect me at all 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.490

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.380

 twist this thing so 12 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.390
 so still give this thing and now you need 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.930
 still red fish so you can turn 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.810

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.200
 rice need rice need rice 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.930

 without even knowing your age you will order 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.610
 or not I think it is not worth it because before 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.370
 customers will not be this last customer 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.410
 but rather the action is pleased with this and more legs 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:35.390
 interesting person he throws is that 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.970
 why is he still here at all three 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.010

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:35.169
