are watching in the background of the
moment<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:37.170> gonna<00:01:37.320> talk<00:01:37.500> about<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> couple<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
moment just gonna talk about a couple of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.429 
moment just gonna talk about a couple of
things<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.700> his<00:01:39.060> strength<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.630> example<00:01:40.170> is

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
things like his strength for example is

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.679 
things like his strength for example is
a<00:01:40.650> really<00:01:41.220> really<00:01:41.250> powerful<00:01:41.549> player<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.540> you

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
a really really powerful player if you

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.359 
a really really powerful player if you
are<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:43.380> he's<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> fastest<00:01:44.250> of

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
are because he's not the fastest of

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.149 
are because he's not the fastest of
plays<00:01:44.610> he<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.880> quite<00:01:45.299> slow<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.890> doesn't

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
plays he is quite slow and that doesn't

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.100 
plays he is quite slow and that doesn't
really<00:01:47.280> matter<00:01:47.579> because<00:01:47.880> when<00:01:48.210> he's<00:01:48.390> running

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
really matter because when he's running

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.170 
really matter because when he's running
say<00:01:49.470> next<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.860> PK<00:01:50.340> he<00:01:50.549> does<00:01:50.820> manage<00:01:51.030> to

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
say next to a PK he does manage to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.230 
say next to a PK he does manage to
out-power<00:01:52.049> PK<00:01:52.710> because<00:01:53.490> his<00:01:53.610> strength<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.030> so

really<00:03:21.100> good<00:03:21.370> player<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.760> have<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:21.970> say<00:03:22.420> is

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
really good player to have a say is

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.140

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
around the 800 k mark and he is pricey

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.270 
around the 800 k mark and he is pricey
probably<00:03:35.170> slowly<00:03:35.500> going<00:03:35.680> down<00:03:35.799> now<00:03:36.250> I

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
probably slowly going down now I
