00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.560
 he gets in another video on the danger points that see today 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.560
 Senseo swears the switch to ourselves 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:14.859
 You do not have to say half the sales of Temple Isik Endgame of the week 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.300
 and therefore groups and a mess here the ipad version 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.599
 and get into such a game and you can already see the start screen 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.089
 Before that you should make a nice count on users to their players 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.160
 as you can see there will be 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.420
 Players follow the ladies 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.800
 can play after the progress 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.260
 and here's just the single player and think since then 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.770
 Field to drive 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.710
 and yes 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.820
 Of course you should first play the Vikings then the Aztecs and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.949
 then he does not recover because of that and he continues to be the next man in the world 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.990
 his 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.590
 and yes there always is 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.550
 Zumthor little dialogues 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.550
 by applying read about Springer continues manners 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.740
 and at the beginning there is also such a small tutorial 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.740
 what will be shown is shown 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.910
 and as you can see 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.910
 we would have here with the boys now 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.220
 short and in deficient regions Siegmund a small bar by all means 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.960
 continues 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.869
 you can also dream of evil once you see that he is with Christoph 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.840
 moved and so must than here 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.250
 right 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.560
 The people are destroying and should be educating and Honda is building us 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.870
 a little gold 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.870
 deliver 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.410
 and he walks from Rome 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.670
 because he is already attacked 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.279
 and then there's a symbol where we can expand units 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.320
 But that's about how you learn about stress all generations 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.620
 around 20 percent are always waiting for art 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.900
 with a double click 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.159
 that will also be talked 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.159
 Unister Media GmbH buys league build 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.489
 the ones around the one long tires 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.679
 the blue ones are us 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.219
 and the Six here 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.219
 because these gold mines may 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:28.650
 and there comes one more and then you can see it here too 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.439
 the phrase speaks 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.999
 our goal is always so easy 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:38.169
 You should already have a finished one to gradually expand around this symbol 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.169
 we can also learn a purely symbolic 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:46.999
 if you have activated this right here, our units can 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.999
 that's supposed to heal 37 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:54.369
 that way if Ole Wegner 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.919
 For example, if he likes to attack we can point to the objection and 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.659
 Show line for example 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.329
 only a few seconds 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.329
 that Elser became a pilot from Milan 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.579
 have to try to destroy every opponent 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.469
 the top pulled if you also happen that 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.469
 except for the one with the blue Corsa that means we can only stop 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.620
 It means he only use when we have enough to call 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:27.919
 and JAL here you gradually get more units and percent 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.619
 Functions too 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:33.619
 of course later in the game 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.229
 only in between always super 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:38.869
 insoles 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:41.709
 and it has become night 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.709
 look what's going on here he is right 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.610
 now it looks like percent is already something in the majority 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.369
 that such a hall 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.539
 so that our unit does not die immediately percent 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.079
 At that time I am in the top right corner 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.629
 Of course you can gradually build units so that they 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.129
 also goes on 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.790
 the game costs the way 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.230
 now it is EUR 39 and was lowered yesterday in the price 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.009
 the special houses 99 cents and 2 39 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.969
 the summer is a game which as a ipad app of the week until the trend 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.479
 then again in the price is lowered but not rare 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.740
 Thinking of, for example, considering what's just right 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.740
 poorly long time because he is 50 years old 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.990
 that is not so Metz 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.400
 at the same time we have arrived 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.400
 we still want him 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.689
 the Oderbruch 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.090
 by Dana Mann same 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.990
 Pillar hits every beginner and there you can see on the ad 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.800
 Amount of light undermines 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.800
 Bresser Millisievert 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:02.129
 then you see only with his overview the thrown for Goldman temporary workers 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:03.979
 Frequent flyer 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.569
 and so on this number has been applied 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.449
 what you see here in the synopsis also shown the minutes of the game men 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.460
 and with one click you get back to the level screen 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.169
 back and can see me here, for example 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.909
 if you choose three we'll see, though, he'll be there again 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.740
 in multiplayer mode that is only a local on 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.430
 Multiplayer mode that means two people on an iPad 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.849
 and here you can, for example 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.039
 Verena Ottmann also wants the Vikings to play the Aztecs and Chinese now 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.959
 you can adjust your color individually and up here you can too 

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:42.139
 then say yes now the case is going m deserved 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.139
 For one thing, you can start 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.710
 For this goal still hot player, for example, must have a banter and the 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.189
 exams 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:54.520
 around here you can also see that the campaign mode is playing high around the 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:56.699
 Unlock challenge 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.029
 and the banter there you can also freely choose what you want to be who 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:03.370
 against whom plays and here on the easy to read along 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.639
 from the setting then too 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.059
 to start a new game 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:11.859
 whoever has an option itself there is not a lot of music volume and and 

00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:15.299
 Game Speed â€‹â€‹It's not so interesting during the year the game alone 

00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:16.529
 applications 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:19.500
 as Game Center us to this service of shilling 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.400
 only the shore is called son 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.699
 as a continent 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.729
 however, percent would recommend such the Game Center 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:32.059
 yes as I said the game costs 2 39 is quite nice on the iPad 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.909
 offers long fun the merger 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:39.169
 quite a lot of teachers actually use the different game modes of their two 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.830
 our 2 39 definitely suitable
