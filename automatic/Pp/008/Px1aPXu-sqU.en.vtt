moment are quote based on the game being
a<00:00:33.390> next-gen<00:00:33.840> experience<00:00:34.380> running<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.710> 60fps

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
a next-gen experience running at 60fps

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.700 
a next-gen experience running at 60fps
and<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.780> these<00:00:36.989> are<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> system

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and that these are the system

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
and that these are the system
requirements<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.340> deliver<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> pc<00:00:39.059> game<00:00:39.300> as

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
requirements to deliver the pc game as

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.459 
requirements to deliver the pc game as
it<00:00:39.750> was<00:00:39.780> intended<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.620> experienced<00:00:41.360> now<00:00:42.469> so

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it was intended to be experienced now so

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.110 
it was intended to be experienced now so
basically<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.040> means<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.489> assume<00:00:44.910> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
basically this means you can assume that

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.510 
basically this means you can assume that
they<00:00:45.210> are<00:00:45.239> recommended<00:00:46.170> specifications<00:00:47.129> and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
they are recommended specifications and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.180 
they are recommended specifications and
not<00:00:47.850> minimum<00:00:48.600> hopefully<00:00:49.440> Bethesda<00:00:49.980> will

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
not minimum hopefully Bethesda will

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.020 
not minimum hopefully Bethesda will
actually<00:00:50.730> give<00:00:50.879> us<00:00:51.030> minimum<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.660> maximum

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
actually give us minimum and maximum

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.369 
actually give us minimum and maximum

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.410 
outsides of cons are right you have to
worry<00:01:07.920> about<00:01:08.040> if<00:01:08.250> your<00:01:08.369> system<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.850> powerful

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
worry about if your system is powerful
