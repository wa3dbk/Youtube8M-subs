00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello everyone decided to shoot a little video 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.799
 facts of the usefulness of the use of grease 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.580
 at 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.429
 on threaded connections when assembling here 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.449
 unscrew long short jet 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.710
 barbell look unscrewed 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.340
 I personally collected this car 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.830
 changed the rubber bushings did not collect everything 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.170
 played on nigrol planted smeared bolts 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:38.160
 look completely unscrewed without problems 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:45.410
 without forgetting without knocking your hands without breaking the keys 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:50.059
 nothing warming thread is greased nut 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.059
 lubricated take out the bolt 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.010
 take out the bolt 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:02.300
 the bolt is spinning freely not soured and 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:06.150
 look thread that is the body of the bolt 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.500
 oiled bolt goes loose by two 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:15.090
 no problems with your fingers 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:18.869
 sticking souring is our extra bolt 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:24.080
 just proves that when assembling just 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:30.650
 it is better to lubricate this example 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.490
 usual nigrol therefore here such here 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.240
 a little advice 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:41.579
 I advised this is often a lot of Well 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.000
 you saw the fact exactly the fact when i 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.780
 I disassemble and there everything is blurred we wish you 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.750
 the same to understand you and everything is easy 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.899
 sorted out relied on today everything 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.939
