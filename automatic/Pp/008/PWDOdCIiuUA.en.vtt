some<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.009> these<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.460> elongated<00:01:21.119> grew<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
some of these then elongated grew the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.550 
some of these then elongated grew the
characteristic<00:01:22.650> tail<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.220> started<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> swim

but<00:01:25.560> other<00:01:25.710> scientists<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.369> doubts<00:01:26.640> that

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
but other scientists have doubts that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030 
but other scientists have doubts that
the<00:01:27.000> sperm<00:01:27.299> would<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.720> work<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.650> certainly

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the sperm would really work we certainly

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.920 
the sperm would really work we certainly
need<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.610> an<00:01:29.729> egg<00:01:29.880> being<00:01:30.090> fertilized<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
need to see an egg being fertilized and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.929 
need to see an egg being fertilized and
we<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.380> experimentally<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.759> can

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
we can do that experimentally and we can

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.850 
we can do that experimentally and we can
see<00:01:33.150> how<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> sperm<00:01:33.780> reacts<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> egg<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
see how the sperm reacts to the egg and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.649 
see how the sperm reacts to the egg and
what<00:01:35.159> happens<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> chromosomes<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.509> is

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
what happens to the chromosomes this is

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.210 
what happens to the chromosomes this is
quite<00:01:36.780> an<00:01:36.900> elaborate<00:01:37.320> sequence<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.890> events

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
quite an elaborate sequence of events

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.640 
quite an elaborate sequence of events
that<00:01:38.369> occurs<00:01:38.700> when<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.450> sperm<00:01:39.810> eats<00:01:40.110> an<00:01:40.290> egg<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that occurs when a sperm eats an egg and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.310 
that occurs when a sperm eats an egg and
when<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> chromosomes<00:01:41.490> merged<00:01:42.420> together<00:01:42.689> and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
when the chromosomes merged together and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.690 
when the chromosomes merged together and
I<00:01:43.409> would<00:01:43.560> want<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.100> again<00:01:44.369> as

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I would want to see that again as

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.429 
I would want to see that again as
another<00:01:44.820> piece<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.450> crucial<00:01:45.840> evidence<00:01:45.899> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
another piece of crucial evidence to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.719 
another piece of crucial evidence to
make<00:01:46.590> sure<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.310> here<00:01:47.549> are

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
make sure that what we have here are

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.050 
make sure that what we have here are
actually<00:01:48.299> sperm<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.770> rare<00:01:49.979> ethical<00:01:50.490> concerns

actually sperm the rare ethical concerns

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.380 
actually sperm the rare ethical concerns
-<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:52.259> basically<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.220> very<00:01:53.460> unnatural<00:01:53.790> system

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
- it's basically a very unnatural system

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.149 
- it's basically a very unnatural system
and<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.869> very<00:01:55.079> unnatural<00:01:55.350> mass<00:01:55.979> of
