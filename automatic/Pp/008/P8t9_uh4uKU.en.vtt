00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
all day I mean 24 hours and more on the

all day I mean 24 hours and more on the
battery<00:06:23.199> life<00:06:23.380> there<00:06:23.650> I<00:06:23.800> would<00:06:24.460> say<00:06:24.610> I

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 
battery life there I would say I

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.450 
battery life there I would say I
probably<00:06:24.910> got<00:06:25.120> closer<00:06:25.449> to<00:06:25.600> about<00:06:25.930> maybe<00:06:26.460> 40

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
probably got closer to about maybe 40

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.610 
probably got closer to about maybe 40
hours<00:06:27.940> on<00:06:28.120> battery<00:06:28.449> life<00:06:28.630> it's<00:06:28.960> also<00:06:29.110> got<00:06:29.320> fast

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
hours on battery life it's also got fast

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.290 
hours on battery life it's also got fast
