00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
next year now I know I'm not doing it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.649 
next year now I know I'm not doing it
but<00:01:35.610> remember<00:01:36.090> i'm<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.509> whole

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
but remember i'm going to have a whole

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.450 
but remember i'm going to have a whole
ranking<00:01:37.110> system<00:01:37.470> i'm<00:01:37.590> how<00:01:37.770> i<00:01:37.799> left<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> team

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
ranking system i'm how i left the team

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.030 
ranking system i'm how i left the team
you<00:01:39.090> know<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.570> i<00:01:39.810> think<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.530> kind<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you know so i think we kind of have to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.830 
you know so i think we kind of have to
keep<00:01:41.460> Joe<00:01:42.049> just<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.229> case<00:01:43.470> um<00:01:44.329> because<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.720> we

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
keep Joe just in case um because if we

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.330 
keep Joe just in case um because if we
get<00:01:46.079> another<00:01:46.350> first<00:01:46.649> line<00:01:46.860> center<00:01:47.159> whose

five million on his UH on his payroll

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.969 
five million on his UH on his payroll
already<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.680> we're<00:01:55.770> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.950> have

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
already so I think we're going to have

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.889 
already so I think we're going to have
to<00:01:56.130> stick<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.340> Joe<00:01:56.610> boys<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:57.509> had<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> great

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
to stick with Joe boys we had a great

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.980 
to stick with Joe boys we had a great
season<00:01:58.170> last<00:01:58.350> year<00:01:58.649> why<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.990> everybody

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
season last year why like everybody

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.630 
season last year why like everybody
except<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.469> Joe<00:02:01.619> got<00:02:01.799> better<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.430> can

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
except for Joe got better so you can

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.219 
except for Joe got better so you can
argue<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:03.149> are<00:02:03.270> better<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.689> can<00:02:03.810> argue<00:02:03.960> we're

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
argue we are better you can argue we're

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.959
