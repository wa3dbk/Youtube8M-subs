good skill I think for your kids to
learn<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.930> develop<00:01:22.049> too<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.130> might<00:01:23.250> want<00:01:23.460> to

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
learn to develop too you might want to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.130 
learn to develop too you might want to
double<00:01:23.759> check<00:01:23.790> those<00:01:24.090> first<00:01:24.390> batches<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.990> make

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
double check those first batches to make

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.420 
double check those first batches to make
sure<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.500> they<00:01:25.619> picked<00:01:25.860> out<00:01:25.950> all<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> rocks

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
