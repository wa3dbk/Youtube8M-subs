00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 I welcome the audience if you come 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.580
 itâ€™s a thought to change tires on yours 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.300
 SUVs 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.830
 I can offer you a good option 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.740
 I myself advised one good 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.639
 comrade 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.699

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:25.590
 pirelli scorpion 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:28.619
 it is very beautiful rubber as you see 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:39.050
 she really remembers her protector 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:45.090
 scorpion tails to sizes she 265 70 16 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:47.539
 here you can see but italian 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.539
 rubber 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:56.289
 which in principle has an m plus s index 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:58.750
 and they say well here again on my friend 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:05.759
 He said that he went to her all Chelyabinsk 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:09.450
 winter is quite normal to the touch 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.450
 pretty soft 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.650
 it has good 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:20.690
 wear-resistant qualities in her very 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:24.170
 I tread a deep tread ruler 8 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:28.990
 millimeters fair such rubber 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:33.140
 tread means that the more weight it 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.440
 has about average 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:42.140
 weight four tires weigh 74 kilograms 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:45.700
 and it is not very heavy that is 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.060
 You can ride on the asphalt safely and also 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.200
 some kind of light off-road 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:57.440
 looks very confident 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:02.300
 aggressively well and pen or brand after all 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:11.750
 this is my kordiant but not even ventus 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:15.490
 korean for hello you are a ray of hope 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.990

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.830
 good you rubber 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.830
 subscribe to the channel 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.260
 hello again we finish very important 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.710
 quality is rubber 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.710
 these are excellent 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:42.360
 as you can see the paths for water drainage are very 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.360
 important for rain 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.300
 water flows out and no 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.300
 aquaplaning does not threaten you 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.750
 now checked rolled on solid 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.220
 puddles well, very confident car goes 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.570
 especially this at speed is very important 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.890
 if you buy tires on an SUV 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.980
 be sure to pay attention to 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.310
 how much well calculated drainage 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.380
 water 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.490
 because if the tires will be closed 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.220
 profile either to cat bf goodrich such 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.670
 very tricky structure which is water in 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.780
 as if captures itself and does not display 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.220
 maybe aquaplaning is very 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.190
 dangerous thing if you're at speed 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:32.140
 get on heavy off-road vehicles into the water 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.250
 you can just swim and well god forbid 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.010
 Of course no one can throw out 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.800
 health so good luck to all 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.300
 excellent rubber are not afraid of snow 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:46.110
 rain is not dirt is not ours on asphalt 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.110
