 hi youtube hi dear subscriber 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:15.059
 and the viewer in general what else I want to say about 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.029
 wild strawberries here the hike June 30 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.410
 which was today this one probably 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.380
 the third video I will break into three parts into 1 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.369
 this hike is so much their strawberries 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.890
 as you saw then i will 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:37.070
 I would like to experiment 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.090
 make strawberry wine 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:47.059
 here then sources well in the spring which 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:53.480
 I showed you I scored a little 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:01:00.059
 water based on which I will do 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:05.450
 it is wine itself for this we take 3 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.540
 liters shirt and remind another third 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.549
 strawberry well as on that 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.080
 Well, maybe a little less because 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.610
 a third may be a lot 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:23.930
 here I think so much will be enough here 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:28.390
 Now we pour out approximately 600 grams 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.030
 sugar to make us sweet 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.400
 Well, at least I can for you 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:41.130
 add less then be less sweet 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:41.130
 and managing promo sugar 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:52.829
 now fill 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.829
 spring water around the shoulders 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.390
 bays 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.260
 you can still add 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:33.360
 you don't want to cook yet 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.360
 about 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.610
 and 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.470
 can 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.510
 or eat with a spoon 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.020
 in fact, although he dissolves himself 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.020
 multi-valued case 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:11.530
 what does she have to do at this stage 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:15.880
 close the water trap they come in different 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:21.330
 kinds of these water seal and there gloves 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:26.790
 someone dresses they then cost either 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:30.330
 Purchased I did just bought a cover 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:38.590
 did not hole slipped 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:44.700
 tubule from the dropper system and so 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.700
 covers it to be sealed to 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.209
 carbon dioxide could go out and we could 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:58.550
 knows this fermentation process also 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:04:01.349
 put on his exact ending here and 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.000
 the end of this tube will need to be placed 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:10.349
 its on because the water seal is to 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:16.560
 fly where I could go air there 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:20.940
 no longer coming from one so not 20 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:24.290
 30 probably put it lions 720 30 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.860
 days see what happens 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.860
 that's all for now
