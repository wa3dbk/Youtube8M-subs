which<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.000> reviewed<00:00:24.449> kind<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.260> back<00:00:25.380> then<00:00:25.680> but

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
which I reviewed kind of back then but

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.950 
which I reviewed kind of back then but
then<00:00:26.400> again<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:26.910> kind<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.180> different<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
then again it's kind of different at the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.509 
then again it's kind of different at the
same<00:00:27.990> time<00:00:28.529> because<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.980> has<00:00:29.010> multiple

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
same time because it has multiple

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.099 
same time because it has multiple
waypoints<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.449> yeah<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.929> little

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
waypoints and yeah it's just a little

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.389 
waypoints and yeah it's just a little
bit<00:00:31.230> different<00:00:31.500> there<00:00:31.590> are<00:00:31.619> different<00:00:31.740> mods

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
bit different there are different mods

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.040 
bit different there are different mods
but<00:00:32.640> then<00:00:32.730> again<00:00:32.820> they<00:00:33.120> do<00:00:33.180> kind<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.960> same

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
but then again they do kind of the same

to the end and to the nether which is

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.359 
to the end and to the nether which is
really<00:01:31.079> cool<00:01:31.229> also<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
really cool also you can see the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.609 
really cool also you can see the
coordinates<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.659> kind<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.990> tell<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.530> you

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
coordinates you can kind of tell if you

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.020 
coordinates you can kind of tell if you
look<00:01:34.650> at<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.920> coordinates<00:01:35.310> how<00:01:35.430> far<00:01:35.700> away<00:01:35.909> it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
look at the coordinates how far away it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.969 
look at the coordinates how far away it
is<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.270> let's<00:01:36.450> go<00:01:36.570> ahead<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.990> show<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.560> how

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
is so let's go ahead and show you how

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.280 
is so let's go ahead and show you how
this<00:01:38.189> mod<00:01:38.520> works<00:01:38.790> I'm<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.360> fly<00:01:39.750> over<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
this mod works I'm going to fly over to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.969 
this mod works I'm going to fly over to
this<00:01:40.439> island<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.540> kind<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.350> test<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
this island so we can kind of test it I

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.440 
this island so we can kind of test it I
guess<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.159> could<00:01:44.369> say<00:01:44.520> tell<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.299> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
guess you could say tell you that it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.929 
guess you could say tell you that it
does<00:01:45.750> work<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.649> very<00:01:47.070> very<00:01:47.310> far<00:01:47.670> range

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
does work in a very very far range

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.880 
does work in a very very far range
almost<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.540> across<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.079> frickin<00:01:49.350> world<00:01:49.680> I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
almost like across the frickin world I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.230 
almost like across the frickin world I
guess<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.100> could<00:01:50.220> say<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:50.369> obviously<00:01:51.149> we're

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
guess you could say but obviously we're

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.460 
guess you could say but obviously we're
not<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.840> big<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.110> an<00:01:52.229> example

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
not going to do that big of an example

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.350 
not going to do that big of an example
first<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:52.979> first<00:01:53.280> off<00:01:53.460> let<00:01:53.850> me<00:01:53.880> show<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.060> craft

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
first so first off let me show you craft

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.819 
first so first off let me show you craft
recipe<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> crafting<00:01:55.320> recipe<00:01:55.590> for

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
recipe this is the crafting recipe for

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.800 
recipe this is the crafting recipe for
the<00:01:55.950> Waypoint<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.270> crafted

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the Waypoint it's going to be crafted

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.870 
the Waypoint it's going to be crafted
with<00:01:58.020> five<00:01:58.530> pieces<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.979> stone<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.490> they're

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
with five pieces of stone and they're

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.670 
with five pieces of stone and they're
probably<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.210> sadly<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.049> craft<00:02:01.259> for

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
probably not sadly you have to craft for

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200 
probably not sadly you have to craft for
these<00:02:01.920> which<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.579> little<00:02:02.850> bit<00:02:02.939> hefty

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
these which is a little bit hefty

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.580 
these which is a little bit hefty
because<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.659> get<00:02:03.780> 400<00:02:04.140> pearls<00:02:04.409> but<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
because you have to get 400 pearls but I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.840 
because you have to get 400 pearls but I
guess<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.860> could<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.490> little<00:02:05.610> bit<00:02:05.759> of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
guess you could go for a little bit of

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.520 
guess you could go for a little bit of
indoor<00:02:06.299> hunting<00:02:06.689> at<00:02:06.810> night<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.439> you

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
notice when you put them all together

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.029 
notice when you put them all together
they<00:02:08.819> actually<00:02:09.450> come<00:02:09.629> together<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.890> can

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
they actually come together so you can

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.830 
they actually come together so you can
tell<00:02:11.190> that's<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.459> solid<00:02:11.760> block<00:02:12.000> saw<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> block

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
then when you put it together at all

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.949 
then when you put it together at all
merges<00:02:14.880> together<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.270> it's<00:02:15.390> really<00:02:15.510> cool<00:02:15.720> and

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959

can see let's go ahead and set down our

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.890 
can see let's go ahead and set down our
Waypoint<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.610> make<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.760> net<00:02:50.970> but<00:02:51.450> net<00:02:51.720> let's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
Waypoint and to make a net but net let's

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.990 
Waypoint and to make a net but net let's
make<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.080> nether<00:02:52.500> Waypoint<00:02:53.160> so<00:02:53.310> let's<00:02:53.519> just

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
make a nether Waypoint so let's just

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.400 
make a nether Waypoint so let's just
name<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:54.390> one<00:02:54.540> woops<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.110> meant<00:02:55.350> to

we can tell that we have the nether so

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.759 
we can tell that we have the nether so
if<00:03:01.920> we<00:03:01.980> wanted<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.310> go<00:03:02.640> back<00:03:02.819> simply<00:03:03.510> -<00:03:04.019> I<00:03:04.049> don't

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
if we wanted to go back simply - I don't

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.140 
if we wanted to go back simply - I don't
know<00:03:04.830> mod<00:03:05.040> showcase<00:03:05.400> 1<00:03:05.610> we<00:03:05.760> could<00:03:05.880> just<00:03:05.970> down

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
know mod showcase 1 we could just down

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.330 
know mod showcase 1 we could just down
go<00:03:06.750> back<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.049> that<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.290> will<00:03:07.530> generate<00:03:08.190> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
go back to that and will generate the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.650 
go back to that and will generate the
world<00:03:08.549> and<00:03:08.760> stuff<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.269> might<00:03:09.480> take<00:03:09.599> a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
world and stuff like that might take a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.420 
world and stuff like that might take a
little<00:03:09.720> bit<00:03:09.900> generate<00:03:10.349> it<00:03:10.470> might<00:03:11.220> take<00:03:11.400> a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
little bit generate it might take a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.160 
little bit generate it might take a
little<00:03:11.700> bit<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.330> generate<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.810> because<00:03:13.019> you

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
little bit to generate it because you

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.050 
little bit to generate it because you
are<00:03:13.349> going<00:03:13.650> back<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.400> normal<00:03:14.580> world<00:03:14.849> so

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
are going back to the normal world so

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.370 
are going back to the normal world so
let's<00:03:15.209> go<00:03:15.299> ahead<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.599> go<00:03:16.049> back<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
let's go ahead and go back to the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.370 
let's go ahead and go back to the
stronghold<00:03:16.890> where<00:03:17.069> we<00:03:17.280> originally<00:03:18.000> work<00:03:18.510> so

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
that is going to be about it for the

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.910 
that is going to be about it for the
Waypoint<00:03:21.780> mod<00:03:21.959> that's<00:03:22.140> all<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.410> can<00:03:22.530> do<00:03:22.709> I

Waypoint mod that's all you can do I

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.819 
Waypoint mod that's all you can do I
love<00:03:23.280> how<00:03:23.400> they<00:03:23.670> have<00:03:23.910> put<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.989> coordinates

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
love how they have put the coordinates

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.979 
love how they have put the coordinates
and<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.160> dimension<00:03:26.790> when<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.030> click<00:03:27.390> on<00:03:27.540> this

you<00:03:28.290> can<00:03:28.380> see<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.890> coordinates<00:03:29.190> and

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
you can see the coordinates and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.280 
you can see the coordinates and
dimension<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.480> can<00:03:30.569> tell<00:03:30.720> for<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.049> nether

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290

dimension so you can tell for the nether
you<00:03:31.470> can<00:03:31.590> see<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.859> dimension<00:03:32.250> that's<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.549> the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
you can see the dimension that's in the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.580 
you can see the dimension that's in the
nether<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.180> is<00:03:33.299> an<00:03:33.390> overworld<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.440> if

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
nether and this is an overworld so if

stuff or all those awesome indoor eyes
and<00:03:39.810> put<00:03:39.930> them<00:03:40.019> in<00:03:40.109> here<00:03:40.319> then<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.530> can<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:40.739> in

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
and put them in here then you can go in

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.550 
and put them in here then you can go in
the<00:03:41.190> end<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:42.359> can<00:03:42.510> clearly<00:03:42.959> put<00:03:43.440> a

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
the end and you can clearly put a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.900 
the end and you can clearly put a
waypoint<00:03:43.980> in<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.190> end<00:03:44.340> if<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:44.519> want<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.850> do

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
waypoint in the end if you want to do

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.160 
waypoint in the end if you want to do
that<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.180> think<00:03:45.329> it's<00:03:45.450> really<00:03:45.569> useful<00:03:45.660> if

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
that so I think it's really useful if

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.410 
that so I think it's really useful if
you<00:03:46.620> were<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:46.920> get<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:47.459> mod<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.150> name

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
you were to get this mod and name

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.270 
you were to get this mod and name
different<00:03:48.660> stuff<00:03:49.019> like<00:03:49.200> your<00:03:49.380> mind<00:03:49.709> so<00:03:50.010> let's

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
different stuff like your mind so let's

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.370 
different stuff like your mind so let's
say<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.519> don't<00:03:50.790> know<00:03:50.970> for<00:03:51.180> example<00:03:51.269> I<00:03:51.780> go<00:03:52.079> ahead

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
say I don't know for example I go ahead

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.740 
say I don't know for example I go ahead
and<00:03:52.709> jump<00:03:53.459> in<00:03:53.579> in<00:03:53.730> this<00:03:53.910> mind<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.510> found

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750
