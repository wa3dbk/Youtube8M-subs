00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
various kept good yeah and certain to be

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.819 
various kept good yeah and certain to be
water<00:02:04.810> in<00:02:04.899> there<00:02:05.110> but<00:02:05.259> it<00:02:05.350> looks<00:02:05.500> like<00:02:05.649> its

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
water in there but it looks like its

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.770 
water in there but it looks like its
evaporated<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:06.640> but<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.119> got<00:02:07.329> a<00:02:07.360> little<00:02:07.570> bit

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
evaporated so but you got a little bit

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.949 
evaporated so but you got a little bit
of<00:02:07.869> water<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.440> just<00:02:08.649> come<00:02:08.860> fresher<00:02:09.959> yeah

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.960 
of water and I just come fresher yeah
that's<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.709> trick<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.160> think<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.489> is<00:02:12.550> another

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
that's the trick I think this is another

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.250 
that's the trick I think this is another
thing<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.330> lot<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.540> people<00:02:13.660> know<00:02:14.080> the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
thing a lot of people know the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.809 
thing a lot of people know the
importance<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.650> eating<00:02:14.890> whole<00:02:15.370> grain<00:02:15.580> right

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
importance of eating whole grain right

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.970 
importance of eating whole grain right
but<00:02:16.450> there's<00:02:16.630> so<00:02:16.930> much<00:02:17.080> whole<00:02:17.349> wheat<00:02:17.500> bread<00:02:17.650> on

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
but there's so much whole wheat bread on

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.000 
but there's so much whole wheat bread on
the<00:02:18.160> shelves<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:19.530> learned<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.739> or

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
the shelves that it learned that or

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.830 
the shelves that it learned that or
