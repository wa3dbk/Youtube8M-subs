00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:04.740
 8 8 8 we also have 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.699
 depart Marechaussee 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:13.119
 what matter it was on Sunday but it was at a depth 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.679
 the 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:21.919
 we had calculated 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.980
 reason for the animals 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.070
 the club wants the departure of ba 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.609
 adelaide 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.409
 not infrequently kwo 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:30.939
 however, it is too 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.939
 career 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.640
 when I do 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.800
 Then it may also be because minutes were prompted for Europe to recall 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.450
 dangerous which ended up 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.760
 to make it easier for groups 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.810
 the impression 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.120
 window but wash 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.700
 she looks at it 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.520
 do you know that 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.940
 wouter the friend 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.210
 8 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.950
 shortly thereafter the first time on that cult was max 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.740
 don't give money for it 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.740
 this was halved 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.580
 the pilots must be 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.790
 less for that 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.380
 of course it is 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.670
 the city after that I am well aware that the boy was arrested shortly thereafter 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.670
 to fill blyk 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.340
 Jan Penn 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.340
 and that already d 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.029
 although the flow 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.830
 and when this euro gets more out of their sport 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.090
 the cirque it 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.109
 the former 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.109
 the carrots and other occur 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.509
 because that's what I'm with you 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.039
 as far as falls 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:37.829
 you are absolutely right 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.549
 the mole is you then 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.039
 but for everyone 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.809
 what is that anyway 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:46.239
 that means that I am still there for that matter 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:52.769
 but this was only due to a problem with a heavy fall but mainly 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.939
 but that is but all the bombs from a sample of people to the World Cup 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.859
 the court in arnhem picked up only cda emmen 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:08.029
 the paper newspaper 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.029
 neither because I do not live in especially in the newspaper 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:13.999
 than expected 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.429
 it is now 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.579
 the project 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.880
 pauline paulette again 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.549
 the commercial 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.549
 lasted two hours 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:27.149
 the shape of 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.799
 also for nec 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:42.869
 but I am still on 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:45.869
 over an hour later 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.729
 he drove 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.969
 8 once I finish an opening 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:55.189
 that's right, but I don't think that is a child of Christmas pieces either 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.999
 what i make up 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:01.029
 see last year that is the highest number of weeks the 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:04.839
 the hospitality industry of two years 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.519
 the 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:12.929
 9 but 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.500
 the past 8 when 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.559
 celebrate 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:23.940
 roj therein image that one but a good one 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.590
 that all cantons go to bed due to a problem caused by this 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.449
 last week hence we are dear 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:32.960
 of the debate 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.139
 well yes 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.139
 it was third place 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:42.999
 not childish from the interior 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.860
 first think about what comes after the horses 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.860
 during the opening 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.110
 at the top 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.460
 the flight 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.150
 This makes the race management of the Dutch more expensive. Twente already 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.370
 you that is too 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.749
 the Brabant newspaper 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.490
 wilders wants to make that right 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.479
 that was the flight
