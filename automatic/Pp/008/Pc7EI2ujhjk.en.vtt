it's not like mine which heats it up and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.020 
it's not like mine which heats it up and
steams<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.490> put<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.909> like

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
steams it this one you put it in like

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.490 
steams it this one you put it in like
this<00:01:48.060> little<00:01:48.420> jar<00:01:48.659> then<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.960> kind<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.259> pump

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
this little jar then you kind of pump

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.380 
this little jar then you kind of pump
this<00:01:49.770> thing<00:01:50.220> through<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.850> then<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.240> makes

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
this thing through it and then it makes

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.450 
this thing through it and then it makes
it<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.630> foamy<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.439> pulled

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
it all foamy but it is pulled

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.039

I<00:01:53.520> might<00:01:54.000> imagine<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.570> could<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.810> heat<00:01:54.960> up

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
I might imagine you could like heat up

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.600 
I might imagine you could like heat up
the<00:01:55.170> milk<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.470> then<00:01:55.590> put<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.009> or<00:01:56.280> something

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the milk and then put it in or something

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.149 
the milk and then put it in or something
like<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.180> use<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.469> then<00:01:58.590> uh<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:59.009> think

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
like that I use that and then uh I think

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.209 
like that I use that and then uh I think
it<00:01:59.939> got<00:02:00.119> broken<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.290> mine<00:02:01.680> but

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
it got broken but I like mine but

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.679 
it got broken but I like mine but
obviously<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> other<00:02:02.880> one<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> lot<00:02:03.420> cheaper

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
obviously the other one is a lot cheaper

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.889 
obviously the other one is a lot cheaper
it's<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.170> 20<00:02:04.979> bucks<00:02:05.130> maybe<00:02:05.460> at<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> most<00:02:06.000> so

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
it's like 20 bucks maybe at the most so

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.839 
it's like 20 bucks maybe at the most so
that<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.560> an<00:02:07.770> option<00:02:07.860> too<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.489> don't<00:02:08.640> know<00:02:08.819> I

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
that is an option too but I don't know I

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.400 
that is an option too but I don't know I
like<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.979> got<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.489> my<00:02:11.970> HBIC
