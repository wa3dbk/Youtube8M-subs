00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.389
 Hi everyone! How are you ? 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.130
 I'll show you how to make a purse. 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.349
 wearing a shirt you will see that 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.260
 It's super easy to do and it's super 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.840
 Lovely rate to use on a daily basis 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.260
 So the bag that we're going to do is 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.119
 This one I made the drawing on it will have 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.580
 will be lines or show that for the moment 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:35.489
 It is the part of me here and that's not 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.050
 now check with me step by step 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.190
 We're going to need a T-shirt that is 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.379
 a size m 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.729
 today in the case a shirt she is at 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.250
 because I did not have one 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.110
 shirt that did not have a print 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.299
 so here first thing we cut 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.489
 the sleeves 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:54.239
 then we'll cut the ball to make the 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.229
 strap of our bag 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.610
 I'll be using scissors 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.610
 even proof holding 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.610
 now let's pull a little 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.840
 shirt down and we'll cut the 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.840
 bar of the shirt 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.370
 now let's measure four fingers and let's go 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.530
 To report several T-shirt to 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.530
 make our handbags 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:55.229
 here we have our little angels now 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:00.560
 that we're going to need to get the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:03.329
 each had and pull to be fine 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.780
 and besides getting thinner will stay 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.780
 bigger 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.660
 Now let's get it two by two. 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.769
 Let's make knots for 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.769
 close our bag 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.040
 and here is our result 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:51.480
 now let's get the sleeves and pull the 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:51.480
 cloth the same thing let's do with the ball 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.290
 and here is our handle 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.750
 I also decided to make drawings in our 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.370
 bag will let rain fall and here 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.430
 I'll use a rule because otherwise 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.349
 It will be all crooked, choosing drawings. 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.480
 then you can search the 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.930
 google ethnic prints that you take 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.709
 This is the way I'm going to use it. 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.359
 an enamel to touch the bag as it is 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.700
 so people are complicated to us 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.980
 use the enamel because it 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.810
 then if you are going to use 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.930
 uses that they do not have what you 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.040
 or have their own ink for 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.040
 painting t-shirt 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.980
 now let's get the bar of the shirt to 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.980
 people had already cut 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.760
 let's cut it down 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:13.250
 now let's leave a little tip 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.250
 and let's make a knot 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:31.250
 very strong is not let go and now we go 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.180
 make a braid equal to the braid of 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.190
 hair 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.190
 We're going to do it here with our cops. 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.399
 After you're done, do not forget. 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:04.529
 on the other side of the 

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:04.529
 fringes soups and do the knot 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.819
 this braid will turn the handle of the 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.819
 our purse 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.789
 now let's put la na shirt 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.200
 when it comes to putting the shirt on 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.750
 inside the shirt loop so that 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.160
 our lines stay outside 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.160
 and of course there is a new node 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.290
 and then people you left in the bag if 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.420
 Do you want a tip for you to comment? 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.610
 down here you found it there too 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.140
 and here under the release of the video is 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.670
 register in cases where it is not channel 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.670
 inscribed tea
