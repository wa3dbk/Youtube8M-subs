00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
throughout the whole flower and you just

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.210 
throughout the whole flower and you just
cut<00:01:06.039> in<00:01:06.460> an<00:01:07.180> angle<00:01:07.600> down<00:01:07.869> then<00:01:08.830> you<00:01:08.979> pull<00:01:09.190> it

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
piece that doesn't come out you just cut

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.859 
piece that doesn't come out you just cut
a<00:01:16.929> little<00:01:17.200> deeper<00:01:17.649> and<00:01:18.060> let<00:01:19.060> out<00:01:19.270> yank<00:01:19.630> it<00:01:19.750> out

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.859 
a little deeper and let out yank it out
like<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.289> and<00:01:20.920> then<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:21.700> just<00:01:21.759> you<00:01:22.240> know<00:01:22.360> go

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
like that and then you just you know go

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.870 
like that and then you just you know go
all<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.259> way<00:01:23.289> around<00:01:23.560> like<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:24.220> when<00:01:24.759> you

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
all the way around like that when you

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.180 
all the way around like that when you
come<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.390> center<00:01:25.929> you<00:01:26.649> want<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:26.950> leave

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
come to the center you want to leave

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.820 
come to the center you want to leave
those<00:01:28.090> little<00:01:28.390> Leafs<00:01:28.869> in<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.289> middle<00:01:29.619> and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
those little Leafs in the middle and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.040 
those little Leafs in the middle and
that<00:01:29.860> will<00:01:30.610> become<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:31.000> pistil<00:01:31.660> of<00:01:31.899> the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
that will become the pistil of the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.529 
that will become the pistil of the
flower<00:01:32.319> what<00:01:32.950> keeps<00:01:33.190> really<00:01:33.700> good<00:01:33.940> if<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:34.360> put

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
flower what keeps really good if you put

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.040 
flower what keeps really good if you put
it<00:01:34.630> in<00:01:34.750> ice<00:01:34.959> water<00:01:35.289> and<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:37.270> should<00:01:37.509> keep<00:01:37.750> up

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
it in ice water and that should keep up

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.230 
it in ice water and that should keep up
for<00:01:39.149> three<00:01:40.149> to<00:01:40.300> four<00:01:40.509> days<00:01:40.690> over<00:01:41.560> here<00:01:42.240> but

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
for three to four days over here but

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.249 
for three to four days over here but
celery<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:44.229> made<00:01:44.770> kind<00:01:45.039> of<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.310> wreath<00:01:46.259> that's

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
celery I made kind of a wreath that's

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.580 
celery I made kind of a wreath that's
pretty<00:01:47.979> cool<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:49.420> take<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.840> garnishes<00:01:50.380> out

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
pretty cool you take the garnishes out

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.740 
pretty cool you take the garnishes out
so<00:01:51.009> you<00:01:51.069> can<00:01:51.280> see<00:01:51.310> this<00:01:51.640> better<00:01:51.910> this<00:01:52.569> is

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
so you can see this better this is

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.719 
so you can see this better this is
pretty<00:01:52.989> easy<00:01:53.349> to<00:01:53.530> do<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.280> looks<00:01:54.310> pretty

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
pretty easy to do and it looks pretty

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.320 
pretty easy to do and it looks pretty
fancy<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.869> I<00:01:55.929> grabbed<00:01:56.580> celery<00:01:57.580> stock<00:01:57.940> just

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
fancy so I grabbed celery stock just

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.270 
fancy so I grabbed celery stock just
like<00:01:58.509> that<00:01:58.750> okay

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
like that okay

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.000 
like that okay
and<00:02:01.770> lengthwise<00:02:02.770> I<00:02:03.400> half<00:02:03.970> its<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.680> middle

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
and lengthwise I half its to the middle

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.460 
and lengthwise I half its to the middle
okay<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:08.020> then<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.200> grab<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.800> paring<00:02:09.280> knife<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
okay and then I grab a paring knife and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.580 
okay and then I grab a paring knife and
then<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:15.270> cut<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.450> in<00:02:16.660> an<00:02:16.810> angle

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.360 

and<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:20.720> just<00:02:21.720> keep<00:02:22.110> going<00:02:22.680> all<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.340> way

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
and then just keep going all the way

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.010 
and then just keep going all the way
through

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.860 

and<00:02:27.410> make<00:02:27.650> sure<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.120> go<00:02:29.330> in<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.630> nice

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
and make sure that you go in a nice

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.960 
and make sure that you go in a nice
angle<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.640> can<00:02:31.940> get<00:02:32.210> a<00:02:33.460> really<00:02:34.460> nice

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
angle so you can get a really nice

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.340 
angle so you can get a really nice
effect<00:02:36.910> but<00:02:37.910> will<00:02:38.120> happen<00:02:38.630> when<00:02:38.960> this<00:02:39.110> goes

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
effect but will happen when this goes

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.580 
effect but will happen when this goes
into<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:40.040> water<00:02:40.340> advil<00:02:41.150> curl<00:02:41.540> up<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.870> celery

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
into the water advil curl up the celery

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.210 
into the water advil curl up the celery
so<00:02:43.460> it<00:02:43.520> becomes<00:02:44.030> circular<00:02:44.630> like<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:45.230> and

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
so it becomes circular like this and

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.420 
so it becomes circular like this and
then<00:02:46.340> you'll<00:02:46.520> have<00:02:46.820> a<00:02:47.180> nice<00:02:47.900> wreath<00:02:49.420> overnight
