00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
spectrum medicine and a lot of the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.800 
spectrum medicine and a lot of the
city's<00:01:31.610> you're<00:01:31.850> not<00:01:32.060> going<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.360> have<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.630> same

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
city's you're not going to have the same

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.679 
city's you're not going to have the same
experience<00:01:33.320> as<00:01:33.500> you<00:01:33.649> will<00:01:33.829> out<00:01:34.070> in<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.689> rural

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
setting and so that was another reason

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.609 
setting and so that was another reason
why<00:01:38.210> I<00:01:38.240> chose<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.780> be<00:01:38.869> out<00:01:38.990> here<00:01:39.020> it<00:01:39.500> is

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
why I chose to be out here it is

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.649
