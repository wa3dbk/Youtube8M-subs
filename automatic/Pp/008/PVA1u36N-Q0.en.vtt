pure<00:00:26.849> acetone<00:00:27.390> because<00:00:28.640> your<00:00:29.640> nails<00:00:29.910> will

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
pure acetone because your nails will

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.749 
pure acetone because your nails will
stop<00:00:30.480> growing<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.109> simply<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
stop growing and simply because the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.299 
stop growing and simply because the
purest<00:00:33.210> took<00:00:33.450> very<00:00:33.840> bad<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.290> your<00:00:34.380> nail<00:00:34.559> you

may<00:00:35.460> not<00:00:35.579> know<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.820> because<00:00:36.739> pure<00:00:37.739> acetone

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
may not know that because pure acetone

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.430 
may not know that because pure acetone
it's<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:41.129> really<00:00:41.340> natural<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.360> doesn't<00:00:43.350> have

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
it's not really natural and doesn't have

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.619 
it's not really natural and doesn't have
that<00:00:43.590> much<00:00:43.710> biotin<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.879> could<00:00:45.030> kill<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
that much biotin so you could kill the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.190 
that much biotin so you could kill the
growth<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.860> nails<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> suspect<00:00:49.050> you

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
growth of your nails so I suspect you

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.459 
growth of your nails so I suspect you
don't<00:00:49.530> use<00:00:50.010> pure<00:00:50.969> acetone<00:00:51.449> as<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.289> see

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
don't use pure acetone as you can see

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.860 
don't use pure acetone as you can see
art<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.520> already<00:00:53.820> notice<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
art like you can already notice that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.900 
art like you can already notice that
that's<00:00:55.079> why<00:00:55.350> people<00:00:55.710> now<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.129> yell<00:00:56.640> over

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
that's why people now that yell over

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.990 
that's why people now that yell over
here<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.629> those<00:00:57.809> stuff<00:00:58.079> um<00:00:59.000> because

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
here and all those stuff um because

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.430 
here and all those stuff um because
they're<00:01:00.239> using<00:01:00.480> pure<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> turn<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.289> they

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
they're using pure on the turn and they

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.319 
they're using pure on the turn and they
keep<00:01:01.590> moving<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.309> polish<00:01:02.670> every<00:01:02.969> day<00:01:03.090> so

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
keep moving in that polish every day so

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.910 
keep moving in that polish every day so
I<00:01:03.539> suspect<00:01:04.350> avoiding<00:01:06.409> you<00:01:07.409> should<00:01:07.560> use<00:01:07.680> not<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
I suspect avoiding you should use not a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.940 
I suspect avoiding you should use not a
stone<00:01:08.430> which<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.790> very<00:01:09.000> great<00:01:09.330> natural
