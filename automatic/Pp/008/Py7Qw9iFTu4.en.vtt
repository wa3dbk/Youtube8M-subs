that<00:00:00.450> we<00:00:00.570> neglect<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.319> our<00:00:01.589> athletes<00:00:02.010> is

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
that we neglect in our athletes is

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.160 
that we neglect in our athletes is
actually<00:00:03.120> working<00:00:03.330> and<00:00:03.570> strengthening<00:00:04.080> the

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
actually working and strengthening the

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.140 
actually working and strengthening the
hips<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.650> that<00:00:05.130> means<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.520> total<00:00:05.730> hip

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
hips and that means a total hip

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.150 
hips and that means a total hip
strengthening<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:07.200> means<00:00:07.470> we<00:00:07.649> can<00:00:07.830> go<00:00:08.010> out

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
strengthening that means we can go out

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.680 
strengthening that means we can go out
here<00:00:08.400> on<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.610> field<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.090> can<00:00:09.120> do<00:00:09.360> some<00:00:09.599> of

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
here on the field and we can do some of

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.900 
here on the field and we can do some of
our<00:00:09.809> drills<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.469> pulling<00:00:10.800> linear<00:00:11.580> straight

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
our drills of pulling linear straight

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.759 
our drills of pulling linear straight
ahead<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.300> we<00:00:12.360> can<00:00:12.509> do<00:00:12.630> sideways<00:00:13.170> but<00:00:13.650> we

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
ahead and we can do sideways but we

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.440 
ahead and we can do sideways but we
really<00:00:14.130> need<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.400> make<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.700> hip<00:00:14.940> work<00:00:15.179> and

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
really need to make that hip work and

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.930 
really need to make that hip work and
strengthen<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.020> glutes<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:17.369> actually<00:00:17.730> get

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
strengthen the glutes to actually get

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.880 
strengthen the glutes to actually get
that<00:00:18.119> hip<00:00:18.300> stronger<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.350> produce<00:00:19.500> for

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
that hip stronger so it can produce for

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.429 
that hip stronger so it can produce for
us<00:00:19.949> okay<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.119> when<00:00:21.270> we're<00:00:21.449> doing<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:22.080> is

explosion if you're talking basketball
you<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.549> awkward<00:02:06.000> positions<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.500> is

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
you get in awkward positions and this is

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.109 
you get in awkward positions and this is
another<00:02:07.950> way<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.160> use<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.580> call<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:08.940> those

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
another way to use the call on those

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.930 
another way to use the call on those
muscles<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.840> able<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.080> perform<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.950> so

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
now they're coming back down on this

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.270 
now they're coming back down on this
side

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.050 

toe<00:02:17.280> up<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.360> over<00:02:18.840> as<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.370> get<00:02:20.370> we've<00:02:20.550> got<00:02:20.790> ten

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
toe up and over as you get we've got ten

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.120 
toe up and over as you get we've got ten
hurdles<00:02:21.420> on<00:02:21.540> each<00:02:21.690> side<00:02:21.990> so<00:02:22.290> they're<00:02:22.770> actually

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
hurdles on each side so they're actually

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.670 
hurdles on each side so they're actually

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
back and forth done the hurdles where

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.680 
back and forth done the hurdles where
we're<00:02:29.850> going<00:02:30.030> forward<00:02:30.390> again

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
we're going forward again

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.570 
we're going forward again
we're<00:02:31.140> gonna<00:02:31.230> go<00:02:31.440> backwards<00:02:31.680> now<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.280> again

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
we're gonna go backwards now so again

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.930 
we're gonna go backwards now so again
next<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.300> hurdle<00:02:33.600> hip<00:02:34.470> up<00:02:34.680> step<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.460> bring

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
next to the hurdle hip up step and bring

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.740 
next to the hurdle hip up step and bring
it<00:02:36.090> back<00:02:36.240> down

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
it back down

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.740 
it back down
alright<00:02:37.530> come<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.770> through<00:02:38.010> Gavin<00:02:38.630> when<00:02:39.630> you

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
alright come on through Gavin when you

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.350 
alright come on through Gavin when you
do<00:02:39.930> one<00:02:40.170> direction<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.950> do<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.790> opposite

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
do one direction you do the opposite

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.210 
do one direction you do the opposite
your<00:02:42.930> muscles<00:02:43.320> are<00:02:43.440> built<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:43.830> go<00:02:43.950> both<00:02:44.190> ways

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
your muscles are built to go both ways

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.880 
your muscles are built to go both ways
so<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:45.270> really<00:02:45.660> need<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.050> go<00:02:46.200> one<00:02:46.470> way<00:02:46.650> with

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
so you really need to go one way with

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.590 
so you really need to go one way with
the<00:02:47.010> muscle<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.520> then<00:02:47.940> strengthen<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
the muscle and then strengthen it the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.370 
the muscle and then strengthen it the
opposite<00:02:49.080> way<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:54.180> notice<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.959> they<00:02:55.110> should

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
opposite way and notice that they should

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.920 
opposite way and notice that they should
be<00:02:55.530> using<00:02:55.800> their<00:02:56.070> arms<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.940> help<00:02:57.090> propel<00:02:57.450> that

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
be using their arms to help propel that

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.150 
be using their arms to help propel that
leg<00:02:58.200> over<00:02:58.590> as<00:02:58.680> well

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
leg over as well

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.570 
leg over as well
anything<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.270> do<00:03:00.650> even<00:03:01.650> if<00:03:01.740> it's<00:03:01.890> slow<00:03:02.190> you

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
anything you do even if it's slow you

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.910 
anything you do even if it's slow you
want<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:03.360> body<00:03:03.570> mechanics<00:03:03.840> going<00:03:04.560> with<00:03:04.740> you

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
want that body mechanics going with you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.699 
want that body mechanics going with you
so<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.459> elbow<00:03:05.760> should<00:03:05.790> be<00:03:06.030> back<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:07.380> the

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
so the elbow should be back and the

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.290 
so the elbow should be back and the
other<00:03:07.830> one<00:03:07.950> should<00:03:08.040> be<00:03:08.370> by<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.610> face<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.209> then

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
other one should be by the face and then

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.790 
other one should be by the face and then
alter<00:03:09.690> data<00:03:09.900> as<00:03:10.020> you're<00:03:10.170> going<00:03:10.350> through

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
alter data as you're going through

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.000 
alter data as you're going through
there<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.190> go<00:03:11.340> step<00:03:11.700> through
