hello and welcome to a class on 20 Torr
today<00:00:03.270> I'm<00:00:03.360> gonna<00:00:03.480> be<00:00:03.629> showing<00:00:03.840> you<00:00:03.990> how<00:00:04.049> to

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
today I'm gonna be showing you how to

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.150 
today I'm gonna be showing you how to
make<00:00:04.589> water<00:00:04.890> react<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:06.120> an<00:00:06.240> object<00:00:07.160> for

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
make water react to an object for

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.459 
make water react to an object for
example<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.610> bowl<00:00:08.820> so<00:00:09.330> open<00:00:09.840> up<00:00:09.900> blender<00:00:10.290> and

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
example a bowl so open up blender and

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.330 
example a bowl so open up blender and
delete<00:00:10.920> your<00:00:11.280> default<00:00:11.880> cube<00:00:13.009> going<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.099> front

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
delete your default cube going to front

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.890 
delete your default cube going to front
view<00:00:14.429> pressing<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> one<00:00:15.540> key<00:00:15.830> space<00:00:16.830> add<00:00:17.190> mesh

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
view pressing the one key space add mesh

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.950 
view pressing the one key space add mesh
plane<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.520> we<00:00:20.520> want<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.970> be<00:00:21.210> face<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.840> us

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
plane and we want it to be face on to us

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.960 
plane and we want it to be face on to us
if<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.289> hit<00:00:22.410> our<00:00:22.650> X<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.330> type<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.810> 90<00:00:25.880> there<00:00:26.880> we

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
if we hit our X and type of 90 there we

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.359 
if we hit our X and type of 90 there we
go<00:00:27.150> now<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.260> tap<00:00:28.470> into<00:00:28.619> edit<00:00:28.890> mode<00:00:28.920> we'll<00:00:29.250> be

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
go now if we tap into edit mode we'll be

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.519 
go now if we tap into edit mode we'll be
making<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> bowl<00:00:30.119> first<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.050> select<00:00:31.380> one<00:00:31.410> of

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
making the bowl first so select one of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.310 
making the bowl first so select one of
the<00:00:31.650> vertices<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.399> delete<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.829> grab<00:00:34.829> another

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
the vertices and delete it grab another

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.900 
the vertices and delete it grab another
and<00:00:37.320> we'll<00:00:37.590> make<00:00:37.770> an<00:00:37.920> outline<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.610> bottle

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and we'll make an outline of a bottle

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.479 
and we'll make an outline of a bottle
here<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.379> use<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.680> G<00:00:43.890> key<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.280> move

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
here so you can use the G key to move

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.880 
here so you can use the G key to move
them<00:00:44.670> move<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> vertexes<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:49.260> e<00:00:49.289> key<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
them move the vertexes and the e key to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.619 
them move the vertexes and the e key to
it<00:00:49.980> extrude<00:00:50.520> more<00:00:51.420> vertex<00:00:51.899> s<00:00:53.180> we<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.480> make

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
it extrude more vertex s we have to make

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.849 
it extrude more vertex s we have to make
sure<00:00:54.660> our<00:00:55.129> bowl<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.690> got<00:00:57.690> some<00:00:57.960> thickness<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
sure our bowl is got some thickness to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.760 
sure our bowl is got some thickness to
it<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:58.980> well<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.899> water<00:01:01.079> won't<00:01:01.289> correctly

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
it as well the water won't correctly

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.390 
it as well the water won't correctly
react<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> bowl

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
react to the bowl

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.920 
react to the bowl
also<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:06.090> our<00:01:06.510> last<00:01:07.490> vertex<00:01:08.630> need<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> make

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
also on our last vertex need to make

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.090 
also on our last vertex need to make
sure<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.260> slightly<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> left<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:13.100> this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
sure it's slightly to the left of this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.020 
sure it's slightly to the left of this
bottom<00:01:14.520> one<00:01:14.549> yeah<00:01:16.100> this<00:01:17.100> will<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.400> become

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
bottom one yeah this will be become

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.510 
bottom one yeah this will be become
obvious<00:01:18.360> layer<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:19.830> if<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.130> select<00:01:20.280> this

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
obvious layer so now if we select this

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.480 
obvious layer so now if we select this
bottom<00:01:21.030> middle<00:01:21.690> vertex<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.950> shift<00:01:23.220> s

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
bottom middle vertex and do shift s

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.310 
bottom middle vertex and do shift s
click<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> cursor<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.140> selection<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:27.320> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
click the cursor to selection and a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.910 
click the cursor to selection and a
twice<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.399> select<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.850> whole<00:01:29.970> mesh<00:01:30.149> now<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.259> we

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
twice to select the whole mesh now if we

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280 
twice to select the whole mesh now if we
come<00:01:32.610> down<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.479> we're<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.840> spin

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
come down here and we're going to spin

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.910 
come down here and we're going to spin
our<00:01:34.590> bowl<00:01:34.920> by<00:01:35.600> 360<00:01:36.600> degrees<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:37.380> put<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
our bowl by 360 degrees I put that in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.969 
our bowl by 360 degrees I put that in
the<00:01:38.160> degrees<00:01:38.520> box<00:01:38.789> and<00:01:39.080> it's<00:01:40.080> going<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.289> use<00:01:40.470> 32

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the degrees box and it's going to use 32

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.070 
the degrees box and it's going to use 32
steps<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.460> way<00:01:41.490> around<00:01:41.789> make<00:01:42.659> sure<00:01:42.840> you

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
steps on the way around make sure you

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.649 
steps on the way around make sure you
are<00:01:43.289> in<00:01:43.320> top<00:01:43.740> view<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.960> hit<00:01:45.960> spin<00:01:47.149> great<00:01:48.149> so

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
are in top view and hit spin great so

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.730 
are in top view and hit spin great so
there<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.080> our<00:01:49.319> bowl<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:52.200> does<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> few

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
there is our bowl it does have a few

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.880 
there is our bowl it does have a few
duplicated<00:01:53.630> vertices<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.080> we<00:01:55.229> hit<00:01:55.319> a<00:01:55.530> twice

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
duplicated vertices so if we hit a twice

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.370 
duplicated vertices so if we hit a twice
and<00:01:56.250> come<00:01:57.119> down<00:01:57.300> here<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.630> click<00:01:57.750> Randall's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and come down here and click Randall's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.550 
and come down here and click Randall's
and<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:59.429> removed<00:01:59.789> a<00:02:00.000> few<00:02:01.789> okay<00:02:02.789> so<00:02:03.300> now<00:02:03.560> this

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and it's removed a few okay so now this

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.169 
and it's removed a few okay so now this
is<00:02:04.649> why<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.280> had<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.490> put<00:02:05.819> that<00:02:05.940> vertex

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
is why we had to put that vertex

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.990 
is why we had to put that vertex
slightly<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.929> left<00:02:10.489> because<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.850> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
slightly to the left because in the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.460 
slightly to the left because in the
middle<00:02:12.299> of<00:02:12.390> our<00:02:12.510> bone<00:02:12.720> there<00:02:13.049> is<00:02:13.200> now<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.380> big

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
middle of our bone there is now a big

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.729 
middle of our bone there is now a big
hole<00:02:13.829> so<00:02:14.459> if<00:02:14.519> we<00:02:14.700> press<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.930> unselect<00:02:16.530> our

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
hole so if we press a to unselect our

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.050 
hole so if we press a to unselect our
mesh<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:18.540> be<00:02:18.780> twice<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:20.760> select

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
mesh and it be twice and just select

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.270 
mesh and it be twice and just select
that<00:02:21.120> circle<00:02:21.720> make<00:02:22.680> sure<00:02:22.799> you<00:02:22.890> don't<00:02:23.070> select

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
that circle make sure you don't select

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.940 
that circle make sure you don't select
the<00:02:23.489> bottom<00:02:23.670> vertex<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.510> put<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.530> limit<00:02:25.829> up

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
the bottom vertex and put the limit up

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.360 
the bottom vertex and put the limit up
on<00:02:26.250> Ram<00:02:26.640> doubles<00:02:26.970> only<00:02:27.329> if<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.290> wants

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.309 

okay<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.430> now<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:34.269> have<00:02:34.299> one<00:02:34.659> vertex<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.260> the

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
okay so now we have one vertex in the

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.780 
okay so now we have one vertex in the
middle<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.620> one<00:02:35.739> at<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:35.920> bomb<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.609> it's

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
middle and one at the bomb so it's

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.660 
middle and one at the bomb so it's
perfect<00:02:37.209> tab<00:02:37.959> out<00:02:38.109> of<00:02:38.140> edit<00:02:38.349> mode<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.769> we<00:02:39.459> can

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
perfect tab out of edit mode and we can

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.910 
perfect tab out of edit mode and we can
add<00:02:39.849> a<00:02:39.930> subsurf<00:02:40.930> modifier<00:02:40.959> just<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.680> make<00:02:41.799> a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
add a subsurf modifier just to make a

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.520 
add a subsurf modifier just to make a
bold<00:02:42.129> look<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.310> bit<00:02:42.430> smoother<00:02:42.790> go<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.840> camera

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
bold look a bit smoother go to camera

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.920 
bold look a bit smoother go to camera
view<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.909> if<00:02:45.909> we<00:02:46.150> scale<00:02:46.810> our<00:02:48.150> bowl<00:02:49.150> down<00:02:49.390> and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
view and if we scale our bowl down and

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.619 
view and if we scale our bowl down and
position<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.409> bit<00:02:50.560> better<00:02:50.739> for<00:02:51.069> us<00:02:51.450> right<00:02:52.450> so

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
position a bit better for us right so

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.990 
position a bit better for us right so
that<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.840> our<00:02:52.989> bowl<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:54.400> can<00:02:54.489> also<00:02:54.640> set<00:02:54.970> it

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
that is our bowl you can also set it

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.129 
that is our bowl you can also set it
smooth<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.450> make<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:55.989> little<00:02:56.109> bit<00:02:56.319> uh<00:02:58.139> sadly

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
smooth to make it a little bit uh sadly

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.140 
smooth to make it a little bit uh sadly
we<00:02:59.349> have<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.530> strange<00:02:59.889> ring<00:03:00.129> there<00:03:00.310> but<00:03:00.819> if<00:03:01.000> we

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
we have a strange ring there but if we

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.020 
we have a strange ring there but if we
tab<00:03:01.389> into<00:03:01.420> edit<00:03:01.840> mode<00:03:01.870> select<00:03:02.590> all<00:03:02.920> control<00:03:03.849> N

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
tab into edit mode select all control N

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.670 
tab into edit mode select all control N
and<00:03:04.239> it<00:03:04.329> will<00:03:04.420> recalculate<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.170> norm<00:03:05.379> was<00:03:05.530> for

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
and it will recalculate the norm was for

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.369 
and it will recalculate the norm was for
us<00:03:05.739> which<00:03:05.950> will<00:03:06.040> fix<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.400> problem<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:08.230> go

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
us which will fix that problem so go

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:15.479 
us which will fix that problem so go
into<00:03:08.560> front<00:03:08.799> view<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:11.220> add<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.609> mesh<00:03:13.419> cube<00:03:14.489> not

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
into front view and add a mesh cube not

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.690 
into front view and add a mesh cube not
to<00:03:15.669> probably<00:03:15.939> go<00:03:16.120> into<00:03:16.470> wireframe<00:03:17.470> view<00:03:17.709> and

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
to probably go into wireframe view and

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.300 
to probably go into wireframe view and
what<00:03:19.090> we<00:03:19.180> need<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.419> do<00:03:19.599> is<00:03:20.200> make<00:03:20.560> our<00:03:20.769> cube<00:03:21.099> big

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
what we need to do is make our cube big

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.409 
what we need to do is make our cube big
enough<00:03:21.519> so<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.909> bowl<00:03:22.150> come<00:03:23.049> fit<00:03:23.379> inside<00:03:23.859> it

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
enough so the bowl come fit inside it

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.559 
enough so the bowl come fit inside it
like<00:03:25.419> that<00:03:25.659> that<00:03:25.870> should<00:03:26.049> be<00:03:26.079> fine

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
like that that should be fine

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.220 
like that that should be fine
now<00:03:28.569> we<00:03:28.629> need<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.079> add<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.560> mesh<00:03:30.159> cylinder<00:03:31.230> keep

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
now we need to add a mesh cylinder keep

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.289 
now we need to add a mesh cylinder keep
the<00:03:32.319> default<00:03:32.680> values<00:03:33.069> make<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:33.909> bit<00:03:34.030> smaller

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
the default values make it bit smaller

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.140 
the default values make it bit smaller
if<00:03:34.419> you<00:03:34.569> like<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:36.010> we'll<00:03:36.159> grab<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.819> just

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
if you like and we'll grab it and just

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.869 
if you like and we'll grab it and just
pop<00:03:37.930> up<00:03:38.139> there<00:03:38.349> take<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.069> look<00:03:39.250> from<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.459> top<00:03:39.549> to

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
pop up there take a look from the top to

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.110 
pop up there take a look from the top to
make<00:03:40.000> sure<00:03:40.060> our<00:03:40.510> Bowl<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.760> cylinder<00:03:42.760> are

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
make sure our Bowl and cylinder are

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.259 
make sure our Bowl and cylinder are
inside<00:03:43.690> this<00:03:43.989> cube<00:03:44.430> so<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.459> is<00:03:45.729> fine<00:03:45.970> so<00:03:46.180> that

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
inside this cube so that is fine so that

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.409 
inside this cube so that is fine so that
is<00:03:46.419> our<00:03:46.540> scene<00:03:46.840> setup<00:03:47.260> now<00:03:47.650> completely<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:49.239> now

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
is our scene setup now completely so now

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.289 
is our scene setup now completely so now
if<00:03:49.510> we<00:03:49.599> go<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:49.810> camera<00:03:50.079> view<00:03:50.940> make<00:03:51.940> sure<00:03:52.090> our

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
if we go to camera view make sure our

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.199 
if we go to camera view make sure our
box<00:03:52.720> is<00:03:52.930> selected<00:03:53.370> go<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.579> objects<00:03:54.970> button

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
box is selected go to the objects button

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.189 
box is selected go to the objects button
the<00:03:55.900> physics<00:03:56.319> button<00:03:56.739> click<00:03:57.639> fluid<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.930> make

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199 
the physics button click fluid and make

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.740 
the physics button click fluid and make
that<00:03:59.349> domain<00:03:59.859> you<00:04:00.609> can<00:04:00.849> make<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.180> resolution

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
that domain you can make the resolution

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.300 
that domain you can make the resolution
as<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:01.930> water<00:04:02.229> higher<00:04:02.590> but<00:04:02.949> it<00:04:03.040> will<00:04:03.129> take

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
as the water higher but it will take

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.119 
as the water higher but it will take
longer<00:04:03.639> to<00:04:03.909> bake<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:05.260> it's<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.560> toss-up<00:04:05.889> between

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
longer to bake so it's a toss-up between

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.500 
longer to bake so it's a toss-up between
those<00:04:06.639> two<00:04:06.879> really<00:04:07.590> now<00:04:08.590> we<00:04:08.650> want<00:04:08.949> to<00:04:09.250> make<00:04:10.239> an

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
those two really now we want to make an

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.689 
those two really now we want to make an
inflow<00:04:11.079> of<00:04:11.109> water<00:04:11.229> so<00:04:11.769> select<00:04:12.099> our<00:04:12.220> cylinder

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
inflow of water so select our cylinder

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:20.009 
inflow of water so select our cylinder
click<00:04:13.510> fluid<00:04:13.979> click<00:04:14.979> inflow<00:04:15.669> and<00:04:18.720> we'll<00:04:19.720> just

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
click fluid click inflow and we'll just

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.850 
click fluid click inflow and we'll just
put<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:20.769> bit<00:04:20.919> of<00:04:20.979> gravity<00:04:21.579> on<00:04:21.699> there<00:04:22.409> now<00:04:23.409> select

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
put a bit of gravity on there now select

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.790 
put a bit of gravity on there now select
our<00:04:24.010> bowl<00:04:24.340> click<00:04:25.240> fluid<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:26.349> this<00:04:26.500> will<00:04:26.650> be<00:04:26.710> an

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
our bowl click fluid and this will be an

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.560 
our bowl click fluid and this will be an
obstacle<00:04:26.949> for<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.580> water<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:28.030> react<00:04:28.300> to

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
obstacle for the water to react to

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.610 
obstacle for the water to react to
so<00:04:29.080> click<00:04:29.380> shell<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:30.130> that<00:04:30.479> is<00:04:31.479> ready<00:04:32.199> to<00:04:32.409> bake

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
so click shell and that is ready to bake

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.519 
so click shell and that is ready to bake
so<00:04:33.099> if<00:04:33.159> we<00:04:33.280> click<00:04:33.400> our<00:04:33.610> domain

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:36.529 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.090 

to<00:04:36.769> bake

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.720 

we<00:04:41.640> get<00:04:41.880> our<00:04:42.000> water<00:04:42.210> there<00:04:42.660> if<00:04:42.750> we<00:04:42.930> just<00:04:43.730> wait

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
we get our water there if we just wait

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.820 
we get our water there if we just wait
for<00:04:44.760> it<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.120> finish<00:04:45.240> baking<00:04:48.230> okay<00:04:49.230> so<00:04:49.290> now<00:04:49.620> our

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
for it to finish baking okay so now our

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.400 
for it to finish baking okay so now our
water<00:04:50.010> is<00:04:50.310> finished<00:04:50.670> baking<00:04:50.850> we<00:04:51.810> can<00:04:52.020> delete

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410

looks quite blocky water so we can

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.680 
looks quite blocky water so we can
subsurf<00:05:13.050> it<00:05:13.320> by<00:05:13.890> going<00:05:14.100> into<00:05:14.250> edit<00:05:14.460> mode<00:05:14.690> add
