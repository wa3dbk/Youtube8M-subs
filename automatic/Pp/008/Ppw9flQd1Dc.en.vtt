can<00:03:14.390> actually<00:03:14.540> make<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:15.020> feel<00:03:15.320> little<00:03:16.090> warmer

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
can actually make it feel little warmer

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.210 
can actually make it feel little warmer
looking<00:03:17.480> with<00:03:17.690> giving<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.050> an<00:03:18.170> orange<00:03:18.530> hue<00:03:19.040> if

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
looking with giving it an orange hue if

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.160 
looking with giving it an orange hue if
you<00:03:19.370> can<00:03:19.489> see<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:19.730> we<00:03:20.600> can<00:03:20.720> bring<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.989> down

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
you can see that we can bring it down

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.900 
you can see that we can bring it down
and<00:03:21.380> give<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.620> more<00:03:21.770> of<00:03:21.830> a<00:03:21.950> blue<00:03:22.220> colder

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
and give it more of a blue colder

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.449 
and give it more of a blue colder
temperature<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:24.590> know<00:03:24.709> take<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.070> warmth<00:03:25.370> the

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
temperature you know take the warmth the

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.280 
temperature you know take the warmth the
way<00:03:25.580> from<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.940> image<00:03:26.239> put<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.720> up<00:03:26.870> make<00:03:27.260> it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
way from the image put it up make it

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.250 
way from the image put it up make it
look<00:03:27.410> really<00:03:27.800> summery

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
look really summery

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.110 
look really summery
lower<00:03:29.439> the<00:03:29.650> saturation<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:30.519> black<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:30.939> white

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
lower the saturation to black and white

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.940 
lower the saturation to black and white
if<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.390> like<00:03:31.629> and<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.409> can<00:03:32.530> see<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.709> little

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
if you like and you can see the little

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.920 
if you like and you can see the little
temperature<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:33.670> obviously<00:03:34.090> changed<00:03:34.599> you

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
temperature is obviously changed you

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.929 
temperature is obviously changed you
could<00:03:35.079> up<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.319> saturation<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.430> lot<00:03:36.610> more<00:03:36.790> and

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
could up the saturation a lot more and

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.660 
could up the saturation a lot more and
look<00:03:37.090> make<00:03:37.569> an<00:03:37.689> image<00:03:37.810> really<00:03:38.439> rich<00:03:38.670> again

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
look make an image really rich again

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.280 
look make an image really rich again
with<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:39.939> saturation<00:03:40.599> if<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:40.810> want<00:03:40.959> up<00:03:41.140> the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
with the saturation if you want up the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.690 
with the saturation if you want up the
colors<00:03:41.650> of<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.860> image<00:03:42.129> and<00:03:42.280> kind<00:03:42.489> of<00:03:42.519> make<00:03:42.670> it

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
colors of the image and kind of make it

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.610 
colors of the image and kind of make it
pop<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> little<00:03:43.269> more<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:44.049> can<00:03:44.140> just<00:03:44.349> drag<00:03:44.590> your

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
pop a little more you can just drag your

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.740 
pop a little more you can just drag your
saturation<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.640> can<00:03:45.760> see<00:03:45.849> the<00:03:45.970> image<00:03:46.269> really

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
saturation you can see the image really

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.319 
saturation you can see the image really
stands<00:03:47.079> out<00:03:47.290> on<00:03:47.470> tops<00:03:47.909> we<00:03:48.909> can<00:03:49.060> add<00:03:49.150> the

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
stands out on tops we can add the

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.330 
stands out on tops we can add the
highlights<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:49.959> kind<00:03:50.170> of<00:03:50.230> give<00:03:50.379> it<00:03:50.530> white<00:03:51.069> to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
highlights and kind of give it white to

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.830 
highlights and kind of give it white to
make<00:03:51.459> it<00:03:51.640> pop<00:03:51.819> a<00:03:51.849> little<00:03:52.090> more<00:03:52.360> take<00:03:52.629> it<00:03:52.750> away

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
make it pop a little more take it away

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.740 
make it pop a little more take it away
and<00:03:53.110> look<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.769> little<00:03:54.099> more<00:03:54.220> flat<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:55.030> these

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
and look a little more flat and these

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.569 
and look a little more flat and these
shadows<00:03:56.230> here<00:03:56.530> we<00:03:56.739> can<00:03:56.890> kind<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.129> bring<00:03:57.310> them

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
shadows here we can kind of bring them

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.119 
shadows here we can kind of bring them
into<00:03:57.790> focus<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.659> make<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.959> sky<00:03:59.319> really

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
into focus and make that sky really

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.160 
into focus and make that sky really
stand<00:04:00.549> out<00:04:00.760> then<00:04:01.450> from<00:04:01.599> there<00:04:01.840> we're<00:04:01.959> going<00:04:02.079> to

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
stand out then from there we're going to

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.800 
stand out then from there we're going to
use<00:04:02.260> our<00:04:02.379> contrast<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:03.940> really<00:04:04.510> give<00:04:04.659> it<00:04:04.750> a

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
use our contrast and really give it a

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.640 
use our contrast and really give it a
really<00:04:04.989> cool<00:04:05.489> magical<00:04:06.489> look<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.650> we're

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
really cool magical look and we're

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.069 
really cool magical look and we're
straight<00:04:09.040> everything<00:04:09.489> sharpen<00:04:10.150> see<00:04:10.870> if<00:04:10.959> the

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
straight everything sharpen see if the

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.710 
straight everything sharpen see if the
vignette<00:04:11.440> actually<00:04:12.010> adds<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.489> it<00:04:12.639> I<00:04:12.909> think<00:04:13.569> is

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
vignette actually adds to it I think is

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.319 
vignette actually adds to it I think is
it<00:04:13.870> a<00:04:13.930> nice<00:04:14.109> dark<00:04:14.500> feel<00:04:15.370> all<00:04:15.609> around<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.150> so

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
it a nice dark feel all around it so

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.610 
it a nice dark feel all around it so
that's<00:04:16.510> just<00:04:16.630> playing<00:04:17.079> with<00:04:17.229> some<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.590> I

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
that's just playing with some of the I

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.460 
that's just playing with some of the I
felt<00:04:17.889> the<00:04:18.250> effects<00:04:18.910> here<00:04:19.090> on<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.389> presets<00:04:19.900> you

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
felt the effects here on the presets you

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.990 
felt the effects here on the presets you
could<00:04:20.590> also<00:04:20.739> go<00:04:20.949> back<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.310> your<00:04:21.400> filters<00:04:21.820> and

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
could also go back to your filters and

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.610 
could also go back to your filters and
change<00:04:22.240> them<00:04:22.479> at<00:04:22.600> any<00:04:22.750> time<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.260> it's<00:04:23.380> not

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
change them at any time and it's not

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.010 
change them at any time and it's not
going<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.919> affect<00:04:24.449> the<00:04:25.449> settings<00:04:25.810> that<00:04:25.990> you

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
going to affect the settings that you

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.439 
going to affect the settings that you
did<00:04:26.289> into<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.710> image<00:04:26.919> here<00:04:27.400> see<00:04:28.150> that<00:04:28.330> they

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
did into the image here see that they

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.930 
did into the image here see that they
still<00:04:28.750> look<00:04:28.930> great<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:30.130> don't<00:04:30.340> anything

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
still look great and I don't anything

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.879 
still look great and I don't anything
that<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.270> use<00:04:31.810> you'll<00:04:32.260> see<00:04:32.410> this<00:04:32.530> gray<00:04:32.860> line

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
that you use you'll see this gray line

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.310 
that you use you'll see this gray line
on<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.430> bottom<00:04:33.550> here<00:04:34.050> anything<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.199> is

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
on the bottom here anything that is

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.040 
on the bottom here anything that is
turned<00:04:35.620> on<00:04:35.830> will<00:04:36.760> be<00:04:36.940> selected<00:04:37.539> down<00:04:37.690> here<00:04:37.900> so

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
turned on will be selected down here so

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.510 
turned on will be selected down here so
you<00:04:38.139> can<00:04:38.260> either<00:04:38.380> turn<00:04:38.650> them<00:04:38.800> on<00:04:38.979> or<00:04:39.039> off<00:04:39.310> if

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
you can either turn them on or off if

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.339 
you can either turn them on or off if
you<00:04:39.669> want<00:04:39.820> again<00:04:40.570> you<00:04:40.690> can<00:04:40.720> go<00:04:40.930> through<00:04:41.169> here

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
you want again you can go through here

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.080 
you want again you can go through here
and<00:04:41.440> use<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.620> little<00:04:42.039> pop<00:04:42.250> filter<00:04:42.729> section

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
and use that little pop filter section

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.510 
and use that little pop filter section
that<00:04:43.479> does<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.810> automatic<00:04:44.349> thing<00:04:45.130> that<00:04:45.310> makes

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
that does the automatic thing that makes

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.430 
that does the automatic thing that makes
images<00:04:46.000> stand<00:04:46.360> out<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.750> look<00:04:46.900> pretty<00:04:47.110> magical

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
images stand out and look pretty magical

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.629 
images stand out and look pretty magical
so<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.789> just<00:04:48.820> tap<00:04:49.180> share<00:04:49.510> next<00:04:50.349> and<00:04:50.830> post<00:04:51.520> it

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
so you just tap share next and post it

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.950
