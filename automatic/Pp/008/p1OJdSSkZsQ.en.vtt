 Hello KusaTaro 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:12.120
 I bought a new Panasonic product hxi min a 500 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:18.920
 This is the body 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.920
 This camera is very easy to use, with a large button 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.440
 The leftmost button is the power button and the middle one is the record button 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.920
 This button is a joystick and you can make various settings here 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.239
 Accessories are a holder for putting the body, a head mount and a cord for charging 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.239
 Let's actually attach 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.450
 The set of is very easy 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.390
 Put the body in a folder 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.390
 Attach to arm 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.040
 It is really good and good fit 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.570
 For example it looks like this when I actually put 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:24.100
 Please note in advance that there is no connection with the towel . 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.100
 Even if you shake it, it doesn't shift at all. 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:33.390
 You can adjust the size at the rain channel at 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.390
 I can lock firmly with this 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.909
 I actually mounted the head mount and tried to run by bicycle 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.000
 Wow 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.460
 I also took a scene of making a fishing tackle 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.960
 Hmm 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.090
