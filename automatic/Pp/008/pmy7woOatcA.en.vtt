I look back over there so right now I'm
kind<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.520> definitely<00:01:27.390> UAV<00:01:28.140> oh<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.770> actually<00:01:29.040> did

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
kind of definitely UAV oh I actually did

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.590 
kind of definitely UAV oh I actually did
one<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:31.110> UAV<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.560> probably<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> best

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
one the UAV is probably one of the best

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.030 
one the UAV is probably one of the best
kill<00:01:33.600> streaks<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:34.229> until<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.650> guess<00:01:34.860> it's

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
kill streaks or until I guess it's

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.280 
kill streaks or until I guess it's
called<00:01:35.329> but<00:01:36.329> never<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> mortar<00:01:36.990> strike

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
called but never use a mortar strike

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.539 
called but never use a mortar strike
unless<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.740> think<00:01:37.890> you're<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.340> two

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
unless you think you're going to get two

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.560

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
or more kills with it because you get a

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.469 
or more kills with it because you get a
lot<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.750> points<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.200> UAV<00:01:43.530> anyway<00:01:44.270> I'm<00:01:45.270> so

and then I get my next kill streak which

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.490 
and then I get my next kill streak which
is<00:03:07.579> an<00:03:07.669> airstrike<00:03:08.209> calling<00:03:09.079> it<00:03:09.169> over<00:03:09.349> there

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
is an airstrike calling it over there

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.740 
is an airstrike calling it over there
because<00:03:09.620> that's<00:03:09.769> where<00:03:09.859> they<00:03:10.010> spawn<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.750> I

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
because that's where they spawn and I

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.170 
because that's where they spawn and I
think<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:12.019> killer<00:03:12.260> entire<00:03:12.500> team<00:03:12.739> one<00:03:13.489> two<00:03:13.760> three

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
think a killer entire team one two three

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.929 
think a killer entire team one two three
four<00:03:14.569> five<00:03:14.629> six<00:03:15.349> seven<00:03:15.769> seven<00:03:16.549> kills<00:03:16.849> with

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
four five six seven seven kills with

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.250 
four five six seven seven kills with
that<00:03:17.090> then<00:03:17.269> I<00:03:17.329> get<00:03:17.449> the<00:03:17.510> cruise<00:03:17.690> missile<00:03:18.079> I

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
that then I get the cruise missile I

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.960 
that then I get the cruise missile I
actually<00:03:18.769> kill<00:03:19.069> myself<00:03:19.250> with<00:03:19.519> this<00:03:19.609> because

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
actually kill myself with this because

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.119 
actually kill myself with this because
it's<00:03:20.239> like<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:21.109> kills<00:03:21.319> everything<00:03:21.680> on<00:03:21.919> the<00:03:21.979> map

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
it's like it kills everything on the map

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.330 
it's like it kills everything on the map
basically<00:03:23.079> that<00:03:24.079> thing<00:03:24.260> is<00:03:24.409> freaking<00:03:25.099> huge

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
basically that thing is freaking huge

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.399 
basically that thing is freaking huge
but<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.120> don't<00:03:26.329> really<00:03:26.419> care<00:03:26.599> that<00:03:26.659> I<00:03:26.840> died<00:03:27.049> kids

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
but I don't really care that I died kids

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.710 
but I don't really care that I died kids
hey<00:03:28.299> whatever<00:03:29.299> um<00:03:30.169> I<00:03:31.099> think<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.299> has<00:03:32.419> like<00:03:32.689> a

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
hey whatever um I think it has like a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.119 
hey whatever um I think it has like a
40-metre<00:03:33.709> blast<00:03:34.099> radius<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:35.180> that<00:03:35.419> a<00:03:35.629> lot<00:03:36.129> i'm

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
40-metre blast radius is that a lot i'm

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.300 
40-metre blast radius is that a lot i'm
not<00:03:37.310> sure<00:03:37.489> but<00:03:38.199> basically<00:03:39.199> that's<00:03:39.889> that's

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
not sure but basically that's that's

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.860
