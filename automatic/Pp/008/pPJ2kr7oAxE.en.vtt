00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
we are going to look at the flash and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.150 
we are going to look at the flash and
how<00:00:10.160> he<00:00:10.219> attacks<00:00:10.880> in<00:00:11.210> this<00:00:11.420> game<00:00:11.980> so<00:00:12.980> the

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
how he attacks in this game so the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.270 
how he attacks in this game so the
flashes<00:00:13.730> are<00:00:13.969> probably<00:00:14.629> one<00:00:14.900> of<00:00:14.929> the<00:00:15.440> most

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.280 
flashes are probably one of the most

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.660 
flashes are probably one of the most
sought-after<00:00:16.640> characters<00:00:17.510> or<00:00:18.100> card<00:00:19.100> when<00:00:19.490> you

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
sought-after characters or card when you

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.120 
sought-after characters or card when you
first<00:00:19.970> begin<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:20.690> game<00:00:20.720> because<00:00:21.230> you're<00:00:21.950> just

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
first begin the game because you're just

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.150 
first begin the game because you're just
running<00:00:22.340> into<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:22.820> flash<00:00:23.090> almost<00:00:23.720> in<00:00:24.230> in

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
running into the flash almost in in

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.920 
running into the flash almost in in
every<00:00:25.760> battle<00:00:27.220> so<00:00:28.300> actually<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.480> flash<00:00:29.720> is

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
every battle so actually the flash is

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.130 
every battle so actually the flash is
quite<00:00:30.140> weak<00:00:30.530> um<00:00:30.860> when<00:00:31.670> you<00:00:31.760> get<00:00:31.940> far<00:00:32.450> into<00:00:32.930> game

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
quite weak um when you get far into game

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.279 
quite weak um when you get far into game
but<00:00:33.789> he's<00:00:34.789> quite<00:00:35.120> a<00:00:35.149> useful<00:00:35.510> character<00:00:36.140> at<00:00:36.260> the

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
but he's quite a useful character at the

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:37.990 
but he's quite a useful character at the
beginning<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.039> we're<00:00:37.219> going<00:00:37.339> to<00:00:37.429> look<00:00:37.550> at<00:00:37.730> his

well<00:00:52.819> actually<00:00:53.109> so<00:00:54.109> the<00:00:54.230> enemy<00:00:54.379> is<00:00:54.649> doing<00:00:54.980> it

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
well actually so the enemy is doing it

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.829 
well actually so the enemy is doing it
but<00:00:55.280> I'm<00:00:55.460> going<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.789> do<00:00:55.969> it<00:00:56.089> to<00:00:56.239> this<00:00:56.510> is<00:00:56.690> the

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
but I'm going to do it to this is the

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.020 
but I'm going to do it to this is the
lightning<00:00:57.319> kick<00:00:58.809> what's<00:00:59.809> in<00:01:00.019> this<00:01:00.170> quick<00:01:01.030> so

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
lightning kick what's in this quick so

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.450 
lightning kick what's in this quick so
if<00:01:02.120> you<00:01:02.329> listen<00:01:02.870> or<00:01:03.079> watch<00:01:03.159> Justice<00:01:04.159> League

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
if you listen or watch Justice League

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.630 
if you listen or watch Justice League
you'll<00:01:05.269> notice<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:06.190> they<00:01:07.190> don't<00:01:07.370> have<00:01:07.400> the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
you'll notice that they don't have the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
you'll notice that they don't have the
same<00:01:07.820> voice<00:01:12.610> so<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.850> flash<00:01:14.120> is<00:01:14.300> a<00:01:14.330> really

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
same voice so the flash is a really

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.190 
same voice so the flash is a really
quick<00:01:14.900> puncher<00:01:15.350> if<00:01:15.470> you<00:01:15.650> play<00:01:16.310> with<00:01:16.850> him

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
quick puncher if you play with him

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.540 
quick puncher if you play with him
you'll<00:01:18.200> notice<00:01:18.500> that<00:01:18.530> his<00:01:18.800> punches<00:01:19.250> are<00:01:19.370> much

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
you'll notice that his punches are much

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.330 
you'll notice that his punches are much
quicker<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.150> this<00:01:20.900> is<00:01:21.080> his<00:01:21.260> second<00:01:21.830> which<00:01:22.310> is

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
quicker and this is his second which is

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.460 
quicker and this is his second which is
sonic<00:01:22.970> punch<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:23.540> think<00:01:23.780> or<00:01:23.960> psionic<00:01:24.500> pound<00:01:25.240> and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
sonic punch I think or psionic pound and

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.320 
sonic punch I think or psionic pound and
he<00:01:27.470> does<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.680> continuation<00:01:28.580> attack<00:01:28.850> okay<00:01:29.480> so<00:01:30.290> he

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
he does a continuation attack okay so he

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330 
he does a continuation attack okay so he
he<00:01:32.330> does<00:01:32.540> three<00:01:32.930> punches<00:01:33.470> for<00:01:33.770> his<00:01:33.950> second

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
he does three punches for his second

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.980 
he does three punches for his second
attack<00:01:34.670> I<00:01:34.880> think<00:01:36.550> so<00:01:37.550> we're<00:01:37.700> gonna<00:01:37.850> go<00:01:38.330> back<00:01:38.600> in

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
attack I think so we're gonna go back in

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:46.470 
attack I think so we're gonna go back in
so<00:01:39.320> we<00:01:39.470> can<00:01:39.500> see<00:01:39.800> if<00:01:39.920> hit<00:01:40.100> his<00:01:40.370> last<00:01:40.700> attack

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.290 

I<00:01:46.600> wasn't<00:01:47.230> expecting<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.640> flash<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:49.120> have

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
I wasn't expecting the flash to have

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.890 
I wasn't expecting the flash to have
like<00:01:49.510> three<00:01:50.170> attacks<00:01:50.560> after<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:51.510> first<00:01:52.510> one<00:01:52.720> I

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
like three attacks after the first one I

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.560 
like three attacks after the first one I
think<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.760> thought<00:01:54.760> it<00:01:54.880> was<00:01:54.970> just<00:01:55.210> going<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.480> be

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
think I thought it was just going to be

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.370 
think I thought it was just going to be
a<00:01:55.600> single<00:01:56.290> attack<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:57.840> haven't<00:01:58.840> seen<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.350> last

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380
