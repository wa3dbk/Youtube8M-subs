 atomium welcome to indymac in this 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.639
 new indie review today we 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.639
 let's talk about titanium souls 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:36.180
 available on playstation 4 ps vita and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.370
 pc titanium souls is an action game 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.379
 adventure without context and his art to sion 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.969
 who puts everything on his mood and on his 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.350
 vision of boss fights 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.030
 after a prototype winning the game 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.610
 jam the stop dome lot 28 there are two 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.989
 years the game from to 6.9 has changed well and we 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.339
 find it today in a grind 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.339
 far more ambitious than before 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.800
 titanium souls adventure is constituted 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.300
 a little less than twenty 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.650
 Titan battles spread over a 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.510
 large map divided into several areas 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.100
 characteristics we find the 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.200
 traditional forest volcano and others 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.060
 snowy mountains comprising at each 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.340
 times a central checkpoint and a number 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.780
 defined boss to face the principle 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.400
 of the game is pretty simple our hero did 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.930
 that an arrow in his possession and he does 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.520
 it will take a single shot well placed 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.260
 to overcome his opponents 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.820
 so you have to understand the pattern of 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.010
 shakti time identify his weak point 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.690
 visible on the screen in pink and finally 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.580
 succeed in bringing him the fatal blow but 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.710
 attention the slightest damage taken by 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.180
 our character will end his life on 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.630
 thus bringing back to the last checkpoint 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.630
 valid 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.190
 we're not going to lie to each other at it and souls is 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.110
 a game of rage understand by that he 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.640
 is difficult sometimes unfair but 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.960
 especially since he asks for a crazy patience 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.700
 not to let go of the joystick after 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.170
 dozens deaths on a very boss 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.610
 resistant which will take less time to 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.119
 to kill you that you need it for the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.950
 rejoin 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.050
 because yes every death asks you 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.060
 to redo the whole trip from the checkpoint 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.140
 up to the titan room what can 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.790
 clearly annoyed 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.350
 by the way moving side where shadow 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.180
 of the colossus given some clues 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.740
 as to the position of the titanium colossi 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.610
 souls lets us explore and find 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.259
 the few secret passages 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.190
 necessary for the advancement of the game by 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.870
 our own means 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.330
 we can congratulate ourselves for not 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.860
 to be too held by the hand but in the end 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.450
 we sometimes find ourselves a little lost for 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.650
 nothing and the lack of teleport system 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.160
 between the areas makes it all a bit 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.160
 laborious 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.830
 m 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.519
 despite these bad times and this 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.170
 Oddly fix dose and titanium 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.359
 souls is a good game beyond his 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.159
 excellent soundtrack sound salute the 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.659
 very good work done on the bumps 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.769
 as well from a visual point of view as 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.420
 in the design of their pattern 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.859
 every fight is unique and some 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.209
 clashes are memorable with 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.560
 very good ideas that I'm going 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.420
 voluntarily do not spoil yourself 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.439
 on the other hand, once the adventure is completed 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.879
 we realize that the experience 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.739
 proposed style developers 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.810
 nervous is more of die and retry than 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.400
 of the lyric epic and even though the universe 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.689
 to something quite charming 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.760
 way shadow of the colossus 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.500
 we will spend more time repeating his 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.750
 actions to refine his reactions 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.579
 face bosses to contemplate the fon and 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.379
 architecture surrounding us titanium 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.000
 souls sweat class and he wants to 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.949
 generous in its content with particular 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.239
 several modes of new game + but this 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.980
 is clearly not a game to put 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.480
 in all hands this being and 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.620
 will be perfect for players 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.069
 more patients who are in need of 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.069
 challenge
