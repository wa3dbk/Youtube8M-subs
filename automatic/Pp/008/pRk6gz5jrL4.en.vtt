00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
one side core is you can see that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.760 
one side core is you can see that
actually<00:01:00.420> has<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> handle<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.260> back<00:01:01.469> but

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
it off but that goes like that so you

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.510
