00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.740
 Buu 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.990
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.059
 It has been 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:23.400
 Hello plumbing third time is the video 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:27.039
 This time drainage drainage equipment and drainage treatment 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:32.920
 I would like to introduce drainage reuse 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:37.030
 As drainage drainage system is place coming out well by examination of architect, we watch this video by all means 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.180
 Or I would like you to study while listening 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:47.680
 Let's start the third 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:50.110
 Water and waste water from sanitary appliances on each floor of the building passes through drainage while passing through the pipe space 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:56.590
 It flows to the drainage stack pipe 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:01:00.170
 And we will continue to flow into the sewage through the straight down the passed in the water next to subjectivity in the ground 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:06.200
 This is the basic route of drainage but it is cheaper 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:13.490
 Several devices have been applied to ensure that water and gray water are drained before 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:19.700
 Water and miscellaneous wastewater from the a floor of the ground floor are not directly drained into the drainage pipe but in the underground pit. 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.159
 As a result it has a form to be discharged by pumping in drainage pump from in order to drain tank 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.179
 Joker 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.440
 Avoiding the danger that one of the sanitary appliances' feng shui jumps out as a result of the fall of an angry filthy waste water 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:34.890
 I am 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:40.680
 Let's also introduce the drainage tank that came out in the previous introduction 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:46.560
 Yes that is used to hold street sewage gray water tank name is drainage tank 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:50.960
 Also , to prevent water from remaining on the bottom for cleaning and inspection 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:57.950
 We have a slope of 1/15 to 1/10 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.450
 The drainage pump is operated alternately with the spare pump and the remaining water 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.820
 Because of the anti-corruption 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:08.820
 The timer has been designed to automatically drain every two hours a day . 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:14.220
 Water resistant horizontal branch pipe drainage stand pipe 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:22.020
 It is necessary to set up two periods to keep the inside of the drainage layer at atmospheric pressure . 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:23.760
 Around plumbing fixtures has dressed two aircraft system and loop 2 aircraft system, but in Japan the most upstream plumbing fixtures 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.810
 From the immediate downstream of 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.920
 It is common to take loop 2 period 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.569
 It has become 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:38.450
 Suzhou aircraft contains harmful substances and sights contained in large water 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:43.910
 The substance should be prevented from flowing to separate collection is here to flow the rest 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.470
 Generally there is a trap function, but for those without trap function downstream 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.910
 It provided a trap 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.420
 There are also several types of traps 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.950
 Let's introduce it 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.950
 Grease interceptor is used to remove fats and oils contained in kitchen wiring 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.330
 A device that separates and collects moisture 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:09.840
 It will be used, such as in a store which operates mainly food and drink industry 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:11.410
 An oil interceptor is a device that floats and collects gasoline oil in the interceptor . 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.640
 Mainly kakarin stand 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:20.370
 Used for 8 car repair shop 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:25.350
 + Tani cycle is to precipitate insoluble matter such as gypsum and precious metals 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:31.890
 Equipment to collect, mainly used in dental clinics and surgeons' clinics 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:34.630
 Hair interceptor device is a device for collecting the hair and insoluble substances in the screen mesh 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.260
 Mainly used for hairdressers and barbers 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:44.410
 Besides these sand shields 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:52.540
 There is such as glass shards inhibitory collection instrument books indoor Suzhou machine 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:55.330
 Mass flow in such that it requires the confluence and purchase of piping Oiteo water or gray water to the outdoor ground 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:03.880
 To make sure that 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:04.400
 Drainage waste is mainly in the middle of drainage pipes that are buried in the ground for inspection and cleaning in the outdoor ground, and a water resistant building 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:11.180
 Confluence of 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:13.780
 Mud that is mixed with rainwater flows into the piping. 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.109
 I 'm working on it 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:21.160
 Sewage drainage as kind of drainage 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.800
 Masuo water there is rain water has been flowing from large and small toilet 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:29.310
 Tell about drainage 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:32.760
 Wastewater says that the waste water flowing from such as kitchen bathroom washbasin 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.360
 There are two types of drainage methods: combined and separated. 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:42.390
 It is classified as you see 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:49.440
 In the building, the case of using water and general drainage separately is called diversion type. 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:57.870
 In addition , even if it is combined in the building, rainwater must be a separate system 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:58.440
 In contrast offsite public sewerage and split type that separate system sewage wastewater and rainwater 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.139
 reading 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:06.530
 It is called the alternating current that is merged all 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.889
 Drainage is the primary treatment with either Yaro Chinren 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:16.729
 Secondary treatment to treat organic matter in biological science 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:23.129
 Furthermore , through tertiary treatment to remove the chest compounds and phosphorus compounds that are the cause of eutrophication 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:26.129
 The biological treatment method that is secondary treatment is a day of activity in oxygen 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:32.190
 Aerobic processing methods that use organisms 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:40.050
 Anaerobic treatment method using bacteria active in the direction is used 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:45.210
 The septic tank and purification to no public sewer area to Oite given water quality discharged into moisture for the public 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:52.180
 It also refers to the tank for purification treatment to purify it to the level it can 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:56.810
 In the septic tank, a single treatment method of treating only the water in the water closet and water and waste water together 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:06:01.880
 There are two types of merger processing method to process 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:05.480
 Rainwater is Shusui by Rufudoren in the roof surface of the building 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:10.070
 However, the early rainfall is somewhat favorable 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:16.800
 It is often excluded considering the influence of dirt on the roof surface 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:21.900
 Remarkable to chores Mizuki add run after after Shusui is that has been disinfected through the so settling tank rainwater tide 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:28.860
 Reuse of drainage outside the building will be done well 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:31.949
 Attenuation of drainage reuse is also used for toilet wash water besides washroom and kitchen drainage 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:36.790
 However, there are things that must be taken care of 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:40.270
 Re-use of toilet cleaning water can be used only in the toilet battlefield 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:43.750
 In addition, in these busy buildings 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:50.230
 Clarifying that it is not suitable for beverages or 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:53.260
 It is necessary to devise to change the color of piping to prevent cross connection 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:57.070
 As index of thing performing evaluation of water quality 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:01.050
 There is thing to see This time beauty day in it 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:05.310
 I would like to introduce ss in the specification 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:12.330
 bod is good with biochemical oxygen demand rim 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:13.560
 The amount of oxygen needed when microorganisms in water biodegrade organic matter in water 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:20.780
 Represents 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:24.200
 The larger the value, the more dirty it is and is mainly used in freshwater areas such as rivers 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:29.660
 cod is good with chemical oxygen demand 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:37.730
 It represents the amount of oxygen required to participate in the 100-degree water of organic matter 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:40.770
 It is mainly used to evaluate the water quality of the ocean and lakes ss sounds of suspended solids and turbidity of good water 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:43.770
 It is floating in water by index to express 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:47.639
 It represents the amount of substance 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:50.639
 More drainage aeration and drainage treatment 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:56.639
 Was introduced followed in wastewater reuse 

00:07:50.639 --> 00:08:03.319
 As I said at the beginning, it often appears in drainage and architect tests, so your study 

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:03.319
 Help Thank you I hope you watch do it even a little beneath 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.090
 ni
