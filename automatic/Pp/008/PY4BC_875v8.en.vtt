00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
regeneration bed now if you do this on a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.599 
regeneration bed now if you do this on a
right-click<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:22.770> instantly<00:01:23.369> get

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609

regeneration for about 4 minutes in like

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.109 
regeneration for about 4 minutes in like
10<00:01:27.479> seconds<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:29.430> way<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.609> craft<00:01:29.820> one<00:01:30.030> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
10 seconds the way you craft one of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.270 
10 seconds the way you craft one of
these<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.570> simply<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.560> some<00:01:31.710> block<00:01:31.920> ago

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
these is simply with some block ago

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.459 
these is simply with some block ago
which<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> little<00:01:33.270> expensive<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:34.049> gives

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
which is a little expensive but gives

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:35.840 
which is a little expensive but gives
you<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> purpose<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.219> gold<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
you a purpose for that gold that you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.300 
you a purpose for that gold that you
probably<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.299> piling<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:36.929> somewhere<00:01:37.310> -

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
probably have piling up somewhere -

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.029 
probably have piling up somewhere -
yellow<00:01:38.609> wool<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.179> one<00:01:39.450> red<00:01:39.990> wool<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.829> that's

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
yellow wool and one red wool and that's

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.099 
yellow wool and one red wool and that's
how<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> craft<00:01:41.609> regeneration<00:01:42.420> bed<00:01:42.810> which

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
how you craft regeneration bed which

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.130 
how you craft regeneration bed which
just<00:01:43.649> boom<00:01:43.979> um<00:01:44.990> next<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.799> last<00:01:47.100> three<00:01:47.609> um

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
just boom um next up the last three um

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.279 
just boom um next up the last three um
have<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> chance<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:50.039> blowing<00:01:50.249> up<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.600> copied

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
have a chance of blowing up so I copied

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.050 
have a chance of blowing up so I copied
up<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> world<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.149> put<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.780> know<00:01:54.929> um

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
up the world and put it in you know um

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.389 
up the world and put it in you know um
basically<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.270> copy<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.020> um<00:01:58.229> yeah<00:01:58.499> this<00:01:58.979> next

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
basically a copy so um yeah this next

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.980 
basically a copy so um yeah this next
one<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.820> nether<00:01:59.999> bed<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.869> has<00:02:00.960> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
one is the nether bed and it has a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.209 
one is the nether bed and it has a
hundred<00:02:01.469> percent<00:02:01.560> chance<00:02:02.039> of<00:02:02.249> exploding<00:02:02.939> so

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
hundred percent chance of exploding so

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.789 
hundred percent chance of exploding so
this<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.429> really<00:02:05.729> pointless<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.299> craft<00:02:06.569> um<00:02:07.079> but

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
this is really pointless to craft um but

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.590 
this is really pointless to craft um but
hey<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.069> mean<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.789> control<00:02:09.300> people<00:02:09.450> with

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
hey you mean can you control people with

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.070 
hey you mean can you control people with
it<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.869> guess

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
it I guess

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.800 
it I guess
so<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.740> can<00:02:11.069> get<00:02:11.250> three<00:02:11.850> another<00:02:12.030> bricks<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
so you can get three another bricks to

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.290 
so you can get three another bricks to
another<00:02:13.110> rack<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.650> once<00:02:14.220> also<00:02:14.490> not<00:02:15.270> very

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
another rack and once also not very

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.390 
another rack and once also not very
expensive<00:02:15.720> just<00:02:16.350> need<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.770> get<00:02:17.040> three

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
expensive just need to get three

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.090 
expensive just need to get three
diamonds<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.940> go<00:02:18.060> down<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.569> nether<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.020> uh

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
diamonds to go down to the nether and uh

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.710 
diamonds to go down to the nether and uh
oh<00:02:20.100> just<00:02:20.850> like<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.360> got<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.140> regen<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
oh just like I got the regen and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.100 

right<00:02:25.590> click<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.130> boom<00:02:26.400> everything<00:02:27.150> blows<00:02:27.540> up

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
right click and boom everything blows up

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.090 
right click and boom everything blows up
so<00:02:29.780> don't<00:02:30.780> know<00:02:30.870> what<00:02:30.990> that<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.680> basically

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
so don't know what that is so basically

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.220 
so don't know what that is so basically
this<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.820> all<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.240> really<00:02:33.480> happens<00:02:33.840> it's

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
this is all that really happens it's

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.620 
this is all that really happens it's
kind<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.590> kind<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.340> pointless<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.030> I'm<00:02:36.450> about

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
kind of kind of pointless and I'm about

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.120 
kind of kind of pointless and I'm about
to<00:02:36.780> switch<00:02:36.990> over<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.410> next<00:02:37.620> world<00:02:37.800> right

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
to switch over to the next world right

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.340 
to switch over to the next world right
then<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.670> I'm<00:02:38.790> here<00:02:39.030> now<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.240> we<00:02:39.960> just<00:02:39.990> looked

we can get it to there we go the five

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.850 
we can get it to there we go the five
percent<00:03:02.940> chance<00:03:03.330> has<00:03:03.510> happened<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.740> also

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
percent chance has happened you can also

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
JIT legit um reason to craft it because

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.140 
JIT legit um reason to craft it because
you<00:03:56.340> might<00:03:56.489> want<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.730> have<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.940> fire
