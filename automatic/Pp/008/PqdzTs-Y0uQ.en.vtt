00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
see it just screws right in and we did

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.210 
see it just screws right in and we did
all<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.110> plumbing<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.590> hooked<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.829> up<00:01:35.009> here

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
all this plumbing we hooked this up here

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.560 
all this plumbing we hooked this up here
probably<00:01:35.549> took<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.729> minute<00:01:38.360> overhead<00:01:39.360> rain

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
probably took a minute overhead rain

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.830 
probably took a minute overhead rain
shower<00:01:39.869> connects<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> same<00:01:40.650> way<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.840> plumbing

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
shower connects the same way so plumbing

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.660 
shower connects the same way so plumbing
is<00:01:42.899> very<00:01:43.049> easy<00:01:43.290> now<00:01:43.619> for<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> electrical

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
is very easy now for the electrical

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.569 
is very easy now for the electrical
they're<00:01:45.390> gonna<00:01:45.479> need<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.140> hundred<00:01:46.590> ten<00:01:46.829> volt<00:01:47.100> 30
