00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
and that's really a misconception an

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.220 
and that's really a misconception an
actual<00:04:01.859> fact<00:04:02.069> like<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.400> said<00:04:02.670> when<00:04:03.209> we<00:04:03.239> start<00:04:04.079> to

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
actual fact like I said when we start to

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.119 
actual fact like I said when we start to
relax<00:04:05.329> we<00:04:06.329> then<00:04:06.629> become<00:04:07.170> open<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:07.859> when<00:04:08.010> we

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
relax we then become open and when we

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.589 
relax we then become open and when we
become<00:04:08.459> open<00:04:08.879> and<00:04:09.329> we<00:04:09.540> start<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.989> receive<00:04:10.530> is

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
become open and we start to receive is

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.460 
become open and we start to receive is
