00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
let's go ahead and take a look at the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.830 
let's go ahead and take a look at the
figure<00:00:47.280> itself<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.879> we'll<00:00:48.210> start<00:00:48.510> by<00:00:48.660> looking

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
figure itself and we'll start by looking

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.229 
figure itself and we'll start by looking
actually<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.680> accessories<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.969> get

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
actually at the accessories you do get

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.630 
actually at the accessories you do get
this<00:00:51.449> base<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.590> has<00:00:52.649> three<00:00:53.370> pegs

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
this base you can see it has three pegs

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.600 
this base you can see it has three pegs
on<00:00:54.210> which<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.750> place<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.140> figure<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
on which you can place the figure and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.430 
on which you can place the figure and
these<00:00:56.610> are<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> kind<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.090> bases<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:58.140> stands

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
these are the kind of bases or stands

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.130 
these are the kind of bases or stands
that<00:00:58.859> are<00:01:01.070> connectable<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.899> figure<00:01:04.110> does

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
that are connectable so this figure does

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.500 
that are connectable so this figure does
not<00:01:04.379> come<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.710> any<00:01:04.739> part<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:06.060> bill<00:01:06.420> to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
not come with any part of a bill to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.840 
not come with any part of a bill to
figure<00:01:06.720> nor<00:01:07.680> does<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.220> rest<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> figures

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
figure nor does the rest of the figures

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.780 
figure nor does the rest of the figures
from<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.180> wave<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.860> sess

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
from this wave so all you get as a sess

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.740 
from this wave so all you get as a sess
arree<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:15.060> course<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> weapons

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
arree is this in of course the weapons

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.770 
arree is this in of course the weapons

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
got actually five different guns here's

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.160 
got actually five different guns here's
one<00:01:23.909> type<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:27.049> starting<00:01:28.049> off

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
one type right here and starting off

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.660 
one type right here and starting off
with<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:28.530> i<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.650> say<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.490> is

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
with this one i can say that this is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.390 
with this one i can say that this is
actually<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.570> placed<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.320> particular<00:01:32.220> gun

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
actually not placed this particular gun

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.340 
actually not placed this particular gun
in<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> figure<00:01:32.909> sand<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.360> just<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
in the figure sand it was just the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
in the figure sand it was just the
tolerances<00:01:34.890> were<00:01:35.130> too<00:01:35.310> tight<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.970> mean<00:01:36.270> it's

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
tolerances were too tight I mean it's

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.010 
tolerances were too tight I mean it's
probably<00:01:36.990> possible<00:01:37.369> but<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:39.990> I

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
probably possible but this is the one I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.200 
probably possible but this is the one I
actually<00:01:40.229> didn't<00:01:40.619> try<00:01:41.159> out<00:01:41.340> before<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
actually didn't try out before the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.850 
actually didn't try out before the
review<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:43.049> actually<00:01:43.320> place<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
review to actually place it in the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
review to actually place it in the
figures<00:01:44.130> hands<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.790> looks<00:01:44.850> cool<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.420> I

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
figures hands but it looks cool and I

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.270 
figures hands but it looks cool and I
think<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.470> could<00:01:46.560> probably<00:01:46.619> get<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.040> there<00:01:47.100> is

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
think you could probably get in there is

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.410 
think you could probably get in there is
just<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.579> take<00:01:47.670> some<00:01:47.880> effort<00:01:48.119> in

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
just going to take some effort in

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.200 
just going to take some effort in
perhaps<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:50.100> know<00:01:50.220> warming<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> actual

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
perhaps you know warming up the actual

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.289 
perhaps you know warming up the actual
plastic<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:52.320> make<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> more<00:01:52.649> pliable<00:01:53.299> so

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
plastic to make it more pliable so

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.999 
plastic to make it more pliable so
that's<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:54.689> weapon<00:01:55.020> here's<00:01:55.590> another<00:01:55.770> one

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
that's one weapon here's another one

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.490 
that's one weapon here's another one
right<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:57.140> pretty<00:01:58.140> cool<00:01:58.549> and<00:02:00.229> as<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.409> can

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
right here pretty cool and as you can

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.289 
right here pretty cool and as you can
see<00:02:01.560> I've<00:02:01.829> already<00:02:01.950> got<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.820> punisher<00:02:03.149> here

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
see I've already got the punisher here

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.240 
see I've already got the punisher here

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.420 
there's articulation at the at the torso
there<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.160> can<00:04:32.280> see<00:04:32.990> and<00:04:34.010> let<00:04:35.010> me<00:04:35.130> see<00:04:35.310> about

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
there you can see and let me see about

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.130 
there you can see and let me see about
waist<00:04:35.790> articulation<00:04:36.510> let's<00:04:36.750> see<00:04:36.840> if<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:37.020> can

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
waist articulation let's see if I can

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.900 
waist articulation let's see if I can
figure<00:04:37.320> out<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:38.130> actually<00:04:38.490> has<00:04:38.640> waves

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
figure out that actually has waves

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.880 
figure out that actually has waves
articulation<00:04:39.480> it<00:04:39.840> does<00:04:40.260> not<00:04:40.470> appear<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.770> have

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
articulation it does not appear to have

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.230 
articulation it does not appear to have
waste<00:04:41.130> articulation<00:04:41.820> which<00:04:42.480> is<00:04:42.840> all<00:04:43.320> right

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
waste articulation which is all right

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.520 
waste articulation which is all right
because<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.480> have<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.780> articulation<00:04:46.290> he<00:04:46.380> ran

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
because you have the articulation he ran

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.800 
because you have the articulation he ran
out<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.770> ab<00:04:47.120> you<00:04:48.120> got<00:04:48.570> joint<00:04:48.960> here<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:51.750> you

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
out the a ab you got joint here so you

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.000 
out the a ab you got joint here so you
have<00:04:51.900> articulation<00:04:52.320> there<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:54.830> you<00:04:55.830> actually

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
have articulation there and you actually

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.410 
have articulation there and you actually
have<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.250> swivel<00:04:56.610> left<00:04:56.730> hip<00:04:56.970> even<00:04:57.180> though<00:04:57.270> it's

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
have a swivel left hip even though it's

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.570 
have a swivel left hip even though it's
kind<00:04:57.600> of<00:04:57.720> not<00:04:58.530> moving<00:04:58.770> right<00:04:59.040> now<00:04:59.100> it's<00:04:59.430> just

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
kind of not moving right now it's just

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.980 
kind of not moving right now it's just
