00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
few spots so that could get the effect

the first place I usually start is

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.149 
the first place I usually start is
actually<00:05:33.539> my<00:05:33.659> nose<00:05:33.840> basically<00:05:34.169> I<00:05:34.530> like<00:05:34.979> to

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
my finger and then they trace a small

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.380 
my finger and then they trace a small
dash<00:05:47.719> along<00:05:48.719> the<00:05:49.050> bridge<00:05:49.409> of<00:05:49.469> my<00:05:49.620> nose<00:05:49.740> and

that in if your skin were like so super
moisturized<00:05:54.710> you<00:05:54.950> would<00:05:55.040> notice<00:05:55.220> that<00:05:55.400> light

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
moisturized you would notice that light

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.550 
moisturized you would notice that light
would<00:05:56.060> really<00:05:56.330> reflect<00:05:56.750> from<00:05:57.050> the<00:05:57.140> end<00:05:57.320> of

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
would really reflect from the end of

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.430 
would really reflect from the end of
your<00:05:57.680> nose<00:05:57.830> so<00:05:58.300> what<00:05:59.300> I<00:05:59.330> do<00:05:59.450> to<00:05:59.930> kind<00:06:00.050> of<00:06:00.200> mimic

that<00:06:00.620> appearance<00:06:02.470> trace<00:06:03.470> a<00:06:03.500> v-shape<00:06:04.190> on<00:06:04.400> the

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
that appearance trace a v-shape on the

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.310 
that appearance trace a v-shape on the
end<00:06:04.790> of<00:06:04.910> my<00:06:05.000> nose<00:06:05.210> you<00:06:05.510> can<00:06:05.660> kind<00:06:05.840> of<00:06:05.990> see<00:06:06.140> how

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
end of my nose you can kind of see how

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.710 
end of my nose you can kind of see how
highlighting<00:06:06.950> certain<00:06:07.280> spots<00:06:07.610> gives<00:06:08.300> you<00:06:08.480> the

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
highlighting certain spots gives you the

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.980 
highlighting certain spots gives you the
appearance<00:06:09.200> of<00:06:09.590> dewy<00:06:09.800> skin<00:06:09.920> um<00:06:10.600> but<00:06:11.600> you<00:06:11.840> don't

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
want to highlight all over the place

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.680 
want to highlight all over the place
because<00:06:13.820> then<00:06:14.000> you're<00:06:14.120> just<00:06:14.150> gonna<00:06:14.330> happen

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
because then you're just gonna happen

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.110 
because then you're just gonna happen
all<00:06:14.810> over<00:06:14.840> shiny<00:06:15.440> nose<00:06:15.710> and<00:06:16.070> nobody<00:06:16.910> wants

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
as possible just by dabbing again you

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.780 
as possible just by dabbing again you
don't<00:06:42.230> want<00:06:42.320> to<00:06:42.470> over<00:06:42.770> rub<00:06:42.980> and<00:06:43.250> remove<00:06:43.520> some

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 
don't want to over rub and remove some

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.240 
don't want to over rub and remove some
of<00:06:43.820> that<00:06:43.970> luminosity<00:06:44.360> but<00:06:44.870> you<00:06:45.470> don't<00:06:45.860> want<00:06:46.100> to

of that luminosity but you don't want to

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.530 
of that luminosity but you don't want to
be<00:06:46.400> able<00:06:46.520> to<00:06:46.670> see<00:06:46.850> the<00:06:47.000> edge<00:06:47.180> of<00:06:47.420> your

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.540 
be able to see the edge of your

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.790 
be able to see the edge of your
highlighter<00:06:47.930> products<00:06:48.380> because<00:06:48.590> when<00:06:48.710> the

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
highlighter products because when the

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.500 
highlighter products because when the
Sun<00:06:49.010> hits<00:06:49.220> your<00:06:49.460> face<00:06:49.490> and<00:06:49.880> natural<00:06:50.300> daylight

Sun hits your face and natural daylight
that's<00:06:51.410> going<00:06:51.590> to<00:06:51.680> become<00:06:51.830> really<00:06:52.490> really

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
that's going to become really really

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.550 
that's going to become really really
obvious<00:06:53.240> if<00:06:53.450> you<00:06:53.540> have<00:06:53.660> them<00:06:53.810> lens<00:06:54.020> up<00:06:54.200> edges

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
obvious if you have them lens up edges

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.800 
obvious if you have them lens up edges
of<00:06:54.680> your<00:06:54.710> highlighter<00:06:55.190> and<00:06:55.490> the<00:06:56.360> last<00:06:56.570> place
