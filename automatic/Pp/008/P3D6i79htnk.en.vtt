00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.610
 March 7 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.060
 bushes in the vineyard open fertilized 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.570
 compost compost cooked with 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.350
 using baikal em1 effective 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.220
 microorganisms and today i will 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.070
 go to the next operation 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.579
 sowing federal fertilizers what is 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.579
 siderats 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:42.600
 green manure is a plant whose seeds 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.450
 sown before sowing the main 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.620
 culture 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:57.180
 these include plants like lupine 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:01.260
 oats rye richie x century mustard alfalfa 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.949
 very good use legumes 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.939
 cultures 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:11.700
 they enrich the soil with siderata nitrogen and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.470
 improve soil structure prevents 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.220
 leaching of weathering of useful substances 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:24.000
 inhibits weed growth 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.670
 disinfects loud they have a property 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.540
 build up a large amount of green 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:37.400
 mass and then beveled are fermented 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.860
 swim and seduce the earth with humus 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.590
 also from the depths of the soil pull up 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.799
 nutrients to the surface 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.619
 by letting you eat your best 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.640
 cultivated plant 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:56.750
 everything and I mustard scatter with such 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.549
 the way they are all embroidery 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.579
 Mustard consumption 300 400 grams per hundred 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.599
 fighting for it 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:12.060
 completely the entire entire soil surface 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.660
 plant cucumbers if necessary 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.560
 I ask tomatoes 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:24.000
 mustard after sowing and squish the ground for 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.680
 better contact seed tape all 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.680
 and waiting for the next rain 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.819
 after mowing green mass 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:42.090
 federal fertilizer we drift it into 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.700
 unde and it covers enriching the earth 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.120
 humus if treated with the drug 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.360
 baikal em1 then microorganisms accelerate 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.019
 fermentation overlap education 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.019
 hummus
