00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the dis sander is a very versatile tool

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.259 
the dis sander is a very versatile tool
and<00:00:27.990> unlike<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.830> name<00:00:29.039> would<00:00:29.250> suggest<00:00:29.429> we

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
and unlike the name would suggest we

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.520 
and unlike the name would suggest we
actually<00:00:30.779> use<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> disc<00:00:31.650> sander<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:32.759> shaping

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
actually use a disc sander for shaping

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.400 
actually use a disc sander for shaping
rather<00:00:34.530> than<00:00:35.270> sanding<00:00:36.270> now<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.930> could

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
rather than sanding now you could

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.130 
rather than sanding now you could
actually<00:00:37.590> think<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.610> dis<00:00:39.120> sander<00:00:39.570> almost<00:00:39.960> as

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
actually think of a dis sander almost as

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.690 
actually think of a dis sander almost as
an<00:00:40.530> electric<00:00:41.100> rasp

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
an electric rasp

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.270 
an electric rasp
it's<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.480> great<00:00:42.930> job<00:00:43.230> at<00:00:43.559> shaping

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
it's going to do a great job at shaping

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.110 
it's going to do a great job at shaping
curves<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.469> radiuses<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.800> actually<00:00:47.789> when

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
curves and radiuses and actually when

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.560 
curves and radiuses and actually when
paired<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.399> included<00:00:50.399> miter<00:00:50.789> gauge<00:00:51.090> can

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
paired with the included miter gauge can

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.619 
paired with the included miter gauge can
be<00:00:51.690> used<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.710> fine<00:00:53.100> tune<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.789> fit<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.210> many

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
be used to fine tune the fit of many

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.260 
be used to fine tune the fit of many
pieces<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.800> typically<00:00:56.280> would<00:00:56.610> either<00:00:56.820> use<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
pieces we typically would either use the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.930 
pieces we typically would either use the
table<00:00:57.660> saw<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> miter<00:00:58.620> saw<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.940> sometimes

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
table saw or a miter saw to sometimes

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.560 
table saw or a miter saw to sometimes
sneak<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.199> cut<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.680> fit<00:01:02.399> length<00:01:02.820> for

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
sneak up on the cut of fit length for

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.230 
sneak up on the cut of fit length for
many<00:01:03.750> pieces<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.519> actually<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.090> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
many pieces and we can actually do that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.560 
many pieces and we can actually do that
on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.380> disc<00:01:07.680> sander<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.250> well<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.270> very

aluminum disc and they don't have a lot
of<00:01:30.960> weight<00:01:31.229> which<00:01:31.470> means<00:01:31.740> they<00:01:31.920> don't<00:01:32.159> carry<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
of weight which means they don't carry a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
which also helps reduce vibration and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.449 
which also helps reduce vibration and
keep<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.780> unit<00:02:31.140> steady<00:02:31.530> while<00:02:32.220> you're

nice<00:03:15.420> feature<00:03:15.720> in<00:03:16.080> my<00:03:16.290> opinion<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:18.060> adjust<00:03:18.480> the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
nice feature in my opinion to adjust the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.350 
nice feature in my opinion to adjust the
table<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.170> simply<00:03:19.560> loosen<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.790> locking<00:03:21.030> knob

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.870 
table you simply loosen the locking knob
right<00:03:21.660> here<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.140> then<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.860> use<00:03:23.070> this<00:03:23.340> knob<00:03:23.579> to

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
right here and then you use this knob to

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.640 
right here and then you use this knob to
adjust<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.750> angle<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:26.100> will<00:03:26.280> adjust<00:03:26.400> from

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
adjust the angle and it will adjust from

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.310 
adjust the angle and it will adjust from
your<00:03:28.650> zero<00:03:28.980> Degree<00:03:29.340> point<00:03:29.640> down<00:03:30.329> 45<00:03:30.989> degrees

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
your zero Degree point down 45 degrees

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.759 
your zero Degree point down 45 degrees
or<00:03:31.590> up<00:03:32.269> 45<00:03:33.269> degrees<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.930> have<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.110> very<00:03:34.410> nice

show<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:56.610> about<00:04:56.759> this<00:04:57.060> unit<00:04:57.419> is<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:58.020> has<00:04:58.470> a

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
show you about this unit is it has a

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.790 
show you about this unit is it has a
break<00:04:59.340> so<00:05:00.330> when<00:05:00.930> you're<00:05:01.080> using<00:05:01.289> this<00:05:01.530> unit

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
break so when you're using this unit

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.650 
break so when you're using this unit
because<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.280> that<00:05:02.370> motor<00:05:02.759> and<00:05:03.030> that<00:05:03.449> nice

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
because of that motor and that nice

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.170 
because of that motor and that nice
heavy<00:05:03.990> disc<00:05:04.440> when<00:05:04.740> you<00:05:04.860> shut<00:05:05.130> this<00:05:05.400> unit<00:05:05.970> off

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
heavy disc when you shut this unit off

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.450 
heavy disc when you shut this unit off
that<00:05:06.690> disk<00:05:06.960> likes<00:05:07.259> to<00:05:07.470> spin<00:05:07.710> for<00:05:07.949> a<00:05:08.009> long<00:05:08.190> time

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
that disk likes to spin for a long time

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.110 
that disk likes to spin for a long time
I<00:05:08.729> actually<00:05:09.320> timed<00:05:10.320> it<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.710> this<00:05:11.250> unit<00:05:11.610> spins

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
I actually timed it and this unit spins

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.510 
I actually timed it and this unit spins
for<00:05:12.389> over<00:05:12.780> two<00:05:13.110> minutes<00:05:13.380> after<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:14.070> shut<00:05:14.370> the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
for over two minutes after I shut the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.140 
for over two minutes after I shut the
motor<00:05:14.639> off

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
motor off

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.620 
motor off
so<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:16.169> having<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.949> disc<00:05:17.190> brake<00:05:17.400> is<00:05:17.669> a<00:05:18.030> great

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
so the having the disc brake is a great

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.379 
so the having the disc brake is a great
feature<00:05:19.440> and<00:05:19.860> allows<00:05:20.280> us<00:05:20.310> to<00:05:20.610> bring<00:05:20.849> this<00:05:21.090> unit

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
feature and allows us to bring this unit

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.930 
feature and allows us to bring this unit
to<00:05:21.509> a<00:05:21.539> stop<00:05:21.810> in<00:05:22.020> seconds<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:22.800> not<00:05:23.340> have<00:05:23.729> to

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
to a stop in seconds and not have to

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.939 
to a stop in seconds and not have to
walk<00:05:24.270> away<00:05:24.449> from<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.199> leave<00:05:25.440> it<00:05:25.620> spinning

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
walk away from it and leave it spinning

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.659 
walk away from it and leave it spinning
and<00:05:26.699> which<00:05:27.479> really<00:05:28.289> makes<00:05:28.620> this<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.830> safer<00:05:29.340> unit

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
and which really makes this a safer unit

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.570 
and which really makes this a safer unit
and<00:05:29.849> more<00:05:30.120> convenient<00:05:30.720> as<00:05:30.870> well

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
and more convenient as well
