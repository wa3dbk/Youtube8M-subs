00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.010 

I<00:00:35.620> think<00:00:36.620> about<00:00:36.860> 2012<00:00:37.400> every<00:00:37.700> day<00:00:37.850> it's<00:00:38.480> a<00:00:38.660> huge

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
I think about 2012 every day it's a huge

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.810 
I think about 2012 every day it's a huge
thing<00:00:39.290> it's<00:00:39.650> not<00:00:39.800> very<00:00:39.980> often<00:00:40.220> that<00:00:40.400> you<00:00:40.550> get

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
thing it's not very often that you get

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.610 
thing it's not very often that you get
olympics<00:00:41.540> and<00:00:41.720> paralympics<00:00:41.780> in<00:00:42.380> your<00:00:42.500> home

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
olympics and paralympics in your home

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.680 
olympics and paralympics in your home
country<00:00:42.830> and<00:00:43.220> I<00:00:43.280> think<00:00:43.520> for<00:00:44.030> athletes<00:00:44.390> were<00:00:44.570> at

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
country and I think for athletes were at

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.050 
country and I think for athletes were at
the<00:00:44.810> top<00:00:44.989> of<00:00:45.020> their<00:00:45.230> game<00:00:45.290> it's<00:00:46.040> like<00:00:46.400> looking

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
the top of their game it's like looking

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.430 
the top of their game it's like looking
that<00:00:47.210> they've<00:00:47.360> come<00:00:47.600> round<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:48.050> race<00:00:48.230> in

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
that they've come round to race in

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.460 
that they've come round to race in

great initiative because I think the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
great initiative because I think the
fact<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:42.560> people<00:01:42.890> get<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.100> try<00:01:43.310> out

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
fact that people get to try out

fact that people get to try out
different<00:01:43.610> sports<00:01:44.090> is<00:01:44.510> a<00:01:44.570> great<00:01:44.840> thing<00:01:45.110> and

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380
