00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
casting a game between our player in the

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.419

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
in the red and he's at 1260 so it looks

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.209 
in the red and he's at 1260 so it looks
like<00:00:12.840> he's<00:00:13.019> going<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.170> be<00:00:13.259> summoning<00:00:13.679> fable

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.980 
like he's going to be summoning fable
Raymond<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.210> could<00:00:15.360> possibly<00:00:15.509> be<00:00:15.750> playing

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
Raymond so it could possibly be playing

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.010 
Raymond so it could possibly be playing
Dark<00:00:16.199> Worlds<00:00:16.379> or<00:00:16.619> he<00:00:17.070> could<00:00:17.250> be<00:00:17.609> playing<00:00:18.029> some

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
Dark Worlds or he could be playing some

Dark Worlds or he could be playing some
variant<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.410> fables<00:00:21.080> because<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.289> fables<00:00:22.769> can

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
variant of fables because of fables can

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.920 
variant of fables because of fables can
get<00:00:23.189> out<00:00:23.310> quasar<00:00:26.359> so<00:00:27.359> looks<00:00:27.539> like<00:00:27.570> he's<00:00:27.779> just

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
get out quasar so looks like he's just

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.910 
get out quasar so looks like he's just
going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:29.990> base<00:00:30.990> here<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.500> he's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
going to go for a base here and he's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.729 
going to go for a base here and he's
just<00:00:32.099> gonna<00:00:32.600> synchro<00:00:33.600> into<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.430> 6<00:00:35.430> ok<00:00:35.850> i<00:00:36.739> was

just gonna synchro into a 6 ok i was

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.430 
just gonna synchro into a 6 ok i was
thinking<00:00:37.950> possibly<00:00:38.190> he<00:00:38.460> could<00:00:38.610> exceed<00:00:39.290> if<00:00:40.290> you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
thinking possibly he could exceed if you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.060 
thinking possibly he could exceed if you
wanted<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.610> that's<00:00:41.790> ok<00:00:42.059> um<00:00:43.070> I've

would<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.780> absolutely<00:01:46.200> devastating<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
would be absolutely devastating to the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.219 
would be absolutely devastating to the
dark<00:01:47.340> pool<00:01:47.490> player<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> black<00:01:48.780> wings<00:01:48.990> still

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
dark pool player but a black wings still

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.350 
dark pool player but a black wings still
have<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.680> good<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.579> consistency

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
have a really good you know consistency

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.050 
have a really good you know consistency
so<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.200> he's<00:01:52.320> able<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.909> know<00:01:54.030> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
so if he's able to do a you know a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
so if he's able to do a you know a
cursor<00:01:54.570> attack<00:01:54.750> play<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.710> could<00:01:55.920> put<00:01:56.040> himself

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
cursor attack play you could put himself

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.050 
cursor attack play you could put himself
in<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.520> pretty<00:01:56.790> decent<00:01:57.060> situation<00:01:57.540> here

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
in a pretty decent situation here

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.459 
in a pretty decent situation here
because<00:02:00.060> at<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.540> moment<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.170> red<00:02:01.290> player

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
because at the moment the red player

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.510 
because at the moment the red player
kinda<00:02:01.710> has<00:02:01.829> field<00:02:02.040> control<00:02:04.130> but<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> problem

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
kinda has field control but the problem

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.340 
kinda has field control but the problem
is<00:02:05.670> right<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.329> need<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> pirate<00:02:07.200> can

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
is right here I need to pirate can

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.350 
is right here I need to pirate can
synchro<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> blizzard<00:02:08.550> does<00:02:08.849> not<00:02:09.090> negate

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
synchro but a blizzard does not negate

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.420 
synchro but a blizzard does not negate
the<00:02:09.539> effects<00:02:09.929> because<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.500> can<00:02:10.649> still<00:02:10.890> have

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
the effects because you can still have

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.619 
the effects because you can still have
so<00:02:13.269> he<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.810> at<00:02:14.079> 1400<00:02:14.829> attack<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.420> wasn't

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
so he is at 1400 attack so that wasn't

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.250 
so he is at 1400 attack so that wasn't
decent<00:02:20.469> play<00:02:21.540> perhaps<00:02:22.540> if<00:02:22.780> he<00:02:22.840> has<00:02:22.930> acres

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
decent play perhaps if he has acres

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.050 
decent play perhaps if he has acres
attack<00:02:23.560> it'll<00:02:23.799> really<00:02:24.129> make<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.459> place<00:02:24.700> so

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
attack it'll really make this place so

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.839 
attack it'll really make this place so
much<00:02:25.090> better<00:02:26.280> obviously<00:02:27.280> he'll<00:02:27.400> have<00:02:27.579> to<00:02:27.700> pay

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
much better obviously he'll have to pay

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.429 
much better obviously he'll have to pay
the<00:02:28.000> cost<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.590> he<00:02:29.859> can<00:02:29.980> chain<00:02:31.200> acres<00:02:32.200> attack

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:32.439 
the cost and he can chain acres attack

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.789 
the cost and he can chain acres attack
then<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.829> he<00:02:33.340> can<00:02:33.489> pop<00:02:34.590> hopefully<00:02:35.590> he'll<00:02:35.709> have

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
then and he can pop hopefully he'll have

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.390 
then and he can pop hopefully he'll have
a<00:02:35.980> curse<00:02:36.159> attack<00:02:36.459> oh<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:38.620> does<00:02:38.889> not<00:02:39.099> look<00:02:39.250> like

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
a curse attack oh it does not look like

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.490 
a curse attack oh it does not look like
he<00:02:39.430> has<00:02:39.639> it<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.810> he's<00:02:44.079> going<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.260> go<00:02:44.319> for

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
he has it and he's going to go for

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.610 
he has it and he's going to go for
graefe

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.199 

and<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:54.709> this<00:02:55.709> point<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.159> could<00:02:56.250> sack<00:02:56.940> for

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
and so this point you could sack for

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.149 
and so this point you could sack for
graphic<00:02:57.659> but<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.870> don't<00:02:58.140> think<00:02:58.319> tributing<00:02:59.040> is

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
graphic but I don't think tributing is

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:06.300 
graphic but I don't think tributing is
the<00:02:59.519> best<00:02:59.849> idea

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.070 

and<00:03:06.459> I<00:03:07.000> believe<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.569> was<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.690> quick<00:03:07.870> play

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
and I believe that that was a quick play

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.540 
and I believe that that was a quick play
obviously<00:03:08.290> attacking<00:03:08.920> with<00:03:09.010> dark<00:03:09.190> Hallam<00:03:09.459> to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
obviously attacking with dark Hallam to

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.820 
obviously attacking with dark Hallam to
get<00:03:09.670> more<00:03:09.880> damage<00:03:10.300> in<00:03:10.480> by<00:03:11.020> attacking<00:03:11.319> blizzard

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
get more damage in by attacking blizzard

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.729 
get more damage in by attacking blizzard
because<00:03:12.040> oz<00:03:12.250> was<00:03:12.550> doin<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:12.940> Attack<00:03:13.209> Position

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
because oz was doin in Attack Position

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.300 
because oz was doin in Attack Position
but<00:03:14.739> uh<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:16.450> player<00:03:16.959> in<00:03:17.230> blue<00:03:17.590> really<00:03:18.160> needs

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
but uh the player in blue really needs

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.809 
but uh the player in blue really needs
an<00:03:18.430> acre<00:03:18.580> of<00:03:18.730> hack<00:03:19.060> or<00:03:19.709> he<00:03:20.709> needs<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.280> own

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
an acre of hack or he needs to own

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.250 
an acre of hack or he needs to own
darkroom<00:03:22.390> dragon<00:03:22.780> which<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:22.989> quite<00:03:23.260> good<00:03:23.580> and

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
darkroom dragon which is quite good and

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.470 
darkroom dragon which is quite good and
the<00:03:26.260> dark<00:03:27.099> will<00:03:27.250> play<00:03:27.370> usually<00:03:27.880> does<00:03:28.060> not<00:03:28.090> play

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
the dark will play usually does not play

does have gräfin hand that's thing so
obviously<00:04:11.680> he<00:04:11.859> maybe<00:04:12.040> he<00:04:12.250> should<00:04:12.400> have<00:04:12.519> saved

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
obviously he maybe he should have saved

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.219 
obviously he maybe he should have saved
his<00:04:14.049> options<00:04:14.650> for<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:14.950> braai<00:04:15.609> neck<00:04:16.079> later<00:04:17.079> on

his options for a braai neck later on

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.940 
his options for a braai neck later on
with<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.850> blizzard<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:20.410> he<00:04:20.500> will<00:04:20.680> be<00:04:20.709> able<00:04:20.829> to

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
with the blizzard so he will be able to

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.710 
with the blizzard so he will be able to
get<00:04:21.100> graffin<00:04:21.519> he<00:04:21.729> can't<00:04:22.000> attack<00:04:22.090> over<00:04:22.539> guy<00:04:22.690> a

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
get graffin he can't attack over guy a

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.620 
get graffin he can't attack over guy a
night<00:04:23.729> but<00:04:24.729> he<00:04:24.850> does<00:04:25.000> have<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.240> field<00:04:25.479> spell

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
night but he does have the field spell

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.230 
night but he does have the field spell
which<00:04:26.590> I<00:04:26.740> don't<00:04:26.919> think<00:04:27.039> he<00:04:27.100> does<00:04:27.250> because<00:04:27.880> if

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
which I don't think he does because if

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.820 
which I don't think he does because if
he<00:04:28.360> did<00:04:28.479> have<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.840> field<00:04:29.080> spell<00:04:29.229> he<00:04:29.710> would

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
he did have the field spell he would

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.960 
he did have the field spell he would
have<00:04:29.919> discarded<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.340> graph<00:04:30.520> of<00:04:30.669> that<00:04:30.729> he

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
have discarded the graph of that he

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.550 
have discarded the graph of that he
added<00:04:31.390> last<00:04:31.600> turn<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:34.320> bottomless<00:04:35.320> in

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
added last turn and so bottomless in

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.219 
added last turn and so bottomless in
Rafah<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.550> is<00:04:36.760> really<00:04:36.970> gonna<00:04:37.180> hurt<00:04:37.539> Dark

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
Rafah and that is really gonna hurt Dark
