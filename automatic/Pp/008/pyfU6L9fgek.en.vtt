to grow up into the modern world say

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.029 
to grow up into the modern world say
we've<00:00:47.160> invested<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.410> high<00:00:49.410> suggestible

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
we've invested in a high suggestible

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.790 
we've invested in a high suggestible
very<00:00:50.370> large<00:00:50.719> anything<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.870> smart<00:00:52.230> with

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
think that generally ICT needs to be an

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.959 
think that generally ICT needs to be an
integral<00:02:04.710> part<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.070> our<00:02:05.189> children's<00:02:05.700> lives

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969

integral part of our children's lives
it's<00:02:06.930> such<00:02:07.500> an<00:02:07.680> important<00:02:08.099> skill<00:02:08.340> base<00:02:08.550> that

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
it's such an important skill base that

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.850 
it's such an important skill base that
they<00:02:08.910> need<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.560> also<00:02:10.679> help

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
they need to have and it can also help

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.410 
they need to have and it can also help
them<00:02:10.979> further<00:02:11.250> their<00:02:11.489> own<00:02:11.670> education<00:02:12.270> and

them further their own education and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.030 
them further their own education and
develop<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.840> independence<00:02:13.590> in<00:02:13.800> learning

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
develop that independence in learning

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.530 
develop that independence in learning
and<00:02:14.430> that's<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.790> me<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:14.940> one<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.330> most

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and that's to me is one of the most

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.970 
and that's to me is one of the most
important<00:02:16.080> skills<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:16.800> teach

they've done and then look at how they

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.199 
they've done and then look at how they
can<00:03:31.170> improve<00:03:31.379> it<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.430> just<00:03:32.610> makes<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:33.030> just

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
so much quicker not only does the ICT

so much quicker not only does the ICT

for the reason I've described earlier
