tutorial on indirect lighting or some
people<00:00:09.599> call<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.110> clay<00:00:10.860> lighting<00:00:11.929> so<00:00:13.340> open<00:00:14.340> up

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
people call it clay lighting so open up

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.990 
people call it clay lighting so open up
your<00:00:14.639> max<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.680> let's<00:00:16.680> click<00:00:17.100> or<00:00:17.340> five<00:00:17.609> minute

your max and let's click or five minute
you're<00:00:18.869> going<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.050> make<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.980> plain<00:00:21.920> and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
you're going to make just a plain and

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.529 
you're going to make just a plain and
then<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.580> make<00:00:24.449> whatever<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.960> want<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.260> top

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
then just make whatever you want on top

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.939 
then just make whatever you want on top
and<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.660> couple<00:00:27.900> boxes<00:00:28.199> or<00:00:28.560> whatever<00:00:28.830> it

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
and a couple boxes or whatever it

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:38.010 
and a couple boxes or whatever it
doesn't<00:00:28.980> really<00:00:29.250> matter

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:47.670 

I'm<00:00:39.020> going<00:00:39.200> to<00:00:39.260> do<00:00:39.380> my<00:00:39.410> real<00:00:39.950> quick

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.810 

now<00:00:48.680> you<00:00:48.829> don't<00:00:49.010> have<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.160> do<00:00:49.370> everything<00:00:49.489> I'm

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
now you don't have to do everything I'm

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
now you don't have to do everything I'm
doing<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:50.270> just<00:00:50.690> for<00:00:51.820> demonstration

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
doing this just for demonstration

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.500 
doing this just for demonstration
purposes<00:00:53.840> but<00:00:54.820> can<00:00:55.820> if<00:00:55.969> you<00:00:56.089> want<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.390> doesn't

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
purposes but can if you want it doesn't

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:07.260 
purposes but can if you want it doesn't
really<00:00:56.719> matter

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.950 

ok

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.390 

alright<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.350> now<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:12.530> got<00:01:12.740> your<00:01:12.890> same<00:01:13.100> setup

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
alright so now you got your same setup

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.970 
alright so now you got your same setup
but<00:01:14.860> when<00:01:15.860> you're<00:01:16.010> doing<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.580> clay<00:01:17.980> modeling

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
but when you're doing the clay modeling

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.180 
but when you're doing the clay modeling
or<00:01:19.220> clay<00:01:20.000> shader<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:21.380> mostly<00:01:21.950> want

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
or clay shader you mostly want

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.360 
or clay shader you mostly want
everything<00:01:22.370> to<00:01:22.550> be<00:01:22.580> white<00:01:23.740> because<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:24.950> looks

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
everything to be white because it looks

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.070 
everything to be white because it looks
better<00:01:25.520> but<00:01:26.300> you<00:01:26.480> don't<00:01:26.630> have<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:27.020> have

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
better but you don't have to have

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.130 
better but you don't have to have
everything<00:01:27.350> right<00:01:27.820> actually<00:01:28.820> my<00:01:29.810> length

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
everything right actually my length

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.630 
everything right actually my length
really<00:01:30.650> you<00:01:30.710> want<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:30.980> add<00:01:31.100> your<00:01:31.310> own<00:01:31.340> colors

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
really you want to add your own colors

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.970 
really you want to add your own colors
you<00:01:31.910> can't<00:01:32.150> do<00:01:32.330> that<00:01:32.510> but<00:01:33.410> when<00:01:33.560> you're<00:01:33.710> doing

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
you can't do that but when you're doing

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.180 
you can't do that but when you're doing
the<00:01:34.130> clay<00:01:34.460> modeling<00:01:35.360> indirect<00:01:35.870> illumination

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
the clay modeling indirect illumination

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.270 
the clay modeling indirect illumination
it's<00:01:37.190> usually<00:01:37.730> white<00:01:39.820> no<00:01:40.820> um<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.920> light<00:01:43.100> we're

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
it's usually white no um the light we're

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.480 
it's usually white no um the light we're
going<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.490> use<00:01:43.640> is<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.000> skylight<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.920> you're

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
going to use is the skylight and you're

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.180 
going to use is the skylight and you're
going<00:01:46.760> your<00:01:46.880> top<00:01:47.090> viewport<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:47.960> just<00:01:48.190> put

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
going your top viewport and you just put

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.060 
going your top viewport and you just put
it<00:01:49.310> right<00:01:49.340> on<00:01:49.580> top<00:01:49.760> in<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.330> middle<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.920> then

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
it right on top in the middle and then

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.550 
it right on top in the middle and then
just<00:01:52.369> drag<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:52.729> above<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.119> sea<00:01:53.810> now<00:01:54.350> if<00:01:54.410> you

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
just drag it above the sea now if you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.630 
just drag it above the sea now if you
render<00:01:54.890> now<00:01:55.420> it<00:01:56.420> will<00:01:56.570> look<00:01:56.720> really<00:01:56.750> crappy

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
render now it will look really crappy

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.500 
render now it will look really crappy
really<00:01:58.640> really<00:01:59.030> crappy<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.590> what<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:00.920> do<00:02:01.070> is

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
really really crappy so what you do is

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.270 
really really crappy so what you do is
you<00:02:02.510> go<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.170> rendering<00:02:04.000> render<00:02:05.000> setup

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
you go to rendering render setup

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.520 
you go to rendering render setup
advanced<00:02:07.280> lighting<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:08.630> then<00:02:09.110> go<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.290> light

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
advanced lighting and then go to light

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.550 
advanced lighting and then go to light
racer<00:02:10.720> now<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:11.780> can<00:02:12.050> mess<00:02:12.290> with<00:02:12.440> these

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
racer now you can mess with these

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.800 
racer now you can mess with these
settings<00:02:12.980> if<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.250> want<00:02:13.490> I'll<00:02:13.940> put<00:02:14.690> the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
settings if you want I'll put the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.110 
settings if you want I'll put the
bounces<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.500> little<00:02:15.860> bit<00:02:16.010> but<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:16.880> don't

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
bounces up a little bit but I don't

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.930 
bounces up a little bit but I don't
really<00:02:17.269> mess<00:02:17.510> with<00:02:17.540> settings<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:19.250> then<00:02:19.280> when

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
really mess with settings and then when

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:48.670 
really mess with settings and then when
you<00:02:20.030> render<00:02:20.180> it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:03:06.710 

God

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.710 

that's<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:07.990> really<00:03:09.120> now<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.180> want<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.569> mess

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
that's it really now you want to mess

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.900 
that's it really now you want to mess
the<00:03:10.900> settings<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:12.370> touch<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.640> up<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.209> can<00:03:13.660> I

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
the settings to touch it up so you can I

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.940 
the settings to touch it up so you can I
think<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.390> give<00:03:16.599> it<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.930> fuzziness<00:03:17.410> I<00:03:17.650> think

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
think to give it a fuzziness I think

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.059 
think to give it a fuzziness I think
it's<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:18.280> filter<00:03:18.849> size<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.560> radiate

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
it's the filter size and the radiate

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:38.890 
it's the filter size and the radiate
DeRay<00:03:21.610> bias

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:48.550 

yes<00:03:39.590> see<00:03:39.799> that's<00:03:40.010> what<00:03:40.159> it<00:03:40.250> works<00:03:40.430> I<00:03:47.560> assume

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
yes see that's what it works I assume

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.390 
yes see that's what it works I assume
the<00:03:48.709> higher<00:03:48.860> you<00:03:49.040> put<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.489> better<00:03:49.700> look<00:03:51.400> so

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
the higher you put it to better look so

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.450 
the higher you put it to better look so
that's<00:03:53.239> basically
