00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.800 

I<00:00:00.240> basically<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.079> felt<00:00:01.319> that<00:00:01.439> our<00:00:01.530> fast<00:00:02.070> bowlers

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:02.810 
I basically I felt that our fast bowlers

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.970 
I basically I felt that our fast bowlers
would<00:00:03.810> be<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.049> most<00:00:04.230> dangerous<00:00:04.470> in<00:00:04.859> those

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
would be the most dangerous in those

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
would be the most dangerous in those
conditions<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.520> thought<00:00:05.700> that<00:00:05.850> with<00:00:05.940> the

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
conditions I thought that with the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600 
conditions I thought that with the
wicket<00:00:06.299> as<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.660> can<00:00:06.779> see<00:00:06.930> by<00:00:07.280> when<00:00:08.280> Pakistan

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
wicket as you can see by when Pakistan

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.190 
wicket as you can see by when Pakistan
bowled<00:00:09.059> even<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.450> wicket<00:00:09.690> was<00:00:09.780> up-and-down

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
bowled even the wicket was up-and-down

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.410 
bowled even the wicket was up-and-down
for<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.559> for<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.889> quick<00:00:11.070> ease<00:00:11.219> on<00:00:12.030> one<00:00:12.240> length

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
for the for the quick ease on one length

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.730 
for the for the quick ease on one length
in<00:00:12.599> particular<00:00:14.870> yeah<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.900> thought<00:00:16.199> Shawn<00:00:16.440> tape

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
in particular yeah I thought Shawn tape

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.109 
in particular yeah I thought Shawn tape
would<00:00:16.890> would<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:17.220> make<00:00:17.520> some<00:00:17.670> breakthroughs

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
would would have make some breakthroughs

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.060 
would would have make some breakthroughs
for<00:00:18.359> us<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> game<00:00:18.840> those<00:00:19.470> middle<00:00:19.740> overs<00:00:19.980> in

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
for us in the game those middle overs in

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.849 
for us in the game those middle overs in
particular<00:00:21.320> and<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.410> thought<00:00:22.590> we'd<00:00:22.740> had<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
particular and I thought we'd had a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.380 
particular and I thought we'd had a
brettly<00:00:23.189> bali<00:00:23.430> look<00:00:23.609> very<00:00:23.789> dangerous<00:00:23.939> brettly

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
brettly bali look very dangerous brettly

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.370 
brettly bali look very dangerous brettly
and<00:00:24.539> Mitchell<00:00:24.779> Johnson<00:00:24.930> whatever<00:00:25.260> they

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and Mitchell Johnson whatever they

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.960 
and Mitchell Johnson whatever they
bother<00:00:25.619> they<00:00:25.710> look<00:00:25.830> very<00:00:25.859> dangerous<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.580> that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
bother they look very dangerous so that

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.029 
bother they look very dangerous so that
was<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.150> main<00:00:27.300> reason

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
was the main reason

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.040 
was the main reason
Jason<00:00:29.039> bodis<00:00:29.369> his<00:00:30.000> full<00:00:30.240> quota<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.630> thought<00:00:30.900> was

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
Jason bodis his full quota I thought was

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.229 
Jason bodis his full quota I thought was
was<00:00:31.380> pretty<00:00:31.619> good<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.880> couldn't<00:00:33.059> Bowl

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
was pretty good so we couldn't Bowl

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.430 
was pretty good so we couldn't Bowl
everyone<00:00:33.570> tonight<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.020> game<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.320> never

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
everyone tonight the game was never

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.830 
everyone tonight the game was never
going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> go<00:00:34.829> down<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> 50<00:00:35.340> overs<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.390> used

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
going to go down to 50 overs so I used

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.209 
going to go down to 50 overs so I used
the<00:00:36.930> guys<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.350> thought<00:00:37.559> would<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.739> most

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the guys that I thought would be most

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.639 
the guys that I thought would be most
dangerous<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.730> weekend<00:00:38.969> yeah<00:00:39.469> we<00:00:40.469> won

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
dangerous on that weekend yeah we won

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.959 
dangerous on that weekend yeah we won
the<00:00:40.770> toss<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:40.980> batted<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> reasonable

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the toss and batted on a reasonable

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
the toss and batted on a reasonable
wicket<00:00:42.210> they're<00:00:42.420> pretty<00:00:42.570> good<00:00:42.690> week<00:00:42.840> at<00:00:42.930> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
wicket they're pretty good week at a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.420 
wicket they're pretty good week at a
wicket<00:00:43.230> there<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.410> certainly<00:00:43.710> had<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.250> than

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
wicket there was certainly had more than

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.810 
wicket there was certainly had more than
170<00:00:45.270> runs<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:45.840> us<00:00:46.399> as<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.550> said<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
170 runs in it for us as I said the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.100 
170 runs in it for us as I said the
bounce<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.270> bit<00:00:48.390> inconsistent<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:48.989> it

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
bounce was a bit inconsistent but it

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.740 
bounce was a bit inconsistent but it
didn't<00:00:49.320> spin<00:00:49.500> very<00:00:49.770> much<00:00:50.270> came<00:00:51.270> onto<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> bat

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
didn't spin very much came onto the bat

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.200 
didn't spin very much came onto the bat
at<00:00:52.199> reasonable<00:00:52.649> pace<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.850> know<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.059> one

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
at reasonable pace so you know on one

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
at reasonable pace so you know on one
stage<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> game<00:00:54.840> were<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.379> 70<00:00:55.710> or<00:00:55.770> 80

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
stage in the game were one for 70 or 80

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.959 
stage in the game were one for 70 or 80
and<00:00:56.070> look<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.309> we're<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.699> sort<00:00:56.940> of

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and look what we're going to sort of

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.830 
and look what we're going to sort of
post<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.840> 240<00:00:58.379> 250<00:00:58.680> sort<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.100> total<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.579> had

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
post a 240 250 sort of total but we had

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.880 
post a 240 250 sort of total but we had
had<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> big<00:01:01.050> collapse<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.559> middle<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
had a big collapse in the middle of the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.860 
had a big collapse in the middle of the
innings<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.460> allowed<00:01:03.180> us<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.420> only<00:01:03.629> make

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
innings and that allowed us to only make

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.950 
innings and that allowed us to only make
177<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.850> know<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.970> can't<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.390> can't<00:01:06.689> fault

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
177 and you know I can't I can't fault

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.109 
177 and you know I can't I can't fault
the<00:01:07.080> endeavor<00:01:07.380> or<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> spirit<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> boys

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the endeavor or the spirit that the boys

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.370 
the endeavor or the spirit that the boys
showed<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.540> ball<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.049> field<00:01:10.290> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
showed with the ball and in the field I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.230 
showed with the ball and in the field I
thought<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.619> was<00:01:10.740> terrific<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.220> fought<00:01:12.060> our

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
thought it was terrific we fought our

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.550 
thought it was terrific we fought our
way<00:01:12.390> back<00:01:12.420> into<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> game<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.080> actually<00:01:13.439> gave

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
way back into the game and actually gave

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.690 
way back into the game and actually gave
ourselves<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:14.010> chance<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.340> winning<00:01:14.549> when<00:01:14.640> we

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
ourselves a chance of winning when we

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
ourselves a chance of winning when we
had<00:01:14.820> them<00:01:14.909> six<00:01:15.119> down<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:16.380> not<00:01:16.500> enough

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
had them six down but just not enough

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.100 
had them six down but just not enough
runs<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.369> needed<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> make<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.270> 240

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
runs you know we needed to make that 240

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.300 
runs you know we needed to make that 240
score<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.590> were<00:01:19.650> chance<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.950> winning<00:01:20.130> it

score if we were chance of winning it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
score if we were chance of winning it
went<00:01:20.520> nowhere<00:01:21.420> near<00:01:21.689> according<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.170> our<00:01:22.200> plans

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
went nowhere near according to our plans

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.130 
went nowhere near according to our plans
to<00:01:22.650> tell<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.890> truth<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.250> were<00:01:23.869> we<00:01:24.869> were<00:01:24.960> very

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
to tell the truth we were we were very

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.749 
to tell the truth we were we were very
disappointing<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.830> believed<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.460> way<00:01:26.580> that

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
disappointing we believed the way that

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.910 
disappointing we believed the way that
we<00:01:26.820> battered<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.409> nowhere<00:01:28.770> near

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
we battered was you know nowhere near

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.530 
we battered was you know nowhere near
good<00:01:29.040> enough<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.400> win<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> World<00:01:30.299> Cup<00:01:30.509> game

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
good enough to win a World Cup game

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.200 
good enough to win a World Cup game
against<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.140> good<00:01:31.259> Pakistan<00:01:31.680> side<00:01:32.180> we've<00:01:33.180> got

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
against a good Pakistan side we've got

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.490 
against a good Pakistan side we've got
some<00:01:33.360> thinking<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> do<00:01:33.960> about<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> way

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
some thinking to do about that the way

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.300 
some thinking to do about that the way
that<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:34.740> better<00:01:34.890> today

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
that we better today

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.370 
that we better today
as<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.909> said<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.720> seventy<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.229> for

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
as I said one for seventy or one for

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.600 
as I said one for seventy or one for
nearly<00:01:37.530> 80<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.770> think<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.040> were<00:01:38.130> at<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.369> stage

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
nearly 80 I think we were at one stage

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.370 
nearly 80 I think we were at one stage
all<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.939> 177<00:01:39.780> s<00:01:39.869> not<00:01:39.990> good<00:01:40.110> enough<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
all that 177 s not good enough and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.810 
all that 177 s not good enough and
that's<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.250> that's<00:01:41.430> not<00:01:41.520> gonna<00:01:41.670> win

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that's not you know that's not gonna win

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.310 
that's not you know that's not gonna win
you<00:01:41.880> many<00:01:42.090> games<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.450> cricket<00:01:42.659> well<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.079> tried

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you many games of cricket well we tried

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.840 
you many games of cricket well we tried
valent<00:01:43.829> ly<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.040> tried<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.369> hard<00:01:44.399> as<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.700> could

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
valent ly we tried as hard as we could

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.530 
valent ly we tried as hard as we could
but<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:46.079> weren't<00:01:46.560> good<00:01:46.649> enough<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.540> think

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
but just weren't good enough I think

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.859 
but just weren't good enough I think
I'll<00:01:48.659> give<00:01:48.899> credit<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.310> entire<00:01:51.090> team<00:01:51.420> was

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
I'll give credit to the entire team was

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.420 
I'll give credit to the entire team was
the<00:01:52.200> way<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.530> played<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.829> think<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.310> played

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the way we played I think we played

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.580 
the way we played I think we played
superb<00:01:54.149> cricket<00:01:54.540> especially<00:01:55.049> when<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.380> when

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
superb cricket especially when we when

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.770 
superb cricket especially when we when
we<00:01:55.740> were<00:01:55.920> when<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:56.909> were<00:01:56.939> balling<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.450> would<00:01:57.600> say

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
we were when we were balling I would say

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.999 
we were when we were balling I would say
I<00:01:57.810> would<00:01:57.990> give<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> ball<00:01:58.439> us<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> bit<00:01:58.979> more

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
I would give the ball us a bit more

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.149 
I would give the ball us a bit more
credit<00:01:59.490> than<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.820> than<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> batsmen<00:02:00.719> yeah<00:02:01.159> it

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
credit than the than the batsmen yeah it

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.440 
credit than the than the batsmen yeah it
was<00:02:02.399> not<00:02:02.670> easy<00:02:02.939> out<00:02:03.090> there

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
was not easy out there

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.630 
was not easy out there
it<00:02:03.810> was<00:02:04.079> difficult<00:02:04.890> when<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.159> were<00:02:05.250> batting

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it was difficult when you were batting

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.440 
it was difficult when you were batting
but<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.119> mean<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.170> guys<00:02:07.350> really<00:02:07.710> played

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
but I mean the guys really played

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.300 
but I mean the guys really played
tremendously<00:02:09.450> well<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.800> pulled<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.250> a

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
tremendously well and we pulled it a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.229 
tremendously well and we pulled it a
full<00:02:11.550> o<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.730> victory

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.059 

look<00:02:16.239> definitely<00:02:16.510> an<00:02:16.930> achievement<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.739> beat

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
look definitely an achievement to beat

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.179 
look definitely an achievement to beat
Australia<00:02:19.079> as<00:02:20.079> I<00:02:20.260> said<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.680> was<00:02:20.859> not<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
Australia as I said it was not the

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.250 
Australia as I said it was not the
easiest<00:02:21.219> of<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.760> pitches<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.299> do<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:23.079> play

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
easiest of the pitches to do to play

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.959 
easiest of the pitches to do to play
play<00:02:23.680> cricket<00:02:23.920> overall<00:02:24.400> because<00:02:24.609> it<00:02:24.849> was<00:02:24.939> a

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
play cricket overall because it was a

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.550 
play cricket overall because it was a
used<00:02:25.239> pitch<00:02:25.510> when<00:02:25.719> they<00:02:25.840> play<00:02:26.019> they<00:02:26.079> play<00:02:26.319> the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
used pitch when they play they play the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.050 
used pitch when they play they play the
game<00:02:26.769> here<00:02:26.980> before<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.310> ball<00:02:27.459> was<00:02:27.489> turning

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
game here before the ball was turning

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.240 
game here before the ball was turning
and<00:02:28.239> it<00:02:28.420> was<00:02:28.540> just<00:02:28.750> sort<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:28.959> up<00:02:29.859> and<00:02:30.069> down<00:02:30.220> a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
and it was just sort of up and down a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.520 
and it was just sort of up and down a
little<00:02:30.489> bit<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.000> yeah<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.170> definitely

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
little bit and yeah it is definitely

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.509 
little bit and yeah it is definitely
achievement<00:02:33.310> 176<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.390> thought<00:02:34.739> was<00:02:35.739> definitely

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
achievement 176 I thought was definitely

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.460 
achievement 176 I thought was definitely
get<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.730> ball<00:02:36.939> but<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.540> way<00:02:37.689> we<00:02:37.870> got<00:02:38.079> it

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
get a ball but the way we got it

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.470 
get a ball but the way we got it
you<00:02:38.709> know<00:02:38.829> maybe<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.370> little<00:02:39.579> sketchy<00:02:39.849> at<00:02:40.299> the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
you know maybe a little sketchy at the

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.599 
you know maybe a little sketchy at the
end<00:02:40.629> but<00:02:40.840> overall<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.709> superb<00:02:42.430> performance

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
end but overall a superb performance

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.660 
end but overall a superb performance
talking<00:02:43.540> about<00:02:43.719> aside<00:02:44.019> Shafiq<00:02:44.349> I<00:02:44.469> think<00:02:44.709> he's

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
talking about aside Shafiq I think he's

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.660 
talking about aside Shafiq I think he's
becoming<00:02:46.200> mature<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.590> immature<00:02:47.680> everyday<00:02:48.639> I

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
becoming mature and immature everyday I

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.000 
becoming mature and immature everyday I
mean<00:02:48.970> not<00:02:49.450> only<00:02:49.480> this<00:02:50.139> series<00:02:50.530> but<00:02:50.680> even<00:02:50.919> if

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
mean not only this series but even if

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.619 
mean not only this series but even if
you<00:02:51.099> go<00:02:51.189> back<00:02:51.400> in<00:02:51.579> the<00:02:51.639> New<00:02:51.760> Zealand<00:02:52.120> he<00:02:52.239> played

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
you go back in the New Zealand he played

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.690 
you go back in the New Zealand he played
some<00:02:52.840> real<00:02:53.260> good<00:02:53.470> knocks<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.069> he's<00:02:54.489> very

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
some real good knocks and he's very

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.089 
some real good knocks and he's very
steady<00:02:55.120> he's<00:02:55.329> not<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.510> big<00:02:55.780> hitter<00:02:55.989> but<00:02:56.980> you

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
steady he's not a big hitter but you

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.949 
steady he's not a big hitter but you
would<00:02:57.220> say<00:02:57.459> but<00:02:57.730> he's<00:02:58.030> quietly<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.900> know

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
would say but he's quietly you know

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.390 
would say but he's quietly you know
maneuvers<00:02:59.439> the<00:02:59.530> ball<00:02:59.709> here<00:02:59.919> and<00:02:59.950> there<00:03:00.220> and

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
maneuvers the ball here and there and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.159 
maneuvers the ball here and there and
picks<00:03:01.060> up<00:03:01.180> runs<00:03:01.450> he<00:03:01.569> picks<00:03:01.720> up<00:03:01.810> boundaries

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:02.169 
picks up runs he picks up boundaries

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.920 
picks up runs he picks up boundaries
also<00:03:02.349> so<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:03.280> know<00:03:03.400> at<00:03:04.209> number<00:03:04.569> three<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.810> think

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
also so you know at number three I think
