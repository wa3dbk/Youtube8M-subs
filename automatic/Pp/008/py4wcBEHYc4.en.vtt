decides<00:01:07.729> how<00:01:08.729> would<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.060> rate<00:01:09.299> yourself<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
decides how would you rate yourself as a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.190 
decides how would you rate yourself as a
defender<00:01:10.950> at<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.250> stage<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:13.140> my

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
defender at this stage I think my

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.630 
defender at this stage I think my
defense<00:01:13.500> has<00:01:13.619> gotten<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> lot<00:01:14.130> better<00:01:14.340> actually

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
defense has gotten a lot better actually

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.490 
defense has gotten a lot better actually
that's<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:15.810> thing<00:01:15.930> I've<00:01:16.049> been<00:01:16.200> working

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
that's the one thing I've been working

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.770 
that's the one thing I've been working
on<00:01:16.619> consistently<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.520> that's<00:01:18.390> area<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.750> my

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
on consistently and that's area in my

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.810 
on consistently and that's area in my
game<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> wanted<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.500> improve<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.549> i<00:01:20.610> think

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
game I wanted to improve on and i think

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.670 
game I wanted to improve on and i think
i<00:01:20.880> did<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.229> what<00:01:22.229> would<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.380> say<00:01:22.500> your

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
i did so what would you say your

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.560 
i did so what would you say your
greatest<00:01:23.130> strength<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.790> bring<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> an

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
greatest strength is you can bring to an

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.880 
greatest strength is you can bring to an
my<00:01:25.570> ability<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:25.960> shoot<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.170> ball<00:01:26.409> and<00:01:26.619> spread

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
my ability to shoot the ball and spread

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.350 
my ability to shoot the ball and spread
the<00:01:27.010> floor<00:01:27.130> I<00:01:27.190> mean<00:01:27.490> if<00:01:27.640> you're<00:01:28.030> shooting<00:01:28.180> the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
the floor I mean if you're shooting the

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.300 
the floor I mean if you're shooting the
ball<00:01:28.510> and<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:29.110> opens<00:01:29.380> up<00:01:29.470> inside<00:01:29.770> guys<00:01:30.010> as<00:01:30.190> well

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
ball and it opens up inside guys as well

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.980 
ball and it opens up inside guys as well
so<00:01:30.700> i<00:01:30.760> think<00:01:30.820> i<00:01:31.000> can<00:01:31.060> knock<00:01:31.270> down<00:01:31.299> shots<00:01:31.690> and

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
so i think i can knock down shots and

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.750 
so i think i can knock down shots and

strength<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.720> way<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.960> game<00:02:07.990> as<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.289> ball<00:02:08.530> I'd

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
strength the way the game as a ball I'd

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.130 
strength the way the game as a ball I'd
hope<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:10.030> think<00:02:10.509> my<00:02:10.600> ability<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:10.929> shoot<00:02:11.080> the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
hope so I think my ability to shoot the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.070 
hope so I think my ability to shoot the
ball<00:02:11.350> is<00:02:11.470> one<00:02:11.590> thing<00:02:11.769> I<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.190> can<00:02:12.940> do<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.300> the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
ball is one thing I I can do and the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.420 
ball is one thing I I can do and the
league<00:02:14.260> right<00:02:14.290> now<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.769> a<00:02:14.800> lot<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.130> shooting<00:02:15.400> a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
league right now is a lot of shooting a

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.530 
league right now is a lot of shooting a
lot<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.610> three-point<00:02:15.760> shooting<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.360> think

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
lot of three-point shooting and I think

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.229 
lot of three-point shooting and I think
I<00:02:16.570> could<00:02:16.720> bring<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.200> team<00:02:18.239> wouldn't

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239
