 and on Thursdays this time I bring you 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.520
 a video to show you how to make a 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.349
 flower organizer to organize your 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.009
 Makeup can only do what 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.009
 you want 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:35.040
 well I hope you stay to see it and 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:38.310
 let's start with the video we're going to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.100
 need a scissors rule or 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.290
 some pearls to decorate glue 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.800
 or silicon what you want to use me 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.920
 I'm going to use silicon and a cardboard sheet 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.040
 of rubber the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.440
 measure where we are going to put it 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.430
 and cut the parts that we're going to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.190
 need I cut a is a picture for 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.580
 my little box and then as far as 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.470
 let's want what will go around 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.350
 our box of the height that we are going 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.160
 to love and then we will cover everything 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.760
 that was already here in my the base of the 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.780
 box after'll delete what is 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.780
 that will form the box 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.060
 and here I already have all the parts 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.090
 I did not have enough of those and that 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.080
 I still looked a little bit the white of 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.080
 the cardboard 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.260
 and then what we are going to do is 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.240
 stick it 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.060
 and so we will have our little box 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.630
 to make the compartments of our 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.210
 Our organizer's box 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.189
 already run this I'm going to measure the blushes 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.640
 so that the compartments remain 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.710
 exact and rumors and 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.200
 in the end I decided to make these 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.100
 compartments to put some other 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.610
 little things 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.130
 to my mind and bronzing powder and other 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.220
 little things as I say you can 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.120
 use as you want and in the end I 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.430
 you can leave it like this but I 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.000

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.000

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.840

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.310

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.770
