00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.960
 in the time of a single apnea I can live 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.960
 the most unpredictable of adventures 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:45.070
 experience a sense of absolute freedom e 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.070
 all this to me is pure magic 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.610
 on the surface with the last breath 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.840
 abandons me to a new dimension 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.840
 and so the adventure begins 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.920
 this context solitude is beautiful me 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.920
 feel good about myself 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.070
 after a few meters of depth it begins to 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.070
 fly from a fantastic moment 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.890
 immediately after he hears an old man emerge 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.020
 instinct to get food in 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.200
 natural way like mine did 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.200
 ancestors 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.110
 I chose only one shot as available 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.760
 it was a sign of destiny 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.820
 whatever happens, that will be the blow 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.820
 quite right 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.920
 here a single pne a becomes a 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.920
 ocean of emotions
