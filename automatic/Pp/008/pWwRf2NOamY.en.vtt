it provides shelter and a roof above
we've<00:00:58.199> got<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.649> put<00:00:58.829> our<00:00:58.920> hook<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
we've got to do is put our hook on a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.450 
we've got to do is put our hook on a
post<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.050> example<00:01:01.280> gonna<00:01:02.280> go

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
post like this one for example gonna go

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.030 
post like this one for example gonna go
somewhere<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.030> vicinity<00:01:03.180> right<00:01:04.040> then

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
somewhere in this vicinity right then

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.039 
somewhere in this vicinity right then
our<00:01:05.070> eyelet<00:01:06.030> has<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.570> mounted<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
our eyelet has to be mounted on the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.870 
our eyelet has to be mounted on the
ceiling<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.619> roof<00:01:07.799> part<00:01:08.070> approximately

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
ceiling the roof part approximately

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.550 
ceiling the roof part approximately
three<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.119> four<00:01:09.299> feet<00:01:09.479> away<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.260> post

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
three to four feet away from that post

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.140 
three to four feet away from that post
so<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.040> porch<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.340> perfect<00:01:12.000> especially

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
so this porch is perfect especially

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.510 
so this porch is perfect especially
during<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.750> rainy<00:01:12.960> day<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:14.100> mount<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
during a rainy day so we just mount that

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.380 
during a rainy day so we just mount that
up<00:01:14.729> into<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.180> stud<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:17.060> connect<00:01:18.060> our<00:01:18.180> string

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
up into the stud and connect our string

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.039 
up into the stud and connect our string
that's<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
that's it

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.570 
that's it
so<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> first<00:01:19.890> thing<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.430> is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
so the first thing we have to do is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.310 
so the first thing we have to do is
install<00:01:20.790> our<00:01:20.970> eyelet<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> pre-drill

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
install our eyelet going to pre-drill

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.219 
install our eyelet going to pre-drill
into<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> ceiling<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.250> screw<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> holid<00:01:23.880> in

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
into the ceiling and screw the holid in

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.539 
into the ceiling and screw the holid in
while<00:01:25.229> Freddie's<00:01:25.560> doing<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.950> I'm<00:01:26.130> gonna<00:01:26.310> saw

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
while Freddie's doing that I'm gonna saw

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.670 
while Freddie's doing that I'm gonna saw
our<00:01:26.700> hook<00:01:26.909> right<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.810> post<00:01:28.110> about<00:01:28.350> three

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
our hook right on this post about three

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.080 
our hook right on this post about three
and<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.829> half<00:01:28.860> feet<00:01:29.189> from<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> floor

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and a half feet from the floor

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:44.149 
and a half feet from the floor
choose<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> height<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:30.930> good<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.410 

all<00:01:45.159> right<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.520> next<00:01:45.550> step<00:01:45.820> we<00:01:46.150> need<00:01:46.270> to

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
all right so the next step we need to

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.450 
all right so the next step we need to
connect<00:01:46.750> our<00:01:46.870> string<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.740> easiest<00:01:48.010> way<00:01:48.190> to<00:01:48.220> do

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
connect our string the easiest way to do

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.890 
connect our string the easiest way to do
this<00:01:48.610> is<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:49.000> first<00:01:49.180> connect<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:49.810> the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
this is to first connect it to the

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.660 
this is to first connect it to the
eyelet<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.500> then<00:01:50.950> what<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.190> want<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.430> do<00:01:51.520> is

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
eyelet and then what you want to do is

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.000 
eyelet and then what you want to do is
run<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.150> string<00:01:52.479> over<00:01:52.690> and<00:01:53.020> connect<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:53.860> to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
run the string over and connect it to

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.490 
run the string over and connect it to
the<00:01:54.130> ring<00:01:54.369> as<00:01:54.580> it's<00:01:54.970> already<00:01:55.270> sits<00:01:55.780> on<00:01:56.020> the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
the ring as it's already sits on the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.230 
the ring as it's already sits on the
hook<00:01:56.740> just<00:01:57.220> remember<00:01:57.520> to<00:01:57.610> keep<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.940> little<00:01:58.119> bit

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
hook just remember to keep a little bit

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.590 
hook just remember to keep a little bit
of<00:01:58.450> slack<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:03.640> that's<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.150> hook<00:02:04.450> comes

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
of slack well that's it hook comes

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.690
