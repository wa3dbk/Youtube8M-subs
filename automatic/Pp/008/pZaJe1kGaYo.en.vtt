let's see them joven actually in this
video<00:00:10.400> we're<00:00:10.549> going<00:00:10.639> to<00:00:10.700> do<00:00:10.849> the<00:00:10.969> add<00:00:11.120> a<00:00:11.150> box

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
video we're going to do the add a box

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.910 
video we're going to do the add a box
review<00:00:11.660> or

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
review or

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.960 
review or
the<00:00:13.070> HSP<00:00:14.030> and<00:00:14.980> I'm<00:00:15.980> guessing<00:00:16.580> because<00:00:16.730> I'm

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
the HSP and I'm guessing because I'm

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.060 
the HSP and I'm guessing because I'm
waiting<00:00:17.210> on<00:00:17.450> two<00:00:17.690> arriving<00:00:18.470> from<00:00:18.740> my<00:00:18.860> main

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
waiting on two arriving from my main

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.130 
waiting on two arriving from my main
sponsor<00:00:19.700> but<00:00:19.970> actually<00:00:20.390> I'm<00:00:20.570> guessing<00:00:20.990> by<00:00:21.110> the

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
sponsor but actually I'm guessing by the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.200 
sponsor but actually I'm guessing by the
size<00:00:21.529> of<00:00:21.680> this<00:00:21.800> box<00:00:22.130> but<00:00:22.730> this<00:00:22.880> one<00:00:23.090> is

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
size of this box but this one is

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.050 
size of this box but this one is
actually<00:00:23.330> be<00:00:23.720> 1/16<00:00:24.560> scale<00:00:24.590> and<00:00:25.130> I'm<00:00:25.849> not

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
actually be 1/16 scale and I'm not

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.120 
actually be 1/16 scale and I'm not
entirely<00:00:26.360> sure<00:00:26.510> of<00:00:26.750> what<00:00:27.110> to<00:00:27.140> expect<00:00:27.380> yet<00:00:27.920> it

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
entirely sure of what to expect yet it

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.580 
entirely sure of what to expect yet it
might<00:00:28.340> be<00:00:28.580> nitro<00:00:29.480> it<00:00:29.600> might<00:00:29.750> be<00:00:29.900> electric<00:00:30.140> all

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
might be nitro it might be electric all

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.060 
might be nitro it might be electric all
I<00:00:30.650> heard<00:00:30.890> was<00:00:31.100> I'm<00:00:31.490> getting<00:00:31.820> on<00:00:32.150> 1/16<00:00:32.720> scale

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
I heard was I'm getting on 1/16 scale

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.310 
I heard was I'm getting on 1/16 scale

the HSP 27 megahertz radio system so as
I<00:03:28.610> said<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.000> am<00:03:29.300> encouraging<00:03:30.200> companies<00:03:30.500> now<00:03:30.860> to

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
I said I am encouraging companies now to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.580 
I said I am encouraging companies now to
start<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.820> using<00:03:32.240> the<00:03:32.480> 2.4<00:03:33.020> gigahertz<00:03:33.230> radio

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
start to using the 2.4 gigahertz radio

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.010 
start to using the 2.4 gigahertz radio
systems<00:03:34.130> but<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:34.940> mean<00:03:35.120> I'm<00:03:35.360> not<00:03:35.390> saying<00:03:35.900> that

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
systems but I mean I'm not saying that

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.570 
systems but I mean I'm not saying that
these<00:03:36.170> don't<00:03:36.470> do<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:36.650> good<00:03:36.830> job<00:03:36.890> because<00:03:37.250> they

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
these don't do a good job because they

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.120 
these don't do a good job because they
do<00:03:37.640> these<00:03:38.330> radio<00:03:38.630> systems<00:03:39.080> do<00:03:39.620> good<00:03:39.890> enough

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
do these radio systems do good enough

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.490 
do these radio systems do good enough
job<00:03:40.340> for<00:03:40.580> now<00:03:40.730> however<00:03:41.270> I<00:03:41.450> always<00:03:41.780> encourage

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
2.4 gigahertz radio systems actually

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.010 
2.4 gigahertz radio systems actually
when<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:54.560> test<00:03:54.950> I'll<00:03:55.190> see<00:03:55.430> these<00:03:55.640> days<00:03:56.020> and

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
when I test I'll see these days and

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.020 
when I test I'll see these days and
often<00:03:57.260> we're<00:03:57.560> in<00:03:57.770> populated<00:03:58.370> areas

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
often we're in populated areas

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.280 
often we're in populated areas
I<00:03:59.980> nearly<00:04:00.980> always<00:04:01.250> now<00:04:01.910> will<00:04:02.480> actually<00:04:02.690> test

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
I nearly always now will actually test

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.220 
I nearly always now will actually test
them<00:04:03.470> using<00:04:03.950> 2.40<00:04:04.700> radio<00:04:05.060> systems<00:04:05.660> regardless

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
them using 2.40 radio systems regardless

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.880 
them using 2.40 radio systems regardless
of<00:04:06.980> which<00:04:08.170> radios<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.320> companies<00:04:09.710> will

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
of which radios the companies will

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.960 
of which radios the companies will
include<00:04:10.840> okay<00:04:11.840> so<00:04:11.980> next<00:04:12.980> coming<00:04:13.310> out<00:04:13.490> is<00:04:13.790> the

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
include okay so next coming out is the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.800 
include okay so next coming out is the
car<00:04:14.180> itself<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.790> it's<00:04:17.120> mounted<00:04:17.510> on<00:04:17.600> one<00:04:17.780> of

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
car itself and it's mounted on one of
