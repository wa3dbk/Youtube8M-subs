00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.220
I love dance

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.039
it's what i like most.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.279
I think I do since age four
since my mother has also liked

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.789
and we did together.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.880
With dancing, besides exercise and more flexibility

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.300
makes me happy

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.300
and i enjoy great at home and at my dance classes.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.810
I also like pop music

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.230
I'm a fan of Auryn and One Direction.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.230
I also enjoy reading, baking and especially play with my dog​​.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.880
When I meet my friends usually go for a drink, see a movie,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.980
walk my dog ​​in the park

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.980
or stay at my house and we had so much fun playing the console.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.080
All started about two or three years ago

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.350
with foot pain when walking

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.510
and then when I did my homework by poor posture.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.560
I made several radiographs
and toldme that i had scoliosis

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.069
and a lumbar pinch

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.789
and could be hereditary as my father also has it.

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:13.409
Over time

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:19.819
I have fostered in the back curvature and they told me that i had to put an orthopedic corset

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.500
to avoid worsening.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.600
I have to wear the corset all day

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.700
least for the shower and for my dance class.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.700
With this new application

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.500
it really is very simple.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.300
Only I have to indicate where it hurts and how

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.400
and so I have a more accurate monitoring .

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.000
And best of all, I can send it to my doctor

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400
and he can help me better.
