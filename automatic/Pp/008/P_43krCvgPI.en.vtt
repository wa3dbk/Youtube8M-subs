00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
the first glimpse of seeing the game in

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.600 
the first glimpse of seeing the game in
first-person<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.360> third-person<00:00:12.590> and<00:00:13.610> also

first-person and third-person and also

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.210 
first-person and third-person and also
the<00:00:14.820> fact<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.179> destruction<00:00:16.080> will<00:00:16.500> be<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the fact that destruction will be in the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.160 
the fact that destruction will be in the
game<00:00:17.460> before<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.970> show<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.539> first<00:00:18.720> glimpse

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
game before I show you the first glimpse

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.140 
game before I show you the first glimpse
of<00:00:19.230> split-screen<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:20.220> first-person<00:00:20.699> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
of split-screen in first-person and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.759 
of split-screen in first-person and
third-person<00:00:21.410> let's<00:00:22.410> talk<00:00:22.650> about

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
third-person let's talk about

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.890 
third-person let's talk about
destruction<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:24.060> not<00:00:24.480> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.810> be

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
destruction so it's not going to be

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.720 
destruction so it's not going to be
anything<00:00:25.199> like<00:00:25.560> battlefield<00:00:26.400> where

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
anything like battlefield where

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.870 
anything like battlefield where
buildings<00:00:27.510> will<00:00:28.019> fall<00:00:28.349> down<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:28.949> example<00:00:29.400> but

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
buildings will fall down for example but

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.849 
buildings will fall down for example but
EA<00:00:30.179> stars<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.900> Twitter<00:00:31.199> did<00:00:31.439> confirm<00:00:31.830> that

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
EA stars on Twitter did confirm that

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.650 
EA stars on Twitter did confirm that
they<00:00:32.189> are<00:00:32.219> using<00:00:32.369> destruction<00:00:33.360> where<00:00:33.510> it

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
they are using destruction where it

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.870 
they are using destruction where it
makes<00:00:33.840> sense<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.710> also<00:00:35.010> working<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.730> create

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
makes sense but also working to create

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.850 
makes sense but also working to create
something<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.780> authentic<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
something that is authentic to the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.060 
something that is authentic to the
universe<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.910> my<00:00:39.210> guess<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:40.070> certain

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
universe so my guess is that certain

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.389 
universe so my guess is that certain
parts<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.820> buildings<00:00:42.510> may<00:00:42.809> collapse<00:00:43.559> causing

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
parts of buildings may collapse causing

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.760 
parts of buildings may collapse causing
death<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.090> people<00:00:45.989> underneath<00:00:46.260> them<00:00:46.590> for

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
death to people underneath them for

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.150 
death to people underneath them for
example<00:00:47.160> movie<00:00:47.399> maybe<00:00:47.670> sand<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.649> on<00:00:49.649> Tatooine

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
example movie maybe sand in on Tatooine

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.670 
example movie maybe sand in on Tatooine
on<00:00:50.399> Endor<00:00:51.149> you'll<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.870> log<00:00:52.170> swinging

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
on Endor you'll have the log swinging

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.939 
on Endor you'll have the log swinging
into<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.489> 80s<00:00:53.820> tease<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.390> example<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.770> can

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
into the 80s tease for example and I can

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.670 
into the 80s tease for example and I can
definitely<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.579> being<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.180> really<00:00:57.780> fun

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
definitely see this being a really fun

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.130 
definitely see this being a really fun
feature<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.910> maps<00:01:00.239> which<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.870> cool

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
feature of the maps which is really cool

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.340 
feature of the maps which is really cool
because<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.949> nice<00:01:02.579> variety<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.539> terrain

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
because of the nice variety of terrain

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.740 
because of the nice variety of terrain
but<00:01:04.920> anyway<00:01:05.309> let's<00:01:05.610> look<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.030> split-screen

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
but anyway let's look at split-screen

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.320 
but anyway let's look at split-screen
first-person<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.740> third-person<00:01:08.180> on<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
first-person and third-person on the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.910 
first-person and third-person on the
screen<00:01:09.600> right<00:01:09.630> now<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> first

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
screen right now you can see the first

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.710 
screen right now you can see the first
look<00:01:11.189> at<00:01:11.340> split-screen<00:01:12.000> specifically

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
look at split-screen specifically

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600 
look at split-screen specifically
first-person<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.650> third-person<00:01:13.710> which<00:01:14.490> is

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
first-person and third-person which is

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
first-person and third-person which is
absolutely<00:01:14.939> awesome<00:01:15.450> now<00:01:16.140> obviously<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.740> is

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
absolutely awesome now obviously this is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.920 
absolutely awesome now obviously this is
just<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.130> proof<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.460> concept<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.420> part

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
just a proof of concept and it was part

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.280 
just a proof of concept and it was part
of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.290> developer<00:01:19.710> diary<00:01:19.979> episode<00:01:20.970> 14<00:01:21.659> dice

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
not a huge fan of that and I'm sure a

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.580 
not a huge fan of that and I'm sure a
lot<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.119> people<00:02:00.210> aren't<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.020> was<00:02:01.259> looking

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
lot of people aren't and I was looking

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.380 
lot of people aren't and I was looking
through<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.950> battlefront<00:02:02.399> read<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.850> some

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
through the battlefront read it and some

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.959 
through the battlefront read it and some
people<00:02:03.420> really<00:02:03.899> didn't<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.159> if

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
people really didn't like this and if

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.819 
people really didn't like this and if
this<00:02:06.240> was<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.530> far

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
this was going to be like and so far

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.619

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310
