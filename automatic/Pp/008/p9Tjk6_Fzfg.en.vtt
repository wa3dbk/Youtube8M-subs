00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.330
 To Shiraito City is Mitsu introduce this time of Hello Shirai music is here and here 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.940
 Sakae's Flat Booth Series 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.940
 Tsuneya Stand and Tam Stand Introduction 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.830
 Though it is flat base series this is a common tripod 8 flat base is not a form 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.940
 Ne 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.700
 Hey in high position 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.810
 Here it is the cat long 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:33.610
 Flat base chin bottom is long, there is such a difference 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:37.840
 The high position is the low position, so it 's also related to its stability 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.400
 The higher the stability, the lower the stability. 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.190
 However 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:48.770
 Weight will be lighter 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:52.310
 And some people like this because it's a bit like a shaky swing 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.880
 Though it is common to other stands of snare star though 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:59.430
 This angle adjustment This would be staged by 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.610
 It has changed one by one stage to say 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.480
 It is great if there is a group 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:11.820
 It seems to be difficult to set up, but it is here 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:17.430
 Well , I think it's six stages so I can find a good position soon 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:22.540
 Yes it is one of this way I Tam stand if you were setting this 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.310
 You can get close to the bass drum 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.560
 In type lawmakers now 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.490
 You can bring 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.520
 This much to reverse 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.770
 Ne 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:42.399
 It is whether the ordinary for folder is you can bring in this way and here True 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:46.869
 Or could not get the balance between not use a heavy stand ne form of do those really good heavy 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:50.540
 Though it was very difficult and not taken from the bass drum 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:54.080
 In that case, I already asked for it below 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.250
 This firm is a sphere in light stand to To in the support 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.950
 It is a generation 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:05.380
 I have done it a Now this destination though is what do I arm it and be able to support 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:12.160
 The sound here is open and doesn't feel well stretched 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:14.890
 It is in this way or a little also is packed with sound and support and we spread a little Eemaa 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.000
 It may be easy to do this as a control. 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.680
 so 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.530
 I set it like this , and at this point there are just enough pipes 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.790
 If you like to work, you can make it for a long time 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.280
 Say cutter 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.990
 Because there is an effect like living safely to cut such a family pipe 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.580
 It will be a very low setting if you get a bit off 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.290
 Can be realized 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.070
 Yes it is flat base though it is said that if you are worried about that stability or 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.930
 think 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:50.200
 A little in either abandon gotten it be yeah perfectly stable and the use try I have hit 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.200
 I will 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.620
 bj 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.620
 Oh 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.910
 n 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:18.600
 I 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:21.600
 Good Shi tbl 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.600
ー

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.660
 How is it to say yes? Flat based tom stand and snare 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.080
 Pat stand 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.330
 We ne stable 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:43.880
 It has enough stability if it thinks by the usual live and 演奏 performance 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:46.220
 Point It is by all means It is a hardware already this foot was like the terminal hair Gochagucha' 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.300
 It is not suitable for the kit 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.770
 Cymbals to the high three four and Wantamu 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:58.650
 That's great if that's the case 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:01.770
 I think it is very easy to use as a setting, so by all means it is one by all means 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:07.770
 Easy only in the studio of the drum beating Teru 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:10.110
 I think that it will be easier to balance the sound, so what I introduced this time is the flat base of Sakae 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.580
 It was a Tam stand and a snare stand 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.580
 It was Shiraito secret of Shirai Music
