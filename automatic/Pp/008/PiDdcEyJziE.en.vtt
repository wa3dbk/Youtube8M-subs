we'll<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.179> we'll<00:02:03.329> place<00:02:03.600> these<00:02:03.810> small

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
we'll do is we'll place these small

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.279 
we'll do is we'll place these small
incisions<00:02:05.429> in<00:02:05.549> your<00:02:05.700> abdomen<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.780> largest<00:02:07.170> of

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
incisions in your abdomen the largest of

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.900 
incisions in your abdomen the largest of
which<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.439> about<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> size<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.220> my<00:02:08.369> thumb<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
which is about the size of my thumb and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.669 
which is about the size of my thumb and
the<00:02:09.390> smallest<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.869> which<00:02:10.019> is<00:02:10.170> about<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.470> size

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
the smallest of which is about the size

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.619 
the smallest of which is about the size
of<00:02:10.800> my<00:02:10.950> pinky<00:02:11.129> but<00:02:11.849> most<00:02:12.120> patients<00:02:12.540> have

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
of my pinky but most patients have

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.630 
of my pinky but most patients have
between<00:02:13.170> three<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.560> five<00:02:13.920> incisions<00:02:14.489> on

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
between three and five incisions on

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.970 
between three and five incisions on
their<00:02:14.790> abdomen<00:02:15.349> through<00:02:16.349> those<00:02:16.650> incisions

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
their abdomen through those incisions

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.039 
their abdomen through those incisions
were<00:02:17.280> able<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.640> put<00:02:17.970> these<00:02:18.120> sleeves<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.900> we

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
were able to put these sleeves that we

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.770 
were able to put these sleeves that we
call<00:02:19.260> trocars<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.459> trocars<00:02:20.970> allow<00:02:21.299> us<00:02:21.540> to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
call trocars the trocars allow us to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.140 
call trocars the trocars allow us to
take<00:02:21.959> these<00:02:22.170> instruments<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.129> place<00:02:23.910> them

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
take these instruments and place them

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.850 
take these instruments and place them
into<00:02:24.330> your<00:02:24.510> abdomen<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.049> pelvis<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.620> really

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
into your abdomen and pelvis and really

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.220 
into your abdomen and pelvis and really
complete<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.340> procedure<00:02:26.660> once<00:02:27.660> all<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
complete the procedure once all the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.530 
complete the procedure once all the
trocars<00:02:28.620> are<00:02:28.769> in<00:02:28.860> place<00:02:29.099> we<00:02:29.940> take<00:02:30.209> what<00:02:30.420> we

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
trocars are in place we take what we

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.300 
trocars are in place we take what we
call<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.870> robotic<00:02:31.349> patient<00:02:31.829> cart<00:02:32.069> which

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
call the robotic patient cart which

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.890 
call the robotic patient cart which
looks<00:02:32.579> like<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.760> robotic<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.450> we<00:02:33.569> bring<00:02:33.780> it

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
looks like a robotic and we bring it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.809 
looks like a robotic and we bring it
over<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.410> side<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.829> bed<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.310> we

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
over to the side of the bed and we

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.789 
over to the side of the bed and we
attach<00:02:36.120> all<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.420> robot<00:02:36.989> arms<00:02:37.470> -<00:02:37.560> those

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
attach all the robot arms - those

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.670 
attach all the robot arms - those
trocars<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.730> then<00:02:39.329> we<00:02:39.599> can<00:02:39.780> use<00:02:39.959> instruments

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
trocars and then we can use instruments

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.130 
trocars and then we can use instruments
and<00:02:40.890> pass<00:02:41.370> them<00:02:41.640> into<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.030> arms<00:02:42.480> through<00:02:42.989> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
and pass them into the arms through the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.140 
and pass them into the arms through the
sleeves<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.739> into<00:02:44.340> your<00:02:44.459> abdomen<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.030> pelvis

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
sleeves and into your abdomen and pelvis

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.970 
sleeves and into your abdomen and pelvis
so<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.540> we<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:46.019> safely<00:02:46.290> complete<00:02:46.860> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
so that we can safely complete the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.069 
so that we can safely complete the
procedure<00:02:47.340> for<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.819> once<00:02:48.690> we're<00:02:48.870> done<00:02:48.930> with

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
procedure for you once we're done with

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.809 
procedure for you once we're done with
that<00:02:49.140> part<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.769> surgeon<00:02:50.099> actually<00:02:50.250> goes<00:02:50.549> over

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
that part the surgeon actually goes over

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.100 
that part the surgeon actually goes over
and<00:02:50.970> sits<00:02:51.180> down<00:02:51.269> at<00:02:51.540> what<00:02:51.660> we<00:02:51.780> call<00:02:51.959> the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
and sits down at what we call the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.990 
and sits down at what we call the
surgeon<00:02:52.319> console<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.160> then<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:53.819> use<00:02:53.970> a

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
surgeon console and then we use a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.569 
surgeon console and then we use a
combination<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.900> foot<00:02:55.200> pedals<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.829> hand

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
combination of foot pedals and hand

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.550 
combination of foot pedals and hand
controls<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.720> actually<00:02:58.079> control<00:02:58.440> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
controls to actually control the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.949 
controls to actually control the
instruments<00:02:59.280> the<00:03:00.060> hand<00:03:00.329> controls<00:03:00.690> move

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
instruments the hand controls move

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.449 
instruments the hand controls move
around<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.530> like<00:03:01.650> your<00:03:01.829> hands<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.340> your

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
around just like your hands and your

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.340 
around just like your hands and your
wrists<00:03:02.850> do<00:03:03.000> they<00:03:03.180> articulate<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.109> that

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
wrists do they articulate and that

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.490 
wrists do they articulate and that
allows<00:03:04.650> us<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.950> do<00:03:05.370> surgery<00:03:05.700> for<00:03:06.150> women<00:03:06.269> who

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
allows us to do surgery for women who

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.020 
allows us to do surgery for women who
previously<00:03:07.500> really<00:03:08.010> weren't<00:03:08.160> candidates<00:03:08.730> for

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
previously really weren't candidates for

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.970 
previously really weren't candidates for
minimally<00:03:09.420> invasive<00:03:09.959> surgery<00:03:10.410> for<00:03:10.590> example

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
minimally invasive surgery for example

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.580 
minimally invasive surgery for example
those<00:03:11.549> with<00:03:11.850> really<00:03:12.239> complex<00:03:12.660> anatomy<00:03:13.380> or

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
those with really complex anatomy or

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.949 
those with really complex anatomy or
multiple<00:03:14.430> previous<00:03:14.579> surgeries<00:03:15.030> or<00:03:15.510> very<00:03:15.750> high

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
multiple previous surgeries or very high

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.099 
multiple previous surgeries or very high
body<00:03:16.230> mass<00:03:16.500> index<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.269> an<00:03:18.389> example<00:03:18.720> of

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
body mass index this is an example of

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.259 
body mass index this is an example of
one<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.980> robotic<00:03:20.489> instruments<00:03:20.639> that<00:03:21.090> we

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
one of the robotic instruments that we

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.620 
one of the robotic instruments that we
use<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:22.069> we<00:03:23.069> place<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.639> instrument<00:03:24.269> into<00:03:24.420> the

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
use and we place the instrument into the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.050 
use and we place the instrument into the
robotic<00:03:25.079> arm<00:03:25.319> and<00:03:25.680> then<00:03:26.040> through<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.579> trocar

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
robotic arm and then through the trocar

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.819 
robotic arm and then through the trocar
that<00:03:27.269> we've<00:03:27.420> placed<00:03:27.660> into<00:03:27.989> your<00:03:28.019> abdomen<00:03:28.500> and

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
that we've placed into your abdomen and

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.830 
that we've placed into your abdomen and
then<00:03:29.310> we<00:03:29.430> use<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.940> tip<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.329> this<00:03:30.450> instrument

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
then we use the tip of this instrument

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.690 
then we use the tip of this instrument
to<00:03:31.170> perform<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> surgery<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.099> as<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.549> can

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
to perform the surgery and as you can

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.970 
to perform the surgery and as you can
see<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:32.970> tip<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.359> instrument<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.380> about

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
see the tip of the instrument is about

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.220 
see the tip of the instrument is about
the<00:03:35.250> size<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.819> penny<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.480> it's<00:03:36.630> much<00:03:36.900> smaller

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
the size of a penny so it's much smaller

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.610 
the size of a penny so it's much smaller
than<00:03:37.680> our<00:03:37.950> hands<00:03:38.639> and<00:03:39.269> unable<00:03:39.930> us<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.319> be<00:03:40.440> so

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
than our hands and unable us to be so

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.890 
than our hands and unable us to be so
much<00:03:40.739> more<00:03:40.950> precise<00:03:41.340> with<00:03:41.609> our<00:03:41.730> movements<00:03:42.180> why

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
much more precise with our movements why

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.809 
much more precise with our movements why
am<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.139> so<00:03:43.319> excited<00:03:43.440> about<00:03:43.919> the<00:03:44.069> da<00:03:44.160> Vinci<00:03:44.430> robot
