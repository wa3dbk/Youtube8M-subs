okay<00:00:01.620> I<00:00:01.650> know<00:00:01.800> that<00:00:01.920> we've<00:00:02.100> gone<00:00:02.340> into<00:00:02.610> the

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
okay I know that we've gone into the

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.490 
okay I know that we've gone into the
castle<00:00:03.120> week<00:00:03.240> and<00:00:03.540> programmed<00:00:04.259> it<00:00:04.380> into

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
castle week and programmed it into

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.320 
castle week and programmed it into
helicopter<00:00:05.160> mode<00:00:05.310> with<00:00:05.490> fixed<00:00:05.819> end<00:00:06.029> points

have any accidents or anything next
thing<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> transmitter<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.460> don't<00:00:50.700> want

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
thing in the transmitter you don't want

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.369 
thing in the transmitter you don't want
to<00:00:51.000> come<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> travel<00:00:52.050> adjust<00:00:52.440> menu<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:54.379> go

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
to come to the travel adjust menu and go

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.569 
to come to the travel adjust menu and go
to<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.100> throttle<00:00:58.010> here<00:00:59.010> at<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> throttle

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
to the throttle here at the throttle

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.080 
to the throttle here at the throttle
point<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.149> set<00:01:00.449> them<00:01:00.570> both<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:01.170> 50%<00:01:02.090> you're

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
point and set them both to 50% you're

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.630 
point and set them both to 50% you're
gonna<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.750> I'll<00:01:04.650> show<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:05.280> what

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
gonna have to go I'll show you here what

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.140 
gonna have to go I'll show you here what
we're<00:01:05.909> doing<00:01:05.939> two<00:01:06.240> sticks<00:01:07.820> 50%<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:11.150> at

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
we're doing two sticks 50% here and at

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.240 
we're doing two sticks 50% here and at
the<00:01:12.240> high<00:01:12.420> make<00:01:12.720> sure<00:01:12.840> that's<00:01:13.020> at<00:01:13.200> 50%<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:14.040> well

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the high make sure that's at 50% as well

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.980 
the high make sure that's at 50% as well
basically<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.270> gonna<00:01:15.360> make<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.780> look<00:01:15.930> like

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
basically it's gonna make it look like

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.450 
basically it's gonna make it look like
no<00:01:16.259> matter<00:01:16.409> where<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.830> are<00:01:16.860> with<00:01:17.250> your

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
no matter where you are with your

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.789 
no matter where you are with your
throttle<00:01:18.270> stick<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.990> you're<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
throttle stick that you're at the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.359 
throttle stick that you're at the
midpoint<00:01:21.530> this<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.650> how<00:01:22.770> we're<00:01:22.890> gonna<00:01:22.950> start

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
midpoint this is how we're gonna start

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.460 
midpoint this is how we're gonna start
with<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> programming<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.080> fixed<00:01:25.350> end

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
with the programming of the fixed end

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.640 
with the programming of the fixed end
points<00:01:26.509> so<00:01:27.509> now<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.780> you've<00:01:27.990> got<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.350> all

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
points so now that you've got this all

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.450 
points so now that you've got this all
set<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.040> go

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
set to go

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.640 
set to go
we've<00:01:29.729> got<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> motor<00:01:30.180> backed<00:01:30.479> out<00:01:30.720> you're<00:01:31.619> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
we've got the motor backed out you're a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.710 
we've got the motor backed out you're a
normal<00:01:31.920> mode<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.939> linear<00:01:33.150> throttle

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
normal mode and it's a linear throttle

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.380 
normal mode and it's a linear throttle

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
curve ESC is plugged in you're gonna

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.260 
curve ESC is plugged in you're gonna
first<00:01:36.930> provide<00:01:37.290> power<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.780> receiver<00:01:41.270> and

first provide power to the receiver and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.179 
first provide power to the receiver and
go<00:01:42.689> for<00:01:42.960> some<00:01:43.170> power<00:01:44.130> through<00:01:44.490> senior

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
go for some power through senior

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.510 
go for some power through senior
helicopter<00:01:48.140> ok<00:01:49.140> once<00:01:49.860> you've<00:01:50.009> powered<00:01:50.369> up<00:01:50.490> the

helicopter ok once you've powered up the
receiver<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:52.950> come<00:01:53.220> in

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.000 

then<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.140> want<00:02:00.290> to<00:02:00.350> make<00:02:00.470> sure<00:02:00.710> that<00:02:00.890> you've

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
then you want to make sure that you've

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.910 
then you want to make sure that you've
got<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.430> throttle<00:02:02.270> stick<00:02:02.450> on<00:02:02.690> high<00:02:02.960> okay

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
got the throttle stick on high okay

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.150 
got the throttle stick on high okay
we're<00:02:04.130> going<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.430> be<00:02:04.580> adjusting<00:02:05.090> this

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
we're going to be adjusting this

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.410 
we're going to be adjusting this
throttle<00:02:08.020> trip<00:02:09.020> endpoint<00:02:09.590> right<00:02:09.710> here<00:02:10.100> so<00:02:10.880> see

throttle trip endpoint right here so see

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.470 
throttle trip endpoint right here so see
power<00:02:11.720> up<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.140> ESC<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.880> go<00:02:17.060> through<00:02:17.330> all<00:02:17.390> of

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
power up the ESC and go through all of

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.040 
power up the ESC and go through all of
its<00:02:17.720> initialization<00:02:18.530> stuff<00:02:19.930> it's<00:02:20.930> not

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
its initialization stuff it's not

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.290 
its initialization stuff it's not
actually<00:02:21.530> going<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.920> initialize<00:02:22.430> you'll<00:02:23.120> see

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
actually going to initialize you'll see

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.740 
actually going to initialize you'll see
that<00:02:23.420> we've<00:02:23.570> got<00:02:23.750> this<00:02:24.940> little<00:02:25.940> flashing<00:02:26.570> red

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
that we've got this little flashing red

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.470 
that we've got this little flashing red
LED<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.680> we're<00:02:27.830> going<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:27.980> start<00:02:28.400> bumping<00:02:29.030> up

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
LED and we're going to start bumping up

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.440 
LED and we're going to start bumping up
this<00:02:30.010> endpoint<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.400> figure<00:02:31.700> out<00:02:31.730> what<00:02:32.420> our

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
this endpoint and figure out what our

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.060 
this endpoint and figure out what our
end<00:02:32.840> point<00:02:33.110> is<00:02:33.200> going<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.470> be<00:02:33.590> for<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.920> high

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
end point is going to be for the high

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:42.400 
end point is going to be for the high
throttle<00:02:36.070> so<00:02:37.070> we're<00:02:37.190> gonna<00:02:38.650> keep<00:02:39.650> going<00:02:41.410> all

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
throttle so we're gonna keep going all

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.640 
throttle so we're gonna keep going all
the<00:02:42.500> way<00:02:42.560> up<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.840> at<00:02:44.990> some<00:02:45.230> point

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
the way up and at some point

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.010 
the way up and at some point
okay<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:47.030> we<00:02:47.510> heard<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:48.290> now<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.300> LEDs<00:02:50.300> slowed

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
okay so we heard the now the LEDs slowed

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.110 
okay so we heard the now the LEDs slowed
down<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.440> we<00:02:51.530> heard<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.800> beep<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.850> we<00:02:52.940> go<00:02:53.090> up

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
down and we heard the beep so we go up

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.410 
down and we heard the beep so we go up
two<00:02:53.780> more<00:02:54.050> points<00:02:54.380> from<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:55.090> okay<00:02:56.090> now<00:02:56.270> that

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
two more points from that okay now that

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.760 
two more points from that okay now that
we've<00:02:57.250> done<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.430> we're<00:02:58.700> going<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:59.770> unplug

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
we've done that we're going to unplug

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.810 
we've done that we're going to unplug
the<00:03:00.830> power<00:03:01.070> from<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.489> ESC<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:03.370> we're<00:03:04.370> at<00:03:04.459> 102

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
the power from the ESC and we're at 102

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.390 
the power from the ESC and we're at 102
now<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:05.510> that's<00:03:05.690> our<00:03:05.870> our<00:03:06.140> maximum<00:03:06.950> end<00:03:07.160> point

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
now so that's our our maximum end point

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.690 
now so that's our our maximum end point
after<00:03:08.090> we<00:03:08.420> hear<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:09.530> arming<00:03:09.950> sound<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.580> the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
after we hear the arming sound and the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.850 
after we hear the arming sound and the
LED<00:03:11.180> flows<00:03:11.450> down<00:03:11.690> we<00:03:11.840> go<00:03:11.930> up<00:03:12.080> two<00:03:12.380> more<00:03:12.650> points

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
LED flows down we go up two more points

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.100 
LED flows down we go up two more points
just<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.400> make<00:03:14.239> up<00:03:14.390> for<00:03:14.570> if<00:03:14.690> there's<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:15.050> know

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
just to make up for if there's you know

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.260 
just to make up for if there's you know
dust<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.590> gets<00:03:15.620> in<00:03:15.890> there<00:03:16.070> throw<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.090> little

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
dust that gets in there throw a little

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.190 
dust that gets in there throw a little
extra<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:17.750> now<00:03:17.900> we're<00:03:18.020> going<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.200> go<00:03:18.620> down<00:03:18.770> to

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
extra and now we're going to go down to

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.380 
extra and now we're going to go down to
the<00:03:21.200> lowest<00:03:21.440> end<00:03:21.860> point<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.090> bottom

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
the lowest end point to the bottom

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.050 
the lowest end point to the bottom
throttle<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.780> this<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.050> still<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.230> 50<00:03:24.560> percent

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
throttle and this is still a 50 percent

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.270 
throttle and this is still a 50 percent
you<00:03:26.060> can<00:03:26.150> do<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.360> same<00:03:26.510> thing<00:03:27.130> plug-in<00:03:28.130> the

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
you can do the same thing plug-in the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.840 
you can do the same thing plug-in the
ESC<00:03:32.920> I'm<00:03:33.920> just<00:03:34.070> gonna<00:03:34.190> do<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.430> same<00:03:34.610> thing

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
ESC I'm just gonna do the same thing

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.460 
ESC I'm just gonna do the same thing
we're<00:03:35.000> gonna<00:03:35.120> see<00:03:35.300> an<00:03:35.360> LED<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:35.989> it's<00:03:36.290> not

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
we're gonna see an LED and it's not

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.830 
we're gonna see an LED and it's not
going<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.769> armed<00:03:37.310> with<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.150> low<00:03:38.300> end<00:03:38.510> points

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
going to armed with the low end points

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.720 
going to armed with the low end points
so<00:03:38.930> we're<00:03:39.200> gonna<00:03:39.320> start<00:03:39.560> increasing<00:03:40.519> this

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
so we're gonna start increasing this

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:49.090 
so we're gonna start increasing this
value<00:03:43.630> till<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.720> arms<00:03:47.140> okay<00:03:48.140> so<00:03:48.230> at<00:03:48.470> 88<00:03:48.890> it

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
value till it arms okay so at 88 it

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.830 
value till it arms okay so at 88 it
started<00:03:49.400> arming<00:03:49.700> for<00:03:49.880> me<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.540> I'm<00:03:50.630> going<00:03:50.750> to

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
started arming for me so I'm going to

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
started arming for me so I'm going to
pop<00:03:51.019> it<00:03:51.140> up<00:03:51.200> just<00:03:51.440> two<00:03:51.590> more<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:53.540> we're<00:03:54.350> at<00:03:54.470> 90

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
pop it up just two more so we're at 90

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.820 
pop it up just two more so we're at 90
percent<00:03:55.010> for<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.580> low<00:03:55.820> end<00:03:56.150> point<00:03:57.080> and<00:03:57.350> 102

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
percent for the low end point and 102

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.350 
percent for the low end point and 102
for<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.280> high<00:03:58.400> end<00:03:58.430> point<00:03:58.820> so<00:03:59.030> that's<00:03:59.150> how

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
for the high end point so that's how

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.020 
for the high end point so that's how
we've<00:03:59.570> got<00:03:59.750> our<00:03:59.870> our<00:04:00.380> end<00:04:00.830> fixed<00:04:01.489> end<00:04:01.670> points

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
we've got our our end fixed end points

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.960 
we've got our our end fixed end points
programmed<00:04:02.420> into<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.840> transmitter

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
programmed into the transmitter

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.020 
programmed into the transmitter
now<00:04:04.970> you're<00:04:05.120> just<00:04:05.210> gonna<00:04:05.330> want<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:06.670> unplug<00:04:07.670> and

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
now you're just gonna want to unplug and

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.850 
now you're just gonna want to unplug and
turn<00:04:09.040> off<00:04:10.040> your<00:04:10.250> receiver<00:04:11.590> turn<00:04:12.590> off<00:04:12.740> your

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
turn off your receiver turn off your

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.890 
turn off your receiver turn off your
transmitter<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:13.550> now<00:04:14.510> we're<00:04:14.600> going<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.750> go

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
transmitter and now we're going to go

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.540 
transmitter and now we're going to go
program<00:04:15.430> into<00:04:16.430> governor<00:04:17.360> mode
