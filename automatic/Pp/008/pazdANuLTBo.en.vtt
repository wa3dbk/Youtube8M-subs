over<00:00:27.570> five<00:00:28.050> seasons<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.010> not<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> be

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
over five seasons it's not going to be

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.490 
over five seasons it's not going to be
exactly<00:00:29.580> five<00:00:30.150> seasons<00:00:30.630> could<00:00:30.840> be<00:00:30.960> more<00:00:31.170> could

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
exactly five seasons could be more could

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.620 
exactly five seasons could be more could
be<00:00:31.619> less<00:00:31.859> hopefully<00:00:32.430> more<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> sake<00:00:33.600> of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
be less hopefully more for the sake of

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.970 
be less hopefully more for the sake of
this<00:00:33.840> series<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.380> probably<00:00:34.559> will<00:00:34.739> be

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
this series and it probably will be

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.110 
this series and it probably will be
considering<00:00:35.520> how<00:00:35.640> much<00:00:35.760> i'm<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> be

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
considering how much i'm going to be

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.940 
considering how much i'm going to be
uploading<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.110> my<00:00:37.260> domestic<00:00:37.590> cup

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
uploading it and my domestic cup

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.310 
uploading it and my domestic cup
performance<00:00:38.430> was<00:00:38.579> decent<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.149> well<00:00:39.360> they<00:00:40.140> said

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
performance was decent as well they said

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.930 
performance was decent as well they said
it<00:00:40.410> was<00:00:40.440> great<00:00:40.739> fun<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.190> involved<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.730> so

that<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.420> good<00:00:42.600> i<00:00:42.660> think<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.440> would<00:00:43.530> have

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that was good i think that would have

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.020 
that was good i think that would have
been<00:00:43.710> reaching<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> semi-final<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
been reaching the semi-final of the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.750 
been reaching the semi-final of the
capital<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.570> cup<00:00:45.920> decent<00:00:46.920> level<00:00:47.039> i<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.579> no

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
to be very very big but I've basically

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.780 
to be very very big but I've basically
only<00:04:01.959> kept<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.590> high<00:04:03.160> high<00:04:03.400> level<00:04:03.700> players

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
their high potential as well Pablo

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.080 
their high potential as well Pablo
Rivera<00:04:11.020> he<00:04:11.709> was<00:04:11.860> 1<00:04:12.040> i'll<00:04:12.190> probably<00:04:12.400> let<00:04:12.640> go<00:04:12.850> and

victor jimenez here i would thought

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.570 
victor jimenez here i would thought
about<00:04:17.380> him<00:04:17.560> twice<00:04:17.770> but<00:04:18.040> he<00:04:18.130> didn't<00:04:18.370> have<00:04:18.459> that

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
about him twice but he didn't have that

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.949 
about him twice but he didn't have that
high<00:04:18.790> high<00:04:18.970> potential<00:04:19.419> again<00:04:19.630> what<00:04:19.780> i<00:04:19.810> was

them they can be the best that's a good

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.650 
them they can be the best that's a good
thing<00:05:24.580> but<00:05:24.730> I've<00:05:24.880> noticed<00:05:25.240> in<00:05:25.330> this<00:05:25.450> year's

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
thing but I've noticed in this year's

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.920 
thing but I've noticed in this year's
game<00:05:25.900> in<00:05:26.140> 50<00:05:26.620> 14<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.490> physical<00:05:28.420> attributes<00:05:28.840> of

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
game in 50 14 the physical attributes of

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.180 
game in 50 14 the physical attributes of
the<00:05:28.990> players<00:05:29.260> are<00:05:29.440> really<00:05:29.560> low<00:05:29.860> and<00:05:30.100> that

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
the players are really low and that

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.860 
the players are really low and that
affects<00:05:30.550> when<00:05:31.120> you<00:05:31.210> play<00:05:31.390> them<00:05:31.570> of<00:05:31.690> course

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
affects when you play them of course

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.810 
affects when you play them of course
because<00:05:32.380> pace<00:05:32.620> and<00:05:32.830> strength<00:05:33.130> is<00:05:33.280> so<00:05:33.490> crucial

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
because pace and strength is so crucial

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.210 
because pace and strength is so crucial
it's<00:05:34.240> the<00:05:35.170> most<00:05:35.350> crucial<00:05:35.530> attributes<00:05:36.070> in<00:05:36.190> the

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
it's the most crucial attributes in the

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.190 
it's the most crucial attributes in the

going to try and tell him that was the

case you can see suzhou coming back from
on<00:06:23.830> loan<00:06:23.980> as<00:06:24.160> well<00:06:24.370> a<00:06:24.550> very<00:06:24.880> good<00:06:25.060> young<00:06:25.240> player

on loan as well a very good young player

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.900 
on loan as well a very good young player
he's<00:06:26.080> 20<00:06:26.590> he<00:06:26.860> can<00:06:27.010> make<00:06:27.130> an<00:06:27.250> impact<00:06:27.580> but<00:06:27.790> it's

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
he's 20 he can make an impact but it's

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
he's 20 he can make an impact but it's
gonna<00:06:28.030> be<00:06:28.090> hard<00:06:28.300> we're<00:06:28.480> gonna<00:06:28.540> have<00:06:28.720> a<00:06:28.750> lot<00:06:28.900> of

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
gonna be hard we're gonna have a lot of

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.540 
gonna be hard we're gonna have a lot of
plays<00:06:29.170> in<00:06:29.380> those<00:06:29.530> positions<00:06:29.740> but<00:06:30.190> is<00:06:30.340> he<00:06:30.430> gonna

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
plays in those positions but is he gonna

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.640 
plays in those positions but is he gonna
yeah<00:06:31.240> I'm<00:06:31.480> not<00:06:31.630> sure<00:06:31.810> because<00:06:31.990> his<00:06:32.350> skills

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
yeah I'm not sure because his skills

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.170 
yeah I'm not sure because his skills
aren't<00:06:32.890> great<00:06:33.100> his<00:06:33.310> weak<00:06:33.520> foot<00:06:33.760> isn't<00:06:33.880> great

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
aren't great his weak foot isn't great

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.970 
aren't great his weak foot isn't great
so<00:06:34.840> that<00:06:35.050> might<00:06:35.200> think<00:06:35.440> that<00:06:35.500> might<00:06:35.740> plague

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
so that might think that might plague

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.190 
so that might think that might plague
him<00:06:36.190> and<00:06:36.430> not<00:06:37.210> be<00:06:37.300> able<00:06:37.419> to<00:06:37.630> select<00:06:37.780> him<00:06:38.020> full

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
him and not be able to select him full

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.540 
him and not be able to select him full
the<00:06:38.290> team<00:06:38.470> but<00:06:38.680> it<00:06:38.740> would<00:06:38.860> be<00:06:38.890> realistic<00:06:39.430> to

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
the team but it would be realistic to

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.439 
the team but it would be realistic to
give<00:06:39.700> him<00:06:39.820> a<00:06:39.880> chance

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449 
give him a chance

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.239 
give him a chance
Jordan<00:06:40.749> I'm<00:06:40.900> as<00:06:41.110> well<00:06:41.349> he<00:06:41.830> doesn't<00:06:42.129> have

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:42.249 
Jordan I'm as well he doesn't have

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:43.290 
Jordan I'm as well he doesn't have
skills<00:06:42.550> as<00:06:42.699> well<00:06:42.759> I<00:06:42.819> think<00:06:42.939> it<00:06:43.090> something<00:06:43.270> like

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
skills as well I think it something like

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.269 
skills as well I think it something like
to<00:06:43.539> start<00:06:43.809> skills<00:06:44.050> was<00:06:44.259> pretty<00:06:44.529> disappointing

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:45.279 
to start skills was pretty disappointing

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.589 
to start skills was pretty disappointing
so<00:06:45.729> he's<00:06:45.819> probably<00:06:45.909> not<00:06:46.120> going<00:06:46.240> to<00:06:46.300> be<00:06:46.389> a<00:06:46.449> play

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 
so he's probably not going to be a play

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:47.700 
so he's probably not going to be a play
for<00:06:46.659> me<00:06:46.900> in<00:06:46.960> the<00:06:47.020> future<00:06:47.139> but<00:06:47.349> yes<00:06:47.559> all

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
for me in the future but yes all

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.100 
for me in the future but yes all
increase<00:06:48.039> plus<00:06:48.340> four<00:06:48.669> last<00:06:48.909> season<00:06:49.150> yes<00:06:49.930> all

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
increase plus four last season yes all
