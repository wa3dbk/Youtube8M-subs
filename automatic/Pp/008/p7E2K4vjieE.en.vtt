00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.030
 according to the national confederation of

 Runs in Brazil today are performed 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.550
 more than 1800 pawns per year 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.039
 according to SINAR data they move 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.280
 around 3 billion dollars and generate 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.690
 approximately 300 thousand direct jobs 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.600
 and indirect 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.210
 but this tradition does not please many people 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.310
 people linked to the NGOs that defend 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.070
 animals claim that bulls and horses 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.990
 of rodeos are mistreated 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.360
 this group that is in favor of the rodeo 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.030
 according to them the animals 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.520
 used at parties are very well 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.130
 treated and do not suffer any type of 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.660
 violence this arena is in the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.240
 trooper renan freire 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.920
 according to him the space is used for the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.259
 training of animals 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.060
 the twenty-six bulls of the company are 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.060
 rented for the pawns parties 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:59.039
 I thought about riding a smaller calf. 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.679
 I have started going there hates us 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.000
 today was in wide DAEE for nothing the 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.170
 animals in addition to having a financial value 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.969
 for us it has a value 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.950
 Sentimental also all are well 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.200
 treated has an average care en 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.910
 Nothing at the time you need them is 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.690
 accompanied daily by our 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.180
 capitals 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.370
 Look, we're on the side of a breach. 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.500
 already have an ox prepared here for a 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.049
 and who will explain when the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.739
 process for us is the mauro that the judge 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.739
 of rodeo 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.079
 Many people say that the animal is 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.150
 mistreated before a mount and 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.700
 during the ride also explains to 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.280
 What is the process here before 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.480
 a mount before the pawn's ox go up 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.879
 No bull tells us 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.620
 so we're here to admit to staying 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.720
 this cedh thing in quixada 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.060
 abuse that squeezes the tissue of the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.620
 animal and that rosetta the fair animal 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.209
 in fact we are done can 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.280
 to accompany us is putting together a cd 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.379
 in than the material it is made of 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.450
 effect is any damage on the equipment 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.299
 a good distance from the animal's intestine 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.489
 and now the issue of spore history 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.680
 As you can see Rosé is free. 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.370
 she is beautiful is made of a material to 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.319
 do not hurt ooo agree the body of the animal 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.000
 rodrigo goal of this material body 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.459
 it 's not important 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.950
 another claim of NGOs in defense of 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.959
 animals are the clandestine rodeos that 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.510
 continue to be carried out with 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.069
 often in the country of the professional and 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.660
 has a complete supervision by the 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.760
 veterinarian by the police of the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.650
 forestry police so that it does not 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.780
 maltreatment so that the animal has a 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.549
 proper place to stay the next 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.739
 denigrating our image of 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.260
 true professionals are these 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.209
 people who do without responsibility 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.310
 without honesty 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.579
 Rodeo is putting an end to our culture. 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.349
 this veterinary specialist in cattle 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.540
 ensures that the animals are not 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.090
 maltreated touch has a rt the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.250
 responsible and has the supervisor of the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.859
 Also, there are two 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.389
 professionals there to ensure safety and 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.340
 welfare of these animals 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.780
 the technical person has to be a 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.150
 veterinary surgeon 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.859
 boyle has more health than we can know 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.600
 are animals that live more than ten years 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.200
 when the animal that goes down hard 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.050
 maximum 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.150
 two and a half years three years this passion 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.220
 our era was immense and the Brazilian people 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.560
 I'm sure they'll have to 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.790
 work hard to try to break the 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.340
 our culture that I think is 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.340
 impossible to see our life our page 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.810
 look is the following I ademir saints already 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.960

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.370
 respect we have to respect 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.020
 respect first what the 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.910
 else I think there are people who do not 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.160
 you want to respect and that is to stick the throat 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.290

 with the cowboy can hurt but the 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.760
 professional everything that is professional I 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.850

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.650
 people are so surprised to miss 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.720
