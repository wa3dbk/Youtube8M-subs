00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.700
 U 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.510

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.700
 Hello anhaedo big one is how people are now protected during configuration 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.930
 I will explain to you 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:45.910
 If you want to be disgruntled with the lectures , 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:50.170
 Because the front, then the back, and the mouth itself are important , 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:54.220
 If you divide the screen in the front, then the back hand in the rear, and 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:58.510
 What part of the mouth should be done is now taken in split 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.570
 Now, when you are reporting, you are not confused anymore. 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:06.130
 Now you can learn while watching the screen 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:10.660
 In our present advanced courses in the first week of the course it is now just two seconds until you 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:16.060
 While that may not chaenggil habits are well track or the course while you in 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:17.350
 There are no parts to be taken care of in Juju, and from the second minute , 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.729
 You've heard a lot. 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.630
 How to play when you play the part you know through the min-hole and then 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:29.530
 I looked to see if it was correct. 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.700
 From then on the middle part of the miracle of the ten thousand and one, or you can 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:38.280
 Some may have difficulty expressing They are now part of that is to do that 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.280
 It was in the middle part of the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.009
 In the second part, you now have three of Klein's skills 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.360
 Where to go now and I'll have to write real name when you sinned before any addition 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.649
 How to prepare and how to get ready when you go to the stage 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.250
 Now when you're applying for, or who can be serialized in different orchestras 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.800
 Because I have a lot of different parts than when I was alone . 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.800
 Also I saw that if I get out of the area now meet all sent back 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.800
 Oo 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.550
 This time , I'm going to tell you how the first round is going. 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.930
 Our songs can now now you can play whenever you proceed one week one week 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:24.920
 After you have mastered the Korean style, you can use the metronome to match the exact beat and then 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.910
 If you have difficulty with a lot of fingers , 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:33.290
 For us to study and practice the techniques and practice should typically be part of this 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:37.220

 Part of us now want to be able to check when we want to weigh the exposed 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:48.350
 Theoretically or practically obstructed parts of your work 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:52.100
