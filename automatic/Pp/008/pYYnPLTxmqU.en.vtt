00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.420
 small analysis I will teach what is 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.190
 this game the game is very cheap and as 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.960

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.780
 with different graphic sets 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.360

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.789
 different levels 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.500
 the character also and they are unblocking 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.010
 things you can change the color 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.210
 You can do everything you want with 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.910
 as long as you have that motorcycle there 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.680
 three types of motorcycles other than 125 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:59.400
 the 250 and the 450 if I'm not wrong 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.260
 that right now I do not remember if those of 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.830
 450 are all in motocross and there are also 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.870
 4 good I'll put a little race 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.960
 so that you may know what the game 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.120
 game is quite accomplished I played 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.700
 also before the previous one and I'm going to put 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.729
 one of a short circuit of 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.159
 short track the third unlockable 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.659
 that was unlocked at level 10 already 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.600
 as the level goes up making 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.119
 races and more else get going 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.710

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.799
 that goes up unlock levels 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.759
 handlebars vinyl colors is very 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.149
 entertaining the game is also very 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.370
 easy to complete or that seems like me 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.190
 I got 22 achievements in a day 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.520
 and well let's see the first race 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.940
 how are we doing? Let's go out on fire 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.860
 I jump for the victory 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.830
 here you see yourself not so pretty in color 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.770
 rosita and multicolored and we left June 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.960
 falls hit him and he dies I do not know if they will 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.630
 dead but we do not think it is 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.000
 very well as to continue let's give it 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.470
 let's give it and look for the first jump 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.200
 this is the first time he puts this 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.670
 screen is pretty pretty and another 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.830
 jump here 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.110
 She's very pretty as well as short track 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.640
 an 8 or there is the only thing that I do not like is 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.640
 that you come across people and almost the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.470
 hit me and I almost fell but good 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.380
 worse, I have been advanced four 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.650
 people which will try to come back in 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.160
 a moment there is the game as it is 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.050
 you see 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.750
 if you look at the track as you 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.580
 you are going with the motorcycle and other things are going 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.670
 warping little by little one thing is done 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.630

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.170
