00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939 

in<00:00:00.060> this<00:00:00.630> video<00:00:00.840> we're<00:00:01.170> going<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.410> take<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.680> look

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
in this video we're going to take a look

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.309 
in this video we're going to take a look
at<00:00:02.129> adding<00:00:02.460> and<00:00:02.610> subtracting<00:00:03.060> integers<00:00:03.449> when

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
at adding and subtracting integers when

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.960 
at adding and subtracting integers when
we're<00:00:04.470> working<00:00:04.589> with<00:00:04.890> several<00:00:05.160> integers<00:00:05.609> in

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
we're working with several integers in

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.740 
we're working with several integers in
the<00:00:06.060> same<00:00:06.330> problem<00:00:08.090> remember<00:00:09.090> our<00:00:09.480> strategy

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
the same problem remember our strategy

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.049 
the same problem remember our strategy
for<00:00:10.200> subtracting<00:00:10.710> with<00:00:11.040> integers<00:00:11.460> we<00:00:11.670> simply

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
for subtracting with integers we simply

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.020 
for subtracting with integers we simply
will<00:00:12.210> change<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.840> adding<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.940> opposite<00:00:14.940> of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
will change it to adding the opposite of

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.010 
will change it to adding the opposite of
a<00:00:15.150> number<00:00:16.820> so<00:00:17.820> we're<00:00:18.000> really<00:00:18.150> just<00:00:18.270> adding<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
a number so we're really just adding a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.070 
a number so we're really just adding a
bunch<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.350> integers<00:00:20.449> we'll<00:00:21.449> also<00:00:21.630> keep<00:00:21.930> in

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
bunch of integers we'll also keep in

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.509 
bunch of integers we'll also keep in
mind<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.410> order<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.769> operations<00:00:23.340> with

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
mind the order of operations with

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.060 
mind the order of operations with
subtraction<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.330> addition<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:25.019> done<00:00:25.380> from

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
subtraction and addition is done from

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.550 
subtraction and addition is done from
left<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:27.500> right<00:00:29.510> so<00:00:30.510> we'll<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:30.869> subtract<00:00:31.349> or

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
left to right so we'll just subtract or

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.490 
left to right so we'll just subtract or
add<00:00:31.590> two<00:00:32.550> numbers<00:00:32.730> at<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> time<00:00:33.180> until<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.320> reach

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
add two numbers at a time until we reach

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.549 
add two numbers at a time until we reach
the<00:00:34.530> end<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> problem<00:00:36.110> let's<00:00:37.110> take<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> look

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the end of the problem let's take a look

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.600 
the end of the problem let's take a look
at<00:00:37.680> some<00:00:37.860> examples<00:00:38.010> where<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
at some examples where we do just that

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.240 
at some examples where we do just that
negative<00:00:41.610> 7<00:00:41.969> minus<00:00:42.149> negative<00:00:42.360> 4<00:00:42.930> plus<00:00:43.649> 6<00:00:44.010> minus

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
negative 7 minus negative 4 plus 6 minus

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.220 
negative 7 minus negative 4 plus 6 minus
5<00:00:44.840> minus<00:00:45.840> 9<00:00:46.020> minus<00:00:46.500> negative<00:00:46.860> 9<00:00:48.140> starting<00:00:49.140> with

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
5 minus 9 minus negative 9 starting with

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.920 
5 minus 9 minus negative 9 starting with
the<00:00:49.289> first<00:00:49.530> two<00:00:49.710> numbers<00:00:49.920> we're<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> not

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the first two numbers we're going to not

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.430 
the first two numbers we're going to not
do<00:00:52.199> subtraction<00:00:52.820> but<00:00:53.820> instead<00:00:54.210> add<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
do subtraction but instead add the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.160 
do subtraction but instead add the
opposite<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.070> negative<00:00:56.219> 4<00:00:56.730> which<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.510> positive

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
opposite of negative 4 which is positive

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.939 
opposite of negative 4 which is positive
4<00:00:59.059> we<00:01:00.059> now<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> negative<00:01:00.989> 7<00:01:01.350> plus<00:01:01.500> positive

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
4 we now have a negative 7 plus positive

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.359 
4 we now have a negative 7 plus positive
4<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> different<00:01:04.320> signs<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
4 and we see the different signs the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.520 
4 and we see the different signs the
negative<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.939> bigger<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:07.049> find<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.500> how

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
negative is bigger and to find out how

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.630 
negative is bigger and to find out how
much<00:01:07.920> bigger<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:09.000> subtract<00:01:09.540> 7<00:01:10.049> minus<00:01:10.350> 4<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:11.490> get

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
much bigger we subtract 7 minus 4 to get

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.870 
much bigger we subtract 7 minus 4 to get
3<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:13.619> rest<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> problem<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.549> still<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
3 the rest of the problem is still the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.380 
3 the rest of the problem is still the
same<00:01:15.119> plus<00:01:16.110> 6<00:01:16.470> minus<00:01:16.860> 5<00:01:17.250> minus<00:01:18.240> negative<00:01:18.659> 9<00:01:20.390> now

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
same plus 6 minus 5 minus negative 9 now

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.160 
same plus 6 minus 5 minus negative 9 now
we<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.810> negative<00:01:22.259> 3<00:01:22.619> plus<00:01:23.100> 6<00:01:23.720> it's<00:01:24.720> already

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
we have negative 3 plus 6 it's already

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
we have negative 3 plus 6 it's already
addition<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.189> simply<00:01:26.549> add<00:01:26.580> them<00:01:26.970> using

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
addition so we can simply add them using

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.960 
addition so we can simply add them using
our<00:01:27.720> pattern<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.290> different<00:01:28.650> signs<00:01:28.970> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
our pattern for different signs the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.270 
our pattern for different signs the
positive<00:01:30.509> 6<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.930> bigger<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.680> our<00:01:31.829> answer<00:01:32.130> is

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
positive 6 is bigger so our answer is

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.140 
positive 6 is bigger so our answer is
positive<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.780> subtract<00:01:34.290> 6<00:01:34.770> minus<00:01:35.159> 3<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
positive and we subtract 6 minus 3 to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.649 
positive and we subtract 6 minus 3 to
get<00:01:36.240> 3<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:38.400> rest<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> problem<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.420> still

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
get 3 the rest of the problem is still

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.950 
get 3 the rest of the problem is still
minus<00:01:40.140> 5<00:01:40.409> minus<00:01:41.250> negative<00:01:41.670> 9<00:01:44.299> we<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.630> 3

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
minus 5 minus negative 9 we now have 3

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.649 
minus 5 minus negative 9 we now have 3
minus<00:01:46.320> 5<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.979> again<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.939> don't<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.420> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
minus 5 and again we don't like to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.980 
minus 5 and again we don't like to
subtract<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.860> instead<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.369> will<00:01:50.490> add<00:01:50.990> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
subtract so instead we will add the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.289 
subtract so instead we will add the
opposite<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.590> 5<00:01:53.210> which<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.240> negative<00:01:54.420> 5<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
opposite of 5 which is negative 5 a

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.780 
opposite of 5 which is negative 5 a
positive<00:01:57.299> 3<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.719> negative<00:01:57.869> 5<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:59.340> negative

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
positive 3 and negative 5 the negative

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.709 
positive 3 and negative 5 the negative
is<00:01:59.909> bigger<00:02:00.649> 5<00:02:01.649> minus<00:02:02.070> 3<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.430> 2<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:03.509> negative

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
is bigger 5 minus 3 is 2 we get negative

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.039 
is bigger 5 minus 3 is 2 we get negative
2<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:06.000> rest<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.390> problem<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.840> still

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
2 and the rest of the problem is still

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.400 
2 and the rest of the problem is still
minus<00:02:07.469> negative<00:02:08.069> 9

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.490 

finally<00:02:12.410> our<00:02:12.680> last<00:02:12.709> two<00:02:13.400> together<00:02:14.140> again<00:02:15.140> we

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
finally our last two together again we

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.380 
finally our last two together again we
don't<00:02:15.650> like<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.099> subtract<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:16.910> we<00:02:17.030> will<00:02:17.180> add

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
don't like to subtract so we will add

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.780 
don't like to subtract so we will add
the<00:02:18.290> opposite<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:18.920> negative<00:02:19.040> 9<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.730> positive<00:02:20.420> 9

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
the opposite of negative 9 is positive 9

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.990 
the opposite of negative 9 is positive 9
negative<00:02:22.790> 2<00:02:23.000> plus<00:02:23.239> positive<00:02:23.989> 9<00:02:24.550> but<00:02:25.550> positive

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
negative 2 plus positive 9 but positive

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.660 
negative 2 plus positive 9 but positive
is<00:02:26.120> bigger<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.599> when<00:02:27.290> we<00:02:27.440> subtract<00:02:27.890> 9<00:02:28.099> minus<00:02:28.430> 2

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
is bigger and when we subtract 9 minus 2

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.259 
is bigger and when we subtract 9 minus 2
we<00:02:29.390> get<00:02:29.569> 7<00:02:29.989> positive<00:02:30.980> 7<00:02:31.610> for<00:02:31.849> our<00:02:31.940> final

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
we get 7 positive 7 for our final

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.350 
we get 7 positive 7 for our final
solution<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:34.280> positive<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:34.880> not<00:02:35.030> really

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
solution the positive is not really

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.180 
solution the positive is not really
needed<00:02:35.690> we<00:02:36.019> could<00:02:36.200> just<00:02:36.410> say<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.709> answer<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.190> 7

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
needed we could just say the answer is 7

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.979 
needed we could just say the answer is 7
let's<00:02:40.190> try<00:02:40.400> one<00:02:40.610> more<00:02:40.640> example<00:02:40.819> where<00:02:41.300> we<00:02:41.690> work

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
let's try one more example where we work

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.050 
let's try one more example where we work
from<00:02:42.170> left<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.530> right<00:02:42.819> change<00:02:43.819> in<00:02:43.940> our

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
from left to right change in our

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.860 
from left to right change in our
subtractions<00:02:44.680> into<00:02:45.680> addition<00:02:46.600> here<00:02:47.600> we<00:02:47.750> have

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
subtractions into addition here we have

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.059 
subtractions into addition here we have
7<00:02:48.230> minus<00:02:48.590> 3<00:02:48.860> minus<00:02:49.310> negative<00:02:49.670> 2<00:02:50.120> minus<00:02:50.840> 5<00:02:51.290> plus

7 minus 3 minus negative 2 minus 5 plus

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.539 
7 minus 3 minus negative 2 minus 5 plus
negative<00:02:52.370> 4

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
negative 4

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.150 
negative 4
starting<00:02:55.549> with<00:02:55.640> 7<00:02:56.000> minus<00:02:56.330> 3<00:02:56.660> we<00:02:57.620> don't<00:02:57.799> like<00:02:57.980> to

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
starting with 7 minus 3 we don't like to

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.309 
starting with 7 minus 3 we don't like to
subtract<00:02:58.640> so<00:02:58.940> we<00:02:59.060> will<00:02:59.180> add<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.810> opposite<00:03:00.260> of

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
subtract so we will add the opposite of

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.240 
subtract so we will add the opposite of
3<00:03:00.819> which<00:03:01.819> is<00:03:01.970> negative<00:03:02.390> 3<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:03.040> we<00:03:04.040> see<00:03:04.220> that

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
3 which is negative 3 and we see that

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.420 
3 which is negative 3 and we see that
the<00:03:04.489> positive<00:03:04.700> 7<00:03:05.299> is<00:03:05.390> bigger<00:03:06.489> by<00:03:07.489> 4<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:10.220> rest

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
the positive 7 is bigger by 4 the rest

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.039 
the positive 7 is bigger by 4 the rest
of<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.730> problem<00:03:11.060> still<00:03:11.269> reads<00:03:11.540> minus

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
of the problem still reads minus

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:19.360 
of the problem still reads minus
negative<00:03:12.290> 2<00:03:12.799> minus<00:03:13.549> 5<00:03:14.030> plus<00:03:14.989> negative<00:03:15.290> 4<00:03:18.370> the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
negative 2 minus 5 plus negative 4 the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.670 
negative 2 minus 5 plus negative 4 the
next<00:03:19.700> pair<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:20.000> numbers<00:03:20.359> are<00:03:20.510> 4<00:03:20.840> minus

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
next pair of numbers are 4 minus

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.030 
next pair of numbers are 4 minus
negative<00:03:21.920> 2<00:03:23.320> again<00:03:24.320> we<00:03:24.470> don't<00:03:24.620> like<00:03:24.890> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
negative 2 again we don't like the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.550 
negative 2 again we don't like the
subtraction<00:03:25.489> so<00:03:26.239> we<00:03:26.390> will<00:03:26.510> add<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:27.079> opposite

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
subtraction so we will add the opposite

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.330 
subtraction so we will add the opposite
of<00:03:27.620> negative<00:03:28.069> 2<00:03:28.310> which<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.329> positive<00:03:29.510> 2<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.340> we

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
of negative 2 which is positive 2 and we

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.550 
of negative 2 which is positive 2 and we
see<00:03:31.519> we're<00:03:31.670> really<00:03:31.850> adding<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.420> positives<00:03:32.989> 4

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
see we're really adding the positives 4

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.180 
see we're really adding the positives 4
plus<00:03:33.890> 2<00:03:34.220> which<00:03:34.970> we<00:03:35.120> know<00:03:35.239> is<00:03:35.390> 6<00:03:36.100> adding<00:03:37.100> the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
plus 2 which we know is 6 adding the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.039 
plus 2 which we know is 6 adding the
numbers<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:37.670> keeping<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.120> sign<00:03:38.390> because

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
numbers and keeping the sign because

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.400 
numbers and keeping the sign because
they're<00:03:39.230> both<00:03:39.380> positive<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.959> rest<00:03:42.170> of<00:03:42.319> the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
they're both positive the rest of the

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.800 
they're both positive the rest of the
problem<00:03:42.739> still<00:03:42.950> reads<00:03:43.190> minus<00:03:43.700> 5<00:03:43.970> plus

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
problem still reads minus 5 plus

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.099 
problem still reads minus 5 plus
negative<00:03:45.109> 4<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:48.829> do<00:03:48.950> 6<00:03:49.250> minus<00:03:49.609> 5<00:03:49.850> we<00:03:50.630> don't<00:03:50.870> like

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
negative 4 to do 6 minus 5 we don't like

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.620 
negative 4 to do 6 minus 5 we don't like
to<00:03:51.260> do<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.530> subtraction<00:03:51.850> so<00:03:52.850> we<00:03:52.970> will<00:03:53.060> add<00:03:53.269> the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
to do the subtraction so we will add the

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.270 
to do the subtraction so we will add the
opposite<00:03:54.139> of<00:03:54.200> 5<00:03:54.410> which<00:03:55.250> is<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.430> negative<00:03:55.910> 5

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
opposite of 5 which is a negative 5

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.410 
opposite of 5 which is a negative 5
again<00:03:58.280> we've<00:03:58.430> got<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.639> positive<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.359> a

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
again we've got a positive and a

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.930 
again we've got a positive and a
negative<00:03:59.650> different<00:04:00.650> signs<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.730> bigger

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
negative different signs so the bigger

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.000 
negative different signs so the bigger
number<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.450> positive<00:04:02.959> keeps<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.470> sign<00:04:03.739> and

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
number the positive keeps the sign and

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.599 
number the positive keeps the sign and
we<00:04:04.940> subtract<00:04:05.389> the<00:04:05.540> numbers<00:04:05.870> 6<00:04:06.530> minus<00:04:06.889> 5<00:04:07.100> to<00:04:07.459> get

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
we subtract the numbers 6 minus 5 to get

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.140 
we subtract the numbers 6 minus 5 to get
1<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:09.769> rest<00:04:10.010> of<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:10.250> problem<00:04:10.609> still<00:04:10.910> reads

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
1 the rest of the problem still reads

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.080 
1 the rest of the problem still reads
plus<00:04:11.540> negative<00:04:11.870> 4<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.790> we're<00:04:13.790> ready<00:04:13.970> to

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
plus negative 4 and we're ready to

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.910 
plus negative 4 and we're ready to
finish<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.510> problem<00:04:14.720> by<00:04:14.959> combining<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.680> 1

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
finish the problem by combining the 1

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.170 
finish the problem by combining the 1
plus<00:04:16.910> negative<00:04:17.180> 4<00:04:18.519> again<00:04:19.519> we<00:04:19.700> have<00:04:19.820> different

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
plus negative 4 again we have different

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.180 
plus negative 4 again we have different
signs<00:04:20.419> so<00:04:21.080> the<00:04:21.200> larger<00:04:21.590> one<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.979> negative

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
signs so the larger one the negative

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.460 
signs so the larger one the negative
keeps<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:22.909> sign<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:23.450> we

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
keeps the sign and we

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.770 
keeps the sign and we
subtract<00:04:24.830> 4-1<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:26.540> get<00:04:26.690> 3<00:04:27.080> or<00:04:27.400> negative<00:04:28.400> 3<00:04:28.780> for

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
subtract 4-1 to get 3 or negative 3 for

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.000 
subtract 4-1 to get 3 or negative 3 for
our<00:04:29.810> final<00:04:30.320> solution<00:04:32.410> working<00:04:33.410> left<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.740> right

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
our final solution working left to right

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.130 
our final solution working left to right
remembering<00:04:34.940> that<00:04:34.970> subtraction<00:04:35.570> is<00:04:35.870> really

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
remembering that subtraction is really

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.560 
remembering that subtraction is really
adding<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.590> opposite<00:04:37.100> we<00:04:37.970> can<00:04:38.120> combine<00:04:38.540> our

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
adding the opposite we can combine our

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.590 
adding the opposite we can combine our
