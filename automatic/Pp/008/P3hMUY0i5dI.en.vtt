years ago when I started a rooster teeth
I<00:01:39.479> was<00:01:40.479> here<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.719> work<00:01:40.869> on<00:01:41.020> red<00:01:41.229> vs.<00:01:41.500> blue<00:01:41.530> and

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
I was here to work on red vs. blue and

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.010 
I was here to work on red vs. blue and
add<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.070> animation<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.880> scenes<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.929> know

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
add the animation to the scenes you know

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.749 
add the animation to the scenes you know
give<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.289> a<00:01:44.320> little<00:01:44.469> bit<00:01:44.649> of<00:01:44.740> punch<00:01:45.009> in<00:01:45.250> action

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
give it a little bit of punch in action

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.059 
give it a little bit of punch in action
um<00:01:46.649> essentially<00:01:47.649> doing<00:01:48.460> red<00:01:48.670> vs.<00:01:48.939> blue<00:01:48.969> was<00:01:49.420> a

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
um essentially doing red vs. blue was a

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.199 
um essentially doing red vs. blue was a
path<00:01:51.069> to<00:01:51.250> earning<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.610> right<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:51.759> do<00:01:51.969> a<00:01:52.000> show

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
path to earning the right to do a show

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.539 
path to earning the right to do a show
like<00:01:52.360> Ruby<00:01:52.750> um<00:01:52.929> we<00:01:53.709> still<00:01:53.920> do<00:01:54.039> red<00:01:54.219> vs.<00:01:54.520> blue

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
like Ruby um we still do red vs. blue

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.789 
like Ruby um we still do red vs. blue
and<00:01:54.909> it's<00:01:55.000> definitely<00:01:55.380> still<00:01:56.380> worth<00:01:56.590> doing

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
and it's definitely still worth doing

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.319 
and it's definitely still worth doing
with<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.069> characters<00:01:57.459> do<00:01:57.579> we<00:01:57.670> have<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:58.119> we

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
by animating followed by compositing it

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.720

definitely a different experience for us

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.589 
definitely a different experience for us
because<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.620> mean<00:02:26.739> we<00:02:26.829> worked<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.599> season

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
because you mean we worked on season

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.630 
because you mean we worked on season
eight<00:02:28.720> nine<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:28.930> ten<00:02:29.200> all<00:02:29.470> had<00:02:29.709> animation<00:02:30.519> in

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
eight nine and ten all had animation in

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.970 
eight nine and ten all had animation in
it<00:02:30.760> for<00:02:30.970> our<00:02:31.209> vb<00:02:31.480> but<00:02:32.319> starting<00:02:32.860> something

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
it for our vb but starting something

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.830 
it for our vb but starting something
from<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.250> ground<00:02:33.400> up<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:34.060> having<00:02:34.269> no<00:02:34.450> assets

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
from the ground up and having no assets

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.420 
from the ground up and having no assets
to<00:02:34.900> begin<00:02:35.110> with<00:02:35.290> no<00:02:35.500> nothing<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.069> just<00:02:36.220> alright

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
to begin with no nothing is just alright

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.520 
to begin with no nothing is just alright
let's<00:02:36.700> create<00:02:36.940> everything<00:02:37.299> was<00:02:38.049> a<00:02:38.079> pretty

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
let's create everything was a pretty

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.009 
let's create everything was a pretty
different<00:02:38.769> yeah<00:02:39.609> I<00:02:39.910> mean<00:02:40.209> that<00:02:40.389> it<00:02:40.720> starts

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
different yeah I mean that it starts

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.599 
different yeah I mean that it starts
with<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:41.170> fact<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.500> these<00:02:41.769> are<00:02:41.950> original

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
with the fact that these are original

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.940 
with the fact that these are original
characters<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.329> they<00:02:44.260> have<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.530> be<00:02:44.620> designed

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
characters so they have to be designed

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.120 
characters so they have to be designed
so<00:02:45.250> I<00:02:46.239> went<00:02:46.450> in<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:46.660> just<00:02:46.840> like<00:02:46.989> think<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.069> is

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
so I went in and just like think this is

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.990 
so I went in and just like think this is
what<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.340> character<00:02:48.730> should<00:02:48.819> look<00:02:48.970> like

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
what this character should look like

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.300 
what this character should look like
sure<00:02:49.329> and<00:02:49.569> then<00:02:50.170> we<00:02:50.319> keep<00:02:50.470> moving<00:02:50.769> because<00:02:50.889> we

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
sure and then we keep moving because we

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.460 
sure and then we keep moving because we
just<00:02:51.519> have<00:02:51.670> no<00:02:51.850> time<00:02:52.060> we<00:02:52.810> make<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.139> character

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
just have no time we make the character

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.259 
just have no time we make the character
as<00:02:53.560> good<00:02:53.709> as<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:53.859> needs<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.190> be<00:02:54.340> we<00:02:54.880> make<00:02:55.090> the

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
as good as it needs to be we make the

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.520 
as good as it needs to be we make the
show<00:02:55.450> as<00:02:55.630> good<00:02:55.690> as<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:55.959> needs<00:02:56.109> to<00:02:56.230> be<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:56.410> then

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
show as good as it needs to be and then

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.319 
show as good as it needs to be and then
we<00:02:56.620> keep<00:02:56.799> moving<00:02:56.980> but<00:02:57.639> it<00:02:57.760> helps<00:02:58.239> that

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
we keep moving but it helps that

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.780 
we keep moving but it helps that
everyone<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.350> very<00:02:59.590> talented<00:02:59.829> so<00:03:00.280> as<00:03:00.489> good

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
everyone is so very talented so as good

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.339 
everyone is so very talented so as good
as<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.000> needs<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.269> be<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.599> probably<00:03:01.989> more<00:03:02.170> than

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
as it needs to be is probably more than

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.740 
as it needs to be is probably more than
we'd<00:03:02.680> ever<00:03:02.799> need<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.280> be<00:03:03.400> because<00:03:03.750> everyone

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
we'd ever need it to be because everyone

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.470 
we'd ever need it to be because everyone
is<00:03:04.870> just<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.519> much<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:07.329> much<00:03:07.359> a

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.490 

while<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.210> transition<00:05:01.690> from<00:05:01.870> machinima<00:05:02.199> to

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
while the transition from machinima to

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.310 
while the transition from machinima to
ruby<00:05:02.830> was<00:05:03.280> uh<00:05:03.580> pretty<00:05:04.419> easy<00:05:04.690> because<00:05:04.870> of<00:05:05.229> the

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
ruby was uh pretty easy because of the

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.200 
ruby was uh pretty easy because of the
animation<00:05:05.650> bridge<00:05:06.310> that<00:05:06.580> we<00:05:06.669> had<00:05:06.790> done<00:05:06.970> by

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
animation bridge that we had done by

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.770 
animation bridge that we had done by
putting<00:05:08.199> animations<00:05:08.650> in<00:05:08.800> red<00:05:09.280> vs.<00:05:09.550> blue<00:05:09.580> so<00:05:10.509> I

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
putting animations in red vs. blue so I

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.469 
putting animations in red vs. blue so I
mean<00:05:11.050> we<00:05:11.259> use<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.560> same<00:05:11.590> software<00:05:12.160> uh

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
mean we use the same software uh

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.999 
mean we use the same software uh
sometimes<00:05:13.479> it<00:05:13.870> might<00:05:13.960> even<00:05:14.110> be<00:05:14.259> similar<00:05:14.979> to

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
sometimes it might even be similar to

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.860 
sometimes it might even be similar to
the<00:05:15.190> same<00:05:15.490> animation<00:05:15.850> we<00:05:16.419> use<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.690> same

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
the same animation we use the same

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.990 
the same animation we use the same
motion<00:05:17.410> capture<00:05:17.770> system<00:05:17.919> it's<00:05:18.580> just<00:05:18.729> a<00:05:18.820> matter

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
motion capture system it's just a matter

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.260 
motion capture system it's just a matter
of<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.389> different<00:05:20.020> type<00:05:20.050> of<00:05:20.199> output<00:05:20.440> are<00:05:21.270> taking

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
of a different type of output are taking

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.060 
of a different type of output are taking
the<00:05:22.389> animation<00:05:22.990> pipeline<00:05:23.350> from<00:05:23.620> you<00:05:23.949> know

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
the animation pipeline from you know

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.550 
the animation pipeline from you know
half<00:05:24.910> seasons<00:05:25.419> of<00:05:25.539> a<00:05:25.600> show<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.840> a<00:05:26.020> full<00:05:26.259> season

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:30.729 
forced to take vacations we still didn't

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.800
