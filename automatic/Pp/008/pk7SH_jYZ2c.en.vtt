this<00:00:51.380> is<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.559> really<00:00:51.860> nice<00:00:52.070> Spanish<00:00:52.970> guitar

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
this is a really nice Spanish guitar

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.869 
this is a really nice Spanish guitar
piece<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:53.870> you'll<00:00:54.170> find<00:00:54.440> yourself<00:00:54.879> playing

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
piece and you'll find yourself playing

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.650 
piece and you'll find yourself playing
it<00:00:56.239> around<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:56.809> around<00:00:58.330> starts<00:00:59.330> off<00:00:59.480> it's

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
it around and around starts off it's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.030 
it around and around starts off it's
mostly<00:00:59.989> arpeggio<00:01:00.680> picking<00:01:01.250> through<00:01:01.550> a<00:01:01.760> minor

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
mostly arpeggio picking through a minor

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.410 
mostly arpeggio picking through a minor
into<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.369> minor

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
into a minor

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.950 
into a minor
and<00:01:06.680> then<00:01:07.680> b7

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
and then b7

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:20.450 
and then b7
into<00:01:10.620> E<00:01:10.650> minor

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.249 

so<00:01:21.460> just<00:01:22.270> get<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.509> structure<00:01:22.899> of<00:01:22.960> that<00:01:23.049> down

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
so just get the structure of that down

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:30.240 
so just get the structure of that down
first<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:29.380> start<00:01:29.710> off<00:01:29.770> with<00:01:29.890> these<00:01:30.009> little

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
first we start off with these little

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.179 
first we start off with these little
lines<00:01:30.549> three<00:01:30.939> to<00:01:31.119> zero<00:01:31.149> on<00:01:31.719> the<00:01:32.020> high<00:01:32.200> E<00:01:32.229> string

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:46.029 

three<00:01:37.909> to<00:01:38.060> zero<00:01:38.270> again<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:40.340> E<00:01:40.369> minor<00:01:44.500> b7<00:01:45.500> line

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
three to zero again to E minor b7 line

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.889 
three to zero again to E minor b7 line
is<00:01:46.219> slightly<00:01:46.490> different<00:01:47.000> threat<00:01:47.539> fret<00:01:47.750> on<00:01:47.780> the

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
is slightly different threat fret on the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.169 
is slightly different threat fret on the
high<00:01:48.020> E<00:01:48.079> string<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.179> open<00:01:50.539> B<00:01:50.719> string<00:01:52.179> so

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
high E string to the open B string so

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:59.270 
high E string to the open B string so
that<00:01:53.209> prepares<00:01:53.750> b7

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.330 

same<00:02:00.280> one<00:02:00.460> again<00:02:00.579> back<00:02:00.970> into<00:02:01.149> E<00:02:01.270> minor

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
same one again back into E minor

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.399 
same one again back into E minor
okay<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:03.399> mostly<00:02:03.939> arpeggio<00:02:04.270> picking<00:02:04.840> with<00:02:05.320> the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
okay so mostly arpeggio picking with the

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:26.690 
okay so mostly arpeggio picking with the
little<00:02:05.649> melodic<00:02:06.009> lines

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.309 

so<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.730> normally<00:02:28.060> do<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.390> twice<00:02:28.629> before<00:02:28.989> going

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
so I normally do that twice before going

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.470 
so I normally do that twice before going
into<00:02:29.650> another<00:02:29.829> variation<00:02:30.549> we're<00:02:31.329> actually

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
into another variation we're actually

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.929 
into another variation we're actually
slide<00:02:32.049> from<00:02:32.409> two<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:33.219> three<00:02:33.249> on<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.819> high<00:02:33.909> E

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
slide from two to three on the high E

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.259 
slide from two to three on the high E
string<00:02:34.359> and<00:02:35.079> then<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.069> hit<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.400> open<00:02:36.519> high<00:02:37.239> E

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
string and then I hit the open high E

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:46.360 
string and then I hit the open high E
string<00:02:37.480> always<00:02:40.620> slide<00:02:41.620> again

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:55.810 

okay

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.800 

and<00:02:57.200> on<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.290> b7<00:02:58.830> i<00:02:58.890> do<00:02:58.950> slight<00:02:59.430> variation<00:03:00.060> so

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
and on the b7 i do slight variation so

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.950 
and on the b7 i do slight variation so
I'm<00:03:00.870> still<00:03:01.140> holding<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.590> third<00:03:01.830> fret<00:03:02.960> but

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
I'm still holding a third fret but

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.480 
I'm still holding a third fret but
instead<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.350> just<00:03:04.470> going<00:03:04.620> up<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.070> open

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
instead of just going up to the open

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.640 
instead of just going up to the open
second<00:03:06.360> string<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.720> do<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.080> third<00:03:07.290> string<00:03:07.530> as

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
second string I do the third string as

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:20.500 
second string I do the third string as
well<00:03:08.180> like<00:03:09.180> this

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.260 

so<00:03:21.500> use<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:21.950> tab<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.520> once<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.030> get<00:03:23.210> your

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
so use the tab and once you get your

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.990 
so use the tab and once you get your
aperture<00:03:24.170> picking<00:03:24.650> down<00:03:24.860> it's<00:03:25.520> not<00:03:25.760> that

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
aperture picking down it's not that

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.910 
aperture picking down it's not that
difficult<00:03:26.240> to<00:03:26.630> get<00:03:26.810> in<00:03:26.960> the<00:03:27.080> leading<00:03:27.440> line<00:03:27.650> so

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
difficult to get in the leading line so

00:03:27.920 --> 00:04:02.480 
difficult to get in the leading line so
it<00:03:27.980> all<00:03:28.130> will<00:03:28.430> group<00:03:28.670> together

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.550 

you
