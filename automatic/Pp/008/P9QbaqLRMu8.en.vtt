tie<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.070> some<00:00:47.309> Mirage<00:00:47.700> sheathing<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.739> cut<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.860> in

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
tie in some Mirage sheathing I cut it in

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.529 
tie in some Mirage sheathing I cut it in
different<00:00:50.760> widths<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.480> cut<00:00:54.480> a

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
different widths and then I just cut a

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.869 
different widths and then I just cut a
taper<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.430> on<00:00:56.430> my<00:00:56.489> tying<00:00:56.910> point<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:58.820> got<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
taper to it on my tying point I got to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.990 
taper to it on my tying point I got to
tie<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.359> right<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.750> where<00:01:00.780> we

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
tie that in right there where we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.109 
tie that in right there where we
finished<00:01:03.000> off<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> wire<00:01:03.629> there

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:16.270
