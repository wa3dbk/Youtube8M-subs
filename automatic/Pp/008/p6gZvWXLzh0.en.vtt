hey<00:00:01.410> there<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.979> one's<00:00:02.220> for<00:00:02.460> rayearth<00:00:02.939> you

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hey there this one's for rayearth you

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.170 
hey there this one's for rayearth you
had<00:00:03.240> some<00:00:03.890> questions<00:00:04.890> about<00:00:05.250> isolation<00:00:05.850> so<00:00:06.150> I

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
had some questions about isolation so I

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.720 
had some questions about isolation so I
got<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> couple<00:00:06.509> tips<00:00:06.779> for<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.170> here<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:08.250> really

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
got a couple tips for you here a really

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.400 
got a couple tips for you here a really
great<00:00:09.030> technique<00:00:09.300> for<00:00:09.719> starting<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.110> is

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
great technique for starting that is

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
great technique for starting that is
going<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.650> be<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.860> somehow<00:00:11.219> mark<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.820> center

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
going to be to somehow mark the center

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.490 
going to be to somehow mark the center
of<00:00:12.179> your<00:00:12.300> chain<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> drew<00:00:12.990> with<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> little

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
of your chain I drew with a little

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.079 
of your chain I drew with a little
permanent<00:00:13.679> marker<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.190> here<00:00:14.610> but<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.849> can<00:00:15.000> do

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
permanent marker on here but you can do

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.369 
permanent marker on here but you can do
like<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> piece<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.599> scotch<00:00:15.809> tape<00:00:16.080> or<00:00:16.199> something

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
like a piece of scotch tape or something

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.500 
like a piece of scotch tape or something
like<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.859> now<00:00:17.580> initially<00:00:18.090> what<00:00:18.390> you're

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
like that now initially what you're

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.660 
like that now initially what you're
gonna<00:00:18.630> want<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.900> do<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.320> hold<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> point<00:00:20.580> in

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
gonna want to do is hold the point in

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.400 
gonna want to do is hold the point in
front<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.300> then<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.990> start<00:00:22.199> slowly

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
front of you and then to start slowly

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.470 
front of you and then to start slowly
stirring<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.130> pot<00:00:23.310> with<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:23.939> like<00:00:24.180> this

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
stirring the pot with it just like this

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.390 
stirring the pot with it just like this
so<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.170> can<00:00:25.289> kind<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.560> get<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> feeling<00:00:26.160> for

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
so you can kind of get the feeling for

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.099 
so you can kind of get the feeling for
how<00:00:26.670> now<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.029> I'm<00:00:27.119> doing<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.869> watch

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
how now what I'm doing this if you watch

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.070 
how now what I'm doing this if you watch
look<00:00:28.980> straight<00:00:29.460> down<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:30.179> top<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.689> your<00:00:30.810> hand

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
look straight down on top of your hand

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.110 
look straight down on top of your hand
you're<00:00:31.650> gonna<00:00:31.740> see<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.340> as<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.820> start

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
you're gonna see that as you start

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.060 
you're gonna see that as you start
swinging<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.660> slowly<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.829> point

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
swinging it slowly like this the point

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.560 
swinging it slowly like this the point
head<00:00:35.219> sort<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.640> follows<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.270> hand

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
head sort of like follows your hand

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.150 
head sort of like follows your hand
that's<00:00:36.750> going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.110> coming<00:00:37.469> after<00:00:37.649> your

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
that's going to be coming after your

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.040 
that's going to be coming after your
hand<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.790> right<00:00:39.000> now<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.360> not<00:00:39.480> rotating

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
hand and right now it's not rotating

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.889 
hand and right now it's not rotating
around<00:00:40.440> my<00:00:41.070> finger<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.750> where

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
around my finger like this like where

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.139 
around my finger like this like where
I'm<00:00:43.079> gripping<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:44.010> actually<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.579> rotating

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
I'm gripping but actually it's rotating

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.750 
I'm gripping but actually it's rotating
more<00:00:45.660> around<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.860> at<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> centerline<00:00:47.489> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
more around here at the centerline and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.500 
more around here at the centerline and
so<00:00:48.629> once<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> feeling<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.489> then

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
so once you get the feeling of that then

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
so once you get the feeling of that then
you're<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.570> gonna<00:00:51.719> want<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> try<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> speed

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
you're just gonna want to try to speed

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
you're just gonna want to try to speed
that<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> theory<00:00:54.270> behind<00:00:54.360> in

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
that up and so the theory behind in

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.369 
that up and so the theory behind in
isolation<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.500> basically<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.870> when<00:00:57.870> you're

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
isolation is basically that when you're

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.010 
isolation is basically that when you're
doing<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.859> normal<00:00:59.070> rotation<00:00:59.449> the<00:01:00.449> poi<00:01:00.660> head<00:01:00.870> is

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
doing a normal rotation the poi head is

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.319 
doing a normal rotation the poi head is
rotating<00:01:01.559> around<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.340> handle<00:01:02.940> connection

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
rotating around that handle connection

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.690 
rotating around that handle connection
right<00:01:03.480> there<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.619> an<00:01:04.739> isolation<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
right there and with an isolation you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.719 
right there and with an isolation you
see<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.939> black<00:01:06.180> line<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.720> there<00:01:06.960> now<00:01:07.729> your

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
see that black line right there now your

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.870 
see that black line right there now your
hand<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.810> poi<00:01:10.049> head<00:01:10.380> are<00:01:10.799> following<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
hand and the poi head are following the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
hand and the poi head are following the
same<00:01:12.180> circle<00:01:12.930> okay<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.210> basically<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.659> you

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
same circle okay so basically what you

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.510 
same circle okay so basically what you
want<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.320> didn't<00:01:16.619> work<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.220> it's

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
want to do didn't work up to that it's

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.670 
want to do didn't work up to that it's
like<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.850> said<00:01:17.909> work<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.450> speeding<00:01:19.200> up<00:01:19.409> this

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
like I said work on speeding up this

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.380 
like I said work on speeding up this
motion<00:01:20.159> more<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.460> more<00:01:20.610> because<00:01:21.210> that's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
motion more and more because that's

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.700 
motion more and more because that's
going<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.900> used<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.259> making<00:01:22.500> that

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
going to get you used to making that

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.560 
going to get you used to making that
larger<00:01:23.130> rotation<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:23.759> your<00:01:23.909> hand<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.360> this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
larger rotation with your hand and this

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.730 
larger rotation with your hand and this
is<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.990> those<00:01:25.080> point<00:01:25.350> moves<00:01:25.560> that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
is one of those point moves that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.080 
is one of those point moves that
actually<00:01:26.070> does<00:01:26.220> involve<00:01:26.549> your<00:01:26.729> shoulders

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
actually does involve your shoulders

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.179 
actually does involve your shoulders
quite<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.570> unlike<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> lot<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.229> them<00:01:28.470> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
quite a bit unlike a lot of them so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.830 
quite a bit unlike a lot of them so
you're<00:01:29.909> gonna<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.180> throwing<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.509> shoulders

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
you're gonna be throwing your shoulders

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.969 
you're gonna be throwing your shoulders
out<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.110> still<00:01:31.290> want<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.470> keep<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:31.710> elbow

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
out you still want to keep your elbow

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.740 
out you still want to keep your elbow
pretty<00:01:32.400> stiff<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.090> completely<00:01:33.659> because

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
pretty stiff but not completely because

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.270 
pretty stiff but not completely because
it's<00:01:34.020> gonna<00:01:34.170> need<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.470> extend<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.950> little<00:01:35.100> bit

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
it's gonna need to extend a little bit

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.530 
it's gonna need to extend a little bit
you<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.579> don't<00:01:35.820> wanna<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:35.970> throwing<00:01:36.450> your

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
you just don't wanna be throwing your

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.819 
you just don't wanna be throwing your
elbows<00:01:36.840> out<00:01:36.990> all<00:01:37.079> over<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> place<00:01:37.470> because

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
elbows out all over the place because

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.550 
elbows out all over the place because
you'll<00:01:38.130> everything<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:40.170> far<00:01:40.470> as

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you'll everything up so as far as

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.530 
you'll everything up so as far as
how<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.770> work<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.729> your<00:01:41.880> isolations<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
how to work up to your isolations and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.359 
how to work up to your isolations and
recommended<00:01:42.990> your<00:01:43.049> routines<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:43.979> you're

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
recommended your routines now you're

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.039 
recommended your routines now you're
just<00:01:44.520> gonna<00:01:44.610> need<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.970> practice<00:01:45.390> doing<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
just gonna need to practice doing this a

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.620 
just gonna need to practice doing this a
lot<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.470> do<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.829> one<00:01:46.860> hand<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.630> that's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
lot just do it with one hand and that's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.990 
lot just do it with one hand and that's
your<00:01:48.780> easy<00:01:48.960> basic<00:01:49.470> isolation<00:01:50.250> once<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.850> get

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
your easy basic isolation once you get

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.240 
your easy basic isolation once you get
used<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.720> feeling<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.220> manipulating<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
used to the feeling of manipulating the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.149 
used to the feeling of manipulating the
poi<00:01:54.210> head<00:01:54.540> around<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.409> center<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> chain

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
poi head around the center of the chain

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.950 
poi head around the center of the chain
instead<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.700> around<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> handle<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.899> is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
instead of around the handle this is

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.719 
instead of around the handle this is
going<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.259> get<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> lot<00:01:58.619> easier<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.100> again<00:01:59.579> this

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
going to get a lot easier and again this

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.310 
going to get a lot easier and again this
is<00:01:59.909> your<00:02:00.030> basic<00:02:00.360> fundamental<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.110> being<00:02:01.259> able

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
is your basic fundamental for being able

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.080 
is your basic fundamental for being able
to<00:02:01.469> build<00:02:01.649> up<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:02.880> once<00:02:03.030> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
to build up to that and then once you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.249 
to build up to that and then once you
feel<00:02:03.240> comfortable<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.840> bring<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.170> on

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
feel comfortable you can bring it up on

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.260 
feel comfortable you can bring it up on
your<00:02:04.500> wall<00:02:04.649> plane<00:02:04.950> whoops<00:02:06.079> now<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.560> terms<00:02:07.829> of

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
your wall plane whoops now in terms of

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.609 
your wall plane whoops now in terms of
working<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> new<00:02:09.539> routine<00:02:09.899> there's<00:02:10.530> a

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
working on a new routine there's a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.140 
working on a new routine there's a
really<00:02:10.860> easy<00:02:10.890> way<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.310> do<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.910> was

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
really easy way to do this that I was

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.110 
really easy way to do this that I was
taught<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.480> then<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.660> thought

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
taught and then I thought

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.160 
taught and then I thought
people<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.569> they've<00:02:13.659> had<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> great<00:02:13.900> lot<00:02:14.080> of

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
people and they've had a great lot of

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.770 
people and they've had a great lot of
great<00:02:14.290> success<00:02:14.500> with<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.519> so<00:02:15.670> basically<00:02:16.060> what

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
great success with it so basically what

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.229 
great success with it so basically what
you're<00:02:16.900> gonna<00:02:16.959> want<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.290> do<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:18.790> your<00:02:18.970> basic

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
you're gonna want to do is your basic

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.180 
you're gonna want to do is your basic
three<00:02:19.480> beat<00:02:19.629> weave<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.170> then<00:02:20.950> when<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.129> get

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
three beat weave and then when you get

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.369 
three beat weave and then when you get
to<00:02:21.340> your<00:02:21.400> side<00:02:21.640> here<00:02:21.940> just<00:02:22.659> do<00:02:22.780> one<00:02:23.049> set<00:02:23.290> of

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
to your side here just do one set of

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.350 
to your side here just do one set of
isolations<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:24.040> your<00:02:24.190> side<00:02:24.370> left<00:02:25.090> your<00:02:25.209> right

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
isolations on your side left your right

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.610 
isolations on your side left your right
doesn't<00:02:25.569> matter<00:02:25.810> I'm<00:02:26.019> a<00:02:26.080> lefty<00:02:26.379> so<00:02:26.470> I'm<00:02:26.530> gonna

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
doesn't matter I'm a lefty so I'm gonna

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.460 
doesn't matter I'm a lefty so I'm gonna
go<00:02:26.739> left<00:02:26.950> right<00:02:27.519> there<00:02:27.760> okay<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.959> I'll<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.319> from

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
go left right there okay so I'll do from

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.170 
go left right there okay so I'll do from
the<00:02:29.590> side<00:02:29.739> over<00:02:29.950> here<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:30.909> can<00:02:31.000> see<00:02:31.090> what

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
the side over here so you can see what

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.440 
the side over here so you can see what
I'm<00:02:31.239> doing<00:02:31.450> right<00:02:31.870> there<00:02:32.200> okay<00:02:33.150> right<00:02:34.150> there

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
I'm doing right there okay right there

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.720 
I'm doing right there okay right there
now<00:02:35.170> once<00:02:35.799> you<00:02:35.950> feel<00:02:36.129> like<00:02:36.159> you've<00:02:36.250> got<00:02:36.489> that

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
now once you feel like you've got that

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.910 
now once you feel like you've got that
pretty<00:02:36.970> comfortable<00:02:37.540> then<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.650> want<00:02:38.860> to

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
pretty comfortable then you want to

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.289 
pretty comfortable then you want to
repeat<00:02:39.159> it<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.430> other<00:02:39.519> side<00:02:39.909> so<00:02:40.150> right

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
repeat it on the other side so right

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.319 
repeat it on the other side so right
here<00:02:40.750> blender<00:02:41.590> right<00:02:41.739> here<00:02:42.069> okay<00:02:42.579> right<00:02:42.790> there

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
here blender right here okay right there

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.720 
here blender right here okay right there
and<00:02:43.629> then<00:02:44.319> around<00:02:44.530> her<00:02:44.709> right<00:02:44.860> there<00:02:45.129> now

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
and then around her right there now

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.190 
and then around her right there now
you're<00:02:45.849> doing<00:02:45.970> an<00:02:46.090> isolation<00:02:46.569> on<00:02:46.660> both<00:02:46.900> sides

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
you're doing an isolation on both sides

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.610 
you're doing an isolation on both sides
okay<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.879> as<00:02:49.180> long<00:02:49.299> as<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:49.660> can<00:02:49.840> do<00:02:50.079> your

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
okay and so as long as you can do your

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.309 
okay and so as long as you can do your
basic<00:02:50.799> three<00:02:51.609> be<00:02:51.819> found<00:02:52.299> way<00:02:52.690> it's<00:02:52.900> like<00:02:53.019> that

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
basic three be found way it's like that

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.110 
basic three be found way it's like that
you're<00:02:54.099> gonna<00:02:54.190> want<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.459> move<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:54.760> up<00:02:54.940> by

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
you're gonna want to move this up by

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.330 
you're gonna want to move this up by
doing<00:02:55.180> one<00:02:55.540> here<00:02:55.989> one<00:02:56.530> here<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.980> crossover

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
doing one here one here on the crossover

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.130 
doing one here one here on the crossover
and<00:02:57.670> then<00:02:58.090> one<00:02:58.239> over<00:02:58.450> here<00:02:58.629> in<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.780> back<00:02:58.930> side

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
and then one over here in the back side

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.319 
and then one over here in the back side
back<00:02:59.650> around<00:02:59.829> on<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.069> crossover<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.819> then

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
back around on the crossover and then

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.479 
back around on the crossover and then
right<00:03:01.450> at<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.599> starting<00:03:01.840> position<00:03:02.280> once<00:03:03.280> you

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
right at the starting position once you

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:04.649 
right at the starting position once you
feel<00:03:03.700> like<00:03:03.730> you're<00:03:03.940> pretty<00:03:04.030> comfortable<00:03:04.239> with

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
feel like you're pretty comfortable with

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.000 
feel like you're pretty comfortable with
doing<00:03:04.989> those<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.650> feel<00:03:05.769> like<00:03:05.799> your

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
doing those and you feel like your

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.410 
doing those and you feel like your
isolations<00:03:06.519> look<00:03:06.700> pretty<00:03:06.970> tight<00:03:07.209> like<00:03:07.390> that

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
isolations look pretty tight like that

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.229 
isolations look pretty tight like that
the<00:03:08.049> next<00:03:08.319> step<00:03:08.500> is<00:03:08.650> gonna<00:03:08.769> be<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.010> do<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.700> crank

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
the next step is gonna be to do a crank

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.610 
the next step is gonna be to do a crank
and<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.480> way<00:03:11.019> that<00:03:11.140> you're<00:03:11.230> going<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.379> work<00:03:11.500> up

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
and the way that you're going to work up

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.289 
and the way that you're going to work up
to<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.769> it's<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.579> same<00:03:12.760> thing<00:03:12.819> so<00:03:13.060> you're

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
to that it's the same thing so you're

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.759 
to that it's the same thing so you're
doin<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.480> three-beat<00:03:13.780> weave<00:03:13.900> right<00:03:14.079> here<00:03:14.319> now

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
doin a three-beat weave right here now

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.009 
doin a three-beat weave right here now
I'm<00:03:14.829> gonna<00:03:14.950> do<00:03:15.099> one<00:03:15.340> two<00:03:15.879> isolations<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.750> then

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
I'm gonna do one two isolations and then

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.280 
I'm gonna do one two isolations and then
go<00:03:17.200> back<00:03:17.410> one<00:03:18.310> two<00:03:18.760> isolations<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.750> then<00:03:20.169> go

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
go back one two isolations and then go

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.569 
go back one two isolations and then go
back<00:03:20.470> I'm<00:03:21.069> gonna<00:03:21.160> do<00:03:21.340> one<00:03:21.609> two<00:03:22.560> one<00:03:23.560> two<00:03:23.859> in

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
back I'm gonna do one two one two in

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.300 
back I'm gonna do one two one two in
pretty<00:03:25.090> soon<00:03:25.209> I'm<00:03:25.299> just<00:03:25.359> doing<00:03:25.660> one<00:03:25.900> two<00:03:26.500> three

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
pretty soon I'm just doing one two three

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.780 
pretty soon I'm just doing one two three
four<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:28.480> get<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.780> idea<00:03:29.079> so<00:03:29.549> that's<00:03:30.549> pretty

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
four you get the idea so that's pretty

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.960 
four you get the idea so that's pretty
much<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.840> whole<00:03:32.370> spiel<00:03:33.370> right<00:03:33.400> there<00:03:33.760> once

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
much the whole spiel right there once

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.610 
much the whole spiel right there once
you<00:03:34.090> can<00:03:34.239> figure<00:03:34.389> that<00:03:34.510> up<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.019> isolations

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
you can figure that up and isolations

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.790 
you can figure that up and isolations
are<00:03:35.739> gonna<00:03:35.889> be<00:03:36.010> really<00:03:36.160> simple<00:03:36.370> for<00:03:36.669> you
