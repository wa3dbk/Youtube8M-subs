00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.610
 for you 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:23.099
 the boston of this little box that is 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:26.199
 here in my hand it's from ingan chan 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:29.310
 the fourth- generation model launched by 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.689
 apple at the end of 2010 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.760
 You can see the packaging is quite 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.449
 that it was purchased in the 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.480
 electric is the price of it normal is 259 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.360
 only that he has a promotion 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.409
 where you are going out for 99 reais 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.629
 besides the pretty good price 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.830
 in the capital são paulo the new delivery of 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.650
 four o'clock 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:59.260
 so it was bought from dawn 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:03.610
 at two in the morning and now 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.010
 around 4 o'clock 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.130
 the device already have on hand a little more 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.540
 within 24 hours after approval but must 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.640
 give a discount it 's raining a lot 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:19.329
 in São Paulo today 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:31.060
 Let's take a look here whether the 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:33.929
 packaging is enough on a list of 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.929
 to help 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.090
 here he is 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.560
 You can see a lot of 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.039
 compact but very well done in the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.899
 style of the time where experience already 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:07.659
 the packaging of the product is very 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.929
 Nice this is the yellow color I found 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.110
 quite different and I find the most 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.349
 pretty yellow and blue 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:25.500
 Let's open here, we 're a little 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:30.810
 better back here easily than you are. 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.920
 can shampoo 2gb of memory 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.560
 I think the biggest problem with this device 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.560
 reads does not have much memory capacity 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:45.810
 but as it is just to listen to songs then 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.810
 It's a good size, since he's wearing it. 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.489
 now 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.380
