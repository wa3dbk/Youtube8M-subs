convincingly<00:00:15.660> one<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.230> your<00:00:16.470> favor<00:00:17.539> mmm<00:00:18.539> I

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
convincingly one in your favor mmm I

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.230 
convincingly one in your favor mmm I
think<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:19.920> just<00:00:19.949> killed<00:00:20.460> them<00:00:20.609> I'll<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:21.090> too

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
think we just killed them I'll be too

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.349 
think we just killed them I'll be too
much<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:22.230> end<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.590> fast<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.949> guess<00:00:23.359> why

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
much and just end it fast I guess why

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.330 
much and just end it fast I guess why
was<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.080> easy<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.619> kill<00:00:25.650> them<00:00:26.010> too<00:00:26.189> much

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
was it so easy to kill them too much

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.950 
was it so easy to kill them too much
because<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:27.060> felt<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.480> guys<00:00:27.660> were

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
because it just felt like you guys were

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.109 
because it just felt like you guys were
all<00:00:28.140> mechanically<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.519> out<00:00:29.640> playing<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
all mechanically just out playing the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.780 
all mechanically just out playing the
copenhagen<00:00:30.630> wolves<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.050> mean<00:00:31.769> apart<00:00:32.430> from<00:00:32.520> I

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
copenhagen wolves I mean apart from I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.520 
copenhagen wolves I mean apart from I
don't<00:00:33.300> know<00:00:33.360> if<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.630> mechanically<00:00:34.230> update

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
don't know if we mechanically update

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.250 
don't know if we mechanically update
them<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.739> think<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.300> like<00:00:36.300> took<00:00:36.960> trades

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
them I think we just like took trades

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.510 
them I think we just like took trades
are<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.469> better<00:00:37.649> times<00:00:37.920> because<00:00:38.190> i<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.460> i

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
are the better times because i think i

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.889 
are the better times because i think i
mislike<00:00:38.820> every<00:00:39.000> hook<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.300> game<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:39.719> it

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
mislike every hook this game but it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.000 
mislike every hook this game but it
didn't<00:00:40.110> really<00:00:40.200> matter<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> end<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
didn't really matter at the end of the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.580 
didn't really matter at the end of the
day<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.190> thing<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:43.170> example<00:00:43.260> on

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
day so thing is just like for example on

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.110 
day so thing is just like for example on
but<00:00:43.739> then<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.040> traded<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.910> had<00:00:45.030> our

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
but then we traded but we had our

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.990 
but then we traded but we had our
jungler<00:00:45.360> close<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.980> forced<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> Morgana

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
jungler close so we forced the Morgana

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.580 
jungler close so we forced the Morgana
to<00:00:48.210> flash<00:00:48.480> out<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> river<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.320> our

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
to flash out to the river and our

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.350 
to flash out to the river and our
jungler<00:00:49.829> was<00:00:49.980> there<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.430> knew<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
jungler was there so we knew like the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.549 
jungler was there so we knew like the
trade<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.629> were<00:00:51.719> taking<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.140> know<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.410> they

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.380 
trade we were taking you know and they
they<00:00:53.070> thought<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:53.370> were<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:53.940> doing<00:00:54.239> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
they thought they were to be doing that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.119 
they thought they were to be doing that
they<00:00:54.510> weren't<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.620> things<00:00:56.039> like

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
they weren't and it's just things like

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.250 
they weren't and it's just things like
this<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.140> really
