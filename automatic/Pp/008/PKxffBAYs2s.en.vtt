rye flour and wheat flour we just didn't

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.360 
rye flour and wheat flour we just didn't
need<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.759> leave<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.149> standing<00:00:33.600> out

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370

sourdough culture is in the top there

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.950 
sourdough culture is in the top there
and<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.280> need<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.610> stir<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> into<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.780> dough

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and we need to stir that into the dough

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.459 
and we need to stir that into the dough
into<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.070> starter<00:00:56.600> well<00:00:57.600> if<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.780> was<00:00:57.930> later<00:00:58.170> I

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
into the starter well if I was later I

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.770 
into the starter well if I was later I
had<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.280> fly<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> problem<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.359> was<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
had to fly a problem because this was a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.240 
had to fly a problem because this was a
warm<00:01:01.170> summer<00:01:01.379> day<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:02.550> need<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.820> feed<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:04.250> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
warm summer day we need to feed it and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
warm summer day we need to feed it and
we<00:01:05.400> need<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:06.650> muster<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.390> dried<00:01:09.390> surface<00:01:09.869> into

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
we need to muster the dried surface into

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.250 
we need to muster the dried surface into
the<00:01:10.320> mixture<00:01:10.939> one<00:01:11.939> part<00:01:12.240> rye<00:01:12.420> flour<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.049> one

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the mixture one part rye flour on one

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.569 
the mixture one part rye flour on one
part<00:01:13.560> white<00:01:13.979> flour

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:23.080 

and<00:01:18.560> water<00:01:19.560> equal<00:01:20.280> parts

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.950 

mix<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.240> well<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:29.270> should<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.570> one

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
mix it well I should have this one

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.880 
mix it well I should have this one
Ethan's<00:01:31.340> consistency<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.319> we<00:01:37.319> leave<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.710> for

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
Ethan's consistency so we leave that for

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.810 
Ethan's consistency so we leave that for
another<00:01:37.979> 12<00:01:38.490> hours

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.430 

you

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.200 

naturally<00:01:50.440> they<00:01:50.740> started<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.400> bubble<00:01:51.580> by<00:01:52.030> now

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
naturally they started to bubble by now

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.340 
naturally they started to bubble by now
and<00:01:52.450> that's<00:01:52.600> very<00:01:52.900> quickly<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:55.630> chew<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.140> two

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
and that's very quickly to chew the two

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.440 
and that's very quickly to chew the two
days<00:01:56.530> is<00:01:56.800> one<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.310> two<00:01:57.460> days<00:01:57.700> that's<00:01:57.910> very<00:01:58.180> fast

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
days is one to two days that's very fast

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.070 
days is one to two days that's very fast
but<00:01:58.660> I'll<00:01:58.840> feed<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.290> so<00:01:59.470> it<00:02:00.600> once<00:02:01.600> more

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
but I'll feed it so it once more

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.060 
but I'll feed it so it once more
so<00:02:02.410> it'll<00:02:02.620> profile<00:02:03.900> this<00:02:04.900> is<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:05.080> disorder<00:02:05.890> I

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
so it'll profile this is a disorder I

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.010 
so it'll profile this is a disorder I
made<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.340> hot<00:02:06.550> summer<00:02:06.850> day<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.390> that's<00:02:07.630> why<00:02:07.870> it's

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
made a hot summer day so that's why it's

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.870 
made a hot summer day so that's why it's
so<00:02:08.200> fast<00:02:08.470> in<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:08.770> winds<00:02:09.040> I<00:02:09.100> can<00:02:09.310> take<00:02:09.520> up<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.700> a

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
so fast in the winds I can take up to a

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.350 
so fast in the winds I can take up to a
week<00:02:11.490> well<00:02:12.490> you<00:02:12.550> just<00:02:12.760> need<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.060> do<00:02:13.180> this

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
week well you just need to do this

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.280 
week well you just need to do this
process<00:02:14.130> every<00:02:15.130> 12<00:02:15.430> hours

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.020 

so<00:02:20.490> 12<00:02:21.490> hours<00:02:21.670> later<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:23.500> very<00:02:23.920> nice<00:02:24.220> fluffy

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
so 12 hours later it's very nice fluffy

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.900 
so 12 hours later it's very nice fluffy
and<00:02:25.300> foamy<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:29.200> leave<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:29.890> for<00:02:29.920> another<00:02:30.370> 12

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
and foamy I just leave it for another 12

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.110 
and foamy I just leave it for another 12
hours<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.430> now<00:02:34.030> it's<00:02:34.240> done<00:02:35.280> that's<00:02:36.280> really<00:02:36.490> not

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
hours so now it's done that's really not

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.340 
hours so now it's done that's really not
much<00:02:37.300> more<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.750> do<00:02:37.900> with<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:44.080> have<00:02:44.230> to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
much more to do with this just have to

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.900 
much more to do with this just have to
check<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.709> it's<00:02:44.890> just<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.160> smell<00:02:45.520> like<00:02:45.670> rye

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
check it it's just you smell like rye

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.320 
check it it's just you smell like rye
