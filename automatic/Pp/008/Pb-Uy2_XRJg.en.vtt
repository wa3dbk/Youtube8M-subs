take some to dry and in a very short
amount<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.210> time<00:01:40.430> these<00:01:41.430> will<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.670> nice<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
amount of time these will be nice and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.480 
amount of time these will be nice and
tight<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:43.310> ready<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.430> go<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.220> go

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
with the with a good base so anyway

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.520 
with the with a good base so anyway
balance<00:02:04.170> important<00:02:04.890> and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
balance important and
