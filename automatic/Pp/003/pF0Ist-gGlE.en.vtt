 here is drawn and scripted by 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.930
 neural backyard launched in Brazil by 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.580
 panini worth 15 90 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.250
 It's one of the shocks it gives to anyone who knows 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.920
 very xote the humanity last we 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.489

 is in the book for sure you know 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.690
 he is the author of a stone that a work that 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.100
 I like you too and you can 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.079
 being with the cast 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.899
 if you know the fuck in your issue of 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.149
 luxury so let's talk about this video here 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.369
 about an old script take that would 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.180
 change synopsis for you 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.680
 I'll tell some good art to uol. 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.080
 About what I liked I did not like it so much 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 so in this place that is worth it or not 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.660
 you 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.180
 since then let's go the history of 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.400
 cat makeup is very simple she turns in 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.610
 around a double called delos 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.790
 It is their affection here and the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.010
 promise little girl we have here and they 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.800
 are in a very post-apocalyptic world. 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.900
 ahead of our time and idelos is a 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.120
 Honored gladiator he uses the style of 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.730
 fight and promise she's a girl 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.010
 with some mysterious abilities that 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.310
 are not well shown in this way. 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.190
 manga and they are on a mission where 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.229
 they have to find parts of gaia 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.060
 which are some giants who are 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.820
 spread out there they end up 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.119
 discovering that one of them is in a 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.300
 village the same village that captured them 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:09.330
 due to her being sepromi human being uses 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.400
 and the villagers are called light 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.880
 Calm down, I'll explain to you the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.640
 sus are common humans and the walls are 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.060
 the evolved form that they acquired 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.340
 characteristics of the insect but the walls 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.920
 were annihilated by the empire formed 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.019
 by the uses that are the humans that 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.590
 consider musicians as being 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:35.550
 inferior to them because of hatred for domus 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.580
 sus be got to understand 1 and so 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.560
 due to her sepromi are practically 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.110
 human in these since the promise 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.030
 apparently does not look like a human they 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.640
 are captured and must face the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.100
 fearsome warrior some in the meantime 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.860
 empire with one of its giants is 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.930
 to invade the village to capture the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.350
 another giant that is there the same as 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.940
 them and promise behind and this giant 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.950
 what a promise behind 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.830
 villagers think it's a kind of a 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.769
 God their god there they farm and 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.709
 so good and we can say as soon as we had dinner 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.080
 glosses it is divided into three parts to 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.049
 first part is the fight against or some 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.480
 aa second part of the fight against 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.040
 and the third and last part is 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.560
 more focused on the double 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.170
 for me the fact that manga is a volume 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.830
 only he is good and at the same time he is 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.860
 bad 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.830
 he knows he's good because of the advantage 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.010
 in the pocket for whoever collects such 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.170
 save money 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.489
 enough for me that I found a lot 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.530
 rich in detail 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.319
 he has a lot that deserves a 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.540
 answer but do not quit we do not 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.970
 we find this answer in this unique 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.799
 volume that there is a lot that people 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.840
 wants to know so much about the giants of 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.180
 where they came with anointing and everything else 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.519
 about the devastated world that happened 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.379
 with the world being that way knows and has 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.349
 other things than this mission of 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.390
 it's sepromi how they met 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.650
 lots of expensive thing that I wanted to know 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.540
 It just does not count because it's a volume. 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.879
 single I think this is the only point 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.310
 weak to tell the story is fine 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.500
 tied up just leaving some things to 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.470
 understand that it could have a continuation 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.019
 You're just understanding that you do not have just this. 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.479
 single volume zinho here we have 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.919
 This was what annoyed me a lot. 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.310
 a lot that I was curious about 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.520
 to know how the walls became the 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.860
 walls because humans evolved that 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.000
 way to become certain it seems that 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.370
 hunger says something that they 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.680
 environmental relations between some 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.690
 insects something like that but 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.330
 there is a lot that they should 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.270
 explain more here knows could be 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.030
 extend but there are some four five volumes 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.199
 there we are going to say 'good about the art of 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.210
 Send me here I do not have much 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.520
 talk we're talking about the backyard 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.099
 I'll show you here, look here. 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.440
 We have this art here, which is very 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:58.320
 fuck I do not have to talk face him I 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.389
 I admire the features of the sight very much because of 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.330
 fact they abyssal extreme technique of 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:06.479
 face hatching for shading and he 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.789
 uses both scenarios and 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.030
 lior characters you are giving to 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:15.870
 You see right there, this is the 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.190
 second part of the fight to be careful here 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.409
 It's not here for you 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.300
 in the face of it, in his art, art 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:27.740
 it is too were this forest 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.289
 he did it sucks 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.500
 art is exceptional face of this manga 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.990
 I like fucking hell do we have the scenes of 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.240
 He also fights that he knows how to do very well. 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.449
 I really liked the fight scenes. 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.449
 also 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.400
 the art is very good we do not have what 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.830
 complain about the art of singing 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.200
 improving and send here I think okay 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.020
 one of the best phases of 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.730
 face draws very well but we do not have 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.140
 what to complain 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.140
 this part here fuck 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.150
 so this is expensive GigantÃ£o glosses is a 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.760
 war is worth for you 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.500
 Only what made me upset in him is 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.380
 that there is a lot that should show 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.750
 only as a single volume it seems that 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.240
 they do not go deep so treats both 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.400
 so in the subject know could have more 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.440
 things show themselves as promoting 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.480
 where it came from 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.970
 their mission and behind these parts of 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.980
 A lot of things made me curious here. 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.050
 only as a single volume do we stay 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.790
 without knowing if you understand enough 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.980
 It seems that this puts some 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.110
 things like hole-slapping I still 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.000
 I do not know I liked it quite worth it 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.200
 if you take only that you will stay 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.140
 same way that I want to know more 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.800
 Only things you do not have then that's it 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.260
 face 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.480
 this is the director maquia I think 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.600
 worth you get there against 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.220
 were 90 and it will be worth 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.680
 who 's in the middle is fuck the story 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.330
 very fucking and some fans still base 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.460
 that twist his nose a little so he does not 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.000
 it's because the guy does not finish the base work 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.040
 who else does another parallel work there but 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.470
 do what the guy sometimes needs to do 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.570
 rest is the basis for doing other 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.030
 things I like a lot so I guess 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.350
 it's worth you to buy gigantic makeup 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.000
 beauty 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.950
