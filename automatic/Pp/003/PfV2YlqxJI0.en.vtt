00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
circular button which looks kind of

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.270 
circular button which looks kind of
weird<00:00:46.570> if<00:00:46.750> you've<00:00:46.930> used<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.380> lot<00:00:47.560> of<00:00:47.710> previous

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
Apple products so sort of looks almost

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.930 
Apple products so sort of looks almost
like<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.380> ripoff<00:00:50.770> even<00:00:51.160> though<00:00:51.280> it's<00:00:51.430> not<00:00:51.610> and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
like a ripoff even though it's not and

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.880 
like a ripoff even though it's not and
then<00:00:52.390> on<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.660> home<00:00:52.810> screen<00:00:53.080> you'll<00:00:53.380> also<00:00:53.500> see

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
then on the home screen you'll also see

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.690 
then on the home screen you'll also see
that<00:00:54.340> all<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:54.670> icons<00:00:55.060> are<00:00:55.360> circles<00:00:55.780> as<00:00:55.930> well

that all the icons are circles as well

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.740 
that all the icons are circles as well
now<00:00:57.700> looking<00:00:57.970> at<00:00:58.060> the<00:00:58.180> bottom<00:00:58.510> you'll<00:00:58.660> see

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
now looking at the bottom you'll see

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.030 
now looking at the bottom you'll see
that<00:00:58.990> the<00:00:59.110> main<00:00:59.290> difference<00:00:59.530> is<00:00:59.980> the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
that the main difference is the

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.820 
that the main difference is the
connector<00:01:00.790> obviously<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.690> new<00:01:01.840> iPod<00:01:02.200> uses

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830

connector obviously the new iPod uses
the<00:01:02.980> Lightning<00:01:03.310> connector<00:01:03.430> opposed<00:01:04.119> to<00:01:04.329> the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
the Lightning connector opposed to the

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.419 
the Lightning connector opposed to the
sixth<00:01:04.689> generation<00:01:04.719> which<00:01:05.320> use<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.799> bigger

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
headphone jacks are on the bottom now if

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.480 
headphone jacks are on the bottom now if
you<00:01:10.960> look<00:01:11.109> at<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.320> side<00:01:11.499> on<00:01:11.710> top<00:01:11.890> of<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.280> two

and<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:44.109> extra<00:01:44.469> functionality<00:01:45.189> seems<00:01:45.490> to

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:45.639 
and the extra functionality seems to

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.669 
and the extra functionality seems to
help<00:01:45.819> now<00:01:46.659> when<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.899> look<00:01:47.020> at<00:01:47.139> the<00:01:47.259> back<00:01:47.439> you

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
help now when you look at the back you

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.440 
help now when you look at the back you
can<00:01:47.709> see<00:01:48.009> that<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.520> sixth-generation<00:01:48.819> has<00:01:49.420> a

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
can see that the sixth-generation has a

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.629 
can see that the sixth-generation has a
clip<00:01:49.810> in<00:01:50.079> which<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.469> seventh-generation<00:01:50.889> has

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:51.639 
clip in which the seventh-generation has

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:53.399 
clip in which the seventh-generation has
gotten<00:01:51.999> rid<00:01:52.179> of<00:01:52.209> and<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:52.929> see<00:01:53.049> on<00:01:53.139> the<00:01:53.259> bottom

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
gotten rid of and you see on the bottom

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.050 
gotten rid of and you see on the bottom
the<00:01:53.679> seventh<00:01:53.979> generation<00:01:54.009> you<00:01:54.520> get<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.819> sort

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
the seventh generation you get the sort

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.469 
the seventh generation you get the sort
of<00:01:55.149> ugly<00:01:56.109> chip<00:01:56.829> out<00:01:57.069> of<00:01:57.340> your<00:01:57.609> out<00:01:57.880> of<00:01:58.389> your

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
of ugly chip out of your out of your

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.120 
of ugly chip out of your out of your
device<00:01:58.630> which<00:01:58.959> is<00:01:59.079> most<00:01:59.289> likely<00:01:59.649> has<00:01:59.829> to<00:01:59.979> do

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
device which is most likely has to do

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.279 
device which is most likely has to do
with<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.029> radio<00:02:01.359> but<00:02:01.659> you'll<00:02:01.779> see<00:02:01.929> that<00:02:01.959> that

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
with the radio but you'll see that that

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.620 
with the radio but you'll see that that
kind<00:02:02.529> of<00:02:02.729> impedes<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:03.999> color<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.329> looks

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
kind of impedes on the color and looks

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.739 
kind of impedes on the color and looks
doesn't<00:02:05.139> look<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.529> best<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:07.119> ultimately<00:02:07.569> the

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
doesn't look the best but ultimately the

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:09.300 
doesn't look the best but ultimately the
two<00:02:07.899> backs<00:02:08.140> are<00:02:08.379> totally<00:02:08.679> different<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.189> not

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
two backs are totally different and not

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.339 
two backs are totally different and not
really<00:02:09.580> comparable<00:02:10.000> now<00:02:10.689> the<00:02:10.750> software<00:02:11.260> on

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
really comparable now the software on

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.990 
really comparable now the software on
both<00:02:11.530> devices<00:02:11.830> are<00:02:12.159> fairly<00:02:12.549> similar<00:02:12.970> but

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
both devices are fairly similar but

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.190 
both devices are fairly similar but
you'll<00:02:13.330> see<00:02:13.569> that

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
you'll see that

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.809 
you'll see that
with<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.440> newer<00:02:14.620> generation<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.370> have<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.550> lot

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
with the newer generation you have a lot

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.970 
with the newer generation you have a lot
more<00:02:16.060> space<00:02:16.360> which<00:02:16.629> means<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:17.170> lot<00:02:17.800> more

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
more space which means a lot more

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.369 
more space which means a lot more
functionality<00:02:18.250> inside<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.540> applications<00:02:20.140> if

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
functionality inside the applications if

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.740 
functionality inside the applications if
you<00:02:20.470> open<00:02:20.739> up<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.950> music<00:02:21.370> app<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.910> both

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
you open up the music app on both

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.930 
you open up the music app on both
devices<00:02:23.010> you'll<00:02:24.010> see<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.459> it's<00:02:24.640> just<00:02:24.730> so

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
devices you'll see that it's just so

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.000 
devices you'll see that it's just so
much<00:02:25.060> easier<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.480> navigate<00:02:25.720> on<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.860> newer

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
much easier to navigate on the newer

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.119 
much easier to navigate on the newer
iPod<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:28.660> have<00:02:29.230> some<00:02:29.440> music<00:02:29.709> playing<00:02:29.920> you

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
iPod and I have some music playing you

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.580 
iPod and I have some music playing you
can<00:02:30.250> see<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.700> music<00:02:31.239> player<00:02:31.450> has<00:02:31.780> changed<00:02:32.380> a

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
can see the music player has changed a

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.360 
can see the music player has changed a
bit<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:34.450> new<00:02:34.630> iPod<00:02:35.050> as<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.470> can<00:02:35.560> see<00:02:35.739> here

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
bit on the new iPod as you can see here

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.370 
bit on the new iPod as you can see here
the<00:02:36.550> two<00:02:36.700> side-by-side<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.959> but<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.260> main

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
the two side-by-side this but the main

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.979 
the two side-by-side this but the main
advantage<00:02:38.560> on<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.550> Nano<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.540> have<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.720> lot

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
advantage on the Nano is you have a lot

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.320 
advantage on the Nano is you have a lot
more<00:02:41.019> room<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.860> look<00:02:42.849> through<00:02:43.060> your<00:02:43.209> music

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
more room to look through your music

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.350 
more room to look through your music
opposed<00:02:44.019> to<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.890> older<00:02:45.190> generation<00:02:45.360> where

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
opposed to the older generation where

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.979 
opposed to the older generation where
you're<00:02:46.510> stuck<00:02:46.720> in<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.080> very<00:02:47.260> small<00:02:47.650> screen<00:02:48.989> so

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
you're stuck in a very small screen so

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.630 
you're stuck in a very small screen so
you<00:02:50.049> can<00:02:50.170> see<00:02:50.319> applications<00:02:51.130> on<00:02:51.250> both<00:02:51.400> devices

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
you can see applications on both devices

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.640 
you can see applications on both devices
are<00:02:52.060> pretty<00:02:52.360> much<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.660> same<00:02:52.870> we<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.140> open<00:02:53.560> up

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
are pretty much the same we can open up

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.400 
are pretty much the same we can open up
the<00:02:53.829> clock<00:02:54.099> on<00:02:54.340> both<00:02:54.579> and<00:02:55.000> you'll<00:02:55.660> see<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.110> can

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
the clock on both and you'll see you can

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.699 
the clock on both and you'll see you can
just<00:02:56.650> swipe<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.310> side<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.840> view<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.410> timer

and the alarm etc on both devices just

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.500 
and the alarm etc on both devices just
you<00:03:02.799> have<00:03:02.920> more<00:03:03.160> real<00:03:03.400> estate<00:03:03.430> with<00:03:04.360> the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
you have more real estate with the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.289 
you have more real estate with the
seventh-generation<00:03:05.190> now<00:03:06.190> if<00:03:06.519> we<00:03:06.640> go<00:03:06.790> back<00:03:06.819> on

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
seventh-generation now if we go back on

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.660 
seventh-generation now if we go back on
to<00:03:07.510> them<00:03:07.750> one<00:03:08.049> of<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.230> major<00:03:08.440> features<00:03:09.130> you'll

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
to them one of the major features you'll

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.390 
to them one of the major features you'll
notice<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.290> seventh-generation<00:03:11.650> has

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
notice that the seventh-generation has

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.250 
notice that the seventh-generation has
which<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.940> previous<00:03:13.150> one<00:03:13.510> does<00:03:13.810> not<00:03:13.959> is

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
which the previous one does not is

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.800 
which the previous one does not is

other intentions on the Internet now

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.050 
other intentions on the Internet now
it's<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.650> little<00:04:11.859> bigger<00:04:12.069> and<00:04:12.430> you'll<00:04:12.819> need<00:04:13.000> a

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
it's a little bigger and you'll need a

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.699 
it's a little bigger and you'll need a
more<00:04:13.269> space<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.750> store<00:04:13.989> it<00:04:14.079> but<00:04:14.290> ultimately

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
more space to store it but ultimately

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.190 
more space to store it but ultimately
both<00:04:15.519> devices<00:04:15.849> are<00:04:16.209> pretty<00:04:16.419> small<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.959> should

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
both devices are pretty small and should

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.529 
both devices are pretty small and should
have<00:04:17.289> a<00:04:17.320> good<00:04:17.530> time<00:04:17.769> another<00:04:18.519> complaint<00:04:18.970> that

I know a lot of people have is sort of
looks<00:04:21.549> like<00:04:21.609> a<00:04:21.729> ripoff<00:04:22.150> something<00:04:22.630> you<00:04:22.720> see<00:04:22.960> at

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440

Walmart<00:04:23.979> and<00:04:24.190> that's<00:04:24.370> definitely<00:04:24.849> the<00:04:24.940> case

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
Walmart and that's definitely the case

as you can see even the home button
makes<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.030> fact<00:04:28.270> that

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569
