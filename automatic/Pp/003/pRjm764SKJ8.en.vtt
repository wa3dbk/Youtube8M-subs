00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.300
 the malaga of roque santacruz and the 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.160
 mighty real madrid faced this 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.440
 Saturday on the 17th day of the league 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.150
 Spanish the pellegrini team had 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.099
 the difficult mission of facing the 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.869
 set of mourinho doing local 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.460
 in the stadium the rose garden 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.070
 the hosts gave the first blow 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.509
 when disco suárez with good shot 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.759
 corner for goalkeeper adam 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.279
 inaugurated the score for málaga 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.519
 this happened at minute 4 of the stage 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.519
 complementary 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.719
 Sergio Sanchez in his attempt to love 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.489
 reject the ball involuntarily the 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.679
 He sent his own net for the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.679
 meringues will match 1 to 1 score 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.679
 two 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.450
 our compatriot roque santacruz 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.130
 he replaced the Argentine Javier Saviola 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.260
 about 20 minutes from the stage 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.570
 complementary and seven minutes later 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.970
 and with elton center to put again 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.050
 up to Malaga 2 to 1 another hit that 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.050
 they received the meringues 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.829
 and before trying to react again 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.140
 what appeared with a good left foot 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.729
 unattached corner for antonio adam 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.420
 who suffered on this occasion the goalkeeper 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.420
 iker boxes 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.060
 and 3 to 1 already marked trends in this 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.190
 I find however karim benzema put 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.830
 a bit of suspense to the match in the absence of 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.690
 9 minutes to the end of the match 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.670
 using a pass and scored from that 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.800
 way from 3 to 2 for the team of 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.480
 mourinho the 3 to 2 remained until the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.000
 final and with his triumph Malaga 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.280
 remains in fourth place with 31 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.760
 points as the meringues are 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.210
 with 33 units 16 points below the 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.210
 Barcelona leader 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.920
 things
