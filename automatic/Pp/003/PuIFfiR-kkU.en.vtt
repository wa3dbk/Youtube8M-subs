00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.249 
pocket that's the first way for a legal
shot<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.369> other<00:01:14.580> scenario<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.020> like

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
ball but the other way for a legal shot

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.940 
ball but the other way for a legal shot

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
play but all on a bar table that rule
really<00:01:49.350> never<00:01:49.680> sticks<00:01:50.070> because<00:01:50.280> you're

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
really never sticks because you're

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.580 
really never sticks because you're
playing<00:01:50.759> with<00:01:51.030> again<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> money<00:01:51.960> situation

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
playing with again the money situation

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.109 
playing with again the money situation
you<00:01:52.680> can't<00:01:52.920> bring<00:01:53.130> balls<00:01:53.369> out<00:01:53.610> can't<00:01:53.909> take

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
you can't bring balls out can't take

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.520 
you can't bring balls out can't take
balls<00:01:54.360> away<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.350> usually<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.549> bar<00:01:56.850> table

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
balls away so usually on a bar table

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.260 
balls away so usually on a bar table
it's<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.250> considered<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> scratch<00:02:00.030> and

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
it's it's just considered a scratch and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.270 
it's it's just considered a scratch and
you<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.509> ball<00:02:00.719> behind<00:02:01.140> hands<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.740> that's<00:02:02.009> how

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
you get ball behind hands so that's how

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.789 
you get ball behind hands so that's how
the<00:02:02.340> foul<00:02:02.640> works<00:02:02.909> there<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.810> again<00:02:04.140> remember

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the foul works there but again remember

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.620 
the foul works there but again remember
that<00:02:04.829> either<00:02:05.430> one<00:02:05.759> has<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.149> hit<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.509> could

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
that either one has to hit you could

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.510 
that either one has to hit you could
also<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> legal<00:02:07.829> shot<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.399> could

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
also do this as a legal shot you could

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.059 
also do this as a legal shot you could
make<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.849> cue<00:02:09.090> ball<00:02:09.300> hit<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> rail<00:02:09.750> first

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
make the cue ball hit a rail first

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.979 
make the cue ball hit a rail first
come<00:02:11.310> back<00:02:11.519> and<00:02:11.790> hit<00:02:11.969> the<00:02:11.999> ball<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.689> then

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
come back and hit the ball and then

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.319 
come back and hit the ball and then
either<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.620> cue<00:02:13.890> ball<00:02:14.099> all<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.760> ball<00:02:15.030> have

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
either the cue ball all that ball have

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.809 
either the cue ball all that ball have
to<00:02:15.450> hit<00:02:15.599> a<00:02:15.629> rail<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:16.139> it<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.319> be<00:02:16.469> a<00:02:16.499> legal<00:02:17.129> shot

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
to hit a rail for it to be a legal shot

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.030 
to hit a rail for it to be a legal shot
so<00:02:18.209> there's<00:02:18.420> your<00:02:18.569> definition<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.859> two

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
so there's your definition for the two

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.429 
so there's your definition for the two
scenarios<00:02:20.609> of<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:21.209> legal<00:02:21.510> shot<00:02:21.540> all<00:02:22.379> right

the<00:02:39.480> ball<00:02:39.689> hit<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.959> rail<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.950> legal<00:02:41.280> shot<00:02:41.310> if

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
the ball hit a rail it's a legal shot if

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.119 
the ball hit a rail it's a legal shot if
this<00:02:42.239> ball<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.319> even<00:02:43.469> do<00:02:43.650> something<00:02:43.919> like

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
this ball you can even do something like

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.929 
this ball you can even do something like
this<00:02:45.379> where<00:02:46.379> maybe<00:02:46.889> the<00:02:47.159> six<00:02:47.400> doesn't<00:02:47.819> hit<00:02:47.909> a

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
this where maybe the six doesn't hit a

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.759 
this where maybe the six doesn't hit a
rail<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.480> cue<00:02:48.689> ball<00:02:48.870> does<00:02:49.139> and<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.560> still

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
rail but the cue ball does and you still

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.909 
rail but the cue ball does and you still
hit<00:02:49.919> the<00:02:49.949> six<00:02:50.310> see<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.439> right<00:02:52.439> there<00:02:52.469> that's

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
hit the six see that right there that's

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.490 
hit the six see that right there that's
a<00:02:53.310> legal<00:02:53.819> shot<00:02:54.000> because<00:02:54.449> I<00:02:54.719> hit<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> ball<00:02:55.169> and

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
a legal shot because I hit a ball and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.259 
a legal shot because I hit a ball and
the<00:02:55.620> cue<00:02:55.799> ball<00:02:55.980> hit<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.250> rail<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.699> again

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
the cue ball hit the rail and again

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.879 
the cue ball hit the rail and again
another<00:02:57.540> legal<00:02:57.870> shot<00:02:58.199> could<00:02:58.439> be<00:02:58.590> something

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
another legal shot could be something

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.050 
another legal shot could be something
like<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.250> where<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.579> hit<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.849> rail<00:03:00.030> first

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
like this where you hit the rail first

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.439 
like this where you hit the rail first
and<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.900> comes<00:03:04.169> back<00:03:04.819> that<00:03:05.819> would<00:03:05.969> be<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.120> foul

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:06.449 
and it comes back that would be a foul

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.509 
and it comes back that would be a foul
because<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:07.079> didn't<00:03:07.290> hit<00:03:07.379> anything<00:03:07.680> okay<00:03:08.459> so

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
because it didn't hit anything okay so

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.089 
because it didn't hit anything okay so
now<00:03:08.849> you<00:03:08.909> know<00:03:09.269> who<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.900> stripes<00:03:10.469> and<00:03:10.769> who<00:03:10.919> is

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
now you know who is stripes and who is

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.189 
now you know who is stripes and who is
solids<00:03:11.639> let's<00:03:12.180> come<00:03:12.419> back<00:03:12.599> and<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.840> just<00:03:13.019> wanted

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:13.199 
solids let's come back and I just wanted

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.430 
solids let's come back and I just wanted
to<00:03:13.349> find<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.949> legal<00:03:14.400> shot
