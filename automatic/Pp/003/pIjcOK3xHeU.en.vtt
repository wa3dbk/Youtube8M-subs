object simply go into delete edge tool
and<00:00:26.970> will<00:00:27.060> give<00:00:27.180> me<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.330> simple<00:00:27.480> heads-up

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
and will give me a simple heads-up

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.290 
and will give me a simple heads-up
display<00:00:28.580> indicating<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.730> need<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> select

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
display indicating that I need to select

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.659 
display indicating that I need to select
some<00:00:30.449> edges<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.810> delete<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.590> now<00:00:31.859> as<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.340> go<00:00:32.489> in

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
some edges to delete and now as I go in

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.430 
some edges to delete and now as I go in
and<00:00:32.850> begin<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.239> select<00:00:33.480> edges<00:00:33.960> you'll<00:00:34.170> notice

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
and begin to select edges you'll notice

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.229 
and begin to select edges you'll notice
that<00:00:34.559> every<00:00:34.770> time<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.040> click<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.340> an<00:00:35.460> edge<00:00:35.610> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
that every time I click on an edge it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.690 
that every time I click on an edge it
will<00:00:36.360> automatically<00:00:36.989> delete<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.590> edge<00:00:37.800> now

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
will automatically delete that edge now

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.430 
will automatically delete that edge now
it<00:00:38.820> also<00:00:39.120> deletes<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.750> corresponding

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
it also deletes the corresponding

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.650 
it also deletes the corresponding
vertice<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.910> were<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> go<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.450> for

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
vertice so if I were to go in for

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.080 
vertice so if I were to go in for
instance<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.230> delete<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.800> edge<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
instance and delete this edge then it

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.619 
instance and delete this edge then it
deletes<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.510> interior<00:00:45.960> vertices<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.649> well

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
deletes that interior vertices as well

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.139 
deletes that interior vertices as well
so<00:00:48.629> another<00:00:49.110> related<00:00:49.500> tool<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.820> tool<00:00:51.120> called

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
so another related tool is a tool called

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.049 
so another related tool is a tool called
delete<00:00:51.899> vertex<00:00:52.410> edge<00:00:52.620> delete<00:00:53.489> vertex<00:00:53.879> edge

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
delete vertex edge delete vertex edge

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.510 
delete vertex edge delete vertex edge
will<00:00:54.360> actually<00:00:54.809> delete<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
will actually delete all of the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.459 
will actually delete all of the
connected<00:00:56.879> edges<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> given<00:00:57.660> vertice<00:00:58.140> so

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
connected edges for a given vertice so

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.319 
connected edges for a given vertice so
if<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.710> go<00:00:58.859> into<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.250> tool<00:00:59.489> it'll<00:00:59.879> convert<00:01:00.210> me

something like that lastly there is an

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.410 
something like that lastly there is an
additional<00:01:59.159> tool<00:01:59.369> called<00:01:59.790> poke<00:02:00.180> and

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
additional tool called poke and

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.630 
additional tool called poke and
subdivide<00:02:01.290> these<00:02:01.829> are<00:02:02.100> very<00:02:02.310> straightforward

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
subdivide these are very straightforward

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.609 
subdivide these are very straightforward
the<00:02:03.090> poke<00:02:03.299> tool<00:02:03.540> will<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:03.990> basically<00:02:04.140> allow

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the poke tool will just basically allow

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.310 
the poke tool will just basically allow
you<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:05.009> poke<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> single<00:02:05.880> face<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.390> split<00:02:07.140> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you to poke a single face and split that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.979 
you to poke a single face and split that
at<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> center<00:02:07.950> point<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.429> face<00:02:08.989> whereas

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
at the center point of that face whereas

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.320 
at the center point of that face whereas
the<00:02:10.319> subdivide<00:02:10.890> tool<00:02:11.129> will<00:02:11.550> allow<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
the subdivide tool will allow you to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.970 
the subdivide tool will allow you to
select<00:02:13.170> multiple

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
select multiple

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.760 
select multiple
basis<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.180> select<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.720> face<00:02:16.020> another

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
basis so I can select one face another

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.650 
basis so I can select one face another
and<00:02:17.040> until<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.520> actually<00:02:17.760> hit<00:02:18.060> enter<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.540> will

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
and until I actually hit enter it will

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.110 
and until I actually hit enter it will
not<00:02:18.810> subdivide<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:20.010> I'm<00:02:20.130> still<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.580> tool

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
not subdivide so I'm still in the tool

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.640 
not subdivide so I'm still in the tool
mode<00:02:21.390> when<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> hit<00:02:21.900> enter<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.410> will<00:02:22.440> actually

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
mode when I hit enter it will actually

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.530 
mode when I hit enter it will actually
subdivide<00:02:23.340> from<00:02:23.550> there<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:24.150> if<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.360> were<00:02:24.450> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
subdivide from there so if I were to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.839 
subdivide from there so if I were to
grab<00:02:24.720> these<00:02:24.870> faces<00:02:25.319> hit<00:02:25.920> enter<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.730> will

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
grab these faces hit enter it will

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.690 
grab these faces hit enter it will
subdivide<00:02:27.180> from<00:02:27.510> there
