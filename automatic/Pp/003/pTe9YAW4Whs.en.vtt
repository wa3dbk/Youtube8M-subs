00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.850
 the ph series to a new concept of cane 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.490
 a rod completely revised in the 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.100
 geometry and its elements 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.320
 we wanted along with the technicians rule 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.020
 if their engineers and technicians 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.420
 materials match the maximum of 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.400
 technology on this series 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.440
 the non-visible part of the technology 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.960
 used that is what it was 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.790
 used inside the pieces is 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.950
 reported in the new logos then the mat 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.350
 for this new material that weighs 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.810
 only four grams square meter e 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.310
 the Greek now therefore this new matrix 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.590
 of epoxy resin that allowed us 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.829
 at maximum performance on all 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.259
 pieces on these rods 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.580
 we wanted to use two different ones 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:12.580
 types of kits on the 521 which is the top 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.890
 range for the ph series and the 291 that it is 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.560
 the top of the carp rods we have 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.300
 used btp kits 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.450
 telescopic or with the so-called 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.819
 this way we got the top 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.729
 very quick kits at the same time 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:32.470
 therefore very performing of the kits 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.929
 extremely light and which allow us 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:40.090
 to give the barrels a real action 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:42.090
 beautiful on ph 231 and ph 451 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.970
 we have assembled the new special kits 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.340
 that is the classic kit but it lays 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.189
 series consisting of four rods 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 starting from the lowest the 231 that is 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.590
 a rod very beautiful carp from 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.509
 maximum of six surely 11 50 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.729
 maracanÃ  very beautiful also for 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:05.079
 use with the sail floats by 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.170
 291 is the top of the carp rods la 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:11.129
 cane with the heel as I said is a lot 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.500
 very stiff and also very light from 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:17.379
 451 and ours or round and fabio is standing 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.170
 testing today is really a rod 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.750
 exceptional that can be defined as true 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.180
 And then Canada tender then a cane 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.160
 perfect for all conditions but that 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.989
 certainly does not disdain in the car podium 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.599
 me in the big rivers with the burdens 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.450
 sail floats as I said fabio 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.849
 trying the 451 also have another 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.239
 big fish we just got a 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:43.930
 amour let's see maybe this is a 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.120
 love a big carp it seems to me that yes 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.129
 is taking away some nice satisfactions 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.379
 today we are going to hear what is his 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.739
 opinion on this thread has chosen to 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.790
 use the 451 being a cane of 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.290
 medium-high range 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.060
 but with the possibility of being 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.120
 also exploited within a field 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.980
 since it is an extremely light third 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.980
 rigid therefore suitable for fishing afloat 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.230
 either at 11 meters 50 using a new one 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.450
 ph system then having in the hands of 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.220
 base of 13 meters or even in the case 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.319
 the fish move a little further 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.790
 using the barrel for all his 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.819
 length 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.579
 the 521 is a real top of the range 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.970
 a really fantastic rod a lot 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:27.310
 light balanced ready and rigid one 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.799
 exceptional cane in my opinion 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.450
 probably the product par excellence 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.069
 of this series but of the whole 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.459
 production rule if we concentrate 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.590
 we really are on this cam 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.230
 happy with how the product came out 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.230
 from the soup factory 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.970
 of the ph series today i tried 521 e 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.590
 he sent me some beautiful ones 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.540
 emotions 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.239
 I find the barrel extremely rigid 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.110
 extremely ready suitable for 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.540
 race conditions and then I find 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.510
 formidable the discourse of the base to 13 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.670
 meters that engages in the piece 11 that is 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.140
 then the characteristic of the ph series 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.510
 so a can that allows you to 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.019
 fishing even a little bit shorter though 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.449
 having all the features of the cards 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.519
 of solidity of a base of 13 meters one 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.260
 very complete range for all the 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.330
 fisherman here everyone can find 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.330
 really of your ideal athlete
