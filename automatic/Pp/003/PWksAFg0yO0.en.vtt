00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
power tower I think is called

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.910 
power tower I think is called
and<00:00:43.880> that<00:00:44.510> one's<00:00:44.780> going<00:00:44.989> to<00:00:45.050> be<00:00:45.170> coming<00:00:45.500> very

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
and that one's going to be coming very

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.270 
and that one's going to be coming very
very<00:00:46.070> soon<00:00:46.430> right<00:00:47.320> here<00:00:48.320> I<00:00:48.350> have<00:00:48.710> a<00:00:48.739> layout<00:00:49.100> for

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
very soon right here I have a layout for

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.210 
very soon right here I have a layout for
the<00:00:49.700> wall<00:00:50.090> tracks<00:00:50.420> starter<00:00:51.200> set<00:00:51.530> you

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
the wall tracks starter set you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.220 
the wall tracks starter set you
recognize<00:00:52.700> that<00:00:52.730> loop<00:00:53.180> right<00:00:53.420> there<00:00:53.450> what's

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
recognize that loop right there what's

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.020 
recognize that loop right there what's
nice<00:00:54.410> about<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.800> starter<00:00:55.130> set<00:00:55.340> that<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:55.880> can

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
nice about the starter set that you can

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.090 
nice about the starter set that you can
turn<00:00:56.239> around<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:56.630> can<00:00:56.750> take<00:00:56.809> pieces<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.649> you

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
turn around you can take pieces and you

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.810 
turn around you can take pieces and you
can<00:00:58.130> take<00:00:58.520> them<00:00:58.640> off<00:00:58.790> and<00:00:58.850> interchange<00:00:59.660> them

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
can take them off and interchange them

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.889 
can take them off and interchange them
with<00:01:01.820> other<00:01:02.120> sets<00:01:02.570> that<00:01:02.809> use<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.559> same

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
with other sets that use the same

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.609 
with other sets that use the same
dimensions<00:01:07.030> see<00:01:08.030> got<00:01:08.479> Boardwalk<00:01:08.899> glass<00:01:09.170> just

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
dimensions see got Boardwalk glass just

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.539 
dimensions see got Boardwalk glass just
pop<00:01:09.859> it<00:01:10.039> right<00:01:10.069> in<00:01:10.340> there<00:01:11.530> however<00:01:12.530> this<00:01:13.189> new

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
pop it right in there however this new

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.770 
pop it right in there however this new
set<00:01:13.880> racing<00:01:14.509> duel<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:16.100> does<00:01:16.429> not<00:01:16.639> fit<00:01:16.999> with<00:01:17.420> any

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
set racing duel it does not fit with any

previous<00:01:18.170> layout<00:01:18.649> as<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.490> can<00:01:19.639> see<00:01:19.880> here<00:01:20.149> this

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
previous layout as you can see here this

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.690 
previous layout as you can see here this
let's<00:01:21.289> see<00:01:21.409> it<00:01:21.499> doesn't<00:01:21.889> match<00:01:22.039> up<00:01:22.310> right<00:01:22.459> here

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
let's see it doesn't match up right here

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.849 
let's see it doesn't match up right here
with<00:01:23.029> this<00:01:23.209> one<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.350> if<00:01:24.469> you're<00:01:24.679> already

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
with this one so if you're already

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.899 
with this one so if you're already
having<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.399> starter<00:01:25.939> sit<00:01:26.209> on<00:01:27.049> your<00:01:27.289> wall<00:01:27.909> you're

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
having a starter sit on your wall you're

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.699 
having a starter sit on your wall you're
going<00:01:29.029> to<00:01:29.119> have<00:01:29.329> to<00:01:29.569> you're<00:01:30.170> going<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.350> have<00:01:30.560> to

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:30.709 
going to have to you're going to have to

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.429 
going to have to you're going to have to
use<00:01:31.429> a<00:01:31.459> separate<00:01:32.090> layout<00:01:32.359> for<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:32.749> you<00:01:33.259> just

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
use a separate layout for this you just

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.139 
use a separate layout for this you just
have<00:01:33.649> it<00:01:33.770> off<00:01:33.889> to<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.159> side<00:01:34.369> leading<00:01:34.700> in<00:01:34.999> and

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
have it off to the side leading in and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.410 
have it off to the side leading in and
out<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:35.539> your<00:01:35.659> other<00:01:35.899> wall<00:01:36.229> track<00:01:36.560> system<00:01:37.420> now

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
out of your other wall track system now

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.719 
out of your other wall track system now
for<00:01:38.450> my<00:01:38.990> demonstration<00:01:39.889> I'm<00:01:40.159> just<00:01:40.219> going<00:01:40.579> to

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
for my demonstration I'm just going to

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.089 
for my demonstration I'm just going to
set<00:01:40.999> this<00:01:41.209> up<00:01:41.450> underneath<00:01:41.899> my<00:01:42.109> starter<00:01:42.829> set

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
set this up underneath my starter set

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.309 
set this up underneath my starter set
and<00:01:43.700> I'm<00:01:43.789> just<00:01:43.999> going<00:01:44.149> to<00:01:44.209> demonstrate<00:01:44.389> this

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
and I'm just going to demonstrate this

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.620 
and I'm just going to demonstrate this
racing<00:01:45.799> duel<00:01:45.979> by<00:01:46.159> itself<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:46.789> just<00:01:47.299> want<00:01:47.509> to

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
racing duel by itself I just want to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.510 
racing duel by itself I just want to
make<00:01:47.869> sure<00:01:48.079> when<00:01:48.349> you<00:01:48.529> guys<00:01:48.740> set<00:01:49.039> it<00:01:49.159> up<00:01:49.279> you

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
make sure when you guys set it up you

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.099 
make sure when you guys set it up you
know<00:01:49.639> the<00:01:49.789> starter<00:01:50.299> said<00:01:50.539> it<00:01:50.689> tells<00:01:50.959> you<00:01:51.079> to

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
know the starter said it tells you to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:52.659 
know the starter said it tells you to
put<00:01:51.349> the<00:01:51.499> template<00:01:51.950> all<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.249> way<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.399> the

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:52.669 
put the template all the way to the

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:54.879 
put the template all the way to the
ground<00:01:52.880> but<00:01:53.689> this<00:01:53.929> one<00:01:54.169> you<00:01:54.529> don't<00:01:54.619> want<00:01:54.799> to

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:54.889 
ground but this one you don't want to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:56.589 
ground but this one you don't want to
put<00:01:55.039> it<00:01:55.130> all<00:01:55.249> the<00:01:55.369> way<00:01:55.399> to<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.700> ground<00:01:55.880> because

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
put it all the way to the ground because

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.870 
put it all the way to the ground because
you<00:01:56.749> got<00:01:56.929> this<00:01:57.139> little<00:01:57.349> jump<00:01:57.859> at<00:01:58.039> then<00:01:58.279> this

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
you got this little jump at then this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.870 
you got this little jump at then this
little<00:01:59.299> loop<00:01:59.539> and<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.439> hangs<00:02:00.649> down<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.700> you're

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
little loop and it hangs down so you're

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.159 
little loop and it hangs down so you're
