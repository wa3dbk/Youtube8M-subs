00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.240
 Share my life 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.840
 Take me for what I am. 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.300
 Because I will never change, 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.260
 All my colors for you. 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.740
 Take my love, I will never ask you too much. 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.100
 Only what you are and everything you do. 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.400
 Actually, I do not need to see very far. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.400
 I do not want to have to leave, where you do not follow me. 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.840
 I do not want to contain again, this passion inside me. 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.760
 I can not run away from myself, there is nowhere to hide. 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.240
 Do not make me close another door. 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.000
 I do not want to suffer anymore. 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.880
 Stay in my arms, if you dare. 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.040
 Or should I imagine you're there? 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.060
 Do not go away from me. 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.180
 I have nothing, nothing, nothing ... 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.300
 Do not make me close another door. 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.060
 I do not want to suffer anymore. 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.220
 Stay in my arms, if you dare. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.000
 Or should I imagine you're there? 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.600
 Do not go away from me. Do not! 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.280
 Do not go away from me! 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.600
 Do not you dare to get away from me! 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.480
 I have nothing, nothing, nothing ... 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.820
 If I do not have you. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.360
 If I do not have you.... 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.560
 To you.
