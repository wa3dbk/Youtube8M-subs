the short I am used maybe one would be

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.680 
the short I am used maybe one would be
enough<00:01:05.059> but<00:01:05.570> because<00:01:06.470> I<00:01:06.830> saw<00:01:07.520> my<00:01:07.550> egg<00:01:08.030> first<00:01:08.420> no

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.830 
a good pinch or not pinch okay I will
measure<00:01:16.430> that<00:01:16.580> like<00:01:16.910> I<00:01:16.940> have<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.360> tip<00:01:17.660> of

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
measure that like I have a tip of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.510 
measure that like I have a tip of
teaspoon<00:01:18.500> of<00:01:18.680> salt<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:20.500> I<00:01:21.500> already<00:01:22.010> adding<00:01:22.400> a

teaspoon of salt and I already adding a
little<00:01:22.730> more<00:01:23.000> other<00:01:23.180> because<00:01:23.570> it's<00:01:23.720> easier<00:01:24.230> to

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
little more other because it's easier to

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.540 
little more other because it's easier to
make<00:01:24.910> and<00:01:25.910> I<00:01:26.840> will<00:01:27.080> add<00:01:27.560> little<00:01:27.950> by<00:01:28.280> little

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
make and I will add little by little

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.200 
make and I will add little by little
more<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:30.020> cannot<00:01:30.590> do<00:01:30.800> too<00:01:31.250> much<00:01:31.460> at<00:01:31.670> one<00:01:31.909> time

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
more you cannot do too much at one time

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.540 
more you cannot do too much at one time
because<00:01:32.420> this<00:01:32.750> would<00:01:33.230> be<00:01:33.409> like<00:01:33.560> too<00:01:34.100> much<00:01:34.310> it

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
because this would be like too much it

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.620 
because this would be like too much it
to<00:01:34.850> stop<00:01:35.120> and<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:36.020> has<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.710> be<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.890> little<00:01:37.280> bit<00:01:37.700> on

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
to stop and it has to be a little bit on

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.890 
to stop and it has to be a little bit on
the<00:01:38.960> thicker<00:01:39.260> side<00:01:39.850> because<00:01:40.850> today<00:01:41.570> we<00:01:41.630> will

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
the thicker side because today we will

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:50.160 
the thicker side because today we will
use<00:01:42.170> some<00:01:42.550> little<00:01:43.550> machine

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.069

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
knife or the spoon I can do it because

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.359 
knife or the spoon I can do it because
if<00:02:01.189> you<00:02:01.280> cannot<00:02:01.520> find<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.710> pushing<00:02:03.710> or<00:02:04.039> the

if you cannot find it pushing or the

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.350 
if you cannot find it pushing or the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
little gadget then you can do it by hand

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.479 
little gadget then you can do it by hand
or<00:02:08.690> by<00:02:08.899> return<00:02:09.759> knife<00:02:10.759> or<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.150> spoon<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:13.130> these

or by return knife or a spoon and these

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.750 
or by return knife or a spoon and these
things<00:02:13.910> what<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:15.019> using<00:02:15.530> knife<00:02:15.860> under<00:02:16.430> spoon

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
things what you using knife under spoon

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.360 
things what you using knife under spoon
you<00:02:17.480> will<00:02:17.690> figure<00:02:17.959> it<00:02:18.200> out<00:02:18.349> little<00:02:18.860> by<00:02:19.099> little

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
you will figure it out little by little

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.330 
you will figure it out little by little
when<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.849> trying<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.769> getting<00:02:22.130> more

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
when you trying it and you getting more

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.720 
when you trying it and you getting more
expert<00:02:22.849> in<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.319> then<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:24.590> find<00:02:24.920> out<00:02:25.040> if<00:02:25.310> it's<00:02:25.489> a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
expert in it then you find out if it's a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.570 
expert in it then you find out if it's a
spoon<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.269> easier<00:02:26.720> for<00:02:26.989> you<00:02:27.590> or<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:28.069> nice<00:02:28.250> then

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
spoon is easier for you or the nice then

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.100 
spoon is easier for you or the nice then
you<00:02:28.700> do<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:28.910> either<00:02:29.269> way

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
you do it either way

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.830 
you do it either way
Eagleman<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.780> use<00:02:32.930> either<00:02:33.260> one<00:02:34.390> it's<00:02:35.390> up<00:02:35.569> to

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
three minutes because this with the

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.300 
three minutes because this with the
little<00:05:02.270> machine<00:05:02.660> it's<00:05:02.840> small<00:05:03.680> so<00:05:04.040> you<00:05:04.130> don't

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
little machine it's small so you don't

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.270 
little machine it's small so you don't

have to cook at there that long but with
my<00:05:07.550> other<00:05:07.910> oven<00:05:08.419> you<00:05:08.600> do<00:05:08.780> it<00:05:08.930> by<00:05:09.139> hand<00:05:09.410> or<00:05:09.620> with

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
my other oven you do it by hand or with

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.580 
my other oven you do it by hand or with
the<00:05:09.950> knife<00:05:10.160> or<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.910> spoon<00:05:11.330> then<00:05:12.080> you<00:05:12.260> have<00:05:12.440> to

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
the knife or the spoon then you have to

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.820 
the knife or the spoon then you have to
cook<00:05:12.770> it<00:05:12.889> a<00:05:12.950> little<00:05:13.190> bit<00:05:13.430> more<00:05:13.669> because<00:05:14.150> you're

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
cook it a little bit more because you're

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.520 
cook it a little bit more because you're
no<00:05:15.830> kidney<00:05:16.250> or<00:05:16.280> status<00:05:17.000> will<00:05:17.210> be<00:05:17.389> bigger<00:05:17.630> nor

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
no kidney or status will be bigger nor

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.500 
no kidney or status will be bigger nor
my<00:05:18.889> feet<00:05:19.160> now<00:05:19.580> I<00:05:19.610> think<00:05:20.450> it's<00:05:20.660> enough<00:05:21.340> cooked

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
my feet now I think it's enough cooked

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.080 
my feet now I think it's enough cooked
then<00:05:23.510> I<00:05:23.780> find<00:05:24.710> this<00:05:24.889> a<00:05:24.950> speculative<00:05:25.520> Chinese

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
then I find this a speculative Chinese

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.510 
then I find this a speculative Chinese
tour<00:05:26.389> of<00:05:26.510> this<00:05:26.750> little<00:05:27.139> strainers<00:05:27.950> I<00:05:28.190> really

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
tour of this little strainers I really

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.150 
tour of this little strainers I really
like<00:05:28.729> it<00:05:28.970> so<00:05:29.810> it's<00:05:30.320> easier<00:05:30.740> to<00:05:30.919> take

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
like it so it's easier to take

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:57.990 
like it so it's easier to take
everything<00:05:31.520> out

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.320 

my<00:05:59.000> dish<00:06:00.190> for<00:06:01.190> a<00:06:01.220> Dean<00:06:02.620> and<00:06:03.620> after<00:06:04.430> I'm<00:06:04.610> sure<00:06:04.910> I

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
my dish for a Dean and after I'm sure I

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.960 
my dish for a Dean and after I'm sure I
don't<00:06:06.200> want<00:06:06.560> this<00:06:06.680> to<00:06:07.370> stick<00:06:07.700> together

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
don't want this to stick together

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.400 
don't want this to stick together
immediately<00:06:08.870> I<00:06:09.470> add<00:06:10.040> a<00:06:10.070> little<00:06:10.370> oil<00:06:11.290> and<00:06:12.290> I

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
immediately I add a little oil and I

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.870 
immediately I add a little oil and I
knew<00:06:12.620> that<00:06:12.650> well<00:06:14.290> and<00:06:15.290> then<00:06:16.220> I<00:06:16.370> will<00:06:16.580> show<00:06:16.820> you

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
knew that well and then I will show you

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:25.630 
knew that well and then I will show you
the<00:06:17.150> other<00:06:20.620> other<00:06:21.620> way<00:06:21.950> to<00:06:22.010> do<00:06:22.280> it<00:06:22.310> I<00:06:24.640> am

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
the other other way to do it I am

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.000 
the other other way to do it I am
showing<00:06:26.300> you<00:06:26.450> both<00:06:26.690> and<00:06:27.200> what<00:06:27.410> I<00:06:27.440> made<00:06:27.830> with

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
showing you both and what I made with

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.520 
showing you both and what I made with
the<00:06:28.220> spaetzle<00:06:28.730> maker<00:06:28.760> this<00:06:29.660> is<00:06:29.840> smaller<00:06:30.170> one

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
the spaetzle maker this is smaller one

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.450 
the spaetzle maker this is smaller one
and<00:06:30.880> then<00:06:31.880> you<00:06:32.090> can<00:06:32.120> see<00:06:32.540> the<00:06:32.690> bigger<00:06:32.900> one<00:06:33.460> but

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
and then you can see the bigger one but

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.610 
and then you can see the bigger one but
we<00:06:34.670> give<00:06:35.000> it<00:06:35.210> an<00:06:35.390> hour<00:06:35.630> I<00:06:35.750> did<00:06:36.080> with<00:06:36.260> the<00:06:36.410> knife

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
we give it an hour I did with the knife

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.410 
we give it an hour I did with the knife
and<00:06:36.980> spoon<00:06:38.320> my<00:06:39.320> garden<00:06:40.310> observe<00:06:40.700> this<00:06:40.910> way<00:06:41.120> and

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
and spoon my garden observe this way and

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.380 
and spoon my garden observe this way and
somehow<00:06:41.720> I<00:06:42.290> like<00:06:42.650> the<00:06:43.100> big<00:06:43.310> one<00:06:43.550> so<00:06:44.000> it's<00:06:44.120> up<00:06:44.360> to

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 
somehow I like the big one so it's up to
