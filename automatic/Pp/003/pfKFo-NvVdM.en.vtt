 become the rce 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.520
 and then in particular 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.749
 this week there is a show with the text of a small one at the moment 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:19.859
 is that made 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.310
 we are this is an example of how it is not correct 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.630
 the jury deserves 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.550
 is normal 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.029
 it's probably not so bad at all 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.569
 now we are preparing for the show 

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:36.529

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.230

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 sin to specify this 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.350
 I prefer to live with Ajax 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.620
 I want that 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.310
 and this is a man 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.340
 but this 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.340
 In addition, the company wants the year 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.750
 this year is 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.060
 and we all know that made zn are all in theaters 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.620
 sisters was the cause 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.870
 if so 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.130

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.230
 patrick van domburg racing 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.870
 the same reason 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.560
 the measures were taken 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.560
 it is important for young people 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.079
 music can be listened to 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.470
 from this way 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.520
 although not yet known 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.159
 almost all of the making is not over 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.250
 At the beginning of December, all theaters in the Netherlands and Flanders became at the beginning of January
