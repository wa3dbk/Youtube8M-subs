00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
because right now all can hear is the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.790 
because right now all can hear is the
voice<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:44.459> wounded<00:02:45.360> people<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.930> the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
voice of wounded people and the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.130 
voice of wounded people and the
reminders<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.640> what<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.330> lady<00:02:48.570> used<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.989> be

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
reminders of what this lady used to be

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.900 
reminders of what this lady used to be
and<00:02:49.700> they<00:02:50.700> needed<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.120> get<00:02:51.830> clarity<00:02:55.760> for<00:02:56.760> his

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
and they needed to get clarity for his

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.259 
and they needed to get clarity for his
own<00:02:57.060> heart<00:02:58.340> because<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.640> bring<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.970> word<00:03:00.120> of

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
own heart because to bring a word of

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.550 
own heart because to bring a word of
resurrection<00:03:01.019> is<00:03:03.080> different<00:03:04.080> than<00:03:04.260> just<00:03:04.440> a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
resurrection is different than just a

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.600 
resurrection is different than just a
shot<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.950> dark

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.480
