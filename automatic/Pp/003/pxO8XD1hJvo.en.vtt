Camaro so over here we've got an oil
pressure<00:00:16.710> gauge<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:18.240> we<00:00:18.570> got<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.960> nylon<00:00:19.439> line

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
pressure gauge and we got the nylon line

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.640 
pressure gauge and we got the nylon line
and<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.550> fittings<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.480> then<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.140> also<00:00:22.289> have

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
and the fittings and then we also have

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.970 
and the fittings and then we also have
the<00:00:22.859> other<00:00:23.039> fitting<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.769> assist<00:00:25.769> us

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the other fitting is going to assist us

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.769 
the other fitting is going to assist us
in<00:00:26.039> hooking<00:00:26.730> up<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> back<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> gauge

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
in hooking up to the back of the gauge

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.350 
in hooking up to the back of the gauge
there<00:00:28.429> so<00:00:30.080> you<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.199> let's<00:00:31.410> get<00:00:31.529> started<00:00:31.859> so

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
there so you know let's get started so

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.580 
there so you know let's get started so
one<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> first<00:00:33.660> things<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.079> need<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> do<00:00:34.469> is

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
one of the first things we need to do is

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.530 
one of the first things we need to do is
we<00:00:34.680> need<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.860> locate<00:00:35.280> where<00:00:35.550> exactly<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.300> oil

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
we need to locate where exactly this oil

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.389 
we need to locate where exactly this oil
pressure<00:00:36.809> sending<00:00:37.500> unit<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.280> be

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
pressure sending unit is going to be

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.170 
pressure sending unit is going to be
mounted<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:40.100> don't<00:00:41.100> know<00:00:41.309> if<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:42.090> it

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
mounted and don't know if we can see it

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.869 
mounted and don't know if we can see it
from<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.600> angle<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:44.059> it<00:00:45.059> should<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:46.879> right

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
from this angle but it should be right

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.790 
from this angle but it should be right
in<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.719> let's<00:00:51.870> get<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.079> good<00:00:52.260> view<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.739> think

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
in here so let's get a good view I think

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.819 
in here so let's get a good view I think
you<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.059> there<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> before<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
you can see that in there so before I

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.860 
you can see that in there so before I
thread<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.280> wider<00:00:57.000> end<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.510> fitting

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
thread the wider end of this fitting

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.150 
thread the wider end of this fitting
into<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> block<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.039> is

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
into the block what I'm going to do is

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.630 
into the block what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> run<00:00:59.660> the<00:01:00.660> nylon<00:01:01.170> line<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.770> it's

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
I'm going to run the nylon line and it's

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.070 
I'm going to run the nylon line and it's
already<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> nut<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.600> compression

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
already got the nut and the compression

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.800 
already got the nut and the compression
sleeve<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.909> I'm<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.570> that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
sleeve on it I'm just going to get that

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.320 
sleeve on it I'm just going to get that
hand<00:01:07.799> tight<00:01:09.020> on<00:01:10.460> here<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.090> will<00:01:12.240> just

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
hand tight on here and this will just

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.700 
hand tight on here and this will just
make<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.750> bit<00:01:12.960> easier<00:01:13.229> once<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.560> get

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
make it a little bit easier once I get

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.670 
make it a little bit easier once I get
this<00:01:13.920> threaded<00:01:14.220> into<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> block<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.720> this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
this threaded into the block and this

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.620 
this threaded into the block and this
next<00:01:16.950> step<00:01:17.189> I'm<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.939> can't<00:01:18.509> really

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
next step I'm going to do I can't really

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.240 
next step I'm going to do I can't really
show<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.960> guys<00:01:19.259> because<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.710> such<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> tight

extra line okay now that we've got our

oil<00:02:58.079> line<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.769> what<00:02:58.920> we're<00:02:59.040> going<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.340> is

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
oil line in what we're going to do is

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.339 
oil line in what we're going to do is
similar<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.480> what<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:00.690> did<00:03:00.810> with<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.019> engine

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
similar to what we did with the engine

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.110 
similar to what we did with the engine
putting<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.709> compression<00:03:02.370> sleeve<00:03:02.640> together

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
putting the compression sleeve together

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.410 
putting the compression sleeve together
what<00:03:03.959> we<00:03:04.049> do<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.260> we<00:03:04.319> take<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> night<00:03:05.299> we<00:03:06.299> go

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
what we do is we take the night we go

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.160 
what we do is we take the night we go
ahead<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:06.840> put<00:03:07.079> that<00:03:08.480> onto<00:03:09.480> our<00:03:09.510> line<00:03:09.870> like

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
ahead and we put that onto our line like

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.850 
ahead and we put that onto our line like
so<00:03:11.720> then<00:03:12.720> we<00:03:12.810> take<00:03:12.959> our<00:03:13.110> compression<00:03:13.620> sleeve

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
so then we take our compression sleeve

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.130 
so then we take our compression sleeve
which<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.069> this<00:03:14.250> little<00:03:14.489> buddy<00:03:14.640> here<00:03:15.140> just

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
which is this little buddy here just

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.979 
which is this little buddy here just
like<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.790> again<00:03:18.290> onto<00:03:19.290> our<00:03:19.440> line<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:21.600> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
like that again onto our line and the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.500 
like that again onto our line and the
final<00:03:22.350> step<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.680> any<00:03:22.829> repair<00:03:23.340> /<00:03:23.700> upgrade<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.420> to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
final step of any repair / upgrade is to

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.050 
final step of any repair / upgrade is to
fire<00:03:24.690> up<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.959> vehicle<00:03:25.290> or<00:03:25.850> whatever<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:26.970> have

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
fire up the vehicle or whatever you have

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.849 
fire up the vehicle or whatever you have
to<00:03:27.120> do<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.810> make<00:03:27.989> sure<00:03:28.019> that<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.560> did<00:03:28.739> it

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
to do to make sure that you did it

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.080 
to do to make sure that you did it
correctly<00:03:28.889> in<00:03:29.549> that<00:03:29.700> you're<00:03:31.370> your<00:03:32.370> repair<00:03:32.730> /

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
correctly in that you're your repair /

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.670 
correctly in that you're your repair /
upgrade<00:03:33.480> in<00:03:33.600> this<00:03:33.750> case<00:03:33.930> make<00:03:34.230> sure<00:03:34.260> our<00:03:34.380> gauge

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
upgrade in this case make sure our gauge

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.280 
upgrade in this case make sure our gauge
is<00:03:34.859> going<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.069> give<00:03:35.190> us<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.400> reading

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:51.059 

let's<00:03:41.290> try<00:03:41.500> that<00:03:41.560> again<00:03:49.020> there<00:03:50.020> we<00:03:50.140> go<00:03:50.319> much

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
let's try that again there we go much

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.110 
let's try that again there we go much
better

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.979 

so<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.900> steady<00:03:56.230> 40<00:03:56.680> psi<00:03:57.220> are<00:03:57.280> there<00:03:57.640> which<00:03:58.090> not

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
so the steady 40 psi are there which not

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.869 
so the steady 40 psi are there which not
too<00:03:59.170> shabby<00:03:59.530> for<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.980> conditions<00:04:00.400> vehicles

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
too shabby for the conditions vehicles

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.369 
too shabby for the conditions vehicles
in<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.060> seems<00:04:04.360> our<00:04:04.540> gauge<00:04:04.810> has<00:04:05.080> worked

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
in so it seems our gauge has worked

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.930 
in so it seems our gauge has worked
which<00:04:05.709> is<00:04:05.860> good<00:04:06.069> I<00:04:06.250> didn't<00:04:06.550> really<00:04:06.700> want<00:04:06.879> to

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
which is good I didn't really want to

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.580 
which is good I didn't really want to
diagnose<00:04:07.420> any<00:04:07.690> other<00:04:07.900> problems<00:04:08.379> it<00:04:08.530> was

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
diagnose any other problems it was

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.809 
diagnose any other problems it was
assumed<00:04:08.890> that<00:04:08.920> would<00:04:09.099> be<00:04:09.220> associated<00:04:09.790> with

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
assumed that would be associated with
