plate<00:01:52.020> which<00:01:52.439> interesting<00:01:53.039> enough<00:01:53.189> about

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
plate which interesting enough about

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.669 
plate which interesting enough about
this<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.299> actually<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.200> second

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
this is this is actually the second

the carolina foamposite pro as you can
see<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.659> shank<00:02:03.929> plane<00:02:04.109> goes<00:02:04.289> from<00:02:04.469> about

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
see here the shank plane goes from about

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.859 
see here the shank plane goes from about
the<00:02:04.829> mid-foot<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.490> halfway<00:02:05.789> to<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
heel in the helio more of just that i

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.510 
heel in the helio more of just that i
see<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.240> then<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.899> red<00:02:10.730> traction<00:02:11.730> black<00:02:12.569> and

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
see and then the red traction black and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.540 
see and then the red traction black and
yep<00:02:14.520> all<00:02:14.819> black<00:02:15.150> Penny<00:02:15.720> sent<00:02:16.020> logo<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:17.430> that's

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
yep all black Penny sent logo so that's

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.580 
yep all black Penny sent logo so that's
it<00:02:17.640> for<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.850> soul<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.209> see<00:02:18.390> soul<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.870> really

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
it for the soul I see soul I really

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.840 
it for the soul I see soul I really
think<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:19.860> came<00:02:19.980> out<00:02:20.040> good<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> lot<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.610> people

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
think it came out good a lot of people

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.220 
think it came out good a lot of people
were<00:02:20.940> actually<00:02:21.060> saying<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.600> they<00:02:21.720> wish<00:02:21.959> that

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
were actually saying that they wish that

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.170 
were actually saying that they wish that
the<00:02:22.680> soul<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.100> different<00:02:23.400> color<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:24.150> I

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the soul is a different color but I

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.240 
the soul is a different color but I
actually<00:02:24.480> like<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.050> Cecil<00:02:25.380> I'll<00:02:25.680> get<00:02:26.040> an

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
actually like this I Cecil I'll get an

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.940 
actually like this I Cecil I'll get an
all-around<00:02:26.880> angle<00:02:27.180> for<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.590> coming<00:02:28.590> up<00:02:28.709> from

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
all-around angle for you coming up from

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.620 
all-around angle for you coming up from
the<00:02:29.010> carbon<00:02:29.610> fiber<00:02:29.760> shank<00:02:30.060> plate<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.390> see<00:02:30.540> it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
the carbon fiber shank plate you see it

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.300 
the carbon fiber shank plate you see it
really<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.959> lot<00:02:31.170> here<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.740> outside<00:02:32.069> part<00:02:32.250> of

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
really a lot here on the outside part of

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.980 
really a lot here on the outside part of
the<00:02:32.370> shoe<00:02:32.520> again<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:33.390> black<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.840> red

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
the shoe again that black and red

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.930 
the shoe again that black and red
checker<00:02:34.290> board<00:02:34.560> carbon<00:02:34.890> fiber<00:02:35.099> I<00:02:35.340> think<00:02:35.849> it

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
checker board carbon fiber I think it

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.610 
checker board carbon fiber I think it
works<00:02:36.209> really<00:02:36.330> well<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.050> think<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.320> red<00:02:37.500> on

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
works really well and I think the red on

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.290 
works really well and I think the red on
the<00:02:37.710> shoot<00:02:37.920> really<00:02:38.220> makes<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.490> pop<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.970> then

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
the shoot really makes it pop and then

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.000 
the shoot really makes it pop and then
you<00:02:39.420> can<00:02:39.540> see<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.780> carbon<00:02:40.110> fiber<00:02:40.290> again<00:02:40.770> on

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
you can see the carbon fiber again on

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.480 
you can see the carbon fiber again on
the<00:02:41.250> inside

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
the inside

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.030 
the inside
the<00:02:42.640> sheer<00:02:42.850> right<00:02:43.030> there<00:02:43.740> give<00:02:44.740> you<00:02:44.830> another

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
the sheer right there give you another

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.300 
the sheer right there give you another
look<00:02:46.170> yeah<00:02:47.170> I'm<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.380> big<00:02:47.590> fan<00:02:47.770> of<00:02:47.800> carbon<00:02:48.100> fiber

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
look yeah I'm a big fan of carbon fiber

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.030 
look yeah I'm a big fan of carbon fiber
and<00:02:48.630> when<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.660> saw<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.290> was<00:02:50.380> two<00:02:50.530> colors<00:02:50.830> or

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
and when I saw that it was two colors or

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.470 
and when I saw that it was two colors or
really<00:02:51.250> grabbed<00:02:51.490> me<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.970> course<00:02:52.180> that's<00:02:52.390> not

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
really grabbed me of course that's not

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.750 
really grabbed me of course that's not
the<00:02:52.630> only<00:02:52.660> reason<00:02:52.870> i<00:02:53.170> bought<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.470> shoe<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:54.310> it

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
the only reason i bought the shoe but it

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.160 
the only reason i bought the shoe but it
was<00:02:54.880> definitely<00:02:55.060> up<00:02:55.300> there<00:02:55.360> very<00:02:55.690> cool<00:02:55.900> and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
and personally even before the shoot

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.460 
and personally even before the shoot
came<00:03:44.890> out<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.550> think<00:03:46.210> that<00:03:46.360> winter<00:03:46.570> camo<00:03:46.900> which

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.570 
came out I think that winter camo which
is<00:03:47.620> why<00:03:47.710> I'm<00:03:47.800> kind<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.040> calling<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:48.370> because

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
is why I'm kind of calling this because

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.550 
is why I'm kind of calling this because
it's<00:03:48.730> white<00:03:48.910> based<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:49.900> my<00:03:50.050> favorite<00:03:50.410> I

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.890 
it's white based is that my favorite I
love<00:03:50.740> Blue's<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:52.120> don't<00:03:52.270> really<00:03:52.480> see<00:03:52.600> here
