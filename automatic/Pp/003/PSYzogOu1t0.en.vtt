00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 now yes the explanation of the song to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.080
 cries of hope from álex wagon and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.090
 let's start with the part of the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.950
 introduction before seeing the part of 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.170
 introduction or I have to make sure of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.039
 that you know some effects that we are going to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.260
 use as the liver as the glissando and 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.439
 in trine the liver is nothing else to do 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.140
 sound two notes with a single touch of 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.050
 hand with a single hand press 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.369
 right we play here 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.230
 and martí we call with the index and they go to 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.879
 know two notes but alone 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.320
 we have only pressed once with the hand 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.000
 right we can also do this 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.630
 or we can also do a link 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.630
 falling 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.660
 and the liver symbol is like a 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.890
 crescent that joins two numbers in the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:58.750
 tablature the glissando is the same but 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.600
 instead of hammering we make a 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.400
 slip the finger and join two 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.430
 specks with a single touch of right hand 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.440
 and the sliding symbol is or 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.500
 Slip is a bond between 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.030
 table numbers tura 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.600
 and the trill are three numbers that is but 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.909
 they are three notes 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.509
 and that will sound with a single touch of 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.509
 right hand 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.570
 and it's actually an uplinking 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:33.270
 more bound down 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.760
 and there are three notes that sound the same 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.400
 time with a single touch of right hand 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.380
 and did symbol is a crescent but that 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.100
 covers three numbers in the table ture ok 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.290
 knowing that now I'm going to play 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.090
 slowly the effects are there 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.229
 marked in the table and you are going to 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.229
 give an account when we use them 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.370
 yes 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.720
 two 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.620
 Y 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.400
 and when I entered the singing part we're going 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.640
 to start accompanying with an arpeggio 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:38.189
 which will be the pgc thumb index and a half 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:39.970
 annular half index again thumb e 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.250
 index 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.490
 and there we have a progression that 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.630
 Repeat several times that they are a compass 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.630
 of a compass 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.620
 and then we have my least half measure in 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.730
 that middle compass we only make the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.380
 four first movements and then if 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.360
 minor others 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.280
 we complete the middle measure but 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.810
 doing the first four movements 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.810
 from the previous 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.070
 and the C major will not do it here 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.490
 if it is not more comfortable to do it 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.490
 here 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.299
 do not 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.030
 well in the choir part we're going to 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.860
 change strum number 7 is the radius 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.410
 number 7 is very simple thumb to 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.110
 down index up 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.350
 to cancel half index down but 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.610
 turning off 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.610
 and index up 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.260
 Y 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.150
 and the part of the solo starts like this 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.319
 we start with two strings in the air the 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.319
 third and the second 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.310
 quick touch would be like this 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.200
 today we use making a ticket, I explained 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.620
 without you 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.150
 ok we go to the second tabla tura 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.629
 Y 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.660
 Y 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.770
 yes 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.260
 and now we start with the rope rope 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.260
 from air 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.419
 and this song can be found in
