00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.670
 Let's cook carp in foil with mustard and mayonnaise 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:23.870
 Combine mayonnaise with mustard, add salt, ground black 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:43.590
 Pepper, mix thoroughly. 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.700
 Carp clean, gut. 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.950
 Head, tail, fins do not cut. 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:03.670
 Lubricate one side of the carp with mustard-mayonnaise mixture. 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:23.680
 Also grease the belly of the fish on both sides. 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:32.820
 Put garlic cloves in your belly 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.820
 and bay leaf. 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.010
 Secure the fish belly with a toothpick. 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.820
 So, as a large carp is difficult to make one toothpick 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:02:10.239
 two puncture, so enough 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.420
 make one puncture. 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.980
 Secure in two places. 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.120
 Lay out the foil, lay on it carp greased 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:56.140
 side, then lubricate the other 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.140
 side of the fish. 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:38.640
 Wrap the fish in foil, shift the dry baking tray, 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.239
 send to oven preheated to 200 Â° C for 30-35 minutes. 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:51.400
 If the carp has less weight for 20-25 minutes. 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.200
 Remove the fish from the oven, unfold the foil (I 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:23.360
 cut), just cut neatly, just as I accidentally 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.400
 cut the skin. 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:45.300
 Put the carp in the oven again for 10 minutes, when 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.250
 the same temperature, during this time our fish will become golden. 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:58.330
 Remove from oven, let carp cool, lay out 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.759
 on the dish either whole or cut into pieces. 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.880
