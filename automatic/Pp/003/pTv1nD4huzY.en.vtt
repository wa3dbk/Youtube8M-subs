00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
pretty much he doesn't really have a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.910 
pretty much he doesn't really have a
reason<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.120> guess<00:00:57.329> why<00:00:57.600> he's<00:00:57.840> doing<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.199> he

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
reason I guess why he's doing this he

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.270 
reason I guess why he's doing this he
just<00:00:59.100> wants<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.579> see<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.239> good<00:01:00.719> show<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.280> that

just wants to see a good show and that
pretty<00:01:02.489> much<00:01:02.640> makes<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.710> simple<00:01:04.710> basis<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.430> an

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
pretty much makes a simple basis for an

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.550 
pretty much makes a simple basis for an
anime<00:01:05.939> because<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.840> guy<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.049> wants<00:01:07.439> to
