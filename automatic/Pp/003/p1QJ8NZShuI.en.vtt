 hello my name is felix barth today 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.760
 Deputy chef in the castle 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.560
 Eckberg and today I show them the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.590
 channeled split off to ours 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.439
 court that's right on the whole 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.949
 let's just take one 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.390
 nice big apple to share in the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.860
 In the middle, the segments will be rough 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.480
 cut that we need in the end with it 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.570
 that's right with one too 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.660
 looks nice, we give it all 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.730
 a very nice woman that watch that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.320
 even peel from just that on 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.530
 Do not hang between your toes in the end 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.530
 remains 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.630
 so it looks but already quite good 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.820
 The optimum would be of course if we were ourselves 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.640
 a very big solid apple 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.530
 also seek out a certain 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.810
 principles does not end there 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.650
 It gets so cute because we do it again 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.510
 caramelize 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:28.300
 if he becomes that you have to be beautiful 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:32.399
 you're basically in the reason you have to ask 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.399
 us that so gate on the stove 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:45.020
 do a bit of sugar purely as a 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:48.010
 feel for proportions of sugar 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.010
 Caramelize a bit 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.250
 it can take a bit of color 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:56.250
 at the end wanted a nice easy 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.120
 color had split off and then 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.520
 some were so mixed 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.920
 almost the caramel the apple and 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.090
 have teetered nice and taste 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.040
 stop only to take care that it does not now 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.880
 too hot even at the breeding and burns 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.880
 and the whole internet 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.750
 I think now we have the point 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.560
 reached where the whole a bit 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.560
 can replace 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.790
 which is almost in so far that was a 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.290
 a bit easier to do and in the end though 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.580
 The whole thing with a pinch of salt 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.560
 Season 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.940
 because that there should be no reader and 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.209
 which is in the end a good thing because our 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.209
 from
