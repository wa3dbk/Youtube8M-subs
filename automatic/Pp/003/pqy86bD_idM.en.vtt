00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079

held that up until I think it was June
or<00:00:46.289> July<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.070> broke<00:00:47.579> oh<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.420> broke<00:00:48.840> my

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
or July and then I broke oh I broke my

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.720 
or July and then I broke oh I broke my
own<00:00:49.200> record<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.680> June<00:00:49.890> or<00:00:50.010> July<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
own record in June or July and then I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.689 
own record in June or July and then I
lost<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.770> was<00:00:52.800> September<00:00:53.129> and

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
lost it in I think it was September and

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.970 
lost it in I think it was September and
then<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> month<00:00:54.660> later<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.469> took<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.829> back

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
then like a month later I took it back

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.400 
then like a month later I took it back
so<00:00:56.219> I've<00:00:56.340> probably<00:00:56.550> held<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:58.140> nine

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
so I've probably held it for like nine

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.500 
so I've probably held it for like nine
or<00:00:58.739> ten<00:00:59.160> months<00:00:59.340> total<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.149> something<00:01:00.449> like

mind<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:49.649> first<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.430> was<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:50.939> I've<00:01:51.180> never

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
mind because first I was like I've never

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
mind because first I was like I've never
even<00:01:51.479> heard<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.200> guy<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.130> if

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
even heard of this guy I don't know if

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.730 
even heard of this guy I don't know if
he's<00:01:53.430> fast<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.180> don't<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:55.259> anything<00:01:55.530> about

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
he's fast I don't know anything about

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.149 
he's fast I don't know anything about
him

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
him

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.280 
him
the<00:01:56.280> outsize<00:01:56.700> really<00:01:57.390> mad<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.780> whole<00:01:57.810> day<00:01:58.079> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the outsize really mad the whole day and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.800 
the outsize really mad the whole day and
I<00:01:58.710> tried<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> break<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.460> again<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.000> that's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
I tried to break it again and I that's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.399 
I tried to break it again and I that's
the<00:02:00.960> day<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> got<00:02:01.469> my<00:02:02.040> 2.00<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.570> are<00:02:03.719> sorry<00:02:04.110> I

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the day I got my 2.00 and I are sorry I

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.590 
the day I got my 2.00 and I are sorry I
would<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.710> taken<00:02:04.920> my<00:02:05.159> own<00:02:05.250> record<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.570> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
would have taken my own record but I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.389 
would have taken my own record but I
just<00:02:06.869> barely<00:02:07.079> missed<00:02:07.409> beating<00:02:07.770> him<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.250> was

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
just barely missed beating him so I was

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.390 
just barely missed beating him so I was
pretty<00:02:08.580> mad<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:10.020> then<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.200> kind<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.860> got

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
pretty mad and then I kind of just got

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.960 
pretty mad and then I kind of just got
motivated

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
motivated

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.170 
motivated
more<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.600> beat<00:02:12.750> him<00:02:12.960> so<00:02:13.710> III<00:02:14.430> guess<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.000> kind<00:02:15.150> of

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
more to beat him so III guess it kind of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.540 
more to beat him so III guess it kind of
gave<00:02:15.300> me<00:02:15.360> motivation<00:02:15.600> but<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.680> day<00:02:16.920> off<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.370> was

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
gave me motivation but the day off I was

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.160 
gave me motivation but the day off I was
really<00:02:17.790> mad<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.540> you're<00:02:18.690> probably<00:02:18.780> not<00:02:18.990> gonna

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
really mad so you're probably not gonna

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.990 
really mad so you're probably not gonna
check<00:02:19.530> anymore<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.160> day<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.730> because<00:02:20.970> I

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
check anymore on the day of it because I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.550 
check anymore on the day of it because I
probably<00:02:21.270> ruined<00:02:21.750> your<00:02:21.840> concentration<00:02:22.530> a

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
probably ruined your concentration a

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.540 
probably ruined your concentration a
little<00:02:22.800> bit<00:02:23.000> uh<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.900> kind<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.500> did<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:26.130> think

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
little bit uh it kind of did I I think

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.250 
little bit uh it kind of did I I think
had<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.760> not<00:02:27.060> checked<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.720> would<00:02:27.960> have<00:02:28.080> been<00:02:28.230> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
had I not checked I would have been a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.080 
had I not checked I would have been a
little<00:02:28.440> more<00:02:28.530> focused<00:02:29.190> but<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.550> think<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:29.910> would

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
little more focused but I think I would

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.450 
little more focused but I think I would
have<00:02:30.210> been<00:02:30.270> even<00:02:30.750> more<00:02:30.780> angry<00:02:31.230> if<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:32.280> had

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
have been even more angry if I had

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.250 
have been even more angry if I had
thought<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.790> broke<00:02:33.120> world<00:02:33.390> record<00:02:33.720> again<00:02:34.020> and

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
thought I broke world record again and

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.350 
thought I broke world record again and
then<00:02:34.620> checked<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.310> found<00:02:35.460> out<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.700> didn't<00:02:36.150> I

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
then checked and found out I didn't I

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.860 
then checked and found out I didn't I
think<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.230> would<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.410> made<00:02:37.470> me<00:02:37.590> more<00:02:37.740> mad

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
think that would have made me more mad

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.420 
think that would have made me more mad
so<00:02:39.890> what<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:40.980> your<00:02:41.160> average<00:02:42.060> like<00:02:42.960> I<00:02:43.080> know<00:02:43.430> that

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
so what is your average like I know that

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.920 
so what is your average like I know that
you're<00:02:44.580> really<00:02:44.730> really<00:02:44.880> fast<00:02:45.209> around<00:02:45.600> two

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
you're really really fast around two

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.290 
you're really really fast around two
seconds<00:02:46.350> or<00:02:46.440> something<00:02:46.680> aren't<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:46.910> yeah<00:02:47.910> I

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
seconds or something aren't you yeah I

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.449 
seconds or something aren't you yeah I
I'd<00:02:48.810> say<00:02:49.200> my<00:02:49.380> global<00:02:49.830> average<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.310> probably

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
I'd say my global average is probably

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.180 
I'd say my global average is probably
one<00:02:50.790> point<00:02:51.060> nine<00:02:51.209> seconds<00:02:51.900> my<00:02:52.440> best<00:02:52.860> average

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
one point nine seconds my best average

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.670 
one point nine seconds my best average
of<00:02:53.310> 100<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:54.090> one<00:02:54.450> point<00:02:54.720> eight<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.350> it's

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
of 100 is one point eight so it's

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.780 
of 100 is one point eight so it's
probably<00:02:56.010> around<00:02:56.190> one<00:02:56.400> point<00:02:56.640> nine<00:02:56.790> yeah<00:02:57.620> and

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
probably around one point nine yeah and

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.050 
probably around one point nine yeah and
what<00:02:59.790> method<00:03:00.150> do<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.300> use<00:03:00.390> uh<00:03:02.060> basically

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
what method do you use uh basically

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.030 
what method do you use uh basically
everything<00:03:03.780> it's<00:03:04.080> kind<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.380> whatever<00:03:04.560> solves

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
everything it's kind of whatever solves

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.260 
everything it's kind of whatever solves
the<00:03:05.160> cube<00:03:05.370> fastest<00:03:05.970> but<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.630> use<00:03:07.260> CLL<00:03:08.070> eg1<00:03:08.670> eg

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
the cube fastest but I use CLL eg1 eg

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.420 
the cube fastest but I use CLL eg1 eg
two<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.780> then<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.230> recently<00:03:10.650> about<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.160> month

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
two and then I recently about a month

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.510 
two and then I recently about a month
ago<00:03:11.660> made<00:03:12.660> my<00:03:12.870> own<00:03:12.900> method<00:03:13.440> called<00:03:13.709> T<00:03:14.010> CLL

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
ago made my own method called T CLL

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.979 
ago made my own method called T CLL
where<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.180> can<00:03:15.510> have

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
where you can have

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.110 
where you can have
it's<00:03:16.530> like<00:03:16.709> CLL<00:03:17.160> but<00:03:17.400> one<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.820> bottom

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
it's like CLL but one of the bottom

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.990 
it's like CLL but one of the bottom
corners<00:03:18.480> can<00:03:18.660> be<00:03:18.750> twisted<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.310> I've<00:03:20.760> been

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
corners can be twisted so I've been

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.120 
corners can be twisted so I've been
learning<00:03:21.330> that<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.930> know<00:03:22.140> about<00:03:22.620> half<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:22.980> it

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
learning that I know about half of it

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.479 
learning that I know about half of it
now<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.989> use<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.830> then<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:25.980> mean<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.310> use

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
now so I use that and then I mean I use

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.580 
now so I use that and then I mean I use
stuff<00:03:26.760> like<00:03:26.850> Ortega<00:03:27.480> if<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.930> if<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.350> know<00:03:28.380> I'm

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
stuff like Ortega if I if I know I'm

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.500 
stuff like Ortega if I if I know I'm
gonna<00:03:28.709> get<00:03:28.860> an<00:03:28.980> oil<00:03:29.040> I'll<00:03:29.310> skip<00:03:29.610> then<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.330> just

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
gonna get an oil I'll skip then I just

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.020 
gonna get an oil I'll skip then I just
use<00:03:30.660> Ortega<00:03:31.140> if<00:03:31.350> it's<00:03:31.530> really<00:03:31.769> easy<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.820> kind

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
use Ortega if it's really easy so I kind

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.940 
use Ortega if it's really easy so I kind
of<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.269> use<00:03:33.420> everything<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.470> you're<00:03:34.680> look

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
of just use everything so you're look

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.400 
of just use everything so you're look
ahead<00:03:35.160> at<00:03:35.940> this<00:03:36.209> point<00:03:36.570> would<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.140> good

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
ahead at this point would be so good

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.080 
ahead at this point would be so good
that<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.800> can<00:03:38.010> kind<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.310> choose<00:03:38.610> your<00:03:38.850> method

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
that you can kind of choose your method

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.449 
that you can kind of choose your method
during<00:03:39.630> your<00:03:39.780> inspection<00:03:40.190> yeah<00:03:41.190> that's

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
during your inspection yeah that's

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.610 
during your inspection yeah that's
that's<00:03:41.940> exactly<00:03:42.180> what<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.660> do<00:03:42.750> right<00:03:42.989> now<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.200> end

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
that's exactly what I do right now I end

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.130 
that's exactly what I do right now I end
up<00:03:44.010> choosing<00:03:44.040> based<00:03:44.970> on<00:03:45.299> what<00:03:45.540> method<00:03:45.750> would

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
up choosing based on what method would

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.270 
up choosing based on what method would
fit<00:03:46.410> best<00:03:46.620> for<00:03:46.980> it

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
fit best for it

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.520 
fit best for it
right<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.570> so<00:03:48.810> can<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.080> explain<00:03:49.170> to

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
right and so can you explain to

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.289 
right and so can you explain to
everybody<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:50.280> me<00:03:50.400> myself<00:03:50.580> too<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:51.000> mean<00:03:51.150> like

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
everybody and me myself too I mean like

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.330 
everybody and me myself too I mean like
I<00:03:51.390> kind<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.630> have<00:03:51.780> an<00:03:51.870> idea<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.290> what<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:52.709> eg

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
I kind of have an idea of what is eg

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.100 
I kind of have an idea of what is eg
stand<00:03:53.700> for<00:03:54.000> like<00:03:54.150> what<00:03:54.330> are<00:03:54.450> these<00:03:54.570> methods

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
stand for like what are these methods

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.220 
stand for like what are these methods
what<00:03:55.440> does<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.739> stand<00:03:55.980> for<00:03:56.180> well<00:03:57.180> eg<00:03:57.450> I'm

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
what does it stand for well eg I'm

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.949 
what does it stand for well eg I'm
pretty<00:03:58.590> sure<00:03:58.769> stands<00:03:59.130> for<00:03:59.400> Eric<00:03:59.730> gunner<00:04:00.000> it

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
pretty sure stands for Eric gunner it

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.770 
pretty sure stands for Eric gunner it
was<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.680> was<00:04:01.769> invented<00:04:02.130> by<00:04:02.610> those<00:04:03.180> two<00:04:03.420> people

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
was it was invented by those two people

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.520 
was it was invented by those two people
and<00:04:03.989> they<00:04:04.260> just<00:04:04.290> named<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.160> after<00:04:05.400> themselves

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
and they just named it after themselves

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.680 
and they just named it after themselves
eg<00:04:07.530> one<00:04:07.860> is<00:04:08.160> just<00:04:08.970> where<00:04:09.440> you<00:04:10.440> have<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.650> face<00:04:11.010> and

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
eg one is just where you have a face and

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.690 
eg one is just where you have a face and
two<00:04:12.690> adjacent<00:04:13.049> pieces<00:04:13.650> are<00:04:13.799> swapped<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:14.610> you

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
two adjacent pieces are swapped so you

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.000 
two adjacent pieces are swapped so you
would<00:04:14.820> have<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:14.970> bar<00:04:15.209> on<00:04:15.390> bottom<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:15.870> then<00:04:16.530> you

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
would have a bar on bottom and then you

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.979 
would have a bar on bottom and then you
solve<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.489> one<00:04:17.609> algorithm<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.359> when<00:04:18.630> eg

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
solve it in one algorithm and when eg

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.039 
solve it in one algorithm and when eg
two<00:04:19.229> is<00:04:19.640> the<00:04:20.640> where<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.390> have<00:04:21.539> a<00:04:21.570> diagonal

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
two is the where you have a diagonal

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.870 
two is the where you have a diagonal
permeated<00:04:22.950> face<00:04:23.190> yeah<00:04:23.520> I<00:04:23.580> think<00:04:23.640> you<00:04:23.849> just

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
permeated face yeah I think you just

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.960 
permeated face yeah I think you just
solve<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.360> in<00:04:24.479> one<00:04:24.599> Algar

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
solve it in one Algar

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.020 
solve it in one Algar
them<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:26.200> it<00:04:26.620> makes<00:04:26.650> your<00:04:27.130> first<00:04:27.760> layer

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
them so it makes your first layer

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.020 
them so it makes your first layer
extremely<00:04:28.870> easy<00:04:29.190> yeah<00:04:30.190> with<00:04:30.520> all<00:04:30.700> of<00:04:30.880> these

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
extremely easy yeah with all of these

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.540 
extremely easy yeah with all of these
methods<00:04:31.600> like<00:04:32.080> there's<00:04:32.590> almost<00:04:32.920> always

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
methods like there's almost always

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.780 
methods like there's almost always
something<00:04:34.120> insanely<00:04:34.690> easy<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.260> be<00:04:35.380> built

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
something insanely easy to be built

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.300 
something insanely easy to be built
right<00:04:36.790> most<00:04:37.780> of<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:37.990> time<00:04:38.050> can<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.770> see<00:04:39.070> your

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
right most of the time can you see your

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.640 
right most of the time can you see your
hole<00:04:39.610> because<00:04:40.240> I've<00:04:40.420> watched<00:04:40.840> your<00:04:41.080> videos<00:04:41.440> I

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
hole because I've watched your videos I

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.970 
hole because I've watched your videos I
mean<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:43.450> look<00:04:43.630> ahead<00:04:43.990> that<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:44.350> have<00:04:44.710> is

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
mean the the look ahead that you have is

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.930 
mean the the look ahead that you have is
insanely<00:04:45.970> good<00:04:46.150> so<00:04:46.780> like<00:04:46.990> if<00:04:47.760> most<00:04:48.760> of<00:04:48.880> the

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
insanely good so like if most of the

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.030 
insanely good so like if most of the
time<00:04:49.150> can<00:04:49.420> you<00:04:49.450> basically<00:04:50.110> see<00:04:50.560> your<00:04:50.830> entire

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
time can you basically see your entire

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.630 
time can you basically see your entire
solve<00:04:51.850> from<00:04:52.420> your<00:04:52.900> inspection<00:04:53.410> yeah<00:04:54.370> about

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
solve from your inspection yeah about

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.180 
solve from your inspection yeah about
90%<00:04:55.360> of<00:04:55.420> the<00:04:55.510> time<00:04:55.720> I<00:04:56.080> can<00:04:56.470> see<00:04:56.740> my<00:04:57.010> whole

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
90% of the time I can see my whole

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.730 
90% of the time I can see my whole
entire<00:04:57.370> solution<00:04:58.300> once<00:04:58.720> you<00:04:58.900> get<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.530> like

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
entire solution once you get to like

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.520 
entire solution once you get to like
world<00:05:00.250> class<00:05:00.370> on<00:05:00.820> 2x2<00:05:01.180> you<00:05:01.510> can<00:05:01.720> almost<00:05:02.080> always

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
world class on 2x2 you can almost always

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.820 
world class on 2x2 you can almost always
see<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.190> whole<00:05:03.340> solution<00:05:04.290> because<00:05:05.290> if<00:05:05.500> I

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
see the whole solution because if I

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.320 
see the whole solution because if I
couldn't<00:05:06.190> do<00:05:06.340> that<00:05:06.550> my<00:05:06.730> songs<00:05:07.030> would<00:05:07.270> be

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
couldn't do that my songs would be

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.260 
couldn't do that my songs would be
pretty<00:05:08.230> bad<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:08.980> probably<00:05:09.310> like<00:05:09.460> 2.3<00:05:10.240> or

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
pretty bad that probably like 2.3 or

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.820 
pretty bad that probably like 2.3 or
something<00:05:10.660> because<00:05:10.780> yeah<00:05:11.170> you<00:05:11.380> have<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.620> pause

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
something because yeah you have to pause

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.460 
something because yeah you have to pause
to<00:05:12.130> see<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:13.030> case<00:05:13.240> you<00:05:13.420> get<00:05:13.600> but<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.080> can<00:05:14.290> see

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
to see the case you get but I can see

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.350 
to see the case you get but I can see
all<00:05:14.620> that<00:05:14.770> in<00:05:14.890> reckon<00:05:15.220> there<00:05:15.550> in<00:05:15.790> inspection

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
all that in reckon there in inspection

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.330 
all that in reckon there in inspection
do<00:05:16.540> you<00:05:16.630> think<00:05:16.810> you<00:05:16.930> could<00:05:17.110> be<00:05:17.230> inspected<00:05:17.890> and

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
do you think you could be inspected and

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.310 
do you think you could be inspected and
throw<00:05:18.700> on<00:05:18.850> a<00:05:18.880> blindfold<00:05:19.510> and<00:05:19.660> solve<00:05:19.990> your<00:05:20.080> two

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
throw on a blindfold and solve your two

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.020 
throw on a blindfold and solve your two
by<00:05:20.500> two<00:05:20.560> in<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.220> same<00:05:21.400> speed

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
by two in the same speed

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.280 
by two in the same speed
I<00:05:22.560> actually<00:05:23.560> yes<00:05:24.030> my<00:05:25.030> last<00:05:25.210> competition<00:05:25.570> I<00:05:26.110> did

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
I actually yes my last competition I did

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.950 
I actually yes my last competition I did
the<00:05:26.410> finals<00:05:26.830> blindfolded<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:28.600> should<00:05:28.780> make<00:05:28.930> a

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
the finals blindfolded you should make a

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.210 
the finals blindfolded you should make a
video<00:05:29.320> about<00:05:29.530> that<00:05:29.590> I<00:05:29.740> think<00:05:29.950> that'd<00:05:30.070> be<00:05:30.190> a

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
video about that I think that'd be a

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.190 
video about that I think that'd be a
really<00:05:30.370> cool<00:05:30.610> video<00:05:30.820> if<00:05:31.150> you<00:05:31.300> want<00:05:31.510> I<00:05:31.960> think

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
really cool video if you want I think

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.830 
really cool video if you want I think
that'd<00:05:32.320> be<00:05:32.350> very<00:05:32.910> much<00:05:33.910> presented<00:05:34.480> doing<00:05:34.720> it

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
that'd be very much presented doing it

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.050 
that'd be very much presented doing it
cuz<00:05:35.050> I<00:05:35.169> think<00:05:35.380> I'd<00:05:35.980> be<00:05:36.280> kind<00:05:36.460> of<00:05:36.490> fun<00:05:36.700> I've<00:05:36.880> seen

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
cuz I think I'd be kind of fun I've seen

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.240 
cuz I think I'd be kind of fun I've seen
other<00:05:37.240> people<00:05:37.450> do<00:05:37.780> it<00:05:37.930> I<00:05:38.110> just<00:05:38.710> haven't<00:05:39.040> got

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
other people do it I just haven't got

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.610 
other people do it I just haven't got
around<00:05:39.280> to<00:05:39.610> doing<00:05:39.640> it<00:05:39.940> yet<00:05:40.120> right<00:05:41.490> so<00:05:42.490> for<00:05:42.850> uh<00:05:42.880> I

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
around to doing it yet right so for uh I

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.840 
around to doing it yet right so for uh I
would<00:05:44.620> still<00:05:44.800> consider<00:05:44.950> myself<00:05:45.220> a<00:05:45.550> beginner

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
would still consider myself a beginner

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.850 
would still consider myself a beginner
I'm<00:05:45.970> around<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.360> 4.5<00:05:46.990> to<00:05:47.169> 5<00:05:47.350> second<00:05:47.710> average

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
I'm around a 4.5 to 5 second average

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.370 
I'm around a 4.5 to 5 second average
using<00:05:48.160> Ortega<00:05:48.700> I<00:05:48.729> haven't<00:05:49.270> gone<00:05:49.390> into<00:05:49.690> CLL<00:05:50.140> or

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
using Ortega I haven't gone into CLL or

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.630 
using Ortega I haven't gone into CLL or
anything<00:05:50.620> like<00:05:50.800> that<00:05:52.560> you<00:05:53.560> know<00:05:53.680> there's<00:05:54.550> a

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
anything like that you know there's a

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.060 
anything like that you know there's a
lot<00:05:54.820> of<00:05:54.910> algorithms<00:05:55.240> for<00:05:55.570> CLL<00:05:56.229> and<00:05:56.500> when<00:05:57.040> I

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
lot of algorithms for CLL and when I

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.190 
lot of algorithms for CLL and when I
look<00:05:57.310> at<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.490> diagrams<00:05:58.060> on<00:05:58.390> you<00:05:59.020> know<00:05:59.110> the

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
look at the diagrams on you know the

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.440 
look at the diagrams on you know the
tutorials<00:05:59.710> are<00:05:59.860> you<00:06:00.729> know<00:06:00.820> speed<00:06:01.120> solving

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
tutorials are you know speed solving

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.969 
tutorials are you know speed solving
form<00:06:01.690> or<00:06:01.870> wherever<00:06:02.169> I<00:06:02.260> can<00:06:02.500> find<00:06:02.800> the

form or wherever I can find the
algorithms<00:06:03.580> for<00:06:03.669> these<00:06:03.910> things<00:06:04.120> i<00:06:04.360> I<00:06:04.900> see

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
algorithms for these things i I see

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.980 
algorithms for these things i I see
cases<00:06:05.890> like<00:06:06.010> soon<00:06:06.250> case<00:06:06.520> H<00:06:06.760> case<00:06:07.060> T<00:06:07.450> case<00:06:07.690> all

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
cases like soon case H case T case all

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.020 
cases like soon case H case T case all
this<00:06:08.080> kind<00:06:08.290> of<00:06:08.350> stuff<00:06:08.620> and<00:06:08.880> when<00:06:09.880> you're

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
this kind of stuff and when you're

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.760 
this kind of stuff and when you're
looking<00:06:10.360> at<00:06:10.479> these<00:06:10.630> because<00:06:10.870> it's<00:06:11.320> not<00:06:11.500> really

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
looking at these because it's not really

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.340 
looking at these because it's not really
explained<00:06:12.340> too<00:06:12.760> much<00:06:12.910> anywhere<00:06:13.240> but<00:06:13.479> are<00:06:14.110> you

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
explained too much anywhere but are you

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.490 
explained too much anywhere but are you
really<00:06:14.800> looking<00:06:15.070> at<00:06:15.430> where<00:06:16.240> the<00:06:16.510> other<00:06:17.020> colors

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
really looking at where the other colors

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.710 
really looking at where the other colors
are<00:06:17.710> on<00:06:17.919> on<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:18.280> top<00:06:18.550> layer<00:06:18.790> so<00:06:19.330> like<00:06:19.570> you

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
are on on the top layer so like you

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.690 
are on on the top layer so like you
built<00:06:19.990> your<00:06:20.110> bottom<00:06:20.440> layer<00:06:20.620> and<00:06:20.830> then<00:06:21.370> you<00:06:21.400> see

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
built your bottom layer and then you see

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.520 
built your bottom layer and then you see
that<00:06:21.850> you've<00:06:22.000> got<00:06:22.030> a<00:06:22.240> soon<00:06:22.570> case<00:06:22.930> or<00:06:23.200> an<00:06:23.260> anti

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
that you've got a soon case or an anti

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.820 
that you've got a soon case or an anti
soon<00:06:23.770> or<00:06:23.860> whatever<00:06:24.100> and<00:06:24.400> you're<00:06:24.640> looking<00:06:25.000> at

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
soon or whatever and you're looking at

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.770 
soon or whatever and you're looking at
the<00:06:26.830> other<00:06:27.070> colors<00:06:27.580> on<00:06:27.850> where<00:06:28.090> they<00:06:28.270> are<00:06:28.300> it's

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
the other colors on where they are it's

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.700 
the other colors on where they are it's
very<00:06:29.260> difficult<00:06:30.150> for<00:06:31.150> me<00:06:31.210> at<00:06:31.479> least<00:06:31.510> to<00:06:31.960> kind

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
very difficult for me at least to kind

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.100 
very difficult for me at least to kind
of<00:06:33.120> recognize<00:06:34.120> where<00:06:34.419> those<00:06:34.599> are<00:06:34.810> do<00:06:34.960> you<00:06:35.020> have

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
of recognize where those are do you have

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.920 
of recognize where those are do you have
any<00:06:35.260> tips<00:06:35.560> for<00:06:35.830> anything<00:06:36.190> like<00:06:36.370> that<00:06:36.690> yeah

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
any tips for anything like that yeah

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.410 
any tips for anything like that yeah
and<00:06:38.020> the

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
and the

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.480 
and the
I<00:06:38.930> actually<00:06:39.110> was<00:06:39.440> the<00:06:39.560> same<00:06:39.800> way<00:06:40.010> and<00:06:40.310> we<00:06:40.400> all

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
I actually was the same way and we all

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.040 
I actually was the same way and we all
know<00:06:40.700> that<00:06:40.760> that<00:06:41.000> we<00:06:41.330> have<00:06:41.600> about<00:06:41.780> a<00:06:41.840> minute

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
know that that we have about a minute

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.190 
know that that we have about a minute
minute<00:06:42.410> left<00:06:42.680> sorry<00:06:43.010> okay<00:06:44.000> that's<00:06:44.270> fine

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
minute left sorry okay that's fine

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.290 
minute left sorry okay that's fine
and<00:06:45.890> when<00:06:46.010> I<00:06:46.040> started<00:06:46.490> I<00:06:46.640> had<00:06:46.790> the<00:06:46.910> same<00:06:47.090> issue

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
and when I started I had the same issue

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.170 
and when I started I had the same issue
and<00:06:47.690> I<00:06:47.870> have<00:06:48.110> wrecking<00:06:48.710> our<00:06:48.860> videos<00:06:49.460> teaching

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
and I have wrecking our videos teaching

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.060 
and I have wrecking our videos teaching
people<00:06:50.330> how<00:06:50.510> to<00:06:50.540> recognize<00:06:51.050> them<00:06:51.290> trying<00:06:51.980> to

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
people how to recognize them trying to

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.410 
people how to recognize them trying to
figure<00:06:52.250> it<00:06:52.430> out<00:06:52.520> on<00:06:52.700> your<00:06:52.850> own<00:06:53.000> is<00:06:53.180> really

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.420 
figure it out on your own is really

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.970 
figure it out on your own is really
difficult<00:06:53.600> but<00:06:54.200> there's<00:06:54.380> a<00:06:54.470> system<00:06:54.950> that

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:54.980 
difficult but there's a system that

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.030 
difficult but there's a system that
makes<00:06:55.340> it<00:06:55.610> really<00:06:56.120> really<00:06:56.450> easy<00:06:56.570> to<00:06:57.140> learn<00:06:57.440> how

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 
makes it really really easy to learn how

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.280 
makes it really really easy to learn how
to<00:06:58.070> recognize<00:06:58.310> them<00:06:58.990> but<00:06:59.990> yeah<00:07:00.080> in<00:07:00.200> the

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.290 
to recognize them but yeah in the

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.930 
to recognize them but yeah in the
beginning<00:07:00.410> without<00:07:00.830> looking<00:07:01.340> at<00:07:01.430> any<00:07:01.550> videos

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
beginning without looking at any videos

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.410 
beginning without looking at any videos
it's<00:07:02.330> really<00:07:02.810> confusing<00:07:03.370> right<00:07:04.370> yeah<00:07:04.760> cuz<00:07:05.090> I'd

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:05.420 
it's really confusing right yeah cuz I'd

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.330 
it's really confusing right yeah cuz I'd
like<00:07:05.690> to<00:07:05.810> get<00:07:05.930> faster<00:07:06.500> and<00:07:06.650> stuff<00:07:06.920> I<00:07:07.070> mean<00:07:07.220> I'm

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
like to get faster and stuff I mean I'm

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.310 
like to get faster and stuff I mean I'm
also<00:07:07.490> a<00:07:07.640> puzzle<00:07:08.000> solver<00:07:08.300> like<00:07:08.420> the<00:07:08.570> the<00:07:08.990> puzzle

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
also a puzzle solver like the the puzzle

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.960 
also a puzzle solver like the the puzzle
I'm<00:07:09.410> solving<00:07:09.650> in<00:07:09.890> this<00:07:10.010> video<00:07:10.280> is<00:07:10.460> a<00:07:10.490> cuboid

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970 
I'm solving in this video is a cuboid
