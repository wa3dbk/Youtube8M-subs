00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.840 
browser and you're going to want to type
in<00:00:44.899> water<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.829> it'll<00:00:47.039> come<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> whole

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
in water and it'll come up with a whole

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.819 
in water and it'll come up with a whole
range<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.390> orders<00:00:48.780> don't<00:00:49.140> use<00:00:49.320> these<00:00:49.590> ones

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
range of orders don't use these ones

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.860 
range of orders don't use these ones
that<00:00:50.070> kind<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.430> look<00:00:50.550> normal<00:00:50.910> because<00:00:51.059> they'll

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
that kind of look normal because they'll

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.660 
that kind of look normal because they'll
give<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.140> dodgy<00:00:52.379> results<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.160> they<00:00:53.460> won't

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
give you dodgy results and they won't

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.639 
give you dodgy results and they won't
look<00:00:53.789> good<00:00:53.899> instead<00:00:54.899> choose<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.440> these

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
look good instead choose one of these

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.990 
look good instead choose one of these
ones<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.420> normals<00:00:58.370> process<00:00:59.370> into

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
ones that have the normals process into

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.830 
ones that have the normals process into
the<00:01:00.329> preview<00:01:00.870> image<00:01:01.170> um<00:01:01.969> choose<00:01:02.969> dev<00:01:03.270> fourth<00:01:03.600> /

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the preview image um choose dev fourth /

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.969 
the preview image um choose dev fourth /
dev<00:01:04.140> water<00:01:04.500> too<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:06.470> yeah<00:01:07.470> we're<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> be

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
dev water too and yeah we're going to be

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.399 
dev water too and yeah we're going to be
using<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.119> example<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.200> then

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
using that for this example and then

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.390 
using that for this example and then
press<00:01:10.920> Enter<00:01:11.450> or<00:01:12.450> we've<00:01:13.320> got<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.680> far<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:13.979> just

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
press Enter or we've got so far is just

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.770 
press Enter or we've got so far is just
as<00:01:14.549> big<00:01:14.729> floating<00:01:15.270> water<00:01:15.659> thing<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
as big floating water thing and

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.230 
as big floating water thing and
that's<00:01:17.409> kind<00:01:17.890> of<00:01:17.950> not<00:01:18.130> cool<00:01:18.369> we<00:01:18.700> want<00:01:18.909> it<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.030> be

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
that's kind of not cool we want it to be

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.120 
that's kind of not cool we want it to be
in<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.570> ground<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.350> embedded<00:01:20.799> in<00:01:21.010> the<00:01:21.100> ground

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
in the ground and embedded in the ground

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.030 
in the ground and embedded in the ground
so<00:01:21.670> you're<00:01:22.330> just<00:01:22.600> going<00:01:22.750> to<00:01:22.840> click<00:01:23.049> on<00:01:23.080> it<00:01:23.350> type

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
so you're just going to click on it type

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.710 
so you're just going to click on it type
in<00:01:24.270> control<00:01:25.270> shift<00:01:25.659> C<00:01:26.080> or<00:01:26.850> even<00:01:27.850> better<00:01:28.210> right

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
in control shift C or even better right

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.590 
in control shift C or even better right
click<00:01:28.930> on<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.350> go<00:01:29.440> to<00:01:29.560> carve<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.420> all<00:01:31.420> we

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
click on it and go to carve and all we

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.840 
click on it and go to carve and all we
basically<00:01:32.290> have<00:01:32.619> now<00:01:32.830> is<00:01:33.040> big<00:01:33.280> hole<00:01:33.550> in<00:01:33.580> the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
basically have now is big hole in the

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.889 
basically have now is big hole in the
ground<00:01:34.030> where<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.690> water<00:01:34.930> was<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.820> yeah<00:01:36.899> put

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
ground where the water was and yeah put

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.340 
ground where the water was and yeah put
that<00:01:38.020> back<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:39.210> resize<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:40.479> back<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.110> size

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
that back and resize it back to the size

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.469 
that back and resize it back to the size
of<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.619> hole<00:01:41.860> maybe<00:01:42.700> pull<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.060> down<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.270> little

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
of the hole maybe pull it down a little

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.649 
of the hole maybe pull it down a little
bit<00:01:43.720> so<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.170> kind<00:01:44.560> of<00:01:44.649> looks<00:01:44.860> like<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:46.270> the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
bit so it kind of looks like a if the

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.940 
bit so it kind of looks like a if the
hole<00:01:46.930> is<00:01:46.960> filled<00:01:47.409> with<00:01:47.590> water<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:49.410> yeah<00:01:50.410> well

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
hole is filled with water and yeah well

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.480 
hole is filled with water and yeah well
that's<00:01:51.940> pretty<00:01:52.240> much<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.420> for<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.899> water<00:01:53.490> if

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
that's pretty much it for the water if

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.430 
that's pretty much it for the water if
you<00:01:54.640> want<00:01:54.789> to<00:01:54.850> add<00:01:54.970> in<00:01:55.149> an<00:01:55.270> object<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:56.050> watch<00:01:56.289> it

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
you want to add in an object to watch it

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.760 
you want to add in an object to watch it
float<00:01:56.920> then<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.909> can<00:01:58.090> do<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.420> by<00:01:58.690> going<00:01:59.619> to

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
float then you can do that by going to

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.320 
float then you can do that by going to
the<00:01:59.950> entity<00:02:00.450> creator<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.920> down<00:02:03.069> to

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
the entity creator and going down to

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.410 
the entity creator and going down to
prop<00:02:04.330> underscore<00:02:05.140> physics<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:06.270> give<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.360> a

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
prop underscore physics and give it a

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.210 
prop underscore physics and give it a
little<00:02:07.569> click<00:02:07.869> double<00:02:08.500> click<00:02:08.679> on<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.130> go

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
little click double click on it and go

get a bunch of wood objects here

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.810 
get a bunch of wood objects here
I'm<00:02:23.290> gonna<00:02:23.800> try<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.790> find<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.270> wooden<00:02:25.750> crate

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
I'm gonna try and find a wooden crate

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.420 
I'm gonna try and find a wooden crate
all<00:02:27.820> right<00:02:27.940> here<00:02:28.240> we<00:02:28.270> go<00:02:29.070> double<00:02:30.070> click<00:02:30.250> on<00:02:30.370> it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
all right here we go double click on it

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.990 
all right here we go double click on it
click<00:02:30.760> on<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> fly<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.560> here<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.400> your<00:02:33.550> physics

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
click on a fly and here is your physics

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.570 
click on a fly and here is your physics
object<00:02:34.480> which<00:02:34.720> will<00:02:35.020> be<00:02:35.830> buoyant<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.430> the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
object which will be buoyant in the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.790 
object which will be buoyant in the
water<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.390> move<00:02:37.600> it<00:02:37.750> onto<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.200> top<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.620> the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
water and move it onto the top of the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.470 
water and move it onto the top of the
water<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.630> yeah<00:02:40.770> give<00:02:41.770> that<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> run<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:43.270> is

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
water and yeah give that a run this is

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.840 
water and yeah give that a run this is
the<00:02:43.600> result<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:44.110> get<00:02:44.350> after<00:02:44.860> running<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.520> map

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
the result I get after running the map

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.600 
the result I get after running the map
and<00:02:46.290> basically<00:02:47.290> we<00:02:47.590> can<00:02:47.740> see<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.160> I've<00:02:48.310> got<00:02:48.580> a

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
and basically we can see that I've got a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.630 
and basically we can see that I've got a
semi<00:02:49.270> reflective<00:02:50.020> water<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:52.620> floating<00:02:53.640> box

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
semi reflective water and a floating box

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.240 
semi reflective water and a floating box
thing<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.870> blows<00:02:56.290> up<00:02:56.350> when<00:02:56.710> you<00:02:56.830> shoot<00:02:57.040> at<00:02:57.220> it

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
thing that blows up when you shoot at it

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.390 
thing that blows up when you shoot at it
and<00:02:57.490> then<00:02:58.150> an<00:02:58.270> error<00:02:58.390> message<00:02:59.280> thanks<00:03:00.280> for

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
and then an error message thanks for
