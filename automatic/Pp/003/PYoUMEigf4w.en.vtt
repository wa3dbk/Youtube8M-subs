00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
wet next to it so it's easier to finish

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
to start with the front cuz that's way

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.510 
to start with the front cuz that's way
easier<00:01:04.970> to<00:01:05.420> do<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.960> I<00:01:06.439> just<00:01:06.680> take<00:01:06.920> my<00:01:06.950> finger

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
easier to do and I just take my finger

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.460 
easier to do and I just take my finger

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
and section off a kind of squarish type

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.210 
and section off a kind of squarish type
and<00:01:12.470> I'm<00:01:12.590> not<00:01:12.909> super<00:01:13.990> neat<00:01:14.990> about<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.620> parts

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
and I'm not super neat about the parts

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.840 
and I'm not super neat about the parts
and<00:01:16.490> what<00:01:16.729> have<00:01:16.909> you<00:01:16.940> I<00:01:17.210> mean<00:01:17.690> it<00:01:18.650> just<00:01:19.580> all

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
and what have you I mean it just all

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.850 
and what have you I mean it just all
comes<00:01:20.240> together<00:01:20.510> so<00:01:21.049> that<00:01:21.080> no<00:01:21.500> one<00:01:21.530> will

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
comes together so that no one will

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.190 
comes together so that no one will
really<00:01:21.920> see<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:23.030> parts<00:01:23.360> in<00:01:23.600> there<00:01:23.840> but

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
really see the the parts in there but

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.899 
really see the the parts in there but
it's<00:01:24.440> so<00:01:24.799> up<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:25.159> i<00:01:25.310> like<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.790> use<00:01:25.820> my

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
it's so up to you i like to use my

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.450 
it's so up to you i like to use my
finger<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:26.420> like<00:01:26.570> I<00:01:26.600> think<00:01:26.960> it's<00:01:27.080> easier<00:01:27.460> take

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
finger so like I think it's easier take

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.039 
finger so like I think it's easier take
about<00:01:28.729> that<00:01:29.000> much<00:01:29.060> hair<00:01:31.360> take<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.390> dollop<00:01:32.810> sized

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
about that much hair take a dollop sized

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.180 
about that much hair take a dollop sized
amount<00:01:33.470> of<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.270> conditioning<00:01:35.270> cream<00:01:36.190> soaking

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
amount of the conditioning cream soaking

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.969 
amount of the conditioning cream soaking
stretch<00:01:37.760> where<00:01:38.270> ever<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.930> is<00:01:39.080> cream<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.680> I<00:01:39.799> use

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
stretch where ever it is cream and I use

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.850 
stretch where ever it is cream and I use
my<00:01:40.159> fingers<00:01:40.760> and<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.510> could<00:01:41.750> certainly<00:01:42.260> use<00:01:42.409> a

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
my fingers and you could certainly use a

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.399 
my fingers and you could certainly use a
finer<00:01:43.640> tooth<00:01:43.970> comb<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.750> get<00:01:44.960> most<00:01:45.229> of<00:01:45.320> the

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
finer tooth comb to get most of the

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.679 
finer tooth comb to get most of the
tangles<00:01:45.830> out<00:01:45.979> but<00:01:46.640> I<00:01:46.670> find<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.180> breaking

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
tangles out but I find that breaking

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.510 
tangles out but I find that breaking
through<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:47.960> product<00:01:48.500> first<00:01:48.710> as<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.250> saw

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
through the product first as you saw

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.890 
through the product first as you saw
then<00:01:50.360> dividing<00:01:51.080> that<00:01:51.229> section<00:01:51.799> into<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.900> this

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
then dividing that section into to this

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.830 
then dividing that section into to this
and<00:01:54.290> then<00:01:54.979> really<00:01:55.520> getting<00:01:55.939> that<00:01:56.439> front

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
and then really getting that front

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.570 
and then really getting that front
initial<00:01:59.840> twist<00:02:00.350> going<00:02:00.650> so<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.009> can<00:02:01.250> get<00:02:01.369> those

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
initial twist going so you can get those

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.440 
initial twist going so you can get those
baby<00:02:02.390> hairs<00:02:02.810> involved<00:02:03.650> in<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.920> twist<00:02:04.299> if<00:02:05.299> you

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
baby hairs involved in the twist if you

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.770 
baby hairs involved in the twist if you
want<00:02:05.689> those<00:02:06.020> left<00:02:06.560> out<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:08.060> they<00:02:08.239> do<00:02:08.299> just

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
want those left out and they do just

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.489 
want those left out and they do just
slip<00:02:09.049> them<00:02:09.170> now<00:02:09.379> with<00:02:09.739> some<00:02:11.200> product<00:02:12.200> that

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:12.499 
slip them now with some product that

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:13.210

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
overwhelming and it does the trick I

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.920 
overwhelming and it does the trick I
mean<00:03:54.860> really<00:03:55.220> light<00:03:55.810> doesn't<00:03:56.810> leave<00:03:56.900> a

mean really light doesn't leave a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.690 
mean really light doesn't leave a
residue<00:03:57.200> so<00:03:57.799> you<00:03:57.860> can<00:03:58.130> combine<00:03:58.310> it<00:03:58.640> with

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
residue so you can combine it with

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.740 
residue so you can combine it with
virtually<00:03:59.390> anything<00:03:59.720> and<00:04:00.200> it<00:04:00.410> just<00:04:01.750> enhances

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
whatever you use it with would it take a

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.920 
whatever you use it with would it take a
little<00:04:05.570> more<00:04:06.549> be<00:04:07.549> very<00:04:07.820> generous<00:04:08.330> especially

that's<00:06:13.190> about<00:06:13.490> it<00:06:13.520> this<00:06:14.270> will<00:06:14.600> look<00:06:14.810> more<00:06:15.680> like

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
that's about it this will look more like

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.330 
that's about it this will look more like
the<00:06:16.160> same<00:06:16.490> when<00:06:16.910> it<00:06:17.060> dries<00:06:17.410> so<00:06:18.410> this<00:06:18.889> will<00:06:19.070> dry

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
the same when it dries so this will dry

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.020

the<00:06:19.789> hair<00:06:20.150> might<00:06:20.450> shrink<00:06:20.750> a<00:06:20.930> tad<00:06:21.350> but<00:06:22.310> even<00:06:22.789> in

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
the hair might shrink a tad but even in

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.140

a<00:06:23.120> wet<00:06:23.389> twist<00:06:23.810> set<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:24.919> twist<00:06:25.280> itself<00:06:25.729> kind<00:06:26.090> of

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
a wet twist set the twist itself kind of

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.880 
a wet twist set the twist itself kind of
pulls<00:06:26.510> the<00:06:26.780> hair<00:06:27.050> long<00:06:28.090> slightly<00:06:29.090> not

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
pulls the hair long slightly not

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.649 
pulls the hair long slightly not
tremendously<00:06:30.890> so<00:06:31.400> not<00:06:31.880> like<00:06:32.030> a<00:06:32.060> dried<00:06:32.390> twist

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:32.659 
tremendously so not like a dried twist

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:34.810 
tremendously so not like a dried twist
set<00:06:32.840> which<00:06:33.050> it's<00:06:33.260> totally<00:06:34.099> at<00:06:34.280> its<00:06:34.460> full

set which it's totally at its full

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.300 
set which it's totally at its full

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
then it stays that way but pretty much

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.940 
then it stays that way but pretty much
will<00:06:37.700> look<00:06:37.910> more<00:06:38.210> or<00:06:38.360> less<00:06:38.540> the<00:06:38.720> same<00:06:38.800> but<00:06:39.800> i
