00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
gibberish obviously we've got walk up

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.950 
gibberish obviously we've got walk up
there<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.890> his<00:01:56.009> pace<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.549> I'm<00:01:57.090> completely<00:01:57.420> out

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
there of his pace and I'm completely out

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.350 
there of his pace and I'm completely out
of<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.320> loop<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.710> what<00:01:59.549> everyone<00:01:59.880> costs<00:02:00.149> at

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
of the loop of what everyone costs at

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.060 
of the loop of what everyone costs at
moment<00:02:00.750> obviously<00:02:00.840> because<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.649> market

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
moment obviously because of the market

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.370 
moment obviously because of the market
price<00:02:02.399> crush<00:02:02.880> everyone's<00:02:03.659> prices<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.350> been

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
price crush everyone's prices have been

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.530 
price crush everyone's prices have been
decreasing<00:02:05.090> dramatically<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.270> I'm<00:02:06.390> probably

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
decreasing dramatically so I'm probably

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.719 
decreasing dramatically so I'm probably
gonna<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.869> saying<00:02:07.110> one<00:02:07.350> thing<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.280> prices

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
gonna be saying one thing and the prices

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.830 
gonna be saying one thing and the prices
are<00:02:08.879> going<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.270> obviously<00:02:09.390> completely

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
are going to be obviously completely

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.830 
are going to be obviously completely
different<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:11.670> yeah<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.180> doesn't<00:02:12.360> look<00:02:12.569> too

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
different but yeah that doesn't look too

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.130
