so<00:01:44.610> since<00:01:44.790> you're<00:01:45.000> studying<00:01:45.210> radiology

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
so since you're studying radiology

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.389 
so since you're studying radiology
they're<00:01:46.020> cold<00:01:46.229> yeah<00:01:46.500> Peter<00:01:46.740> cool<00:01:47.009> sent<00:01:47.250> us<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
they're cold yeah Peter cool sent us a

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.200 
they're cold yeah Peter cool sent us a
link<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.210> guy<00:01:48.390> who<00:01:48.420> invented<00:01:48.720> this

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
link to this guy who invented this

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.450 
link to this guy who invented this
I<00:01:49.270> can<00:01:49.960> cure<00:01:50.080> for<00:01:50.290> cancer<00:01:50.470> putting<00:01:50.950> likes<00:01:51.100> gold

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
I can cure for cancer putting likes gold

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.130 
I can cure for cancer putting likes gold
and<00:01:51.610> silver<00:01:51.880> into<00:01:52.030> your<00:01:52.150> body<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:52.479> then<00:01:52.869> like

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
and silver into your body and then like

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.500 
and silver into your body and then like
hitting<00:01:53.440> you<00:01:53.530> with<00:01:53.650> radio<00:01:54.369> waves<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.420> the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
hitting you with radio waves and so the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.880 
hitting you with radio waves and so the
radio<00:01:55.780> waves<00:01:55.960> going<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.170> heat<00:01:56.350> up<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.560> silver

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
radio waves going to heat up the silver

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.320 
radio waves going to heat up the silver
of<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.040> gold<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.430> it's<00:01:57.820> going<00:01:57.940> to<00:01:58.000> kill<00:01:58.210> the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
of the gold and it's going to kill the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.359 
of the gold and it's going to kill the
cancer<00:01:58.540> but<00:01:58.930> we<00:01:59.020> also<00:01:59.229> discover<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.100> while

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
cancer but we also discover to it while

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.070 
cancer but we also discover to it while
doing<00:02:00.670> this<00:02:00.880> is<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.600> could<00:02:01.750> do<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.930> same

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
doing this is that you could do the same

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.840 
doing this is that you could do the same
thing<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.350> salt<00:02:02.650> water<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.100> would<00:02:03.430> burn<00:02:03.670> this

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
thing to salt water and would burn this

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.780 
thing to salt water and would burn this
sodium<00:02:04.690> in<00:02:04.869> there<00:02:05.049> so<00:02:05.830> leading<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.670> the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
sodium in there so leading to the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.910 
sodium in there so leading to the
possibility<00:02:07.570> that<00:02:07.600> our<00:02:07.900> nation's<00:02:08.380> oceans

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
possibility that our nation's oceans

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.460 
possibility that our nation's oceans
will<00:02:09.100> be<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.489> fuel<00:02:10.479> source<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.319> new

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
will be a fuel source this is the new

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.120 
will be a fuel source this is the new
oil<00:02:11.680> whales<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.940> better<00:02:13.150> watch<00:02:13.360> out<00:02:14.130> waters

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
oil whales you better watch out waters

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.520 
oil whales you better watch out waters
next<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.819> we<00:02:16.030> don't<00:02:16.239> mean<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.510> dykes<00:02:19.350> how<00:02:20.350> can
