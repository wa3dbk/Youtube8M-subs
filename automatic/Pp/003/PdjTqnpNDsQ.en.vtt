00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
circles here at the hip line what I did

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.520 
circles here at the hip line what I did
was<00:01:41.729> marked<00:01:43.189> with<00:01:44.189> my<00:01:44.520> seam<00:01:45.060> gauge<00:01:45.360> or<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
was marked with my seam gauge or the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.080 
was marked with my seam gauge or the
ruler<00:01:47.600> 5<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.899> 5/8<00:01:49.799> inch<00:01:50.130> seam<00:01:50.549> line<00:01:50.759> all<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
ruler 5 in 5/8 inch seam line all the

ruler 5 in 5/8 inch seam line all the
way<00:01:51.119> down<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.829> see<00:01:55.860> that's<00:01:56.250> where<00:01:56.430> I

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
way down so you can see that's where I

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.080 
way down so you can see that's where I
cut<00:01:56.790> it

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
cut it

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.719 
cut it
so<00:01:58.630> I've<00:01:59.020> cut<00:01:59.320> off<00:01:59.530> my<00:01:59.950> seam<00:02:00.250> allowance

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
so I've cut off my seam allowance

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.620 
so I've cut off my seam allowance
basically<00:02:01.270> right<00:02:01.540> or<00:02:01.689> my<00:02:01.810> seam<00:02:02.020> would<00:02:02.140> run

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
basically right or my seam would run

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.389 
basically right or my seam would run

line so I just take my seam line and
move<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:25.930> out<00:02:26.080> an<00:02:26.349> inch<00:02:27.239> it's<00:02:28.239> gonna<00:02:28.390> use<00:02:28.540> a

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
move it out an inch it's gonna use a

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.740 
move it out an inch it's gonna use a
ruler<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.790> then<00:02:30.940> add<00:02:31.299> an<00:02:31.510> inch<00:02:33.630> kind<00:02:34.630> of

what<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:52.930> do<00:02:53.019> is<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.290> tape<00:02:53.530> this<00:02:53.769> down<00:02:53.830> now

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
what you do is you tape this down now

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.960 
what you do is you tape this down now
and<00:02:55.410> then<00:02:56.410> fill<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.860> in<00:02:57.010> with<00:02:57.310> some<00:02:57.519> extra

pattern<00:02:58.330> paper<00:02:58.599> I<00:02:59.160> have<00:03:00.160> some<00:03:00.400> extra<00:03:00.700> pattern

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
pattern paper I have some extra pattern

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.960 
pattern paper I have some extra pattern
paper<00:03:01.239> that<00:03:01.540> was<00:03:01.690> just<00:03:01.959> cut<00:03:02.530> off<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:03.070> another

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
paper that was just cut off of another

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.660 
paper that was just cut off of another
pattern<00:03:04.540> whenever<00:03:05.079> I<00:03:05.170> made<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.680> saved<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
pattern whenever I made it I saved the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.580 
pattern whenever I made it I saved the
edges<00:03:07.060> around<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.570> pattern<00:03:07.750> piece<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.560> I

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
edges around the pattern piece that I

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.000 
edges around the pattern piece that I
cut<00:03:08.859> out<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.790> use<00:03:09.940> for<00:03:10.180> scrap<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:11.440> tape<00:03:11.829> this

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
cut out to use for scrap so tape this

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.410 
cut out to use for scrap so tape this
down<00:03:12.359> and<00:03:14.700> fill<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:15.819> in<00:03:15.940> with<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.150> piece<00:03:16.359> of

down and fill it in with a piece of

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.020 
down and fill it in with a piece of
pattern<00:03:16.870> paper<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.890> it's<00:03:18.040> not<00:03:18.220> like<00:03:18.430> gaping

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
pattern paper so it's not like gaping

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.509 
pattern paper so it's not like gaping
holes<00:03:19.269> in<00:03:19.540> your<00:03:19.630> pattern<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.260> what<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.280> have

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
holes in your pattern and what you have

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.750 
holes in your pattern and what you have
basically<00:03:22.150> is<00:03:22.540> an<00:03:23.109> extra<00:03:23.470> inch<00:03:23.650> in<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.609> hip

basically is an extra inch in the hip

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.580 
basically is an extra inch in the hip
area<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.359> because<00:03:25.989> this<00:03:26.170> pattern<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.739> haft

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
area and because this pattern is haft

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.940 
area and because this pattern is haft
it's<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.709> cut<00:03:29.889> unfold<00:03:30.989> cut<00:03:31.989> unfold<00:03:32.440> as<00:03:32.590> always

it's a cut unfold cut unfold as always

it's a cut unfold cut unfold as always
indicated<00:03:33.430> by<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.700> mark<00:03:34.180> like<00:03:34.329> that<00:03:34.359> I<00:03:35.220> will

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
indicated by a mark like that I will

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.610 
indicated by a mark like that I will
have<00:03:36.400> an<00:03:36.579> inch<00:03:36.730> added<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.480> each<00:03:37.930> hip<00:03:38.440> in<00:03:38.590> the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.069 
have an inch added to each hip in the
front<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.190> that's<00:03:39.280> two<00:03:39.639> inches<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.329> if<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.019> do

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
front so that's two inches and if I do

front so that's two inches and if I do
this<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.680> back<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.340> same<00:03:42.579> alteration<00:03:43.389> I

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
this to the back the same alteration I

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.710 
this to the back the same alteration I
will<00:03:44.590> have<00:03:44.829> another<00:03:45.549> two<00:03:45.819> inches<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:46.540> will

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
will have another two inches so I will

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.379 
will have another two inches so I will
have<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:46.870> total<00:03:47.350> of<00:03:47.500> four<00:03:47.950> inches<00:03:48.489> of<00:03:48.880> extra

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
have a total of four inches of extra
