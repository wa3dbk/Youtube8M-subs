into<00:02:03.960> chris<00:02:04.229> Robertson<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.100> he<00:02:05.250> has<00:02:05.460> done

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
into chris Robertson what he has done

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.119 
into chris Robertson what he has done
and<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.750> true<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.140> he<00:02:07.530> did<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.829> dear

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
and if it is true that he did in dear

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.300 
and if it is true that he did in dear
indeed<00:02:08.810> commandeer<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.959> plane<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.979> few

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
indeed commandeer a plane for a few

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.809 
indeed commandeer a plane for a few
brief<00:02:11.640> moments<00:02:11.670> that

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
brief moments that

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.380 
brief moments that
drastically<00:02:13.569> different<00:02:14.019> situation<00:02:14.650> Louis<00:02:15.390> uh

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
drastically different situation Louis uh

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.440 
drastically different situation Louis uh
yeah<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.019> mean<00:02:17.439> I<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.620> understand<00:02:18.430> why<00:02:18.909> they

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
yeah I mean I I understand why they

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.720 
yeah I mean I I understand why they
would<00:02:19.480> want<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:20.349> really<00:02:20.980> throw<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.340> book<00:02:21.549> at

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
would want to really throw the book at

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.080 
would want to really throw the book at
him<00:02:21.790> if<00:02:22.359> he<00:02:22.689> did<00:02:23.049> uh<00:02:23.620> cause<00:02:24.189> the<00:02:24.430> plane<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.700> uh

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
him if he did uh cause the plane to uh

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.170 
him if he did uh cause the plane to uh
to<00:02:25.840> move<00:02:26.019> or<00:02:26.230> change<00:02:26.260> or<00:02:26.889> you<00:02:27.340> know<00:02:27.459> commandeer

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
to move or change or you know commandeer

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.300 
to move or change or you know commandeer
I<00:02:28.359> me<00:02:28.689> that<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.439> the<00:02:29.560> word<00:02:29.739> were<00:02:29.889> using

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
I me that is that the word were using

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.610 
I me that is that the word were using
because<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.969> pilots<00:02:31.359> were<00:02:31.480> able<00:02:31.870> would<00:02:32.500> have

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
because the pilots were able would have

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.390 
because the pilots were able would have
been<00:02:32.769> able<00:02:32.889> to<00:02:33.219> you<00:02:33.549> know<00:02:33.700> assume<00:02:34.599> uh<00:02:35.400> command

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
been able to you know assume uh command

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.369 
been able to you know assume uh command
of<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.879> vessel<00:02:37.269> no<00:02:37.510> matter<00:02:37.689> what<00:02:37.959> well<00:02:38.349> I

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
of the the vessel no matter what well I

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.110 
of the the vessel no matter what well I
think<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.980> if<00:02:39.159> you're<00:02:39.400> not<00:02:39.609> one<00:02:39.879> of<00:02:39.909> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
think that if you're not one of the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.569 
think that if you're not one of the
pilots<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.109> take<00:02:41.409> over<00:02:41.799> control<00:02:42.069> of<00:02:42.310> the

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
pilots and you take over control of the

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.099 
pilots and you take over control of the
plane<00:02:42.819> such<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.269> you<00:02:43.569> make<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.900> do<00:02:44.079> something

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
plane such that you make it do something

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.530 
plane such that you make it do something
the<00:02:44.620> pilots<00:02:45.040> aren't<00:02:45.219> intending<00:02:45.819> for<00:02:45.849> it<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.329> do

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
the pilots aren't intending for it to do

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.020 
the pilots aren't intending for it to do
while<00:02:47.319> it<00:02:47.469> may<00:02:47.650> be<00:02:47.680> brief<00:02:48.219> it<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.609> sort<00:02:48.939> of

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
while it may be brief it is sort of

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.819 
while it may be brief it is sort of
commandeering<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:49.810> plane<00:02:50.019> in<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.319> moment<00:02:50.500> I

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
commandeering the plane in that moment I

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.659 
commandeering the plane in that moment I
I<00:02:51.370> suppose<00:02:52.030> by<00:02:52.389> by<00:02:52.689> definition<00:02:53.169> uh<00:02:53.639> now<00:02:54.639> I

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:54.669 
I suppose by by definition uh now I

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.170 
I suppose by by definition uh now I
still<00:02:55.150> think<00:02:55.449> that<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:56.620> if<00:02:56.769> he<00:02:56.980> wanted<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.459> if

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
still think that that if he wanted to if

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.689 
still think that that if he wanted to if
he<00:02:58.689> had<00:02:58.870> if<00:02:59.139> this<00:02:59.349> were<00:02:59.530> malicious<00:03:00.099> if<00:03:00.280> if<00:03:00.489> he

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:00.699 
he had if this were malicious if if he

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.970 
he had if this were malicious if if he
had<00:03:00.909> uh<00:03:00.939> if<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.079> wanted<00:03:02.379> to<00:03:02.469> take<00:03:02.590> down<00:03:02.829> the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
had uh if you wanted to take down the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.159 
had uh if you wanted to take down the
plane<00:03:03.219> I'm<00:03:03.730> not<00:03:04.060> saying<00:03:04.269> he<00:03:04.480> could<00:03:04.689> have<00:03:04.870> it's

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.169 
plane I'm not saying he could have it's

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.360 
plane I'm not saying he could have it's
clear<00:03:05.409> that's<00:03:05.560> not<00:03:05.680> what<00:03:05.859> he<00:03:05.919> was<00:03:06.040> trying<00:03:06.280> to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
clear that's not what he was trying to

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.789 
clear that's not what he was trying to
do<00:03:06.519> yeah<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.449> I<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:07.569> continue<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.319> have<00:03:08.469> mixed

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
do yeah I and I I continue to have mixed

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.530 
do yeah I and I I continue to have mixed
feelings<00:03:09.129> about<00:03:09.219> these<00:03:09.519> situations<00:03:10.120> we<00:03:10.299> know

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
feelings about these situations we know

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.839 
feelings about these situations we know
that<00:03:10.780> often<00:03:11.260> those<00:03:11.530> who<00:03:11.739> expose<00:03:12.219> security

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
that often those who expose security

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.059 
that often those who expose security
flaws<00:03:13.120> are<00:03:13.540> treated<00:03:14.079> to<00:03:14.109> roughly<00:03:14.829> into

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
flaws are treated to roughly into

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.550 
flaws are treated to roughly into
severely<00:03:15.790> when<00:03:16.510> they<00:03:16.659> often<00:03:17.019> weren't<00:03:17.319> even

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
severely when they often weren't even

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.679 
severely when they often weren't even
listen<00:03:17.979> to<00:03:18.009> when<00:03:18.819> they<00:03:18.970> sort<00:03:19.269> of<00:03:19.359> tried<00:03:19.659> to

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:19.689 
listen to when they sort of tried to

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.830 
listen to when they sort of tried to
notify<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.530> company<00:03:21.250> or<00:03:21.400> authorities<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.509> a

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
the same time we now have more

information about the specifics of what
chris<00:03:31.689> Roberts<00:03:32.139> is<00:03:32.290> done<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.769> it's<00:03:33.189> very<00:03:33.519> hard

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
chris Roberts is done and it's very hard

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.580 
chris Roberts is done and it's very hard
for<00:03:33.939> me<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.299> believe<00:03:34.389> that<00:03:34.629> he<00:03:35.349> would<00:03:35.470> have

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
for me to believe that he would have

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.839 
for me to believe that he would have
been<00:03:35.680> ignored<00:03:36.099> if<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.430> went<00:03:36.609> through<00:03:36.790> the

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
been ignored if you went through the

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.240 
been ignored if you went through the
right<00:03:37.000> channels<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.540> said<00:03:37.689> hey<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:38.470> passenger

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
right channels and said hey a passenger

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.780 
right channels and said hey a passenger
could<00:03:39.669> make<00:03:39.909> the<00:03:40.120> plane<00:03:40.389> change<00:03:40.840> altitude

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
could make the plane change altitude

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.740 
could make the plane change altitude
well<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:42.819> i<00:03:43.120> think<00:03:43.629> he<00:03:43.780> was<00:03:43.930> ignored<00:03:44.439> uh<00:03:45.060> yeah<00:03:46.060> uh

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
well I i think he was ignored uh yeah uh

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.039 
well I i think he was ignored uh yeah uh
I<00:03:47.079> don't<00:03:47.199> know<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:48.519> don't<00:03:48.759> this<00:03:49.599> is<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.870> type

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
I don't know you don't this is the type

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.689 
I don't know you don't this is the type
of<00:03:50.079> thing<00:03:50.439> that<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.829> airline's<00:03:51.220> might<00:03:51.519> have

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
of thing that the airline's might have

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.330 
of thing that the airline's might have
been<00:03:51.939> interested<00:03:52.629> in<00:03:52.780> just<00:03:52.989> keeping<00:03:53.709> quiet<00:03:53.919> uh

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
been interested in just keeping quiet uh

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.670 
been interested in just keeping quiet uh
so<00:03:54.970> in<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.389> way<00:03:55.449> perhaps<00:03:55.840> they<00:03:56.199> would<00:03:56.319> wanted

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
so in that way perhaps they would wanted

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.890 
so in that way perhaps they would wanted
to<00:03:56.769> ignore<00:03:57.040> him<00:03:57.069> well<00:03:57.609> but<00:03:57.909> they<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.180> Bianca

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
to ignore him well but they and Bianca

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.300 
to ignore him well but they and Bianca
live<00:03:59.079> in<00:03:59.199> but<00:03:59.319> just<00:03:59.500> might<00:03:59.650> not<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.799> believe<00:04:00.129> do

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
live in but just might not a believe do

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.860 
live in but just might not a believe do
you<00:04:00.400> think<00:04:00.639> they<00:04:00.759> would<00:04:00.909> keep<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.239> quiet<00:04:01.479> but

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
you think they would keep it quiet but

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.890 
you think they would keep it quiet but
they<00:04:02.079> would<00:04:02.259> fix<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:03.090> well<00:04:04.090> fixing<00:04:04.509> it<00:04:04.599> cost<00:04:04.780> a

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
they would fix it well fixing it cost a

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.809 
they would fix it well fixing it cost a
lot<00:04:05.019> of<00:04:05.079> money<00:04:05.199> as<00:04:05.530> we<00:04:05.829> discussed<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.579> you

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
lot of money as we discussed you you

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.490 
lot of money as we discussed you you
would<00:04:06.969> have<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.269> go<00:04:07.419> through<00:04:07.449> every<00:04:07.959> plane<00:04:08.229> and

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
would have to go through every plane and

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.250 
would have to go through every plane and
make<00:04:08.680> significant<00:04:09.219> changes
