end as it's plain on the other end what

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.280 
end as it's plain on the other end what
these<00:00:31.109> two<00:00:31.470> these<00:00:32.189> are<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.520> inner<00:00:32.730> tubes<00:00:33.290> or

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
these two these are the inner tubes or

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.250 
these two these are the inner tubes or
the<00:00:34.530> inner<00:00:34.710> hoops<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.809> plain<00:00:37.140> on

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the inner hoops this one is plain on

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.630 
the inner hoops this one is plain on
both<00:00:37.440> ends<00:00:38.540> but<00:00:41.960> this<00:00:42.960> one<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> suede

both ends but this one it's got a suede
on<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.059> side<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.200> whole<00:00:46.379> thing<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
on one side so that the whole thing to

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.160 
on one side so that the whole thing to
get<00:00:46.920> together<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.370> what<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:47.730> need<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.989> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
get together so what we need to do is to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.869 
get together so what we need to do is to
spread<00:00:49.410> these<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.739> put<00:00:50.280> them<00:00:50.399> together<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
spread these out put them together and

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.600 
spread these out put them together and
screw<00:00:51.149> them<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:55.829> now<00:00:56.039> we've<00:00:56.219> got<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:56.399> our

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
screw them up so now we've got all our

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.420 
screw them up so now we've got all our
