00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.530
 hello everyone even today I am found with 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.629
 a super-fast recipe the recipe of 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.539
 valdostana therefore ingredients that there 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.800
 will welcome are two rolls of pasta 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.689
 puff pastry 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.689
 I round it but also called flying 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.289
 is fine of the ham then it is the 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:30.099
 fontina alcan demo cut into slices 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.810
 and a little bit of tomato sauce 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.660
 meanwhile I turn on the oven since the 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.629
 really fast preparation like vi 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.570
 I said to put us on the oven at 180 degrees for 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.969
 do it to warm up in the plate of the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.420
 oven or already laid the first roll of 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.760
 puff pastry with its paper 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.940
 now let's go and put our pa 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:01:03.949
 they are the whole surface 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:06.730
 distributing it for good we leave free 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.730
 the edges 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.960
 at this point we are going to put the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.960
 our cooked ham 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.930
 that we return this to the whole 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.930
 surface 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.520
 now let's add our own 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.190
 fontina 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.590
 I cut it into slices if the fontina 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.900
 you don't like it or like mine if you want 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.480
 make this recipe for yours too 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.610
 children this cheese is a lot 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.820
 tasty I don't know if you can like it 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.080
 you can also use the slices 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.770
 obviously the taste is not like with 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.360
 the original however equally good 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.350
 so I'm going to put my money into it 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.710
 of fontina born these scattered throughout 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.710
 the dough 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.150
 I put myself a bit anyway 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.770
 it will melt and therefore it seems a bit 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:16.930
 disperse at this point we can 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:22.410
 take the other sheet I go to 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:29.470
 find and in this case baking paper 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:33.180
 what we need then take it off we go 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.180
 lay down exactly on top 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.940
 and we're going to seal all the data 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:51.150
 otherwise our tomato in cooking 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:54.610
 Exit out after he had quoted for good 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.360
 all the edge a fork we go to 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.490
 let's do this we do 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.130
 because in culture, obviously pasta 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.710
 browse you will go to a fiano and so here 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.110
 at this point we just have to go to 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.980
 bottom as I told you at 180 degrees 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.290
 I will tell you the cooking time 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.490
 after I believe around 20 30 minutes 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.760
 however, I will then confirm it later 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:24.940
 Senate last around 25 30 minutes and the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.680
 our Tuscan is ready as you see 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.910
 beautiful golden 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.000
 now I leave you a little 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.830
 warm up and then I'll go and serve this 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.770
 is a recipe that lends itself well to one 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.690
 snack or for an aperitif 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.910
 I hope you enjoyed the reference a 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.540
 greeting and not seen but the next 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.540
 Hello
