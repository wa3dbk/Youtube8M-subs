00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.940
 pokemon a very popular game for his 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.580
 and his video games but pokemon 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.670
 hides many mysteries such as tea 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.639
 pokemon dead ghosts and more 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.820
 again I propose today to you 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.820
 traveling with me beyond pokemon 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.229
 but he greets everyone is welcome 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.909
 in this eleventh episode of pau which 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.220
 theorize am very happy about you 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.940
 find for this suite 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.009
 today we're going to talk about a 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.650
 character who is arguably the most 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:20.149
 charismatic and mysterious in all 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.390
 the history of pokemon n natural harmonia 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.280
 gropius better known as No name is 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.290
 a young boy who was crowned king 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.840
 of the plasma team and who is fighting for 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.509
 realize his dream of freeing 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.340
 pokemon of humanity n is a 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.350
 very recurrent character in games 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.840
 pokemon black and white since in the 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.429
 cross several times n is a 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.830
 character very different from others 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.560
 since from an early age he was 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.690
 sheltered from the world and away from 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.429
 humans he went out very rarely are 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.950
 and not the exception and often 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.530
 with only pokemon company 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.450
 abused and rejected by the trainers 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.909
 this solitary education ordered by 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.800
 guy thys his adoptive father the dust 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.780
 experienced deep empathy with 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.450
 pokemon and ignorance of reality 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.880
 of the ground as well as childlike naivety 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.190
 very push 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.100
 this leads him in search of ideal or 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.230
 reality according to the version well this was 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.590
 a very short biography of our friend 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.540
 not 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.910
 but a lot of details remain of all 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.739
 even fuzzy about hate's past by 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.910
 example we will never be who are 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.470
 his biological parents 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.120
 since they have never been 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.160
 mentioned and that the cause of their 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.450
 disappearance is totally unknown but 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.320
 which is really n 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:38.030
 so here I told you that n is in 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:43.130
 reality a pokemon and if I told you 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.350
 that n is an impossible zoroark me 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.820
 how about is impossible impossible does it 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.030
 not part of the vocabulary of poke and 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.390
 theory here are the five arguments that 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.709
 will convince you number one indeed 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.019
 I could notice a lot of details 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.590
 shocking with similarities between 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.570
 reindeer and zoroark first of all observe 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.239
 more carefully the haircut 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.000
 of hate she fits perfectly with 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.370
 that of the work on could also 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.590
 observe in the animated pokemon that 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.440
 when zorilla turns into human 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.659
 we can still see his tail and 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.370
 same thing with the work 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.489
 except that it's his fur that fits 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.349
 and looks like hair we know 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.890
 all that the war who is the master of 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.920
 illusions 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.170
 so it has no trouble taking shape 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.950
 of a human however a detail remain 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.500
 blurry 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.659
 if according to the theory n is a euro mark 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.000
 how come they can 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.920
 talk and communicate with us and well 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.200
 to hear a talking pokemon is not 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.720
 quite recent indeed a lot of 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.700
 pokemon in the opportunity to talk about 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.440
 side of the animated yahoo this is 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.379
 the perfect example since he speaks 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.640
 during the whole series but not that we 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.890
 also have everything better in the 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.099
 first pokemon movie king ghada in the 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.560
 movie the power is in you arseus louga 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.870
 Innu ghost and I pass the shot 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.269
 to hear a pokemon talking is not so 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.819
 rare that it actually 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:10.400
 number 2 has the ability to 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.599
 understand pokemon these games alone to 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.599
 to be able to do such a thing 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.680
 we can say that between Pokemon they are 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.889
 include 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.470
 number 3 the hate behavior in 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.780
 black and white pokemon 2 is very strange 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.090
 the most amazing thing is when one 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.620
 falls on aisne he starts talking to us 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.289
 as if he continues a conversation 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.020
 whereas we had previously 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:36.169
 meet a the work 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.389
 weird no number four different 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.660
 for port held by him or by 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:44.210
 getty this suggests that hatred is 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.570
 absolutely not a human he is the 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.039
 creature he does not have a heart 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.229
 weird as a sentence we feel 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.250
 that guy thys you talk about hate like 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:57.380
 if he was an animal or a pokemon this 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.880
 is not any guy thys wheels but that 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.669
 again on the carpet saying 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.050
 here are n the bank calent creatures to 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:09.080
 human figure aaa 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.300
 more and more weird the spa our 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.280
 even more striking passage in 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.199
 black and white versions 2 it's in 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.770
 encountering hate in his palace that a 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.840
 very strange conversation engages this is 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.090
 here that the muses took care of me 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.389
 she treat me like a real being 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.810
 human 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:29.900
 the seven sages also bring me everything 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.539
 know them friends I want to focus 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.110
 your attention on this sentence she's me 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:39.050
 treat as a real human being 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.710
 this proves that n is actually all 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.599
 except a human being 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.460
 then the seven wise men brought him 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.680
 all their knowledge he certainly wants 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.180
 say that it is the dock for them 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.150
 can behave like a real 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.889
 human being number 5 last 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.169
 arguments that will convince you if that 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.550
 is not done yet by going in 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.889
 the room of our friend n 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.370
 we can see marks of 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:07.039
 claws on the wall interacting with 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.520
 the wall is written there are marks 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:13.159
 of pokemon claws here and there these 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.500
 traces have no doubt been made by n 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:18.620
 when he was only a king zoo 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.720
 a little wilder than today for 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.640
 summarize she would actually be a 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.500
 zoroark like a werewolf 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.480
 since he would have the faculty of 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.460
 turn into a human when he wants 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.940
 after obviously addresses that a 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.460
 theory 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.520
 free to each of you to believe 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.290
 or not that's the end of this eleventh 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.630
 episode do not hesitate to leave 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.250
 your opinion by commenting the video a 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.380
 little green thumb to encourage me to 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.720
 continue it would make me really happy 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.730
 this is the subject is open that think 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.770
 you from this theory it's going on in 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.080
 comments in any case friends 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.320
 thank you for having followed and at the next 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.320
 bay 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.240
