what<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.369> about<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.549> say<00:01:17.670> earlier<00:01:17.759> before

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
what I was about to say earlier before

his<00:01:18.360> cover's<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.780> scared<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.159> I'm<00:01:20.310> not

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
his cover's get scared was that I'm not

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.399 
his cover's get scared was that I'm not
running<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> timer<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.270> game<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
running a timer on this game so it

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.440 
running a timer on this game so it
probably<00:01:22.740> will<00:01:22.950> cut<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.369> which<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.299> probably

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
probably will cut out which it probably

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.490 
probably will cut out which it probably
already<00:01:24.720> has<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.080> you're<00:01:25.170> probably<00:01:25.259> already

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.620 
and chunks them and i'll yeah you'll
we'll<00:01:32.460> figure<00:01:32.640> some<00:01:32.850> sort<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> system<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.479> for

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
we'll figure some sort of system out for

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.319 
we'll figure some sort of system out for
the<00:01:33.689> titling<00:01:34.110> part<00:01:35.100> 1<00:01:35.369> second<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:38.270> for<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the titling part 1 second one for the

as<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.920> guys<00:01:41.040> are<00:01:41.220> seeing<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:41.640> here<00:01:41.820> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
as you guys are seeing right here you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.200 
as you guys are seeing right here you
need<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:43.110> mod<00:01:43.799> called<00:01:44.009> better<00:01:44.490> grass<00:01:44.820> which

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
need a mod called better grass which

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.850 
need a mod called better grass which
comes<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> exact<00:01:45.960> same<00:01:46.170> pack<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.649> better

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
comes in the exact same pack that better

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.219 
comes in the exact same pack that better
light<00:01:47.130> does<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.149> they're<00:01:48.600> easy<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.140> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
light does so they're easy to get if you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.179 
light does so they're easy to get if you
know<00:01:49.320> where<00:01:49.500> they<00:01:49.560> get<00:01:49.680> home<00:01:49.770> which<00:01:50.040> i<00:01:50.130> will

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
know where they get home which i will

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.480 
know where they get home which i will
put<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.430> link<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> description<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.390> i<00:01:51.570> said

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
put a link in the description as i said

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.140 
put a link in the description as i said
and<00:01:53.490> i<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.880> makes

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
and i think it makes

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:02.060 
and i think it makes
