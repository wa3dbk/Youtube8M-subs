00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.790 

now<00:00:00.599> I've<00:00:00.719> talked<00:00:01.050> before<00:00:01.439> about<00:00:01.469> the

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
now I've talked before about the

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.679 
now I've talked before about the
different<00:00:02.370> technologies<00:00:03.030> out<00:00:03.210> here<00:00:03.419> when<00:00:03.570> it

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
different technologies out here when it

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.639 
different technologies out here when it
comes<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:04.290> robots<00:00:04.950> when<00:00:05.670> it<00:00:05.759> comes<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.089> insects

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
comes to robots when it comes to insects

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.549 
comes to robots when it comes to insects
making<00:00:07.649> fake<00:00:08.160> insects<00:00:08.840> that<00:00:09.840> they<00:00:09.900> can<00:00:10.230> fly

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
making fake insects that they can fly

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.350

it<00:01:02.879> comes<00:01:03.120> close<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.809> when<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> comes<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it comes close to this when it comes to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.560 
it comes close to this when it comes to
size<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:06.320> capability<00:01:07.670> because<00:01:08.670> unlike<00:01:09.360> any

else<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.020> they<00:01:16.770> said<00:01:17.009> rather<00:01:17.460> than

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
else can and they said rather than

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.499 
else can and they said rather than
creating<00:01:18.240> such<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> robot<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.380> trying<00:01:19.740> to

creating such a robot and trying to

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.200 
creating such a robot and trying to
master<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:22.430> they've<00:01:23.430> taken<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.299> shortcut

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
master that they've taken the shortcut

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.859

so<00:01:27.210> they've<00:01:28.140> plugged<00:01:28.740> into<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.970> brain<00:01:30.270> using

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
so they've plugged into the brain using

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.510 
so they've plugged into the brain using
this<00:01:30.960> device<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:32.930> they're<00:01:33.930> literally<00:01:34.520> remote
