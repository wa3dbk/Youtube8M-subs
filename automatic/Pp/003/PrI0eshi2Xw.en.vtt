 all 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.860
 the look will probably be the word 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.910
 more accurate to describe the belvedere of 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.849
 moon 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.369
 located about 40 kilometers 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.460
 subject walks the landscape here 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.100
 found originates from rainfall and 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.059
 millenarian winds will fall in this 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.450
 region 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:40.329
 the conjugation of these agents in a lake 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.030
 aggressive but also inclusive 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.999
 this unique landscape that served as a 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:50.019
 inspiration for the very name of this 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:52.539
 miranda do douro natural wonder 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:57.429
 the story is also very closely associated 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:01:01.059
 this type landscape in the area am 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:03.940
 so much that it was originated by a player 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.490
 they use and we then have a landscape 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.820
 very much wing scarpa is not that in the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.990
 refers a case to the craters that 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.990
 there are on the street 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.540
 the various tones that were winning 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.940
 the mirador's cliffs over the years and 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.250
 which are enhanced with the magnitude of 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.650
 African port are a spectacle 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.650
 A must see and enjoyed by all 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:40.220
 apart from that which is visible name 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.740
 is not this degradation of hides am es 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.040
 python to go to the sea so beyond 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.240
 this bizarre landscape if so 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.180
 We can say 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.070
 many people speak at the sunset of 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.490
 Africa and in this case the setting sun 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.450
 and Angola and paper is the best is 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.380
 best place for those who come from the beach 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.110
 black cable for example stop here from 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.920
 fact to observe the sunset only seems 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.920
 a fireball 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.239
 even here the sunny days are 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.909
 made of iron for long 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.379
 and this contrast is important. 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:25.150
 turns out to be to be magnificent is a 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.150
 natural spectacle worth seeing 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:39.760
 from the viewpoint of the moon you can see 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.650
 in the distance by the beach a sling and 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.930
 typically fishing 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.030
 when leaving the beach from the wall 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.700
 known as the village of the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.760
 moon and benefits from the fame of these 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.800
 known bankruptcy song names 0cm 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.410

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.020
 how the academy wonder that 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.480
 is to meet everyone is a paradise that gave 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.640
 and gave us tapas that live here in 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.120
 we realized most want to see league said 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.860
 today it will not tighten a port much 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.970
 funny everything wants to be a point of 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.790
 reference 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.660
 every tourist or the next carrion arrives 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:23.080
 to start enjoying the scenery a 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.690
 area that this stern magazine that 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:32.050
 nature has a case with a belt 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:35.350
 much is that the holder who never tires 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:40.660
 is not that seems to imply is nuns 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:43.480
 we come in it looks like it 's always new but 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.540
 the unique lunar landscape and would rotate this 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.660
 gazebo can unfortunately have the days 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.660
 counted 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.160
 according to geological studies 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.980
 is progressive illusion of these cliffs does 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.220
 with which every year that passes one meter of the 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.350
 relief disappear 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.810
 year after year there has been a 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.740
 process of integration which, moreover, 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.410
 we observe a little more one 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.110
 a little further on in a 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.000
 set cliffs we want some 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.459
 cliff nowadays have contact with the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.560
 The sea is only seeing the live is in the viewpoint 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.690
 so much we can consider 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.070
 a dead rhyme when it is no longer in 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.100
 contact with the sea 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.169
 if we continue with this illusion 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.050
 progressive school will end up 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.479
 pure disappear 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.169
 the moon gazebo is a constant game 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.750
 color in the immense relief that 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.820
 opens to visitors with Mario 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.910

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.030
 an unpredictable natural spectacle that 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.940
 reassures the Spanish spirit and 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.390
 definitely worth a visit 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.390
 close 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.080
