type of use you're going to get out of
your<00:00:59.250> pressure<00:00:59.489> washer<00:00:59.940> determine<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.570> time

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
your pressure washer determine what time

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
your pressure washer determine what time
there's<00:01:01.320> two<00:01:01.559> types<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.100> when<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> go<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
there's two types that when you go the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.149 
there's two types that when you go the
store<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.239> look<00:01:03.420> there's<00:01:04.110> an<00:01:04.650> electric-type

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
store and look there's an electric-type

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.090 
store and look there's an electric-type
such<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> smaller<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.890> they're

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
such as the smaller one here and they're

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.550 
such as the smaller one here and they're
typically<00:01:08.460> rated<00:01:08.729> anywhere<00:01:09.210> from<00:01:09.420> about<00:01:09.570> 1500

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
typically rated anywhere from about 1500

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.609 
typically rated anywhere from about 1500
to<00:01:10.590> 1800<00:01:11.070> psi<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.570> that's<00:01:12.750> pounds<00:01:13.320> per<00:01:13.590> square

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
to 1800 psi so that's pounds per square

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.350 
to 1800 psi so that's pounds per square
inch<00:01:13.860> that's<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> amount<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.760> pressure<00:01:15.060> that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
inch that's the amount of pressure that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.140 
inch that's the amount of pressure that
it<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:15.659> put<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:17.340> they'll<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.759> kind

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
it will put out and they'll have to kind

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.990 
it will put out and they'll have to kind
of<00:01:18.240> ones<00:01:18.479> they'll<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.080> turbo<00:01:19.500> wand<00:01:20.000> which

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
of ones they'll have a turbo wand which

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.570 
of ones they'll have a turbo wand which
uses<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> very<00:01:21.960> tight<00:01:22.200> pattern<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:23.009> spirals<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
uses a very tight pattern but spirals it

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.280 
uses a very tight pattern but spirals it
around<00:01:23.850> allow<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.450> clean<00:01:24.689> then<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.049> also

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
around allow you to clean then it also

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.100 
around allow you to clean then it also
has<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.680> variable<00:01:26.100> wand<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.810> allows

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
has a variable wand on it that allows

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.980 
has a variable wand on it that allows
you<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.950> adjust<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.790> spray<00:01:30.060> from<00:01:30.450> soap

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you just to adjust it to spray from soap

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.190 
you just to adjust it to spray from soap
all<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.560> way<00:01:31.680> up<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> higher<00:01:32.970> pressure<00:01:33.390> span

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
all the way up to a higher pressure span

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.800 
all the way up to a higher pressure span
spray<00:01:34.590> does<00:01:35.430> run<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> lot<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.060> electricity<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
spray does run a lot on electricity and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.330 
spray does run a lot on electricity and
typically<00:01:37.590> they'll<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.890> some<00:01:38.070> kind<00:01:38.280> of

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
typically they'll have some kind of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.999 
typically they'll have some kind of
detergent<00:01:38.640> tank<00:01:39.030> built<00:01:39.270> into<00:01:39.570> them<00:01:39.799> if<00:01:40.799> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
detergent tank built into them if you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.340 
detergent tank built into them if you
are<00:01:41.040> using<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.820> lot<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.030> or<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> lot<00:01:43.320> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
are using a lot of or have a lot of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.370 
are using a lot of or have a lot of
larger<00:01:43.920> jobs<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.579> you're<00:01:44.790> doing<00:01:45.049> then<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> gas

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
larger jobs that you're doing then a gas

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.230 
larger jobs that you're doing then a gas
powered<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> next<00:01:47.700> step<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
powered would be the next step up and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.810 
powered would be the next step up and
this<00:01:48.420> particular<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:49.140> actually<00:01:49.710> goes<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.729> to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
this particular one actually goes up to

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.840 
this particular one actually goes up to
25<00:01:51.240> 50<00:01:51.750> psi<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.979> which<00:01:53.100> means<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> lot

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
25 50 psi so which means you have a lot

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.270 
25 50 psi so which means you have a lot
more<00:01:53.880> pressure<00:01:54.649> it's<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.890> give<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.250> a

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
you're going to do so again as far as

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.970 
you're going to do so again as far as
when<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.780> look<00:02:39.959> at<00:02:40.050> investing<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.709> pressure

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
when you look at investing in a pressure

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.040 
when you look at investing in a pressure
washer<00:02:41.250> if<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.300> occasional<00:02:42.870> light

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
washer if you just do occasional light

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.229 
washer if you just do occasional light
jobs<00:02:43.349> then<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.250> electrical<00:02:44.700> bowline<00:02:45.030> is

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
jobs then the electrical bowline is

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.210 
jobs then the electrical bowline is
going<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.720> be<00:02:46.080> fine

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
going to be fine

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.430 
going to be fine
for<00:02:47.430> most<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.790> your<00:02:47.910> applications<00:02:48.060> if<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.260> get

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
for most of your applications if you get

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.620 
for most of your applications if you get
into<00:02:49.650> some<00:02:49.680> medium-duty<00:02:50.670> or<00:02:51.030> occasionally

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
into some medium-duty or occasionally

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.170 
into some medium-duty or occasionally
some<00:02:51.870> heavy<00:02:52.080> jobs<00:02:52.440> some<00:02:52.769> larger<00:02:53.190> jobs<00:02:53.459> then

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
some heavy jobs some larger jobs then

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.110 
some heavy jobs some larger jobs then
investing<00:02:54.780> in<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.019> gas-powered<00:02:55.260> one<00:02:55.970> would<00:02:56.970> be

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
investing in a gas-powered one would be

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.940 
investing in a gas-powered one would be
your<00:02:57.269> better<00:02:57.480> choice<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.049> I'm<00:02:58.170> Tim<00:02:58.350> Gipson<00:02:58.410> and

your better choice so I'm Tim Gipson and

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.750 
your better choice so I'm Tim Gipson and
that's<00:02:59.040> how<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.850> buy<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.120> pressure<00:03:00.480> washer
