00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:03.830 
hey guys so today I'm gonna be doing a

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.920 
hey guys so today I'm gonna be doing a
comparison<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:05.460> these<00:00:06.060> two<00:00:06.120> batteries<00:00:06.690> right

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
comparison of these two batteries right

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.520 
comparison of these two batteries right
here<00:00:07.160> the<00:00:08.160> will<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.690> this<00:00:09.690> wasabi<00:00:10.170> power

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
here the will of this wasabi power

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.570 
here the will of this wasabi power
battery<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.820> got<00:00:12.000> off<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.179> Amazon<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.580> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
battery that I got off of Amazon and the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.150 
battery that I got off of Amazon and the
gopro<00:00:15.059> standard<00:00:15.540> battery<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.529> sabe<00:00:16.920> pat

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
gopro standard battery the sabe pat

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.150 
gopro standard battery the sabe pat
power<00:00:18.080> battery<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.880> 1200<00:00:20.880> milliamp<00:00:21.330> hours<00:00:21.750> and

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
power battery is 1200 milliamp hours and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.880 
power battery is 1200 milliamp hours and
this<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.609> only<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:24.060> thousand<00:00:24.539> 50<00:00:25.170> million

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
this one is only one thousand 50 million

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.519 
this one is only one thousand 50 million
powers<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.960> one<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.349> quite<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.220> bit<00:00:29.460> more

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
powers so this one is quite a bit more

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.970 
powers so this one is quite a bit more
so<00:00:31.529> we'll<00:00:31.920> see<00:00:32.340> here<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:33.350> which<00:00:34.350> one<00:00:34.559> lasts

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
so we'll see here of which one lasts

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.520 
so we'll see here of which one lasts
longer<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.550> gonna<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.760> doing<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.329> test<00:00:37.110> about

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
longer I'm gonna be doing a test about

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.299 
longer I'm gonna be doing a test about
how<00:00:38.190> long<00:00:38.399> they<00:00:38.550> last<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.000> I'll<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.450> timing<00:00:39.690> it

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
how long they last for I'll be timing it

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.479 
how long they last for I'll be timing it
and<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.540> should<00:00:42.780> last<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.410> little<00:00:44.340> bit

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
and this one should last a little bit

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.910 
and this one should last a little bit
long<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.879> don't<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:46.140> feels<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.770> they

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
long I don't know it feels like it they

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.240 
long I don't know it feels like it they
last<00:00:47.190> long<00:00:47.399> where<00:00:47.550> I'm<00:00:47.640> using<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.480> I'll

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
last long where I'm using it like I'll

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.500 
last long where I'm using it like I'll
take<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.399> filming<00:00:50.879> stuff<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.300> everything

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
take in filming stuff and everything

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.650 
take in filming stuff and everything
goes<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> lot<00:00:52.410> longer<00:00:52.559> than<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:53.820> but

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
goes a lot longer than this one but

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.049 
goes a lot longer than this one but
we'll<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.230> actually<00:00:55.410> how<00:00:56.100> long<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.579> we're

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
we'll see actually how long it is we're

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.529 
we'll see actually how long it is we're
going<00:00:57.180> time<00:00:57.390> today<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:59.300> let's<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.449> started

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
going time today so let's get started

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.670 
going time today so let's get started
alright<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.379> first<00:01:05.129> step<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.680> standard

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
alright so first step is the standard

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.410 
alright so first step is the standard
GoPro<00:01:08.040> battery<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.790> comes<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.090> every

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
GoPro battery that comes with every

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.640 
GoPro battery that comes with every
GoPro<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.760> I'm<00:01:11.760> gonna<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.119> filming<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.750> 720p

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
GoPro and I'm gonna be filming on 720p

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.789 
GoPro and I'm gonna be filming on 720p
60<00:01:14.580> frames<00:01:14.790> per<00:01:14.939> second<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.409> don't

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
60 frames per second just so I don't

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.060 
60 frames per second just so I don't
fill<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.549> my<00:01:17.909> memory<00:01:18.240> card<00:01:18.710> before<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
fill up my memory card before the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.719 
fill up my memory card before the
battery<00:01:20.369> runs<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.100> or<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> would<00:01:23.400> be<00:01:23.549> doing
