Swan Morton scalpel blades they are non
sterile<00:00:34.739> disposable<00:00:35.010> scalpel<00:00:35.489> blades<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
sterile disposable scalpel blades so I

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.790 
sterile disposable scalpel blades so I
took<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.010> scrap<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.460> Spanish<00:00:38.820> cedar<00:00:39.800> actually

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
took the scrap of Spanish cedar actually

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.190 
took the scrap of Spanish cedar actually
a<00:00:40.980> solid<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.540> kerf<00:00:42.540> through<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.899> end<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
a solid a kerf through the end of it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.240 
a solid a kerf through the end of it
with<00:00:43.290> my<00:00:43.469> bandsaw

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
with my bandsaw

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.040 
with my bandsaw
I<00:00:44.280> stuck<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.120> scalpel<00:00:45.570> blades<00:00:45.809> in

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
I stuck one of the scalpel blades in

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.610 
I stuck one of the scalpel blades in
there<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:47.460> drilled<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.480> countersunk<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
there and I drilled and countersunk a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
there and I drilled and countersunk a
hole<00:00:49.770> first<00:00:50.100> screw<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.629> simply

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
hole first screw and then I just simply

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.459 
hole first screw and then I just simply
took<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> French<00:00:52.590> curve<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.780> sketched<00:00:54.780> out<00:00:55.079> a

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
took a French curve and sketched out a

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.650 
took a French curve and sketched out a
general<00:00:56.219> handle<00:00:56.640> shape<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> kind<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.480> like

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
general handle shape that I kind of like

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.260 
general handle shape that I kind of like
and<00:00:57.989> now<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> secure<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.430> blade<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:00.030> there

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and now to secure this blade in there

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.869 
and now to secure this blade in there
because<00:01:00.680> this<00:01:01.680> blade<00:01:02.039> has<00:01:02.190> got<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> wiggle<00:01:02.640> up

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
because this blade has got a wiggle up

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.230 
because this blade has got a wiggle up
and<00:01:03.030> down<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.890> have<00:01:04.890> sketched<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.000> blade

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and down I have sketched the blade

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.560 
and down I have sketched the blade
position<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.150> front<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
position out on the in front of the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.780 
position out on the in front of the
handle<00:01:10.400> line<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.580> blade<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:13.460> I've<00:01:14.460> cut

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
handle line the blade with that I've cut

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.719 
handle line the blade with that I've cut
out<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.970> few<00:01:15.270> little<00:01:15.619> pieces<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:17.009> walnut<00:01:17.340> it's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
out a few little pieces of walnut it's

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.179 
out a few little pieces of walnut it's
gonna<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.030> glued<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.450> place<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:19.049> that

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
gonna be glued in place like that

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.219 
gonna be glued in place like that
there'll<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.220> another<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.970> bottom<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
there'll be another one on the bottom to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.999 
there'll be another one on the bottom to
support<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.400> keep<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.790> from<00:01:24.030> moving<00:01:25.009> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
support it to keep this from moving and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.010 
support it to keep this from moving and
then<00:01:26.400> I'll<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.939> cut<00:01:27.119> off<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> surplus<00:01:27.780> once

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
then I'll just cut off the surplus once

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.399 
then I'll just cut off the surplus once
the<00:01:28.170> glue<00:01:29.040> dries<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.909> cut<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> handle<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the glue dries and cut the handle out to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:03:00.710 
the glue dries and cut the handle out to
shape

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.720 

and<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.960> couple<00:03:02.170> coats<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.620> bull's-eye<00:03:03.310> blonde

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
and a couple coats of bull's-eye blonde

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.210 
and a couple coats of bull's-eye blonde
shellac<00:03:04.120> should<00:03:05.080> be<00:03:05.260> plenty<00:03:05.590> stuff<00:03:05.920> enough

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
shellac should be plenty stuff enough

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:36.860 
shellac should be plenty stuff enough
for<00:03:06.490> a<00:03:06.850> shop<00:03:07.600> bath

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.930 

now<00:03:37.870> I'm<00:03:37.989> not<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.200> carver<00:03:38.769> but<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.220> decided<00:03:39.580> to

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
now I'm not a carver but I decided to

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.210 
now I'm not a carver but I decided to
test<00:03:40.599> this<00:03:40.810> thing<00:03:41.049> out<00:03:41.230> on<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.560> piece<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:42.010> poplar

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
test this thing out on a piece of poplar

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.729 
test this thing out on a piece of poplar
and<00:03:43.150> try<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:43.810> do<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.959> little<00:03:44.260> bit<00:03:44.409> of<00:03:44.470> chip

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
and try and do a little bit of chip

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.270 
and try and do a little bit of chip
carving<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:46.780> was<00:03:47.349> just<00:03:47.590> really<00:03:47.950> starting

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
carving and I was just really starting

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.140 
carving and I was just really starting
to<00:03:48.459> feel<00:03:48.670> pretty<00:03:48.730> good<00:03:49.180> about<00:03:49.890> my<00:03:50.890> knife<00:03:53.010> and

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
to feel pretty good about my knife and

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:03.080 
to feel pretty good about my knife and
yeah<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:57.150> piece<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.299> walnut<00:03:58.860> gave<00:03:59.860> away<00:04:02.069> and

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
yeah the piece of walnut gave away and

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.240 
yeah the piece of walnut gave away and
it<00:04:04.090> apparently<00:04:04.659> the<00:04:05.079> glue<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.799> glue<00:04:06.010> joint

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
it apparently the glue the glue joint

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.280 
it apparently the glue the glue joint
just<00:04:06.489> seemed<00:04:06.819> like<00:04:07.090> it<00:04:07.269> didn't<00:04:07.720> have<00:04:07.810> any<00:04:07.989> glue

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
just seemed like it didn't have any glue

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.199 
just seemed like it didn't have any glue
on<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.620> inside<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.069> it<00:04:09.310> when<00:04:09.730> I<00:04:09.790> came<00:04:10.000> out<00:04:10.120> it

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
on the inside of it when I came out it

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.849 
on the inside of it when I came out it
was<00:04:10.329> perfectly<00:04:10.810> clean<00:04:11.110> even<00:04:11.379> though<00:04:11.440> I<00:04:11.470> used<00:04:11.769> a

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
was perfectly clean even though I used a

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.800 
was perfectly clean even though I used a
lot<00:04:12.010> of<00:04:12.040> glue<00:04:12.280> when<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.519> put<00:04:12.700> it<00:04:12.790> in<00:04:12.879> there<00:04:13.120> so

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
lot of glue when I put it in there so

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.920 
lot of glue when I put it in there so
this<00:04:14.019> time<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.230> decided<00:04:14.349> to<00:04:14.829> try<00:04:15.040> CA<00:04:15.400> glue<00:04:15.930> and

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
this time I decided to try CA glue and

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.960 
this time I decided to try CA glue and
yes<00:04:17.169> right<00:04:17.380> here<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.650> do<00:04:17.769> almost<00:04:18.130> move<00:04:18.609> my<00:04:18.760> thumb

to the knife so quick repair here with

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.379 
to the knife so quick repair here with
CA<00:04:25.389> glue<00:04:26.160> also<00:04:27.160> put<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.610> little<00:04:27.789> bit<00:04:27.940> on<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.210> top

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
CA glue also put a little bit on the top

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.750 
CA glue also put a little bit on the top
for<00:04:28.660> good<00:04:28.810> measure<00:04:29.130> little<00:04:30.130> touch-up<00:04:30.550> with

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
for good measure little touch-up with

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.640 
for good measure little touch-up with
some<00:04:31.330> sandpaper<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:34.199> get<00:04:35.199> back<00:04:35.410> to<00:04:35.590> the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
some sandpaper and get back to the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:51.140 
some sandpaper and get back to the
business<00:04:35.800> here

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.670 

in<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.240> year<00:04:52.450> I<00:04:52.480> decided<00:04:52.810> not<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.110> take<00:04:53.320> any<00:04:53.560> more

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
in a year I decided not to take any more

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.530 
in a year I decided not to take any more
chances<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:54.310> I<00:04:54.400> put<00:04:54.610> my<00:04:54.730> finger<00:04:55.030> on<00:04:55.180> top<00:04:55.210> of

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
chances and I put my finger on top of

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.940 
chances and I put my finger on top of
the<00:04:55.600> knife<00:04:55.780> blade<00:04:56.050> while<00:04:56.290> I<00:04:56.350> made<00:04:56.620> some<00:04:56.860> of

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
the knife blade while I made some of

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.090 
the knife blade while I made some of
these<00:04:57.010> cuts<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:58.530> just<00:04:59.530> didn't<00:04:59.710> want<00:04:59.860> to<00:04:59.890> break

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
these cuts I just didn't want to break

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.360 
these cuts I just didn't want to break
it<00:05:00.220> again<00:05:00.460> but<00:05:00.850> I<00:05:01.240> think<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.560> CA<00:05:03.040> glue

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
it again but I think the CA glue

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.000 
it again but I think the CA glue
actually<00:05:03.790> helped<00:05:04.390> out<00:05:04.540> quite<00:05:04.570> a<00:05:04.840> bit<00:05:05.010> because

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
actually helped out quite a bit because

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.950 
actually helped out quite a bit because
as<00:05:06.340> I<00:05:06.490> was<00:05:06.670> using<00:05:06.850> it<00:05:07.090> seemed<00:05:07.360> pretty<00:05:07.540> sturdy

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
as I was using it seemed pretty sturdy

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.710 
as I was using it seemed pretty sturdy
now<00:05:08.650> I<00:05:08.680> didn't<00:05:09.160> really<00:05:09.400> make<00:05:10.000> this<00:05:10.180> as<00:05:10.390> a<00:05:10.420> chip

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
now I didn't really make this as a chip

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.850 
now I didn't really make this as a chip
carving<00:05:11.140> knife<00:05:11.350> so<00:05:13.140> really<00:05:14.140> I<00:05:14.170> hadn't<00:05:14.620> like<00:05:14.830> a

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
carving knife so really I hadn't like a

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.090 
carving knife so really I hadn't like a
marking<00:05:15.310> knife<00:05:15.460> in<00:05:16.270> mind<00:05:16.810> when<00:05:17.050> I<00:05:17.080> made<00:05:17.380> it<00:05:17.560> but

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
marking knife in mind when I made it but

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.470 
marking knife in mind when I made it but
I<00:05:18.130> kind<00:05:18.430> of<00:05:18.490> just<00:05:18.640> wanted<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:18.970> see<00:05:19.180> how<00:05:19.330> it

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
I kind of just wanted to see how it

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.120 
I kind of just wanted to see how it
would<00:05:19.600> work<00:05:19.630> out<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.050> was<00:05:20.290> curious<00:05:20.680> how<00:05:20.800> sharp

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
would work out I was curious how sharp

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.130 
would work out I was curious how sharp
those<00:05:21.280> blades<00:05:21.550> were<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.210> they're<00:05:22.930> fairly

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
those blades were and they're fairly

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.260 
those blades were and they're fairly
thin<00:05:23.530> too<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.400> thought<00:05:24.610> you<00:05:24.880> know<00:05:25.030> I've

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
thin too and and I thought you know I've

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.270 
thin too and and I thought you know I've
always<00:05:25.480> wanted<00:05:25.570> to<00:05:25.750> try<00:05:25.930> chip<00:05:26.230> carving<00:05:26.680> so<00:05:27.250> I

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
always wanted to try chip carving so I

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.870 
always wanted to try chip carving so I
thought<00:05:27.970> this<00:05:28.090> might<00:05:28.150> be<00:05:29.070> you<00:05:30.070> know<00:05:30.190> a<00:05:30.220> sort<00:05:30.820> of

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
thought this might be you know a sort of

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.970 
thought this might be you know a sort of
a<00:05:31.000> good<00:05:31.180> blade<00:05:31.480> a<00:05:31.510> good<00:05:31.870> knife<00:05:32.110> to<00:05:32.410> give<00:05:32.800> that<00:05:32.950> a

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
a good blade a good knife to give that a

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.060 
a good blade a good knife to give that a
try<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:34.060> I<00:05:34.270> think<00:05:34.300> it<00:05:34.570> still<00:05:34.840> is<00:05:34.870> you<00:05:35.290> know<00:05:36.930> so

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
try and I think it still is you know so

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.380 
try and I think it still is you know so
you<00:05:39.070> know<00:05:39.190> but<00:05:39.460> there's<00:05:39.670> there's<00:05:40.000> obviously

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
you know but there's there's obviously

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
you know but there's there's obviously
you<00:05:40.810> know<00:05:40.930> better<00:05:41.380> and<00:05:41.530> stronger<00:05:41.830> designs

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
you know better and stronger designs

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.110 
you know better and stronger designs
that<00:05:44.410> would<00:05:44.560> hold<00:05:44.680> that<00:05:44.860> blade<00:05:45.070> in<00:05:45.250> there<00:05:45.490> then

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
that would hold that blade in there then

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.840 
that would hold that blade in there then
that<00:05:46.330> walnut<00:05:46.750> veneer<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:47.740> I'm<00:05:48.370> I<00:05:48.670> might

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
that walnut veneer and I'm I might

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.940 
that walnut veneer and I'm I might
experiment<00:05:49.510> with<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:49.720> some<00:05:49.990> more<00:05:50.170> but

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
experiment with that some more but

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.590 
experiment with that some more but
overall<00:05:51.280> I<00:05:51.400> think<00:05:51.730> it's<00:05:51.820> a<00:05:51.880> pretty<00:05:52.030> solid<00:05:52.300> idea

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
overall I think it's a pretty solid idea

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.970 
overall I think it's a pretty solid idea
and<00:05:53.370> definitely<00:05:54.370> worth<00:05:54.520> doing
