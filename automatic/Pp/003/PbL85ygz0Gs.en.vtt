is<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.750> really<00:02:57.140> good<00:02:57.290> motive<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.830> actually

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
is a really good motive it actually

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.040 
is a really good motive it actually
shows<00:02:58.790> what<00:02:58.820> makes<00:02:59.210> Fluttershy<00:02:59.660> who<00:02:59.720> she<00:03:00.020> is

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
the fact that ridicule is what caused

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.060 
the fact that ridicule is what caused
such<00:03:02.510> trauma<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.170> how<00:03:03.320> it<00:03:03.440> affects<00:03:03.740> her<00:03:03.890> from

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
a filly hood as a good demonstration of

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.540 
a filly hood as a good demonstration of
how<00:03:06.260> people<00:03:06.620> take<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:06.920> effectively<00:03:07.400> in

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
how people take it effectively in

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.300 
how people take it effectively in
reality<00:03:08.090> as<00:03:08.270> I<00:03:08.960> said<00:03:09.200> some<00:03:09.590> people<00:03:09.890> think<00:03:10.190> it's

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
reality as I said some people think it's

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.460 
reality as I said some people think it's
nothing<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:11.060> others<00:03:11.390> take<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.840> pretty<00:03:12.020> hard

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
nothing but others take it pretty hard

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.100 
nothing but others take it pretty hard
admittedly<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.340> did<00:03:13.640> at<00:03:13.730> some<00:03:13.880> point<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:14.840> I<00:03:14.870> knew

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
admittedly I did at some point so I knew

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.220 
admittedly I did at some point so I knew
exactly<00:03:15.260> how<00:03:15.860> Fluttershy<00:03:16.400> felt<00:03:16.730> now<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.990> don't

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
exactly how Fluttershy felt now I don't

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.320 
exactly how Fluttershy felt now I don't
like<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.710> when<00:03:18.860> fluttershy<00:03:19.340> cries<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:20.180> I'm

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
like it when fluttershy cries and I'm

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.940 
like it when fluttershy cries and I'm
sure<00:03:20.510> most<00:03:20.690> Fluttershy<00:03:21.200> fans<00:03:21.470> don't<00:03:21.800> either

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
sure most Fluttershy fans don't either

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.730 
sure most Fluttershy fans don't either

she's supposed to be happy not sad

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.830 
she's supposed to be happy not sad
I<00:03:25.100> did<00:03:25.880> like<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.210> scene<00:03:26.420> where<00:03:26.450> all<00:03:26.690> the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.630 
I did like the scene where all the
animals<00:03:27.230> gather<00:03:27.470> around<00:03:27.650> Fluttershy<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.310> come

animals gather around Fluttershy to come
for<00:03:28.850> her<00:03:29.000> because<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:29.990> reminded<00:03:30.380> me<00:03:30.440> of<00:03:30.530> scene

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920
