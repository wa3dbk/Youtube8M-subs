00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 today in how it's done we're going to prepare 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.270
 delicious homemade croquettes 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.940
 chicken for this we need the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.309
 following ingredients the bechamel la 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.769
 we will have prepared myself in this case the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.070
 I have from before chicken of remains of a 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.060
 puchero or you can use roasted chicken 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.610
 the bechamel that had prepared eggs and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.650
 bread crumbs let's prepare 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.610
 how his promise was prepared 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.660
 I am now warming up a little in 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:36.600
 the pot I have the recipe in another tutorial 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.850
 how a bÃ©chamel is prepared and what 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.629
 you can see 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.629
 and it is no longer in this beautiful mel we add 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.070
 the chicken that is chopped into pieces 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.870
 small and used chicken hen and 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.390
 chicken that I used in a pot 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.640
 but it can also be remains that a 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.390
 Roast chicken that has been left over 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.290
 and it's a way to economize and not 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.590
 throw anything you can use roast some 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.390
 chicken breasts and chop the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.630
 make croquettes if you want to eat 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.630
 croquettes 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.820
 because once you cut it you throw it to the 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.520
 villa mel and do not stop moving so that 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.520
 do not stick to medium heat 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.170
 and let it be homogeneous everything is well 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.700
 compact and let it cook 15 minutes 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.320
 moving from time to time so you do not 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.390
 hit us 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.710
 once it is starting to boil as 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.450
 you see in the image the bechamel and the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.590
 croquettes the filling is prepared well 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.080
 that now what we are going to do is 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.360
 let it cool to make the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.940
 Croquettes I have put it in a tray 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.830
 you try to put a tray as thin as 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:02.040
 possible croquettes layer croquettes 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:05.280
 and you leave it overnight in the fridge 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.680
 so that it hardens 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.459
 once this time has elapsed as 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.440
 you see 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.780
 I covered it with plastic film so that 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.680
 there is crust on the top and be 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:21.150
 everything equal we emphasize the mass is hard 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 and we can work to make the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.590
 croquettes as you see have become hard 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.950
 we use it with very clean hands 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.160
 we give form and once the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.060
 we passed the egg croquette 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.600
 that we have beaten and then for bread 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.600
 grated 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.680
 and that we are doing with the whole mass 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.680
 of the croquettes 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.670
 we give form we went through egg and then 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.690
 by breadcrumbs and so we use all 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.640
 the masses 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.750
 once all the mass of the 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.940
 Croquettes you can cook creeds and 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.410
 that you can not freeze them that you know 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:18.170
 is that option before frying them I'm going to 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.820
 fry then what I need and in one 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.640
 then what we do is in a pan 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:27.569
 we put plenty of oil 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.709
 and when it's hot, we'll add 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.709
 the croquettes 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.890
 it is very important that it makes 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.240
 hot because if the croquettes are not 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.760
 they will break us once they are hot 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.040
 we add the croquettes and then we go down 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.480
 a little bit so we do not get burned and 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.480
 they stay raw inside 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.870
 let turning slowly we 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.370
 left enough space between croquettes 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.900
 so that they do not break or we are 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.250
 stick 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.250
 and we are going around 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.880
 when the croquettes we see that they are already 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.060
 golden on all sides 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.890
 what we do is take them out on a plate 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.340
 We put rolls of kitchen paper for 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:29.030
 to absorb the excess oil and 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.030
 let's go to meat 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.440
 and we already have some delicious 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.630
 homemade chicken croquettes sure 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.890
 I will enjoy jce the whole family when you have 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.590

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:46.690
 liked may be able to follow the recipe in 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:50.220
 the blog that is written with more tricks 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.220
 and with more tips
