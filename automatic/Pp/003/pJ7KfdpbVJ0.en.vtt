00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.580
 I certainly uncharacteristic genre 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.340
 go down to viral video reviews or 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.259

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.940
 but a review of my new camera which I 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.400
 I bought just a couple of weeks ago I 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.109
 perhaps I will do so with my new camera 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.720
 became dormouse hendikan xdr later 660 in and 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.840
 podzhi means that there is a spotlight 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.240
 him a little later features 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.189
 I will not go because it is not 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.890
 interesting and who is very interesting in 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.780
 description there is a link to the full list 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.660
 all the characteristics I'm in this video 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 tell you what surprised me or nice 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.200
 pleased to visually show my 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.329
 new camera has to be removed 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.390
 some shots on my old dormouse 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.210
 Hyaddikan dessert 87 its characteristics 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.430
 also in the description who is interested here 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.600
 regards gives new its main 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.680
 characteristics is 64 gigabytes 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.289
 white jungle twenty six and eight 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.449
 millimeters and five and a half 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.770
 megapixels matrix size 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.700
 But beyond that I was surprised by it 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:16.500
 such a floating lens that is 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.240
 Do you need such a stabilizer? 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.850
 it's very cool and really 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.040
 frame blurring comes down simply to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.170
 minimum in different places so much 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.409
 differently from 28 to 35 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.079
 Here, but only for sale in Moscow, therefore 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.090
 I had to go there and do not use already 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.900
 delivery wants Russia there 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.640
 viewfinder by the way there is 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:48.110
 viewfinder like this is a spotlight 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:52.430
 they further we will tell everyones you here and 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.430
 Here is the way very cool I am very 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.030
 cool topic is a spotlight that is 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.119
 can be in the dark or there 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.250
 some in clubs or just dark 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.820
 premises shoot it all and 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.900
 not to bathe especially conveniently beat her 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.929
 the cord is what's in my old cameras 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.760
 this is not even though the troops are not even 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.860
 headphone and microphone jacks 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.750
 That's why I like that at all 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.000
 really like it so much for charging 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.280
 battery standard in general so it 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.530
 looks like now I want to do 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.130
 a small test drive test that is 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.959
 show simultaneously shooting with 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.209
 1 my old pixel camera is hydrochloric 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.800
 my five and a half song chamber 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.900
 here is the difference is the same 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.350
 absolutely conditions that is one camera 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.030
 shoots well another shoots bad 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.459
 now is the time for gutting 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.060
 boxes in Russian is called anboxing 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.890
 Now I will try to produce was to change 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:55.950
 nothing to be so hard 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.950
 here hd my interesting wire 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.310
 additional yusbi transition 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:14.140
 remote control on this camera 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.440
 does not work naturally and so on 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.180
 i'm very much pregnant here is transitional 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.850
 ring for different lenses i.e. 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.610
 on this ordinary household heater I can 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.440
 I think hang straight cool lenses 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.180
 cameras and peer before 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.650
 women including 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.489
 so there bags the most in my opinion 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.890
 the main thing 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.820
 And well, it may be of course useless, but 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.930
 nice this here it is damn yes I learned 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.000
 new words to damn yes she 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.790
 for those who do not know you need to explain to 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.989
 so that the lens does not fall extra glare 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.160
 and sunlight 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.190
 I tried now 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:04:02.950
 fasten on like this 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:06.460
 twist to keep here twisted 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:13.890
 you on hold and the camera looks already 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:20.709
 more cool then there is a bunch of cool 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:22.960
 you can buy a flashlight so that 's cool i 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.390
 cool reporter i have a blend on 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.390
 these to her in my looks very cool 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.960
 still in this camera there is a spotlight like me 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.730
 already talked about it more than once 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.010
 a button here a searchlight here 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.300
 take off like an infection removed from 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.100
 devices and from an external computer 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.580
 via hdmi and but now I'll show you how 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:56.950
 projection on 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:00.100
 so then there is a focus of course 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.770
 better to do it in the dark 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.620
 but now there is no other option therefore 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.680
 I show it as it is and can look 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:17.560
 what we finished 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:19.419
 here I am primping files take 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.520
 It looks like this on white 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:29.500
 ceiling so you can study here and here 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:33.330
 see interesting topic this 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.800
 close-up every hour and can be 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:40.120
 test this quality gives 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.630
 we are a body macro that is basically on 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.840
 distance now I will show you how much 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.410
 meters 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.470
 all visible in good quality labels here 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:54.870
 and we have so many meters 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:58.480
 the camera takes a really good picture 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:03.050
 in body macro mode and very very 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:05.340
 good quality good zoom 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.610
 in this camera is one interesting feature 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.470
 video camera time lapse function 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.210
 record fast motion duration 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.950
 about three seconds as a slow motion movie 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.110
 movement activity about 12 seconds 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.660
 notes you can not record sound 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.900
 image quality will be lower 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.660
 Now I want to compare writing down the same thing 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.450
 same action 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:33.480
 notable bags in this mode and in normal 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:36.140
 so try to slow it down during installation 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.550
 and then try to do 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.380
 automatically this function on camera 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.750
 let's see what is better if the meaning 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:46.200
 record without sound and with lower 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.330
 quality with this feature on camera or 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:53.150
 can be done by mounting more 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.150
 high-quality and interesting picture 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.590
 at 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.590
 as you saw the function on the camera did 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.479
 mounting options so you can make 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.509
 the conclusion is that if you want to shoot 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:17.879
 short quick movements of three seconds 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:19.740
 do it on camera and then you can 

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:21.360
 don't even mount on it yet 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.310
 I hope you were interested, or at least 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.219
 not boring this is my first review on 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:29.039
 technique it demand to try yourself in 

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:30.389
 this genre and just write your own 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:33.120
 thoughts on this are worth me 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:36.270
 continue to do reviews on what or can 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.520
 be not worth it or even salute the most 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.680
 would be better if you write what 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.840
 shoals of irregularity were in this review 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.460
 I'll consider them and going to do something 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.379
 Interesting also subscribe to 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.319
