 a town had a commitment and more things 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:20.070

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.330

 andreas nothing but in main craft the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.589
 truth is everything I liked a lot 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.530

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.850
 good shows is pretty fun as 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.860
 the guys who made this map see it 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.290
 there they will see their names that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.510
 download of integral and good was the 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.210
 reasons that motivated me why I said 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.720
 not bring them minecraft and well I said but 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.220
 what try of minecraft 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.380
 multiplayer or I said I 'm not going to grab 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.670
 a map of grana foto the truth I 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.310
 I was looking for the grand theft auto 5 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.170
 but I did not find it no more to find the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.549
 san andreas is the same no more than 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.070
 one again and another is the old man up 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.810
 I wanted to put on my dj skin but I said 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.820
 not as it is in fact what I most 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.340
 it's important to show them the map and I'm good 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.610
 you see it finished small drag not giving it 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.390
 giving things to the map and everything together 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.159

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.659
 about the day of the dead is well them 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.450
 I'm going to bring a special who had them 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.130
 said the special will be about the day 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.340
 of dead I start the question but what 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.970
 you're going to bring I do not know if a game of 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.759
 white 2 what I wanted to bring was something 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.340
 this is the ues lenderman or something like that but 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.709
 it is not so important the game but of 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.869
 what the important thing was in this 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.369
 video was I to them talk about 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.610
 supernatural things that have 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.649
 past or have passed or know that not only 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.479
 have been to me another thing I loved this 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.090
 map is that it has mysteries has of 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.130
 everything makes us a very well thought map 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.150
 even if they have their ships but that's more 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.720
 things elements 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.900
 it takes like loading the map and good 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.090
 what I wanted to say and look like yesterday 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.500
 can you upload my video and you always 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.750
 They know I take it more or less like in 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.549
 12 o'clock at night or around now 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.769
 here in Mexico I'm not referring to 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.090
 another work now Mexico City more or 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.000
 unless they leave, I do not think 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.939
 what is gmt six hours something like that I think 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.250
 is on world radio in case someone 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.750
 he wants to know my time more or less to 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.340
 that have been located not when it will be used 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.470
 more than anything what I wanted to tell you 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.750
 in compensation to that yesterday you can not 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.819
 upload videos today I'm going to upload double 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.650
 video and it's going to be again like at 12 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.690
 at night but now here in mexico 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.549
 good just happened to tell me what 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.750
 I wanted to tell them I was going to do as a 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.819
 something super so extra normal is that it's 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.370
 saying that I'm going to upload something like 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.129
 the supernatural things and all these 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.739
 because to me in a certain way it is not that 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.750
 be very attached to all this and everything but 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.060
 I would like to talk to you about that and good 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.650
 we will proceed that none of this I believe 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.450
 what would you tell them I do not know stories of 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.930
 terror anything that is going to be like that 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.180
 or some Mexican legend 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.549
 good is that as you know I do not know if 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.590
 in other countries here on day of the dead 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.010
 the first day of the dead are celebrated 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.140
 to the children and the other to the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.670
 adults then more the halloween are 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.549
 like three days of dead or three 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.139
 halloween is what you want to say these 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.969
 three days here Mexico the children ask 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.409
 sweet and others but well I'm not going 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:42.590
 to talk about traditions from here 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.090
 mexico better respect the special day 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.590
 of dead and there I will talk about 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.970
 several ribs like that of a few 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:53.019
 extra normal supernatural things 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.019
 supernatural there is that except 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.389
 to the ghost something like that taken from 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.310
 wave before it was more expensive what they 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.989
 I wanted to say sorry to me seriously for not 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.030
 have been able to upload videos yesterday is that no 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.650
 I could seriously and well I was here 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.019
 like click what destroys the map 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.719
 because I put it in this mode I think it's 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.329
 creative and put everything then I what 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:16.340
 happened was they get the map to see 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.729
 what buildings were textures and which ones were not 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.280
 the truth those who did this this 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.150
 map was raffled because tell me that 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.460
 I would make this map 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.199
 apart from those of large cars to those of 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.240
 big funds make them for money 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.210
 obviously because you are your source of 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.770
 income and everything but tell me a guy who 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.419
 is engaged is an easier 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.550
 you will win the satisfaction of 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.440
 have that map then it was for something that 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.810
 I would like that I like to bring it to 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.940
 channel I will not leave the link to 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.009
 download or things like that but add as 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.229
 something to leave the environment not because no 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.580
 they told me to jabbar and cheer de facto not 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.800
 I'm going to vary it a lot in fact 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.530
 while they'll upload something father 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.870
 it was an interest for some people 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.889
 but good at the time in the video and now 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.750
 more than not what I wanted to say 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.919
 some things are textures because it is 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.470
 the truth in most of these 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.539
 buildings of the great one missed a Chinese but 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.340
 a Chinese for a shit inside 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.710
 They were furnished and had circuits and 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.720
 they had everything was what I was seeing in 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.060
 some things I said nothing else in the house 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.720
 of the cinema and the house of this black guy 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.310

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.680
 questions and I'm racist because I do not know

 earn more if you're mother speaks no truth 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.919
 is that racist have come by the 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.750

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.569
 mysteries because they notice it in how 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.069
 some little eyes and you get in there and when you act 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.529
