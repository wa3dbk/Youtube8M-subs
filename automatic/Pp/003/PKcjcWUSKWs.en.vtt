00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.910
 hello and welcome to tutorial like 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.109
 my video editor a free 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:27.930
 Video editing program used and 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:36.719
 The video cuts the size of small power 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:39.360
 and so on when we are here then 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.559
 let's first push the video 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.239
 we want 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.140
 in this print media files here is so 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.809
 now just some video that gives you 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.250
 down here and here it could be 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.100
 you want to cut something to stop 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.340
 example here is how you have cut 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.799
 here's the clips and here was stock market 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.570
 stands and for example now we want 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.470
 cut it right here 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.220
 we press on this symbol and that 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.830
 video was cut in half 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.330
 and now we could, for example 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.640
 want to start cutting and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.280
 stop cropping here 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.130
 Let's go back to the symbol and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.909
 then here we have one here 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.400
 part of the video and that's what we mark 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:41.670
 we select and then we press 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.390
 remove and details away and is this 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.840
 video receive this part 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:52.579
 cut out and here could be 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.000
 example another video about 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:00.290
 about this than about the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.100
 put regional video and another one 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.530
 soundtrack for example here 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:11.770
 so if he be satisfied with that 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:17.610
 Of course, the result of the video knows in 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:21.310
 red text and and so and so on 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.959
 but I have not been there yet 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.650
 used so we go because synonymous 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:34.780
 export video then takes its little 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:38.610
 moment as the quality that wants it 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:44.500
 choose and then the maximum just like that 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:47.860
 and then a few minutes later 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.700
 how long the video is and we see 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.730
 us when it is ready 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.250
 Hello and am I where and how you see 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.310
 it just finished that 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.430
 video so now comes your message 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.580
 where the video was saved and we 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.250
 can they then open that he would be 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:15.040
 now our cut video and if 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.820
 it's the biggest before and the size after 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.500
 here 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.680
 I mean we have a bit now 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.730
 what cut away but I guess 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.680
 that I already do 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:30.010
 that is a clear difference 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:33.959
 between before and after so and so 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.959
