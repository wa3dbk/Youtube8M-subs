00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
it wrong so I'm gonna have to do it

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.620 
it wrong so I'm gonna have to do it
again<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.280> way<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.429> did<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.820> had<00:00:15.120> distortion

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
again and the way I did I had distortion

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.300 
again and the way I did I had distortion
one<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:16.020> very<00:00:16.170> hard<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.529> hear<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.220> I'm

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
one so it's very hard to hear so I'm

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
one so it's very hard to hear so I'm
going<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.490> do<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:17.760> one<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.970> little<00:00:18.119> bit

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
going to do this one a little bit

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.700 
going to do this one a little bit
clearer<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:18.810> maybe<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.199> understand<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
clearer so maybe you can understand a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.730 
clearer so maybe you can understand a
little<00:00:19.800> bit<00:00:19.920> better<00:00:20.330> alright<00:00:21.330> well<00:00:21.740> it's

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
little bit better alright well it's

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.650 
little bit better alright well it's
going<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.039> be<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.369> some<00:00:23.580> tuning<00:00:23.939> like<00:00:24.060> go<00:00:24.240> see

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
going to be in some tuning like go see

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.710 
going to be in some tuning like go see
or<00:00:25.640> drop<00:00:26.640> C<00:00:26.820> sharp<00:00:27.119> or<00:00:27.300> something<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.660> that

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
or drop C sharp or something like that

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.480

in standard tuning so you can understand

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.020 
in standard tuning so you can understand
the<00:00:31.439> positions<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.099> know<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.640> not<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:32.940> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the positions I know it's not going to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.370 
the positions I know it's not going to
