broad jump I'm going to show you guys
how<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.060> properly<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> broad<00:00:25.019> jump<00:00:25.260> and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
how to properly do the broad jump and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.870 
how to properly do the broad jump and
for<00:00:26.130> those<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.400> who<00:00:26.460> don't<00:00:26.640> play<00:00:26.730> football

don't stop watching this video because

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.009 
don't stop watching this video because
broad<00:00:29.039> jump<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.460> huge<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.570> need<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
broad jump is huge you need to have a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.659 
broad jump is huge you need to have a
strong<00:00:31.260> broad<00:00:31.529> jump<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.160> further<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.579> can

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
strong broad jump the further you can

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.880 
strong broad jump the further you can
jump<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.899> broad<00:00:34.110> jump<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.559> those<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.829> don't

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
jump so a broad jump for those you don't

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.520 
jump so a broad jump for those you don't
know<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.520> from<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> standstill<00:00:36.410> jumping<00:00:37.410> as

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
know it's from a standstill jumping as

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.410 
know it's from a standstill jumping as
far<00:00:37.770> as<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.250> horizontally<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.300> what

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
far as you can horizontally and what

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.270 
far as you can horizontally and what
that<00:00:39.540> does<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:40.020> measures<00:00:40.590> your<00:00:40.620> horizontal

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
that does it measures your horizontal

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.549 
that does it measures your horizontal
displacement<00:00:41.430> how<00:00:42.180> powerful<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
displacement how powerful you are so the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.500 
displacement how powerful you are so the
more<00:00:43.739> powerful<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.309> are<00:00:44.340> jumping<00:00:45.239> forward

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
more powerful you are jumping forward

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.240 
more powerful you are jumping forward
the<00:00:45.989> faster<00:00:46.350> you're<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> sprint<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the faster you're going to sprint the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.709 
the faster you're going to sprint the
higher<00:00:47.489> you're<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.910> jump<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.450> need

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
higher you're going to jump so you need

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.200 
higher you're going to jump so you need
to<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:49.020> strengthen<00:00:50.010> strengthen<00:00:50.700> muscles<00:00:50.820> in

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
to have strengthen strengthen muscles in

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
to have strengthen strengthen muscles in
order<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> do<00:00:51.840> these<00:00:51.930> exercises<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:53.100> I'm

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
order to do these exercises so what I'm

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.170 
order to do these exercises so what I'm
going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.460> I'm<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.699> first<00:00:53.850> show<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
going to do I'm going first show you the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.910 
going to do I'm going first show you the
technique<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.899> when<00:00:55.320> you're<00:00:55.440> testing<00:00:55.620> your

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
technique of it when you're testing your

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.189 
technique of it when you're testing your
broad<00:00:56.100> jump<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.539> I'm<00:00:57.660> putting<00:00:57.930> my<00:00:57.989> feet<00:00:58.140> in

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
broad jump so if I'm putting my feet in

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.869 
broad jump so if I'm putting my feet in
the<00:00:58.320> line<00:00:58.469> I'm<00:00:58.620> jumping<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.160> way<00:00:59.309> you

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the line I'm jumping out this way you

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.340 
the line I'm jumping out this way you
want<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> good<00:01:00.449> foundation<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:01.109> here

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
want to get a good foundation right here

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.729 
want to get a good foundation right here
the<00:01:01.739> key<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.850> go<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> fast<00:01:03.870> C<00:01:04.530> so

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the key is to go to have a fast C so

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.469 
the key is to go to have a fast C so
you're<00:01:05.040> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.189> decelerate<00:01:05.489> fast<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
you're going to decelerate fast so the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.289 
you're going to decelerate fast so the
eccentric<00:01:06.900> motion<00:01:07.260> down<00:01:07.920> fast<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.970> your

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
eccentric motion down fast and your

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.940 
eccentric motion down fast and your
hands<00:01:09.630> come<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:10.200> your<00:01:10.320> knee<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
hands come down with your knee so you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.609 
hands come down with your knee so you
start<00:01:11.159> with<00:01:11.189> your<00:01:11.340> hands<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.880> this

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
start with your hands up like this

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.690 
start with your hands up like this
decelerate<00:01:13.619> fast<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:14.400> you're<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.610> to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
decelerate fast and then you're going to

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.859 
decelerate fast and then you're going to
jump<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> faster<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.570> decelerate

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
jump the faster you can decelerate

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.480 
jump the faster you can decelerate
there's<00:01:16.530> been<00:01:16.650> studies<00:01:16.890> done<00:01:17.040> there's<00:01:17.340> been

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
there's been studies done there's been

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.100 
there's been studies done there's been
tests<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.030> guys<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.600> decelerate<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
tests the guys you can decelerate the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.810 
tests the guys you can decelerate the
fastest<00:01:19.530> downward<00:01:19.950> eccentrically

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
fastest downward eccentrically

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.249 
fastest downward eccentrically
are<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> ones<00:01:21.420> who<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.689> jump<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.900> furthest

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
are the ones who can jump the furthest

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.649 
are the ones who can jump the furthest
the<00:01:22.290> ones<00:01:22.560> who<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.280> consensually<00:01:24.060> move<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
the ones who can consensually move the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.370 
the ones who can consensually move the
best<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.159> come<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.549> hands<00:01:26.790> go<00:01:27.380> down

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
best so here to come here hands go down

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
best so here to come here hands go down
and<00:01:28.829> then<00:01:28.950> you've<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> genome<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.610> notice

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and then you've to the genome and notice

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.330 
and then you've to the genome and notice
how<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> swung<00:01:30.869> my<00:01:30.930> arms<00:01:31.350> back<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:32.250> of

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
how I swung my arms back to kind of

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.060 
how I swung my arms back to kind of
build<00:01:32.520> some<00:01:32.700> momentum<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.829> I'll<00:01:34.829> show<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
build some momentum so I'll show you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.280 
build some momentum so I'll show you
guys<00:01:35.250> another<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.210> here<00:01:36.450> oh<00:01:38.060> and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
guys another one so it's here oh and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.270 
guys another one so it's here oh and
then<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.320> jump<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.829> make<00:01:40.890> sure<00:01:41.040> when<00:01:41.189> you

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
then you jump and make sure when you

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.190 
then you jump and make sure when you
land<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.790> fall<00:01:42.150> forward<00:01:42.450> because<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.110> you're

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
land you fall forward because if you're

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
land you fall forward because if you're
ever<00:01:43.320> getting<00:01:43.470> tested<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.040> land<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.610> and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
ever getting tested I land like this and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.490 
ever getting tested I land like this and
I<00:01:45.090> touch<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.659> now<00:01:46.110> they're<00:01:46.290> going<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
I touch here now they're going to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.109 
I touch here now they're going to
measure<00:01:46.649> from<00:01:46.770> what<00:01:46.950> your<00:01:47.070> hand<00:01:47.250> touches<00:01:47.640> so

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
measure from what your hand touches so

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.609 
measure from what your hand touches so
if<00:01:48.210> you've<00:01:48.329> ever<00:01:48.420> had<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.600> combine<00:01:49.020> make<00:01:49.500> sure

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
if you've ever had a combine make sure

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.990 
if you've ever had a combine make sure
you're<00:01:49.799> always<00:01:49.920> landing<00:01:50.369> forward<00:01:50.640> now<00:01:50.759> an

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
you're always landing forward now an

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.600 
you're always landing forward now an
awesome<00:01:51.960> time<00:01:52.170> or<00:01:52.560> an<00:01:52.920> awesome<00:01:53.220> measurement

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
awesome time or an awesome measurement

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.760 
awesome time or an awesome measurement
for<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.880> depending<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:55.049> age<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.500> mean<00:01:55.680> if

for this depending on your age I mean if

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.800 
for this depending on your age I mean if
you're<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.040> NFL<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.240> over<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.509> ten

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
you're in the NFL you can get over a ten

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.780 
you're in the NFL you can get over a ten
that'd<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.560> pretty<00:01:58.710> good<00:01:58.979> some<00:01:59.310> guys<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.579> over

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that'd be pretty good some guys get over

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.030 
that'd be pretty good some guys get over
