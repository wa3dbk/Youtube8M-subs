00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.830 
is concerned then sony xperia z1 is
slightly<00:02:49.850> wider<00:02:50.330> than<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:51.220> iphone<00:02:52.220> 5s<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.209> z1

fifty eight point six millimeter so

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.330 
fifty eight point six millimeter so
roughly<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:06.110> can<00:03:06.319> say<00:03:06.920> there<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.310> a

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340

difference of six and a half millimeters
which<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.580> quite<00:03:11.150> substantial<00:03:11.450> considering

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
which is quite substantial considering

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.550 
which is quite substantial considering
this<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.980> width<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:14.840> difference<00:03:15.320> in

this is the width this difference in

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.069 
this is the width this difference in
height<00:03:15.829> and<00:03:16.040> width<00:03:16.519> translates<00:03:17.269> into<00:03:17.930> a

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
height and width translates into a

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.680 
height and width translates into a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.530 
difference is the bottom navigation bar
on<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.620> z1<00:03:43.069> otherwise<00:03:43.609> the<00:03:44.060> screen<00:03:44.510> looks

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
on the z1 otherwise the screen looks

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.509 
on the z1 otherwise the screen looks
pretty<00:03:45.440> similar<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:47.329> iphone<00:03:47.690> 5s<00:03:48.519> however

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
pretty similar to the iphone 5s however

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.840 
pretty similar to the iphone 5s however
in<00:03:49.790> reality<00:03:50.170> beside<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.470> home<00:03:51.709> screen<00:03:52.069> when

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
in reality beside the home screen when

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.819 
in reality beside the home screen when
you<00:03:52.970> are<00:03:53.090> in<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.269> apps<00:03:53.660> iphone<00:03:54.430> 5s<00:03:55.430> is<00:03:55.700> able<00:03:56.180> to

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
you are in the apps iphone 5s is able to

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.979 
you are in the apps iphone 5s is able to
fit<00:03:57.829> slightly<00:03:58.340> less<00:03:58.579> contents<00:03:59.239> as<00:03:59.420> compared

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
fit slightly less contents as compared

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.650 
fit slightly less contents as compared
to<00:04:00.049> z1<00:04:00.680> as<00:04:00.889> you<00:04:01.220> can<00:04:01.340> see<00:04:01.549> there<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:01.880> no<00:04:02.090> bottom

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
to z1 as you can see there is no bottom

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.340 
to z1 as you can see there is no bottom
bar<00:04:03.290> which<00:04:04.100> is<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.790> case<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.389> iphone<00:04:05.930> 5s

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
bar which is the case on the iphone 5s

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.309 
bar which is the case on the iphone 5s
so<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.579> is<00:04:07.609> able<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:08.000> show<00:04:08.269> more<00:04:08.600> contents<00:04:09.170> on

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
so it is able to show more contents on

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.530 
so it is able to show more contents on
twitter<00:04:09.950> as<00:04:10.190> well<00:04:10.220> which<00:04:10.730> was<00:04:10.970> supposed<00:04:11.389> to

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
twitter as well which was supposed to

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.129 
twitter as well which was supposed to
show<00:04:11.950> similar<00:04:12.950> sort<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.370> contents<00:04:14.139> that's

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
show similar sort of contents that's

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.250 
show similar sort of contents that's
because<00:04:15.530> of<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:15.889> designing<00:04:16.280> of<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.820> app

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
because of the designing of the app

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.379 
because of the designing of the app
there

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
there

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.539 
there
other<00:04:18.930> apps<00:04:19.259> which<00:04:19.499> actually<00:04:19.769> does<00:04:20.189> not<00:04:20.370> even

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
other apps which actually does not even

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.239 
other apps which actually does not even
have<00:04:20.699> the<00:04:20.879> bottom<00:04:21.389> navigation<00:04:21.539> bar<00:04:22.199> such<00:04:23.069> as

00:04:23.239 --> 00:04:23.249 
have the bottom navigation bar such as

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:26.600 
have the bottom navigation bar such as
the<00:04:23.430> photo<00:04:23.669> app<00:04:23.969> the<00:04:24.389> YouTube<00:04:25.139> app<00:04:25.349> the<00:04:26.099> movies
