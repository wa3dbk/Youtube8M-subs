00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
Rob we first launched this bike on the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.710 
Rob we first launched this bike on the
stereo<00:00:16.139> platform<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.000> 27.5<00:00:18.000> wheel<00:00:18.300> last

stereo platform with a 27.5 wheel last
year<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.260> think<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:19.949> were<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> first<00:00:20.400> brand<00:00:20.730> to

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
year I think we were the first brand to

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.880 
year I think we were the first brand to
bring<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> race<00:00:21.869> winning<00:00:22.170> bike<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.560> its<00:00:22.710> new

bring you a race winning bike in its new
wheel<00:00:23.130> size<00:00:23.420> also<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.449> think<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.840> were<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
wheel size also I think we were the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.800 
wheel size also I think we were the
first<00:00:25.109> brand<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.560> bring<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> 27-point<00:00:26.810> 560

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
first brand to bring you a 27-point 560

first brand to bring you a 27-point 560
more<00:00:27.960> bikers<00:00:28.260> sub<00:00:28.560> cent<00:00:28.830> kilos<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.849> really

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
more bikers sub cent kilos so it really

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.339 
more bikers sub cent kilos so it really
changed<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> environment<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.050> became<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
changed the environment and became a

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.470 
changed the environment and became a
benchmark<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:32.040> its<00:00:32.189> products<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:33.390> were

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
benchmark for its products we were

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
benchmark for its products we were
really<00:00:33.660> happy<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> only

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
really happy with this but the only

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.260 
really happy with this but the only
changes<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.070> wanted<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.430> make<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:35.969> realize

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
changes we wanted to make is we realize

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.420 
changes we wanted to make is we realize
that<00:00:36.300> carbon<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.140> not<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.440> everybody<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.370> we

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that carbon it's not for everybody so we

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.889 
that carbon it's not for everybody so we
wanted<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> introduce<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.239> bike<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
wanted to introduce the bike to the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.840 
wanted to introduce the bike to the
private<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.410> eraser<00:00:40.920> although<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.370> do<00:00:41.550> spec

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
private see eraser although we do spec

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.310 
private see eraser although we do spec
these<00:00:41.969> bikes<00:00:42.239> straight<00:00:42.660> through<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> pro

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
these bikes straight through to a pro

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.110 
these bikes straight through to a pro
level<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.950> now<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.250> these<00:00:44.370> bikes<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.820> alloy

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
level we now have these bikes in alloy

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.869 
level we now have these bikes in alloy
we<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.539> three<00:00:45.870> specs<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:47.129> main<00:00:47.340> change<00:00:47.700> is

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
we have three specs the main change is

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.910 
we have three specs the main change is
really<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> geometry<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.899> same<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.890> have

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
really the geometry is the same we have

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.529 
really the geometry is the same we have
a<00:00:50.039> slight<00:00:50.399> increase<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> head<00:00:51.149> tube<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
a slight increase in the head tube and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.360 
a slight increase in the head tube and
this<00:00:51.600> means<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.289> angle<00:00:52.649> adjust<00:00:52.949> headset

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
this means it's angle adjust headset

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.860 
this means it's angle adjust headset
