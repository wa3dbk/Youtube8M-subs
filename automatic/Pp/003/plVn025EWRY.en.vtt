00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
up with one of those problems we are

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.529 
up with one of those problems we are
still<00:04:42.009> number<00:04:42.340> one<00:04:42.610> in<00:04:42.639> America<00:04:42.820> let's<00:04:43.360> give

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
is first a fat problem what happens is

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.800 
is first a fat problem what happens is
all<00:05:07.599> kinds<00:05:08.199> of<00:05:08.259> fats<00:05:08.500> and<00:05:09.270> certainly<00:05:10.270> animal

and<00:05:29.979> you<00:05:30.430> end<00:05:30.580> up<00:05:30.699> with<00:05:30.880> pancreatic

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
and you end up with pancreatic

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.250 
and you end up with pancreatic
dysfunction<00:05:32.340> after<00:05:33.340> you<00:05:33.460> in<00:05:33.639> fact<00:05:33.909> have<00:05:34.260> the

dysfunction after you in fact have the
fat<00:05:35.500> problem<00:05:35.979> cause<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.430> diabetes<00:05:37.030> then

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
fat problem cause the diabetes then

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.719 
fat problem cause the diabetes then
every<00:05:38.260> time<00:05:38.470> you<00:05:38.620> look<00:05:38.770> at<00:05:38.860> any<00:05:39.010> form<00:05:39.340> of<00:05:39.460> sugar

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
every time you look at any form of sugar

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.439 
every time you look at any form of sugar
after<00:05:40.120> you<00:05:40.210> hit<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.169> red<00:05:41.349> button<00:05:42.210> your<00:05:43.210> blood

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
after you hit the red button your blood

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.689 
after you hit the red button your blood
sugar<00:05:43.750> goes<00:05:43.900> through<00:05:44.169> the<00:05:44.259> roof<00:05:44.409> and<00:05:44.650> it's<00:05:45.550> now

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
sugar goes through the roof and it's now

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.749 
sugar goes through the roof and it's now
a<00:05:45.729> fat<00:05:46.240> and<00:05:46.509> sugar<00:05:46.900> problem<00:05:47.340> that's<00:05:48.340> why<00:05:48.550> if

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
a fat and sugar problem that's why if

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.790 
a fat and sugar problem that's why if
you<00:05:48.909> look<00:05:49.090> at<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.389> groups<00:05:50.229> that<00:05:50.409> have<00:05:50.650> the

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
you look at the groups that have the

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.129 
you look at the groups that have the
highest<00:05:50.830> incidence<00:05:51.990> african-americans<00:05:52.990> is

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
highest incidence african-americans is

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.249 
highest incidence african-americans is
one<00:05:53.320> example<00:05:53.909> acidic<00:05:54.909> Jews<00:05:55.180> and<00:05:55.449> look<00:05:56.139> at

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259 
one example acidic Jews and look at

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.110 
one example acidic Jews and look at
their<00:05:56.409> diets<00:05:56.830> it<00:05:57.009> has<00:05:57.159> the<00:05:57.280> highest<00:05:57.430> amount<00:05:57.940> of

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
their diets it has the highest amount of

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.950 
their diets it has the highest amount of
animal<00:05:58.479> fat<00:05:58.659> in<00:05:58.840> it<00:05:58.960> they<00:05:59.590> by<00:05:59.830> far<00:06:00.190> by<00:06:00.550> far

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
animal fat in it they by far by far

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.510 
animal fat in it they by far by far
markedly<00:06:01.960> have<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:02.770> highest<00:06:02.949> amount<00:06:03.430> of

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
markedly have the highest amount of

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.640 
markedly have the highest amount of
diabetic<00:06:04.060> conditions<00:06:04.570> in<00:06:04.750> this<00:06:05.710> nation

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
diabetic conditions in this nation

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.360 
diabetic conditions in this nation
so<00:06:07.580> all<00:06:07.790> of<00:06:07.820> these<00:06:08.090> things<00:06:08.360> are<00:06:08.690> clearly

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
so all of these things are clearly

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.210 
so all of these things are clearly
scientifically<00:06:10.370> validated<00:06:11.120> and<00:06:11.449> any<00:06:12.290> serious
