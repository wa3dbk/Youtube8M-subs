00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 to 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.089
 to 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.320
 hello guys and girls that we removed in a 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.330
 new video today I'm going to solve a 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.300
 doubt that a friend of ours made us 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.759
 jesus perez through a comment on 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.130
 our YouTube channel and ask us 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.099
 what do you think of nitric oxide if it's worth 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.890
 sorry to take it or not mine responding to 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.770
 jesus and all of you nitric oxide 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.900
 is a 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.310
 it's not like people think it 's a 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.370
 supplement that we take directly 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.740
 as nitric oxide but normally 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.350
 what we take is a precursor of rust 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.620
 nitric since nitric oxide it 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.150
 they form the body is a molecule 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.820
 us to cause the body 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.910
 Generate more option and tricho what we take 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.790
 is arginine is an amino acid arginine 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.210
 which is a precursor we repeat oxide 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.280
 nitric oxide Nitric what what 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.710
 is going to produce in our body is to have 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.320
 mainly dilate the vessels 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.030
 blood and the positives with this is 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.320
 bring more blood to our muscles 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:17.320
 to get more congestion and what 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.180
 which produces greater intensity and 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.150
 reduce the fatigue of our 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.240
 training 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.360
 there are many people 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.479
 I have read many forums web pages 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.159
 talking to different people who 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.040
 they train and they dedicate themselves to this the world 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.070
 of fitness the bodybuilding because I talk to 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.170
 all these people and there are many people who 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.289
 defends and other people who do not defend 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.470
 this supplement when this predecessor 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.990
 rather nitric leisure / that 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.179
 when what an excess that can produce 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.299
 tests can produce serious problems 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.369
 health because it influences you can 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.670
 alter the nervous system since 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.250
 dilates blood vessels and for people 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.490
 who suffers from hypertension is not 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.569
 recommends for nothing so I'm a 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.970
 advice that I give you personally 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.920
 honestly I never took nitric oxide 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.350
 Davis did not take it either, so he was 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.440
 together of information about this 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.080
 to solve this question and the rust 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.550
 nitric 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.550
 I do not take it but 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.420
 the advice that I am is that if what is 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.260
 Take it with the correct measurements 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.680
 you never just pass those measurements all the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.810
 guidelines that if to take it and for example 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.880
 if you take it for two months in a row 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.640
 take a break for another two months 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.819
 so that the body rests because it is 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.200
 harmful take it for more during 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.930
 your take for long periods of 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.250
 time for health so I eat 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.890
 I say take it two months and rest others 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.140
 two months for the body to breathe 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.230
 say it in a different way that we 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.940
 I wanted to comment is what foods can we 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.100
 use them as oxide precursors 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.480
 nitric because those foods are like 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.180
 example the watermelon 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.519
 the watermelon is a fantastic is a 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.670
 fantastic food that will get 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.310
 these effects like arginine is a 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.470
 natural food so you can not 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.720
 take without any problems and you 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.019
 it's going to help a lot that the watermelon 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.110
 yes it shows, I say it from experience and 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.700
 also before the past 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.890
 we have made a video david has made a 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.020
 video about a milkshake 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.970
 this shake had the purpose of 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.130
 get maximum muscle congestion 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.950
 and one of the main clients that 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.250
 Take this smoothie is the beet so 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.230
 that I invite you to watch this video is 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.570
 a game that many people do not 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.420
 has commented that it has worked like this 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.730
 which is effective or I leave it at the end of this 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.890
 of this video the link and nothing I hope 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.420
 that you liked this video you know 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.060
 for any questions they will put in the 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.640
 comments put it in our networks 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.550
 social either facebook twitter what 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.620
 you want and if it's a question that we 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.290
 it seems very important very interesting 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.049
 we solve it like this and many 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.850
 more that we have solved and we will take it out 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.209
 I hope you feel video and nothing else a 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.209
 greeting
