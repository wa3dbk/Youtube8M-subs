this for my first vid but then this was
at<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> time<00:00:58.020> when<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> was<00:00:58.440> trying<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.980> set<00:00:59.190> a

restriction that inevitably failed my

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440 
restriction that inevitably failed my
thoughts<00:01:04.739> was<00:01:04.979> that's<00:01:05.159> why<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.400> used<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.119> think

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
thoughts was that's why I used to think

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.719 
thoughts was that's why I used to think
the<00:01:06.600> game<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:07.020> okay<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.710> might<00:01:08.100> not<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.460> held

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the game was okay it might not have held

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.390 
the game was okay it might not have held
up<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.240> well<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.900> I'd<00:01:10.560> probably<00:01:10.890> stick

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
up all that well and I'd probably stick

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.270 
up all that well and I'd probably stick
with<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:12.450> not<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> bad<00:01:13.110> FPS<00:01:13.650> at<00:01:13.860> all<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
with that it's not a bad FPS at all and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.550 
with that it's not a bad FPS at all and
it's<00:01:14.460> certainly<00:01:14.909> very<00:01:15.030> dark<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.900> Atmospheric

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
it's certainly very dark and Atmospheric

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.859 
it's certainly very dark and Atmospheric
for<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.830> time<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.759> has<00:01:17.970> been<00:01:18.180> superseded

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
for the time but it has been superseded

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.469 
for the time but it has been superseded

well this is designed to be played over
the<00:06:33.910> telephone<00:06:34.330> so<00:06:34.780> the<00:06:35.260> game<00:06:35.410> itself<00:06:35.800> is<00:06:36.010> just

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
the telephone so the game itself is just

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
a series of very simplistic QuickTime

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.650 
a series of very simplistic QuickTime
events<00:06:39.010> it<00:06:39.550> doesn't<00:06:39.970> really<00:06:40.120> work<00:06:40.360> with<00:06:40.600> a

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
events it doesn't really work with a

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.110 
events it doesn't really work with a
number<00:06:41.080> pad<00:06:41.230> or<00:06:41.470> a<00:06:41.500> joystick<00:06:42.100> the<00:06:42.940> game

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
number pad or a joystick the game

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.820 
number pad or a joystick the game
certainly<00:06:43.450> does<00:06:43.870> bring<00:06:44.140> back<00:06:44.170> some<00:06:44.590> memories

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
certainly does bring back some memories

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.220 
certainly does bring back some memories
though<00:06:45.250> I<00:06:45.490> wish<00:06:46.150> I'd<00:06:46.330> covered<00:06:46.660> lists<00:06:46.900> instead

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
though I wish I'd covered lists instead

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.890 
though I wish I'd covered lists instead
of<00:06:47.410> say<00:06:47.880> Highlander<00:06:48.880> I<00:06:49.180> mean<00:06:49.600> because<00:06:49.690> that

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
of say Highlander I mean because that

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.090 
of say Highlander I mean because that
was<00:06:50.020> shit<00:06:51.390> so<00:06:52.390> well<00:06:52.660> another<00:06:53.410> video<00:06:53.680> comes<00:06:54.010> to

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
was shit so well another video comes to

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.610 
was shit so well another video comes to
an<00:06:54.250> end<00:06:54.460> and<00:06:54.670> we<00:06:55.570> move<00:06:55.750> on<00:06:55.930> to<00:06:56.080> the<00:06:56.200> latter<00:06:56.380> wind

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
an end and we move on to the latter wind

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.240 
an end and we move on to the latter wind
which<00:06:56.920> will<00:06:57.160> feature<00:06:57.690> some<00:06:58.690> games<00:06:59.250> because

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.250 
which will feature some games because

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.130 
which will feature some games because
basically<00:07:00.580> it's<00:07:01.210> not<00:07:01.360> a<00:07:01.540> very<00:07:01.810> good<00:07:01.960> letter

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.140 
basically it's not a very good letter

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.320 
basically it's not a very good letter
it's<00:07:02.530> the<00:07:02.650> worst<00:07:02.920> so<00:07:03.250> far<00:07:03.280> and<00:07:03.760> most<00:07:04.060> of<00:07:04.240> the

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
it's the worst so far and most of the

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.170 
it's the worst so far and most of the
games<00:07:04.540> here<00:07:04.810> are<00:07:05.080> games<00:07:05.500> that<00:07:05.620> are<00:07:05.830> kind<00:07:06.760> of<00:07:06.940> at

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
games here are games that are kind of at

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.500 
games here are games that are kind of at
which<00:07:07.570> but<00:07:08.470> I<00:07:08.740> will<00:07:09.220> do<00:07:09.400> my<00:07:09.430> damnedest<00:07:10.120> to<00:07:10.240> make

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
which but I will do my damnedest to make

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.600 
which but I will do my damnedest to make
a<00:07:10.540> good<00:07:10.780> video<00:07:10.990> out<00:07:11.290> of<00:07:11.320> it<00:07:11.590> but<00:07:12.130> until<00:07:12.400> then

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
a good video out of it but until then
