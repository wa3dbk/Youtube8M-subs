00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.580
 Hello my dear, today we cook 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.680
 Again , there is a total today 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.809
 easy to make peasy 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.270
 Kohlrabi soup is quite whole 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.070
 quickly you have only ten minutes 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.360
 do not chop vegetables 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.640
 ten minutes probably a lot 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.470
 less and then just everything in front of you 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.460
 Cook and puree that 's it 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.190
 by and large 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.650
 Here are the ingredients you need 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.710
 kohlrabi four or five potatoes a 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.620
 until two onions forage broth pepper 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.140
 and salt possibly nutmeg if you can 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.690
 like and for the crowning conclusion 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.670
 a few bacon cubes and a bit of cream 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.940
 fraiche or herbs like parsley 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.120
 For example , I took that today 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.120
 so and first we start the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.140
 whole vegetables so kohlrabi in rough 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.239
 pieces to cut 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.950
 that really does not have to be accurate 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.649
 just in rough pieces 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.780
 cut and the potato of course 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.640
 even the onions are just quartered 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.399
 You really do not need a little more 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.799
 and then you just give 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:13.499
 everything completely does the whole in one 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.350
 bowl so that you in the same 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:18.240
 You can throw pot and there you see it 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.959
 also just very rough 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.959
 part 

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:25.170
 actually you could do that too 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.609
 potatoes kohlrabi soup call but 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.049
 I named it differently today 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.659
 if you did that, you take 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.459
 just a big soup pot and there 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.630
 the piece of butter and the whole 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.759
 vegetable in there 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.649
 the onions the potatoes 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.819
 Potatoes are there to the whole 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.950
 afterwards to bind off nicely 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.990
 you do not need an extra roux 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.209
 or something like that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.979
 Potatoes for you then everything once 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.139
 Season with salt and pepper if you like 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.779
 later want to give it to Beck 

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:56.549
 Please use a little more sparingly with the salt 

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:58.229
 the bacon is very very nice 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.060
 not that it sucks you afterwards 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.729
 salty then let the whole thing 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.759
 medium heat about five minutes 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.290
 sautÃ© until the butter is on the vegetables 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.540
 bit dreamed 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.310
 and then you take a son of liter 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.140
 Measured as I have this one , it fills three 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.350
 Quarter with water and then give 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.240
 two to three teaspoons of crowned broth 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.250
 There is in every supermarket 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.350
 You can also put the water in the first 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.140
 fill pot and then broth the teaspoons 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.400
 from the container with it to give that 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.630
 you can do as you want me 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.900
 have it already in a vessel 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.230
 dissolved and then you leave everything 25 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.880
 minutes with the lid slightly open 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.740
 so please do not simmer 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.050
 at the highest level but just up 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.510
 Medium heat that makes it nice and quiet 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.610
 simmer at this time can 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.350
 you do something different I have myself 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.450
 decided to go to the garden 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.760
 go and see what we are for spices 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.650
 and you already see mine 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.990
 spices I have a bit of parsley 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.450
 something chives and a bit 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.910
 Oregano is it I think so 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.560
 and now i'm shredding everything in the 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.080
 tupperware turbo boss turbo boss is it 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.730
 I think so exactly tory-chef videos 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.260
 I already have enough online who that 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.209
 I'm interested in this link 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.560
 again down in the infobox with it 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.030
 I get spices in now small 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.100
 snipped and I have no mess 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.670
 in the kitchen and my fingers stay 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.530
 quite as the 25 minutes are around 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.650
 you can actually puree right now 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.750
 pass over and at the same time represents the 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.810
 small breakdown with the bacon on the stove 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.580
 You do not have to give extra fed because 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.549
 the bacon itself has enough 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.890
 own fat to tan the beautiful 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.290
 you take her your blender and 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.030
 puree the whole through the consistency 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.440
 is up to you as you are 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.690
 you want it more or you can 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.150
 less puree I like it if still 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.160
 a few bits are in there and in 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.680
 in the meantime this bacon on 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.600
 Tanning takes only about five minutes 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.489
 You can see that, you'll see 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.970
 So it's really close to the end 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.100
 the cooking time then you are at the same time 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.049
 Finish with the soup and then give it 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.269
 just add your herbs in the sun 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.580
 Brian may taste again 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.500
 season with salt and pepper again 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.630
 depending on that bite you then well 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.340
 tastes good and then it is almost 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.169
 ready now you give yours 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.180
 herbs or with rows into the soup 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.070
 the whole thing tastes it again 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.430
 and then it is already very much 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.530
 we finished so the herbs do it 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.210
 I really have to say that give 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.760
 the whole thing again the right whistle 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.800
 please do not leave the herbs yourself 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.199
 if you do not have any in the garden, take it 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.850
 for 1 euro these iglo packs or the 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.949
 I think I'm good too 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.169
 and cheap so ne pack for 60 cents 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.790
 the travelers really out, I have too 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.350
 Previously always tried the herbs away too 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.479
 leave because I thought it does not work 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.520
 Do not take the herbs 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.130
 really sensational taste good in 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.950
 his soup that has a little fat does not saturate 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.169
 tastes good that is vegan now no 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.910
 idea because I know from properly could 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.430
