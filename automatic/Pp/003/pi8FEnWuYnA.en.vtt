00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.720 
I didn't see any mistakes with this it's
probably<00:02:39.660> because<00:02:40.020> it's<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.980> light<00:02:41.160> color<00:02:41.400> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
probably because it's a light color the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.790 
probably because it's a light color the
light<00:02:41.940> yellow<00:02:42.360> hides<00:02:42.810> most<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> mistakes

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
in black it might be walk it might be

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.590 
in black it might be walk it might be
