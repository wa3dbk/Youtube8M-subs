what your boys and lending them and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.599 
what your boys and lending them and
doing<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.359> and<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.920> course<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> next<00:02:05.460> day

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
doing here and of course the next day

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.660 
doing here and of course the next day
they<00:02:05.729> quit<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.999> LBMA<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.100> when<00:02:08.640> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
they quit the LBMA and then when I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.660 
they quit the LBMA and then when I
reflect<00:02:09.240> on<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:10.220> regulators<00:02:11.220> saying<00:02:11.489> that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
reflect on that regulators saying that

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.309 
reflect on that regulators saying that
okay<00:02:11.940> well<00:02:12.090> let's<00:02:12.269> look<00:02:12.510> at<00:02:12.659> what<00:02:12.720> happened

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
okay well let's look at what happened

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.660 
okay well let's look at what happened
last<00:02:13.470> year<00:02:13.620> first<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.099> all<00:02:14.159> if<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.430> think

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
last year first of all if you think

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.020 
last year first of all if you think
about<00:02:14.760> manipulation

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
about manipulation

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.540 
about manipulation
there's<00:02:16.180> only<00:02:16.240> one<00:02:16.570> reason<00:02:16.810> in<00:02:17.380> my<00:02:18.160> mind<00:02:18.430> that

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
there's only one reason in my mind that

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.940 
there's only one reason in my mind that
bankers<00:02:19.120> manipulate<00:02:19.960> things<00:02:20.200> they<00:02:20.800> don't

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
bankers manipulate things they don't

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.770 
bankers manipulate things they don't
manipulate<00:02:21.340> them<00:02:21.820> for<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.120> bank<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.630> make

money<00:02:23.020> they<00:02:23.650> manipulate<00:02:24.280> them<00:02:24.400> for<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
money they manipulate them for the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.630 
money they manipulate them for the
employees<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.270> make<00:02:25.570> bonuses<00:02:26.110> when<00:02:27.100> our<00:02:27.250> bonus

employees to make bonuses when our bonus
is<00:02:27.790> determined

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
is determined

they're determined June and December end
of<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.840> month<00:02:32.080> when<00:02:33.040> did<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.310> gold<00:02:33.520> price<00:02:33.850> hit

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
December and if you can accept that it

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.840 
December and if you can accept that it
was<00:02:42.670> manipulated<00:02:43.630> then<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.800> therefore<00:02:45.700> would

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
was manipulated then you therefore would

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.030 
was manipulated then you therefore would
come<00:02:46.000> as<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.180> clue<00:02:46.330> oh<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.770> it's<00:02:47.890> been

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
come as a clue oh and and it's been

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.400 
come as a clue oh and and it's been
discovered<00:02:48.810> then<00:02:49.810> maybe<00:02:50.050> they<00:02:50.230> won't

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
discovered then maybe they won't

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.760 
discovered then maybe they won't
manipulate<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:51.130> anymore<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:53.380> know<00:02:53.470> where

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
manipulate it anymore and you know where

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.020 
manipulate it anymore and you know where
can<00:02:53.920> we<00:02:54.070> go<00:02:54.280> from<00:02:54.520> here

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
can we go from here

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.150 
can we go from here
knowing<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.870> we<00:02:56.290> won't<00:02:56.500> have<00:02:56.650> these<00:02:56.770> kind<00:02:57.100> of

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
knowing that we won't have these kind of

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.460 
knowing that we won't have these kind of
repressive<00:02:57.790> forces<00:02:58.600> on<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.290> goal

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
repressive forces on the the goal

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.910 
repressive forces on the the goal
present<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.250> think<00:03:01.080> when<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.170> look<00:03:02.200> at<00:03:02.560> at

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
present so I think when you look at at

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.610 
present so I think when you look at at
what's<00:03:03.250> been<00:03:03.600> made<00:03:04.600> public<00:03:05.230> about

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
what's been made public about

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.229 
what's been made public about
manipulation<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.850> what<00:03:07.840> we<00:03:08.260> have<00:03:09.239> analyzed

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
manipulation and what we have analyzed

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.510 
manipulation and what we have analyzed
over<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.690> years<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.260> flows<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.980> physical

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
over the years the flows of physical

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.790 
over the years the flows of physical
metals<00:03:12.880> which<00:03:13.570> has<00:03:13.720> suggested<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.380> us<00:03:14.410> that

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
metals which has suggested to us that

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.010 
metals which has suggested to us that
there's<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:16.030> much<00:03:16.180> buying<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.630> physical

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
there's so much buying of physical

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.260 
there's so much buying of physical
metals<00:03:17.320> that<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:18.070> central<00:03:18.489> banks<00:03:18.730> must<00:03:19.030> be

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
metals that the central banks must be

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.229 
metals that the central banks must be
active<00:03:19.780> in<00:03:19.930> this<00:03:20.140> market<00:03:20.680> on<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:20.920> sell<00:03:21.160> side

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
active in this market on the sell side

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.090 
active in this market on the sell side
not<00:03:22.239> declaring<00:03:22.900> their<00:03:23.080> sales<00:03:23.380> because<00:03:23.950> I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
not declaring their sales because I

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.009 
not declaring their sales because I
honestly<00:03:24.519> think<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:24.910> demand<00:03:25.390> for<00:03:25.630> gold<00:03:25.750> is

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
honestly think that demand for gold is

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.699 
honestly think that demand for gold is
twice<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:27.280> annual<00:03:27.670> mine<00:03:28.030> supply<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.080> think

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
twice the annual mine supply so I think

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.289 
twice the annual mine supply so I think
we<00:03:29.980> have<00:03:30.070> lots<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.370> exciting<00:03:30.730> things<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.150> look

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
we have lots of exciting things to look

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.020 
we have lots of exciting things to look
forward<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.750> in<00:03:31.870> 14<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:32.680> think<00:03:33.220> we<00:03:33.670> could<00:03:33.820> see<00:03:34.000> a

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
forward to in 14 I think we could see a

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.020 
forward to in 14 I think we could see a
massive<00:03:34.830> run-up<00:03:35.830> in<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.040> price<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.250> silver<00:03:36.430> at

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
massive run-up in the price of silver at

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.820 
massive run-up in the price of silver at
price<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:37.480> silver<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.989> gold<00:03:38.170> both<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.680> new

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
price of silver and gold both to new

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.850 
price of silver and gold both to new
highs<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:40.209> course<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.630> impact<00:03:41.170> on<00:03:41.470> stocks

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
highs and of course the impact on stocks

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.600 
highs and of course the impact on stocks
would<00:03:42.130> be<00:03:42.690> incredibly<00:03:43.690> dramatic<00:03:44.430> Eric<00:03:45.430> as<00:03:45.579> a

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
would be incredibly dramatic Eric as a

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.670 
would be incredibly dramatic Eric as a
matter<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:46.030> record<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.450> sold<00:03:47.019> some<00:03:47.320> bullion

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
matter of record you sold some bullion

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.530 
matter of record you sold some bullion
recently<00:03:48.250> in<00:03:48.370> which<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.760> proceeds<00:03:49.239> have<00:03:49.420> been

is true can you explain that strategy is
it<00:03:54.370> time-sensitive<00:03:54.850> and<00:03:55.299> if<00:03:55.360> so<00:03:55.540> why<00:03:55.720> now<00:03:55.959> sure

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
it time-sensitive and if so why now sure

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.979 
it time-sensitive and if so why now sure
well<00:03:57.430> I've<00:03:57.940> always<00:03:58.299> believed<00:03:58.600> that<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.780> price

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
well I've always believed that the price

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.060 
well I've always believed that the price
was<00:03:59.200> manipulated

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
was manipulated

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.819 
was manipulated
we<00:04:00.700> know<00:04:00.910> that<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.269> producers<00:04:01.810> got<00:04:01.989> just

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
we know that the producers got just

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.390 
we know that the producers got just
massacred<00:04:03.790> in<00:04:04.410> 2013<00:04:05.410> as<00:04:05.590> they<00:04:05.739> were<00:04:05.860> also<00:04:06.190> weak

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
massacred in 2013 as they were also weak

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.050 
massacred in 2013 as they were also weak
in<00:04:06.549> 2012<00:04:07.170> they<00:04:08.170> got<00:04:08.380> down<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.650> probably<00:04:09.040> in<00:04:09.670> in

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
in 2012 they got down to probably in in

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.530 
in 2012 they got down to probably in in
some<00:04:10.390> cases<00:04:10.980> 10<00:04:11.980> cents<00:04:12.489> on<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.760> dollar<00:04:13.000> where

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
some cases 10 cents on the dollar where

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.080 
some cases 10 cents on the dollar where
they're<00:04:13.720> or<00:04:14.260> less<00:04:14.590> what<00:04:15.340> their<00:04:15.519> highs<00:04:15.760> were<00:04:16.060> in

they're or less what their highs were in

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.670 
they're or less what their highs were in
fact<00:04:16.359> I<00:04:16.479> think<00:04:16.540> I<00:04:16.750> bought<00:04:16.900> a<00:04:16.959> stock<00:04:17.200> at<00:04:17.410> 12

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
fact I think I bought a stock at 12

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.240 
fact I think I bought a stock at 12
cents<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.910> had<00:04:19.180> been<00:04:19.479> as<00:04:19.660> high<00:04:19.810> as<00:04:19.959> $5<00:04:20.890> when

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
cents that had been as high as $5 when

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.700 
cents that had been as high as $5 when
the<00:04:21.519> price<00:04:21.729> was<00:04:22.470> 1920<00:04:23.550> it's<00:04:24.550> a<00:04:24.640> producer<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.710> I

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
the price was 1920 it's a producer and I

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.290 
the price was 1920 it's a producer and I
have<00:04:26.800> a<00:04:26.890> simple<00:04:27.130> formula<00:04:27.580> if<00:04:27.849> the<00:04:27.970> price<00:04:28.150> of

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
have a simple formula if the price of

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.700 
have a simple formula if the price of
gold<00:04:28.419> goes<00:04:28.539> to

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
gold goes to

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.830 
gold goes to
and<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:30.460> average<00:04:30.610> gold<00:04:31.030> producer<00:04:31.450> probably

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
and the average gold producer probably

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.420 
and the average gold producer probably
has<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.020> cost<00:04:32.320> of<00:04:32.470> production<00:04:32.800> all<00:04:33.070> in<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.370> a

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
has a cost of production all in of a

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.600 
has a cost of production all in of a
thousand<00:04:34.000> so<00:04:34.930> you<00:04:34.990> take<00:04:35.410> his<00:04:35.590> production<00:04:36.220> in

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
thousand so you take his production in

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.790 
thousand so you take his production in
the<00:04:36.880> case<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.510> this<00:04:37.570> 12<00:04:37.840> cent<00:04:38.080> company<00:04:38.410> he<00:04:38.680> had

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
the case of this 12 cent company he had

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.260 
the case of this 12 cent company he had
about<00:04:39.010> eighty-five<00:04:39.430> thousand<00:04:39.880> ounces<00:04:40.000> of

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
about eighty-five thousand ounces of

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.940 
about eighty-five thousand ounces of
production<00:04:40.720> he<00:04:41.140> can<00:04:41.260> make<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.470> thousand

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
production he can make a thousand

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.710 
production he can make a thousand
dollars<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.370> now<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.520> be<00:04:42.790> making<00:04:43.090> 85<00:04:43.450> million

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
dollars and now to be making 85 million

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.890 
dollars and now to be making 85 million
dollars<00:04:44.260> and<00:04:44.590> I<00:04:45.460> think<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:45.910> market<00:04:46.270> cap<00:04:46.450> at<00:04:46.630> 12

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
dollars and I think the market cap at 12

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.450 
dollars and I think the market cap at 12
cents<00:04:47.140> was<00:04:47.320> something<00:04:47.680> like<00:04:47.830> 30<00:04:48.190> million

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
cents was something like 30 million

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.420 
cents was something like 30 million
dollars<00:04:48.940> well<00:04:49.750> if<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:49.960> can<00:04:50.140> make<00:04:50.350> pre-tax<00:04:50.920> 85

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
dollars well if you can make pre-tax 85

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.380 
dollars well if you can make pre-tax 85
million<00:04:52.950> 60<00:04:53.950> million<00:04:54.160> after<00:04:54.490> tax<00:04:54.910> and<00:04:55.240> you

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
million 60 million after tax and you

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.850 
million 60 million after tax and you
traded<00:04:55.750> 10<00:04:55.930> times<00:04:56.140> earnings<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:56.560> become<00:04:56.830> a

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
traded 10 times earnings you become a

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.560 
traded 10 times earnings you become a
six<00:04:57.250> hundred<00:04:57.430> million<00:04:57.940> dollar<00:04:58.150> market<00:04:58.540> cap

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
six hundred million dollar market cap

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.600 
six hundred million dollar market cap
company<00:04:59.110> that<00:04:59.500> was<00:04:59.620> trading<00:04:59.980> for<00:05:00.010> 30<00:05:00.340> million

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
company that was trading for 30 million

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.840 
company that was trading for 30 million
so<00:05:01.480> you<00:05:01.570> can<00:05:01.690> make<00:05:01.810> 20<00:05:02.050> times<00:05:02.380> your<00:05:02.650> money<00:05:02.860> on<00:05:03.790> a

so you can make 20 times your money on a
less<00:05:04.720> than<00:05:04.990> a<00:05:05.020> hundred<00:05:05.290> percent<00:05:05.380> move<00:05:05.770> in<00:05:05.890> the

less than a hundred percent move in the

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.830 
less than a hundred percent move in the
price<00:05:06.130> of<00:05:06.160> gold<00:05:06.400> so<00:05:06.790> that's<00:05:07.000> why<00:05:07.180> I<00:05:07.210> was<00:05:07.510> seller

first two years and of course how

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.460 
first two years and of course how

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
opportunities come and do come along

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.170 
opportunities come and do come along
when<00:05:50.860> you<00:05:50.950> can<00:05:51.190> imagine<00:05:51.400> well<00:05:51.700> this<00:05:51.880> could<00:05:52.030> go

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
when you can imagine well this could go

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.120 
when you can imagine well this could go
up<00:05:52.210> a<00:05:52.390> thousand<00:05:52.900> percent<00:05:53.050> or<00:05:53.380> two<00:05:53.590> thousand

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
up a thousand percent or two thousand

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.040 
up a thousand percent or two thousand
percent<00:05:54.370> because<00:05:54.610> you're<00:05:54.760> really<00:05:55.000> early<00:05:55.330> and

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
percent because you're really early and

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.080 
percent because you're really early and
it's<00:05:56.830> interesting<00:05:57.130> that<00:05:57.520> we<00:05:57.640> just<00:05:57.820> talked

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
it's interesting that we just talked

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.820 
it's interesting that we just talked
about<00:05:58.180> situations<00:05:58.540> where<00:05:59.110> I'm<00:05:59.200> imagining<00:05:59.500> a

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
about situations where I'm imagining a

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.660 
about situations where I'm imagining a
stock<00:06:00.130> and<00:06:00.370> go<00:06:00.520> up<00:06:00.610> to<00:06:00.760> thousand<00:06:01.270> percent<00:06:01.630> here

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
stock and go up to thousand percent here

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.770 
stock and go up to thousand percent here
and<00:06:03.670> that's<00:06:03.880> the<00:06:04.030> sort<00:06:04.300> of<00:06:04.360> thing<00:06:04.510> I'm<00:06:04.630> looking

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
and that's the sort of thing I'm looking

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.810 
and that's the sort of thing I'm looking
for<00:06:05.170> and<00:06:05.290> it's<00:06:05.440> it's<00:06:05.890> not<00:06:06.100> an<00:06:06.310> easy<00:06:06.460> path

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
for and it's it's not an easy path

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.030 
for and it's it's not an easy path
because<00:06:07.390> some<00:06:08.170> of<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.320> companies<00:06:08.680> don't<00:06:08.830> do

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
because some of the companies don't do

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.550 
because some of the companies don't do
as<00:06:09.190> well<00:06:09.370> as<00:06:09.490> you<00:06:09.610> expect<00:06:10.000> some<00:06:10.990> economic

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
as well as you expect some economic

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.410 
as well as you expect some economic
developments<00:06:12.130> come<00:06:12.280> along<00:06:12.580> that<00:06:12.820> affect<00:06:13.210> how

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.420 
developments come along that affect how

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.080 
developments come along that affect how
people<00:06:13.450> treated<00:06:14.200> in<00:06:14.260> the<00:06:14.350> stock<00:06:14.590> market<00:06:15.090> but

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
people treated in the stock market but

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.920 
people treated in the stock market but
when<00:06:16.240> it<00:06:16.360> winds<00:06:16.630> is<00:06:16.990> such<00:06:17.230> a<00:06:17.260> huge<00:06:17.680> payoff<00:06:17.980> that

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
when it winds is such a huge payoff that

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.830 
when it winds is such a huge payoff that
it's<00:06:19.930> not<00:06:20.170> that<00:06:20.500> difficult<00:06:20.800> to<00:06:21.630> increase<00:06:22.630> your

it's not that difficult to increase your

it's not that difficult to increase your
wealth<00:06:23.020> exponentially<00:06:23.950> and<00:06:24.160> I<00:06:24.430> think<00:06:24.640> maybe

wealth exponentially and I think maybe

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.060 
wealth exponentially and I think maybe
that's<00:06:25.090> the<00:06:25.750> reason<00:06:26.110> my<00:06:26.560> wealth<00:06:26.830> has

the financial system I don't want to put
words<00:06:52.930> in<00:06:53.320> everyone's<00:06:53.710> mouth<00:06:53.920> but<00:06:54.220> I<00:06:54.430> would

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
words in everyone's mouth but I would

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.450 
words in everyone's mouth but I would
generally<00:06:55.540> say<00:06:55.750> we<00:06:55.990> think<00:06:56.500> of<00:06:56.590> it<00:06:56.710> as<00:06:56.830> a<00:06:56.860> Ponzi

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
generally say we think of it as a Ponzi

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.490 
generally say we think of it as a Ponzi
scheme<00:06:57.790> or<00:06:58.060> as<00:06:58.240> a<00:06:58.270> Rick<00:06:58.780> rule<00:06:58.990> would<00:06:59.170> call<00:06:59.350> it

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
scheme or as a Rick rule would call it

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.400 
scheme or as a Rick rule would call it
counterfeiting<00:07:00.160> of<00:07:00.280> money<00:07:00.490> and<00:07:01.260> so<00:07:02.260> we're

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
counterfeiting of money and so we're

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.280 
counterfeiting of money and so we're
looking<00:07:02.530> for<00:07:02.890> ways<00:07:03.040> to<00:07:03.600> just<00:07:04.600> survive<00:07:04.930> that

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.290 
looking for ways to just survive that

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.950 
looking for ways to just survive that
situation<00:07:06.070> and<00:07:06.400> I<00:07:07.120> think<00:07:07.390> that's<00:07:07.600> what<00:07:07.780> we

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
situation and I think that's what we

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.930 
situation and I think that's what we
bring<00:07:08.140> to<00:07:08.410> clients<00:07:08.920> we're<00:07:09.430> willing<00:07:09.760> to

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
believe in ourselves and notwithstanding

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.700 
believe in ourselves and notwithstanding
for<00:07:12.400> example<00:07:12.820> the<00:07:13.030> huge<00:07:13.870> declines<00:07:14.380> that<00:07:14.500> we've

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:14.710 
for example the huge declines that we've

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.620 
for example the huge declines that we've
experienced<00:07:15.370> in<00:07:15.520> precious<00:07:16.000> metals<00:07:16.450> in<00:07:16.570> the

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 
the course because obviously we think

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.680 
the course because obviously we think
