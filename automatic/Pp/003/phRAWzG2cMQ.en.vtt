00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.538
I'd like to show you this Catfish Rig.

00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:05.128
We use a slip sinker and tie an open ended knot

00:00:05.128 --> 00:00:12.128
I like to use a surgeons knot to make loop

00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:13.318
We put that onto our snap swivel

00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:18.038
This will be for any type of bigger catfish

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:21.907
Handle almost any kind and bigger
catfish

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:28.768
Run that through the eye

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:35.768
Just slip it down on there

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:42.688
You have that part of the rig made

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:46.388
We have our snells all made up here

00:00:46.388 --> 00:00:53.388
We will attach it to that

00:00:57.037 --> 00:01:00.328
I call this the hot dog rig

00:01:00.328 --> 00:01:05.838
We have our tool that I
showed you how to make in another video

00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:09.588
Made from a coat hanger

00:01:09.588 --> 00:01:14.908
Run it through your hot dog

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:18.948
Leave them out a few days to scent

00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:23.578
we just take that Snell

00:01:23.578 --> 00:01:30.578
right into the knotch like so.

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:35.538
we can just drop that and pull the hotdog right
down through it

00:01:35.538 --> 00:01:41.938
pull hook right into it

00:01:41.938 --> 00:01:45.778
So it lays just like so.

00:01:45.778 --> 00:01:50.388
Take this loose from the tool

00:01:50.388 --> 00:01:54.298
Hook that into our

00:01:54.298 --> 00:01:58.478

00:01:58.478 --> 00:02:02.277
Snap swivel and close it off

00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:06.087
There we've got a

00:02:06.087 --> 00:02:10.338
Great hot dog Catfish Rig

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:13.558
They're not going to get that hot dog of
their

00:02:13.558 --> 00:02:20.208
Very easy and that lays down fairly
close to it when you set the #fishing hook

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:23.998
At issue is what's going to happen
here when you set the hook

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:27.537
That hook its gonna just pull all the
way through it

00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:31.757
Until it gets in the fish's mouth

00:02:31.757 --> 00:02:34.938
"almost got myself the finger there" "laughing"

00:02:34.938 --> 00:02:38.438
It is kind of a glancing blow so anyway

00:02:38.438 --> 00:02:41.817
That said it is a great catfish rig

00:02:41.817 --> 00:02:45.867
In Summary"

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:49.248
It makes a sliding sinker rig

00:02:49.248 --> 00:02:54.257
All you need is a one or two ounce sinker, a snap swivel and a good size hook.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:57.608
You will have a great season fishing

00:02:57.608 --> 00:03:02.018
That's what I recommend is you season these up for a few days

00:03:02.018 --> 00:03:05.748
Soak in salt and they'll be ready to go

00:03:05.748 --> 00:03:07.407
So "Good Luck"
