chapter I'm going to show you the back
of<00:00:13.059> the<00:00:13.210> ion<00:00:13.480> console<00:00:13.960> all<00:00:14.139> of<00:00:14.860> the<00:00:15.280> necessary

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
of the ion console all of the necessary

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.550 
of the ion console all of the necessary
connections<00:00:16.209> that<00:00:16.600> you<00:00:16.720> may<00:00:16.840> need<00:00:16.960> to<00:00:17.020> make<00:00:17.260> to

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
connections that you may need to make to

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.010 
connections that you may need to make to
get<00:00:18.039> the<00:00:18.369> ion<00:00:18.670> ready<00:00:18.940> to<00:00:19.270> start<00:00:19.510> working<00:00:19.720> and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
get the ion ready to start working and

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.630 
get the ion ready to start working and
once<00:00:20.710> you<00:00:20.830> do<00:00:20.949> that<00:00:21.070> you're<00:00:21.250> ready<00:00:21.340> to<00:00:21.520> go

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
once you do that you're ready to go

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.340 
once you do that you're ready to go
alright<00:00:22.359> so<00:00:22.420> let's<00:00:22.660> take<00:00:22.779> a<00:00:22.840> look<00:00:23.019> at<00:00:23.109> the<00:00:23.199> back

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
alright so let's take a look at the back

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.290 
alright so let's take a look at the back
of<00:00:23.529> the<00:00:23.619> ion<00:00:23.890> console<00:00:24.369> and<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.880> connections

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
of the ion console and the connections

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.460 
of the ion console and the connections
that<00:00:25.359> you<00:00:25.480> need<00:00:25.750> to<00:00:25.900> make<00:00:26.109> are<00:00:26.289> kind<00:00:26.439> of

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
that you need to make are kind of

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.529 
that you need to make are kind of
arranged<00:00:27.010> in<00:00:27.220> groups<00:00:27.250> all<00:00:28.090> the<00:00:28.150> way<00:00:28.300> to<00:00:28.359> the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
arranged in groups all the way to the

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.040 
arranged in groups all the way to the
right<00:00:28.779> these<00:00:29.740> connectors<00:00:30.250> are<00:00:30.580> mostly<00:00:31.510> your

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
right these connectors are mostly your

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.410 
right these connectors are mostly your
data<00:00:32.320> connection<00:00:32.770> so<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:33.370> all-important<00:00:34.000> DMX

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
data connection so the all-important DMX

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.120 
data connection so the all-important DMX
connections<00:00:34.899> are<00:00:35.020> right<00:00:35.170> here<00:00:35.440> there<00:00:35.829> are<00:00:35.950> two

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
connections are right here there are two

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.200 
connections are right here there are two
ports<00:00:36.430> of<00:00:36.640> DMX

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
ports of DMX

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.450 
ports of DMX
on<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.570> ion<00:00:37.840> console<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:38.559> typically<00:00:38.920> your

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
on the ion console and typically your

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.920 
on the ion console and typically your
first<00:00:39.790> port<00:00:40.090> is<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.210> one<00:00:40.390> that<00:00:40.480> you'll<00:00:40.629> use

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
first port is the one that you'll use

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.240 
first port is the one that you'll use
and<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:43.149> DMX<00:00:43.540> cable<00:00:43.989> is<00:00:44.170> one<00:00:44.200> of<00:00:44.620> these<00:00:44.710> five

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
and the DMX cable is one of these five

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.950 
and the DMX cable is one of these five
pin<00:00:45.489> XLR<00:00:45.640> connectors<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.539> they<00:00:46.600> just<00:00:46.750> snap

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
pin XLR connectors and they just snap

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.680 
pin XLR connectors and they just snap
right<00:00:47.200> in<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:49.239> so<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:52.090> next<00:00:52.270> thing<00:00:52.449> you<00:00:52.539> want

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
right in like so the next thing you want

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.420 
right in like so the next thing you want
to<00:00:52.780> plug<00:00:53.020> in<00:00:53.230> is<00:00:53.379> right<00:00:53.739> next<00:00:53.890> to<00:00:54.070> that<00:00:54.129> and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
to plug in is right next to that and

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.760 
to plug in is right next to that and
depending<00:00:54.850> on<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.329> manufacturer<00:00:56.020> date<00:00:56.230> of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
depending on the manufacturer date of

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.470 
depending on the manufacturer date of
your<00:00:57.100> ion<00:00:57.340> console<00:00:57.789> you'll<00:00:57.969> either<00:00:58.120> see<00:00:58.239> a

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
your ion console you'll either see a

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.130 
your ion console you'll either see a
video<00:00:59.320> display<00:00:59.649> that's<00:01:00.489> labeled<00:01:00.879> dual<00:01:01.140> DVI

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
video display that's labeled dual DVI

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.900 
video display that's labeled dual DVI
display<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:02.829> your<00:01:02.890> ion<00:01:03.160> console<00:01:03.579> would<00:01:03.670> come

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
display and your ion console would come

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.870 
display and your ion console would come
with<00:01:04.119> a<00:01:04.770> splitter<00:01:05.770> like<00:01:05.979> this<00:01:06.189> and<00:01:06.430> you<00:01:06.490> plug

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
with a splitter like this and you plug

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.240 
with a splitter like this and you plug
the<00:01:07.030> splitter<00:01:07.330> into<00:01:07.869> that<00:01:08.500> connector<00:01:08.890> tighten

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
the splitter into that connector tighten

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.560 
the splitter into that connector tighten
down<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.520> screws<00:01:09.850> now<00:01:10.060> it's<00:01:10.180> important<00:01:10.540> that

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
down the screws now it's important that

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.200 
down the screws now it's important that
once<00:01:10.840> you<00:01:11.049> put<00:01:11.290> this<00:01:11.830> splitter<00:01:12.100> in<00:01:12.340> go<00:01:13.119> ahead

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
once you put this splitter in go ahead

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.820 
once you put this splitter in go ahead
and<00:01:13.299> leave<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:13.630> plugged<00:01:14.170> in<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.530> tighten

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
and leave that plugged in and tighten

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.649 
and leave that plugged in and tighten
down<00:01:14.860> these<00:01:15.700> are<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:16.030> connections<00:01:16.270> that<00:01:16.540> you

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
down these are the connections that you

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.710 
down these are the connections that you
can<00:01:16.750> make<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:17.560> your<00:01:18.070> two<00:01:18.310> monitors<00:01:18.729> or<00:01:19.060> your

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
can make to your two monitors or your

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.249 
can make to your two monitors or your
ion<00:01:20.020> console<00:01:20.590> may<00:01:21.280> actually<00:01:21.490> have<00:01:21.850> two<00:01:22.240> of<00:01:22.509> the

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
ion console may actually have two of the

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.200 
ion console may actually have two of the
individual<00:01:23.799> smaller<00:01:24.159> DVI<00:01:24.549> connectors<00:01:25.060> and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
individual smaller DVI connectors and

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.340 
individual smaller DVI connectors and
you<00:01:25.270> don't<00:01:25.479> need<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.720> splitter<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.049> just

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
you don't need the splitter you just

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.090 
you don't need the splitter you just
plug<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.770> monitor<00:01:27.490> into<00:01:27.729> each<00:01:27.880> one<00:01:29.100> moving

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
plug a monitor into each one moving

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.819 
plug a monitor into each one moving
further<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.549> right<00:01:30.729> we<00:01:31.079> will<00:01:32.079> see<00:01:32.350> an<00:01:32.530> area

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
further to the right we will see an area

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.170 
further to the right we will see an area
where<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.040> can<00:01:33.159> connect<00:01:33.490> peripherals<00:01:34.090> to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
where you can connect peripherals to

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.580 
where you can connect peripherals to
your<00:01:34.390> console<00:01:34.780> so<00:01:34.900> this<00:01:35.049> is<00:01:35.200> where<00:01:35.380> you<00:01:35.500> would

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
your console so this is where you would

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.640 
your console so this is where you would
plug<00:01:35.799> in<00:01:36.009> things<00:01:36.520> like<00:01:36.670> your<00:01:36.820> mouse<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:38.079> it's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
plug in things like your mouse and it's

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.380 
plug in things like your mouse and it's
