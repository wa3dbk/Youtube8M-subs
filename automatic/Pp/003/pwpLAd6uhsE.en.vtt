00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.140 

that's<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.689> difference<00:00:23.779> our<00:00:24.779> real<00:00:25.140> spiritual

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
that's the difference our real spiritual

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
vision knowledge must include an ideal

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.430 
vision knowledge must include an ideal
and<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:36.360> ideal<00:00:37.020> must<00:00:37.620> benefit<00:00:38.250> man<00:00:39.440> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
and that ideal must benefit man and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.280 
and that ideal must benefit man and
that's<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.100> difference<00:00:42.020> between<00:00:43.020> the

all of European thought explores this

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.689 
all of European thought explores this
idea<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.149> knowledge<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.899> power<00:00:55.699> therefore

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
idea that knowledge is power therefore

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.500 
idea that knowledge is power therefore
I'm<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.930> introduce<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.500> an<00:00:58.800> idea

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
I'm going to introduce you to an idea

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.920 
I'm going to introduce you to an idea
the<00:01:00.510> idea<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:01.289> art<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:03.140> a<00:01:04.140> knowledge<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
the idea of art as a knowledge that

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.210 
the idea of art as a knowledge that
presupposes<00:01:06.930> an<00:01:07.710> ideal<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:10.040> ideal<00:01:11.040> in

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
presupposes an ideal and that ideal in

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.630 
presupposes an ideal and that ideal in
every<00:01:11.460> case<00:01:11.729> must<00:01:12.150> benefit<00:01:12.570> man<00:01:13.369> every<00:01:14.369> time<00:01:14.400> I

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
every case must benefit man every time I

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.550 
every case must benefit man every time I
use<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.119> word<00:01:15.299> art<00:01:17.060> it's<00:01:18.060> best<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.840> ignore

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
use the word art it's best if you ignore

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.789 
use the word art it's best if you ignore
all<00:01:19.979> modern<00:01:20.729> references<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.810> art<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:24.619> take<00:01:25.619> it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
all modern references to art and take it

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.999 
all modern references to art and take it
in<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.009> new<00:01:26.040> way<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:28.049> Greek<00:01:28.290> word<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.740> tech

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
in a new way the Greek word is tech

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.640 
in a new way the Greek word is tech
knighted<00:01:30.740> now

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.160 

we're<00:01:35.550> now<00:01:35.760> going<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.360> understand<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> idea

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
we're now going to understand the idea

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.030 
we're now going to understand the idea
of<00:01:37.680> art<00:01:37.980> in<00:01:38.280> an<00:01:38.460> entirely<00:01:39.200> Greek<00:01:40.200> Hellenic<00:01:40.860> way

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
of art in an entirely Greek Hellenic way

and that's where we're going so let's
start<00:01:49.340> first<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.670> want<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.120> talk<00:01:51.360> about

start first I want to talk about

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.030 
start first I want to talk about
different<00:01:52.710> systems<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.620> the<00:01:55.620> people<00:01:55.770> who

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
different systems and the people who

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.660 
different systems and the people who
represent<00:01:56.700> them<00:01:58.190> so<00:01:59.190> I'm<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.460> talk

through<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:23.160> should<00:02:23.400> be<00:02:23.430> able<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.820> see

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
through this you should be able to see

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.670 
through this you should be able to see
why<00:02:24.570> some<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.200> these<00:02:25.500> must<00:02:26.130> be<00:02:26.280> excluded<00:02:27.680> must

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
why some of these must be excluded must

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.460 
why some of these must be excluded must
be<00:02:28.890> excluded<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.700> why<00:02:30.300> some<00:02:30.810> must<00:02:31.260> obviously

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
be excluded and why some must obviously

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.680 
be excluded and why some must obviously
be<00:02:31.920> included<00:02:33.650> because<00:02:34.970> they're<00:02:35.970> -<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.270> didn't

be included because they're - I didn't
put<00:02:36.870> here<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.430> that's<00:02:38.430> going<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:38.910> the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060

evening's<00:02:39.480> discussion<00:02:40.340> all<00:02:41.340> right<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:41.640> there

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
evening's discussion all right so there

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.330 
evening's discussion all right so there
-<00:02:41.910> missing<00:02:42.470> we<00:02:43.470> should<00:02:43.680> see<00:02:43.920> whether<00:02:44.130> or<00:02:44.280> not

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
- missing we should see whether or not

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.650 
- missing we should see whether or not
we<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.850> get<00:02:45.000> them<00:02:45.239> in<00:02:45.420> there<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:48.150> again<00:02:48.420> what

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
we can get them in there so again what

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.780 
we can get them in there so again what
are<00:02:48.720> we<00:02:48.810> doing<00:02:49.070> we're<00:02:50.070> going<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.430> look<00:02:50.580> at

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
are we doing we're going to look at

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.210 
are we doing we're going to look at
knowledge<00:02:51.420> as<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.900> particularly<00:02:52.770> interesting

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
knowledge as a particularly interesting

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.750 
knowledge as a particularly interesting
system<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.440> system<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.650> presupposes<00:02:56.190> an

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
system a system that presupposes an

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.530 
system a system that presupposes an
ideal<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.650> ideal<00:02:58.650> benefits<00:02:59.310> man<00:02:59.550> I'm

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
ideal and that ideal benefits man I'm

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.080 
ideal and that ideal benefits man I'm
looking<00:03:01.080> at<00:03:01.170> these<00:03:01.290> different<00:03:01.739> systems<00:03:02.090> and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
looking at these different systems and

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.199 
looking at these different systems and
therefore<00:03:03.420> what<00:03:03.570> we<00:03:03.690> need<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.050> model<00:03:04.500> that

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
therefore what we need is a model that

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.400 
therefore what we need is a model that
model<00:03:06.209> therefore<00:03:06.420> we're<00:03:06.810> going<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.140> then

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
model therefore we're going to then

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.290 
model therefore we're going to then
apply<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.770> all<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.400> these<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.000> we're<00:03:09.150> going<00:03:09.270> to

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
apply to all of these and we're going to

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.430 
apply to all of these and we're going to
look<00:03:09.450> for<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.780> missing<00:03:09.930> -<00:03:11.660> now<00:03:12.660> as<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.290> know

now everything I say about this figure
should<00:03:27.060> equally<00:03:27.660> be<00:03:27.810> applied<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.470> all<00:03:28.650> of

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
should equally be applied to all of

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.360 
should equally be applied to all of
these<00:03:29.239> up<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.540> certain<00:03:30.900> point<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.650> then

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
these up to a certain point and then

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.040 
these up to a certain point and then
there's<00:03:32.640> going<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.940> be<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.120> difference<00:03:33.660> and

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
there's going to be a difference and

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.220 
there's going to be a difference and
that<00:03:34.080> difference<00:03:34.200> is<00:03:34.800> going<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.100> be<00:03:35.190> art<00:03:35.810> so

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
that difference is going to be art so

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.690 
that difference is going to be art so
surely<00:03:40.540> oh<00:03:41.540> sure<00:03:42.260> yes

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700
