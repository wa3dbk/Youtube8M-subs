you<00:00:23.160> guys<00:00:23.250> today<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.789> key<00:00:24.779> locks<00:00:26.539> now<00:00:27.539> what

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
you guys today is key locks now what

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.320 
you guys today is key locks now what
this<00:00:28.080> does<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.939> type<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
this does is you have to type in the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.720 
this does is you have to type in the
right<00:00:30.510> key<00:00:30.779> code<00:00:31.050> into<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> chess<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> door

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
right key code into a chess for the door

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.440 
right key code into a chess for the door
to<00:00:32.759> open<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.870> let's<00:00:34.200> say<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.710> this

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
to open so let's say I do it like this

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.959 
to open so let's say I do it like this
she's<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.660> key<00:00:36.960> code<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.350> i<00:00:37.380> put<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
she's the key code that i put and the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.900 
she's the key code that i put and the
door<00:00:39.180> opens<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.680> that's<00:00:40.980> really<00:00:41.280> cool<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
door opens so that's really cool and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
door opens so that's really cool and
everything<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.230> i<00:00:43.290> want<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.469> close<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.800> i

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
everything and if i want to close it i

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.319 
everything and if i want to close it i
guess<00:00:44.100> i'll<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.370> take<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.760> stuff<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:45.300> of

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
guess i'll just take this stuff out of

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.459 
guess i'll just take this stuff out of
the<00:00:45.450> chest<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:48.000> um<00:00:48.480> what's<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.200> here

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the chest so um what's going on here

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.260 
the chest so um what's going on here
really<00:00:50.370> quick<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.850> how<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.000> set<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
really quick this is how you set the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.020 
really quick this is how you set the
lock<00:00:51.449> over<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:53.789> i<00:00:53.850> said

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
lock over here so you know if i said

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.869 
lock over here so you know if i said
this<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.239> empty<00:00:54.980> all<00:00:55.980> guys<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.460> open<00:00:56.699> up<00:00:56.760> again

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
this to empty all guys can open up again

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.900 
this to empty all guys can open up again
because<00:00:57.030> they're<00:00:57.270> both<00:00:57.390> empty<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:58.559> here<00:00:59.460> let

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
because they're both empty but here let

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.240 
because they're both empty but here let
me<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.180> set<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> basic<00:01:00.780> 3<00:01:01.289> code<00:01:01.620> lock<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.129> come

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
me just set a basic 3 code lock and come

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.920 
me just set a basic 3 code lock and come
back<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:02.550> show<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.660> set

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
back out here show you that you can set

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.810 
back out here show you that you can set
any<00:01:04.080> kind<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.680> code<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.949> want<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.280> any<00:01:05.610> kind

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
any kind of code you want with any kind

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.080 
any kind of code you want with any kind
of<00:01:05.939> blocks<00:01:06.180> even<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.229> custom<00:01:07.590> name<00:01:07.740> blocks

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
of blocks even like custom name blocks

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.690 
of blocks even like custom name blocks
so<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.810> open<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.619> what's<00:01:11.490> going

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
so as you see it's open so what's going

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.429 
so as you see it's open so what's going
on<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> tiny<00:01:13.140> bit<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
on this is it just the tiny bit of

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.280 
on this is it just the tiny bit of
redstone<00:01:13.909> so<00:01:14.909> all<00:01:15.210> that's<00:01:15.570> really<00:01:15.720> doing<00:01:16.110> is

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
redstone so all that's really doing is

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.810 
redstone so all that's really doing is
just<00:01:16.320> using<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> new<00:01:17.070> test<00:01:17.340> four<00:01:17.549> blocks

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
just using the new test four blocks

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.120 
just using the new test four blocks
command<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:19.049> evolved<00:01:19.290> into<00:01:19.530> game<00:01:19.680> mode<00:01:19.710> one

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
command so evolved into game mode one

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.010 
command so evolved into game mode one
year<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.430> quick<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:21.900> just

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
year really quick you see it's just

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.920 
year really quick you see it's just
testing<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> block<00:01:22.850> at<00:01:23.850> location<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
testing for the block at location of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.370 
testing for the block at location of
here<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.520> that's<00:01:26.729> why<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.030> says<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:28.080> command

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
here so that's why it says that command

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.240 
here so that's why it says that command
twice<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.400> block<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.140> there

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
twice so just that one block and there

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.490 
twice so just that one block and there
so<00:01:32.250> as<00:01:32.490> soon<00:01:32.640> as<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:33.060> are<00:01:33.180> identical<00:01:33.780> it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
so as soon as they are identical it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.350 
so as soon as they are identical it
turns<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.100> now<00:01:35.610> what<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.880> does<00:01:35.970> when<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> turns

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
turns on now what it does when it turns

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.440 
turns on now what it does when it turns
on<00:01:36.740> activates<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.890> redstone<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.490> sets<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
on activates this redstone and sets the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.850 
on activates this redstone and sets the
block<00:01:39.630> underneath<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.200> door<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> redstone

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
block underneath the door to a redstone

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.010 
block underneath the door to a redstone
torch<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.540> don't<00:01:42.659> want<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.840> turns

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
torch and then you don't want it turns

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.490 
torch and then you don't want it turns
off<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.740> activates<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.869> torch<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.110> set<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
off it activates the torch and set the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.990 
off it activates the torch and set the
block<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.920> air<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.560> yeah<00:01:49.560> basically<00:01:49.979> set<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
block to air so yeah basically set the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.240 
block to air so yeah basically set the
lock<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.180> whatever<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.570> want<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.290> can

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
lock to whatever you want and you can

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.149 
lock to whatever you want and you can
kind<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.670> set<00:01:53.850> locks<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.210> your<00:01:54.240> doors<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.990> not

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
kind of set locks on your doors it's not

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.800 
kind of set locks on your doors it's not
not<00:01:56.159> entirely<00:01:56.490> survival<00:01:57.299> friendly<00:01:57.630> at<00:01:57.719> all

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
not entirely survival friendly at all

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.170 
not entirely survival friendly at all
but<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.490> just<00:01:59.490> don't<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.820> it's<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.030> really

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
but I just don't think it's a really

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.319 
but I just don't think it's a really
cool<00:02:00.360> concept<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.530> yeah<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
cool concept so yeah this is in the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.620 
cool concept so yeah this is in the
newest<00:02:03.659> minecraft<00:02:04.170> snapshot<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.710> TW<00:02:05.159> 0<00:02:05.219> 7<00:02:05.640> so

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
newest minecraft snapshot for TW 0 7 so

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.119 
newest minecraft snapshot for TW 0 7 so
yeah<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.020> doesn't<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.469> work<00:02:07.680> with<00:02:07.860> grass

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
yeah this doesn't just work with grass

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.919 
yeah this doesn't just work with grass
this<00:02:08.340> works<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:08.819> like

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
this works with like

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.130 
this works with like

the right places Flynn steals like that

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.780 
the right places Flynn steals like that
I<00:02:37.319> believe<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.099> was<00:02:38.189> a<00:02:38.250> wooden<00:02:38.519> pick<00:02:38.639> in<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
I believe it was a wooden pick in the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.379 
I believe it was a wooden pick in the
middle<00:02:39.769> was<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.069> doesn't<00:02:42.060> look<00:02:42.150> like<00:02:42.209> I

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
middle was that it doesn't look like I

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.479 
middle was that it doesn't look like I
got<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.659> quite<00:02:42.780> right<00:02:43.099> okay<00:02:44.099> wouldn't<00:02:44.370> pick

know you can do this with items that are

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.690 
know you can do this with items that are
renamed<00:02:55.139> to<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.829> player<00:02:56.040> has<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.549> the
