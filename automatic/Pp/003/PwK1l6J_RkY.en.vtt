00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.350
 time account good evening booths it 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.330
 there will be a video answer on the topic of the knife I am to hi-fi 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.940
 I hope you do not think . 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.039
 knife era i so really looked at 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.699
 his knife collection came to one 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.080
 the simple conclusion is that 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.830
 Dara there are many good knives 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.609
 valid but not going to pull the cat 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.609
 for eggs to 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.480
 for me, the era knife is 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.620
 Victorianx 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.960
 quiz in all its manifestations this 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.270
 really brilliant thing believe me 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.079
 I think it is a miracle flexibly believe me 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.360
 you know yourself yes well, I would like to say about 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.850
 knife era on the example of his knife as it were 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.110
 I have only one 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.739
 Victorianx 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.989
 for the simple reason that it covers 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:05.150
 all possible and impossible my desires 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:08.610
 here in a nutshell, take a quick look 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.850
 these blades themselves up to blades to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.880
 I will not cut it to tell why the flour 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.820
 knives here are pliers 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.220
 as stated in some review they 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.259
 remember not pliers then big tweezers well 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.030
 how to say maybe yes of course 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.320
 power work of this to carry out 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.020
 completely unrealistic nonetheless here 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.270
 all i'm going to say now is every element we 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.720
 same with you consider yes it is every 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.939
 element 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.740
 was used was used in real 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.159
 life's not like i'm there with a finger 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.079
 I suck the thing used 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.659
 wonderful pasta they are used on 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:50.060
 fishing in order to hooks 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.750
 turn in when you do jack wiring 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.899
 that is, silicone nozzle and yes 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.240
 jig head 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.939
 you drive along the bottom of one of us forgive not 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.360
 like a pool sometimes cling to snags 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.420
 you have to pull it there by force 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.650
 fishing line holds the hook unbent here 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.320
 my bend 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.340
 window saw was used too 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.710
 great here are scissors i'm not again 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.280
 I unfortunately can not say well authors 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.800
 yes I can not name but was the golden phrase 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.990
 was somewhere that is viktorinoks scissors 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.690
 it is worth buying the whole 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:32.750
 the knife is constantly used leg sulfur 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.420
 sound also does not make sense to explain 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.520
 here it is combined with a small flat 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.780
 screwdriver just I say not to use not 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.780
 I don't know 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.820
 small Phillips screwdriver used 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.890
 due to the specifics of the computer and 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.810
 parse collect and sometimes just stupid 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.760
 Do not go out for a screwdriver please without 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.250
 problems on here is a phillips screwdriver for 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.250
 your k for beer nadal 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.620
 hand opener for beer should we 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.750
 tell how often it is used 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.330
 year without comment + big 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.750
 flat screwdriver used 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.780
 used know too let's go 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:18.140
 big Phillips screwdriver too sometimes 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.140
 periodically used sewed 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.810
 used a couple of times 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.660
 I can not remember why it is 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.820
 used that pore used 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.530
 regularly generally what the cork 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.660
 pushing inside the bottle it's not 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.790
 comme il faut all the same need and pull out 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.150
 out 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.150
 go further 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.910
 tweezers oh what god fuck why 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.670

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.350
 region and in our region in summer and spring 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:04:00.600
 ticks very much these pincers ticks 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:06.420
 wonderfully drawn but here 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.610
 and the legendary unnecessary toothpick means 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.220
 it was also used for its intended purpose 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.890
 as if not an hour I do not want to tell is not well 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.060
 certainly not for its intended purpose but 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:21.000
 so if not someone will say that in this 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.190
 in this victorinox and lacks what 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.610

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.310
 eyes ha ha ha here is all there is to eat 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.300

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.070
 use in the field 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.040
 that's why quiz 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.410
 in principle and hercules hercules in 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:46.260
 particulars it is of course the leg of the era 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:48.480
 it's just a masterpiece well yes hard well 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.750
 such as whether to pay for everything I like 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.750
 So
