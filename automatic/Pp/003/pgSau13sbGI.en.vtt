 It's very cool to say that people 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.430
 are seeking quality of life 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.770
 people want to have a life 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.660

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.810
 worries a lot because with this 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.550
 growth of personal trainer of 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.960

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.210
 physical training it is important that 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.740
