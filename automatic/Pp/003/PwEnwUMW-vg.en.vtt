00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.410
 for all and davi lope of digital network 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.610
 folio dotcom bibles to the video of 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.440
 preview of a camera that in icann has 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.290
 presented this very morning 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.820
 move the 610 nikon but it's not a 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.640
 new camera as such but that 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.070
 it is simply the revision of a camera 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.080
 that is, the substitution of a model that 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.750
 it already existed that it is about the nikon of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.789
 600 well this is not even with 610 is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.000
 practically the same as the other 600 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.859
 that the old 600 from there that is not 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.540
 really a new camera as such but 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.829
 which is simply a revision of the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.840
 a camera that takes time in the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.250
 market and you could say that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.380
 some units have had some 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.320
 problems are not all good 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.879
 a vast majority of them has 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.170
 had good we're going to see the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.969
 specifications that the camera has in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.059
 yes, as I say, they are practically 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.710
 the same as the 600 denny one 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.050
 with the sensor is a size sensor 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.550
 full is a full frame of 24.3 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.670
 megapixels exactly the same as 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.190
 he was wearing the old 600 then he has a 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.600
 6-frame continuous shooting mode 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.880
 per second that this has been 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.480
 improved by nicole since that of 600 us 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.090
 I gave 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.430
 55 frames per second but really 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.070
 it's a bit ridiculous improvement if it's a 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.400
 improvement but neither he nor with how they fit 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.470
 in any manufacturer improve medium 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.530
 frames per second in batches that are 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.920
 that is, this camera is giving us 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.720
 one more photo every two seconds not 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.640
 it's a big big difference so it's 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.860
 a slight improvement but it's not something I'm going 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.330
 to make the camera much better 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.090
 make it a new model that is something that 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.110
 is way above the previous model 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.580
 tell you how good the rest of 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.290
 specifications apart from this 26 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.390
 frames per second is exactly 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.310
 same as 600's yes I've been 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.800
 reading and nikon has introduced a 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.220
 improvement in white balance ie 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.590
 this new 610 nikon has a one 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.390
 best white balance adjustment what 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.130
 which was fired was in raw format is 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.170
 ridiculous because we're not going to change anything 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.730
 that is , if you do photography in 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.070
 raw format and the camera detects better the 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.270
 sensitivity sensitivity but 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.880
 the camera detects better balance of 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.050
 whites and in situations of the best 5 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.480
 thousand 800 degrees kelvin the camera 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.310
 that is not really 5600, it is 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.140
 very little difference and then apart from 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.370
 make little difference because the camera 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.280
 maybe 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.110
 the old sensors the equipment 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.629
 old ones that carried the balance of 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.330
 whites in the middle will give the best 5600 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.860
 Kelvin degrees gave 4 degrees Kelvin today 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.510
 is firing the progress then the 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.040
 rule is not a one level camera 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.829
 amateur to say that I'm going to 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.069
 shoot in jpg format there will always be no 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:39.409
 many with 600 or now 610 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.780
 there working that shoot photography 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.950
 in jpg format only yes there will be 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.950
 some that are in both 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.540
 jpg and in raw but only jpg 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.230
 it really misses me so this improvement 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.760
 of the white balance seems a little 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.950
 little important is worth it because it is a 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.599
 better but good as it shares as you 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.030
 I said good then they are the same 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.590
 specifications that we have in the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.799
 different normal h to include in the 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.280
 Body sensitivity iso of 100 to 6400 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.780
 expandable up to 25 thousand 600 a large 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.030
 quality in the video is worth that yes it is 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.310
 true is a full frame camera is a 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.390
 high performance camera and therefore 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.010
 You can also record video in a 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.049
 Very good quality in 1080p to 30 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.690
 frames per second progressive 25 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.250
 progressive and 24 progressive plus 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.060
 good hdmi output without compression 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.280
 direct 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.010
 to be able to record on other equipment is 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.440
 say use the 610 nikon really 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.540
 as a camera to record and then 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.099
 avoid a bit that the camera with bonus 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.200
 of video is to say these fillings that 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.870
 do these cameras what we could 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.390
 call so to speak have an original 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.069
 of great quality as if we said that 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.560
 we are recording the video in raw format 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.750
 we could get to get a big 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.269
 quality by plugging in the camera by hdmi 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.030
 to a recording device carries 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.030
 double altran one of sd cards and has 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.799
 39 points of focus in cross which is 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.760
 exactly like the previous 600 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.010
 camera availability as it is of 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.989
 610 is available it will start 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.110
 distribute from October 18 according to and 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.120
 so I is not clear whether it will 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.860
 be globally on October 18 or in 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.830
 some countries in some areas will 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.739
 take longer to get prices then 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.810
 well the 600 is going to sell or good is 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.430
 he has found it out there in the reserves 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.290
 what can be done with different 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.030
 packages one that is how you always use 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.540
 only the body the body of the camera 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.460
 which are 1999 with 95 dollars 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.240
 that is approximately 1600 euros 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.780
 as we had the 600 currently 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.099
 then we have the 610 with the 24 85 for 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.470
 2500 99 with 95 dollars about 2,100 euros 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:49.130
 the camera with a 28 300 millimeters per 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:52.610
 3000 49 with 95 dollars about 2600 euros 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.220
 two thousand 700 and finally the package with 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.139
 the 24 85 we saw before 2100 euros and 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.259
 with the 80 300 that is to say with a goal 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:03.069
 a tele longer by three thousand 249 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:06.199
 95 dollars that is about 2 thousand 800 euros 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:10.180
 approximately I tell you this is 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.180
 available from October 18 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.640
 so I went to this camera because it's 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.080
 a full frame camera I always have 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.060
 said when you write to me when you speak 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.460
 when you send me any digital consultation 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.840
 Refolio see the facebook twitter that 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.700
 really these full frame cameras for 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.290
 me are the professional cameras I do not 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.610
 I think a camera that is below 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.440
 of this for photographs a camera 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.520
 professional as such, it can 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.380
 serve to do some jobs 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.690
 punctual can take you games that 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.700
 be psc for example if you do photography 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.840
 sports can be very good to have 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.850
 the multiplication factor in a 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.980
 objective but for more photography of 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.930
 photo studio reportage I think 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:47.330
 that is almost indispensable that is a 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:50.000
 full frame camera then who or what 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.160
 nikon user can access or want 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.980
 Access or access this 610 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.240
 Well, if you have a 600 and do not 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.040
 you have no program the camera is 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.450
 say the camera does not give you problems today 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.520
 It's foolish to buy this camera 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.590
 nothing because by 0.5 frames per 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.780
 second and in improving the balance of 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.300
 whites I think it's not worth the 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.180
 investment of one thousand thousand 600 thousand 500 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.520
 around that price in euros now 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.040
 if you have one of 600 with the spots on 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.140
 the sensor there are people who had to send 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.540
 several times a nikon camera one of 600 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.640
 for this problem that is simply that 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.200
 the shutter or the mirror a part 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.700
 internal camera creates a small 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.950
 oil splash on the sensor 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.120
 the camera with the shots and this ni 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.770
 as the moment has not known 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.380
 fix it the nikon solution is 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:37.430
 this is the 610 that is to say it is a camera 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.780
 new because I do not know really I think 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.760
 that there has to be a way to 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.800
 able to solve this error but if it is 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.720
 your case you have this 600 camera and 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.670
 I sent them several times to niko not you 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.520
 they just solved the problem and hey 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.409
 You are a professional, you need a camera or 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.300
 you can not be depending on what 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:54.949
 you go one day to do a story in the 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.080
 that you shoot a thousand photos that the first 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.729
 go well and in the photo 900 you 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.709
 leave with spots on the sensor then 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.449
 you have to be on the computer 

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:04.459
 correcting these spots and others is not 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:07.069
 one solution is to say is not a good 

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:10.219
 team is team so in that case yes 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:12.169
 I would recommend buying this 610 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:13.759
 it's a great camera it's a good camera 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:15.139
 is the 600's was a good camera 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:17.539
 removing this little problem that I had 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:19.159
 The sensor is a full frame camera that 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:21.499
 we can buy for about 1,600 euros 

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:23.779
 thousand 700 euros is to say a full 

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:25.399
 entry frame and that will give us a 

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:27.199
 great leap in quality in our 

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:29.419
