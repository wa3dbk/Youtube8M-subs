another walgreens or drugstore my local

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.499 
another walgreens or drugstore my local
watering<00:01:11.460> these<00:01:12.180> retail<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.860> 579<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.509> that's

watering these retail for 579 and that's

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.480 
watering these retail for 579 and that's
about<00:01:15.659> normal<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.830> their<00:01:16.950> lipsticks<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
about normal with their lipsticks I

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.039 
about normal with their lipsticks I
think<00:01:17.670> CBS<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.060> little<00:01:18.450> bit<00:01:18.540> more<00:01:18.720> expensive

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
think CBS a little bit more expensive

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.560 
think CBS a little bit more expensive
with<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> Milani<00:01:20.369> products<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.150> haven't

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
with the Milani products and I haven't

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.499 
with the Milani products and I haven't
seen<00:01:21.750> them<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.140> their<00:01:22.650> stores<00:01:23.280> yet<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.030> would

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
seen them in their stores yet so I would

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.450 
seen them in their stores yet so I would
definitely<00:01:24.540> try<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.500> look<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:25.710> specifically

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
definitely try and look for specifically

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.969 
definitely try and look for specifically
a<00:01:26.549> walgreens<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.320> line<00:01:28.500> right<00:01:28.740> now

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
a walgreens the one I'm line right now

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.300 
a walgreens the one I'm line right now
is<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:30.030> shade<00:01:30.299> Matt<00:01:30.780> innocence<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.710> all<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
is the shade Matt innocence and all the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.280 
is the shade Matt innocence and all the
names<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.970> met<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> which<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.020> thought<00:01:34.140> was

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
names have met in it which I thought was

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.740 
names have met in it which I thought was
a<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.650> weird<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.700> guess<00:01:36.329> that's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
a little bit weird but I guess that's

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.200 
a little bit weird but I guess that's
how<00:01:36.990> they<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.920> differentiate<00:01:38.549> these

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
how they want you to differentiate these

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.730 
how they want you to differentiate these
between<00:01:39.630> their<00:01:39.780> regular<00:01:40.229> lipsticks<00:01:40.619> because

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
between their regular lipsticks because

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.130 
between their regular lipsticks because
the<00:01:41.100> packaging<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.729> exactly<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.329> same<00:01:42.570> there

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the packaging is exactly the same there

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.569 
the packaging is exactly the same there
is<00:01:43.259> no<00:01:43.470> difference<00:01:43.920> other<00:01:44.189> than<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
is no difference other than the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.429 
is no difference other than the
formulation<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.299> different<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.110> they<00:01:46.290> all

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
formulation is different and they all

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.289 
formulation is different and they all
say<00:01:46.649> met<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.430> Omarion<00:01:47.820> let's<00:01:48.000> right<00:01:48.149> now
