00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
really cool stuff it's just that you'll

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.300 
really cool stuff it's just that you'll
have<00:02:03.240> seen<00:02:03.570> most<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.200> stuff<00:02:04.500> after<00:02:05.100> just

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
have seen most of this stuff after just

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.310 
have seen most of this stuff after just
a<00:02:05.369> few<00:02:05.399> hours<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> game<00:02:06.659> itself<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.170> about

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
a few hours but the game itself is about

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.830 
a few hours but the game itself is about
9<00:02:07.680> or<00:02:07.829> 10<00:02:08.009> hours<00:02:08.039> long<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.940> by<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.420> time<00:02:09.660> you've

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
9 or 10 hours long so by the time you've

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.510 
9 or 10 hours long so by the time you've
reached<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.200> end<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> game<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.830> sort<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.069> run

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
reached the end the game is sort of run

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.979 
reached the end the game is sort of run
out<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.700> tricks<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.540> gets<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.959> pretty

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
out of tricks and it gets to be pretty

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.730 
out of tricks and it gets to be pretty
monotonous

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
monotonous

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.680 
monotonous
there's<00:02:14.550> some<00:02:14.820> stuff<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.240> break<00:02:15.420> up<00:02:15.570> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
there's some stuff to break up the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.480 
there's some stuff to break up the
action<00:02:16.080> like<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.620> have<00:02:16.860> your<00:02:16.980> forensic

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
action like you do have your forensic

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.400 
action like you do have your forensic
tools<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.030> what<00:02:18.150> happens<00:02:18.510> though<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.050> that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
tools and what happens though is that

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.170 
tools and what happens though is that
the<00:02:19.740> game<00:02:19.890> really<00:02:20.310> leads<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.700> by<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.880> hand

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the game really leads you by the hand

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.750 
the game really leads you by the hand
it's<00:02:21.420> about<00:02:21.540> as<00:02:21.840> interactive<00:02:22.710> as<00:02:22.950> watching<00:02:23.670> an

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
it's about as interactive as watching an

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.790 
it's about as interactive as watching an
episode<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.270> CSI<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:25.020> basically<00:02:25.620> you

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
episode of CSI because basically you

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.800 
episode of CSI because basically you
come<00:02:25.950> into<00:02:26.190> an<00:02:26.280> area<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.180> game<00:02:27.360> tells<00:02:27.660> you

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
come into an area and the game tells you

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.450 
come into an area and the game tells you
to<00:02:27.900> hit<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> button<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.620> bring<00:02:29.130> out<00:02:29.310> your

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
to hit a button to bring out your

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.490 
to hit a button to bring out your
forensic<00:02:29.940> tool<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.420> always<00:02:30.600> equip<00:02:31.350> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
forensic tool and you always equip the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.050 
forensic tool and you always equip the
right<00:02:31.680> one<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.160> then<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.610> just<00:02:32.640> have<00:02:32.940> to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
right one and then you just have to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.000 
right one and then you just have to
stand<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.600> right<00:02:33.750> place<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.620> then

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
stand in the right place and and then

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.500 
stand in the right place and and then
kind<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.370> collect<00:02:35.670> evidence<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.300> then<00:02:36.390> you'll

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
kind of collect evidence and then you'll

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.720 
kind of collect evidence and then you'll
bust<00:02:36.870> out<00:02:36.990> your<00:02:37.140> cell<00:02:37.350> phone<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.800> talk<00:02:38.580> to

bust out your cell phone and talk to
your<00:02:38.910> lady<00:02:39.600> friend<00:02:39.750> kind<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.440> back<00:02:40.590> at<00:02:40.770> base

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
your lady friend kind of back at base

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.860 
your lady friend kind of back at base
and<00:02:41.190> she'll<00:02:41.370> tell<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.060> some<00:02:42.270> more<00:02:42.450> kind<00:02:42.780> of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
and she'll tell you some more kind of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.930 
and she'll tell you some more kind of
plot<00:02:43.110> related<00:02:43.530> stuff<00:02:43.800> but<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.490> stuff<00:02:44.730> really

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
plot related stuff but this stuff really

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.910 
plot related stuff but this stuff really
just<00:02:45.210> serves<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.600> break<00:02:46.050> up<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.440> monotony<00:02:46.560> of

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
just serves to break up the monotony of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.740 
just serves to break up the monotony of
the<00:02:47.010> action<00:02:47.460> it's<00:02:47.610> not<00:02:47.750> particularly

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
the action it's not particularly

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.110 
the action it's not particularly
challenging<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.590> any<00:02:49.740> way<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.490> definitely

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
challenging in any way so it definitely

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.430 
challenging in any way so it definitely
could<00:02:51.240> have<00:02:51.300> been<00:02:51.390> interesting<00:02:51.990> but<00:02:52.170> at<00:02:52.260> least

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
could have been interesting but at least

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.710 
could have been interesting but at least
it<00:02:52.590> doesn't<00:02:52.740> really<00:02:53.040> get<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.400> your<00:02:53.520> way<00:02:53.550> as<00:02:54.390> for

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
it doesn't really get in your way as for

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.080 
it doesn't really get in your way as for
the<00:02:54.780> combat<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.770> really<00:02:56.310> pretty<00:02:56.550> much<00:02:56.730> boils

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
the combat it really pretty much boils

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.640 
the combat it really pretty much boils
down<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.540> melee<00:02:57.840> weapons<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.500> do

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
down to the melee weapons but you do

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.950 
down to the melee weapons but you do
have<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.890> Taser<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.640> can<00:02:59.760> stun<00:03:00.180> an<00:03:00.540> opponent

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
have a Taser that can stun an opponent

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.300 
have a Taser that can stun an opponent
and<00:03:01.050> give<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.290> free<00:03:01.530> shot<00:03:01.560> which<00:03:02.280> is

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
and give you a free shot which is

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.740 
and give you a free shot which is
actually<00:03:02.700> pretty<00:03:02.910> cheap<00:03:03.180> because<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.570> can

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
actually pretty cheap because you can

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.930 
actually pretty cheap because you can
use<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.680> take<00:03:04.860> out<00:03:05.010> single<00:03:05.430> enemies

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
use this to take out single enemies

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.970 
use this to take out single enemies
really<00:03:06.150> easily<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.260> also<00:03:07.470> get<00:03:07.740> to<00:03:07.860> use

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
really easily and you also get to use

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.890 
really easily and you also get to use
guns<00:03:08.310> from<00:03:08.520> time<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.910> time<00:03:08.940> but<00:03:09.360> guns<00:03:09.630> are

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
guns from time to time but guns are

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.020 
guns from time to time but guns are
really<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.470> small<00:03:10.770> part<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:11.190> condemned<00:03:11.580> you

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
really a small part of condemned you

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.670 
really a small part of condemned you
only<00:03:12.300> ever<00:03:12.570> get<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.080> amount<00:03:13.320> of<00:03:13.410> ammunition

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
only ever get the amount of ammunition

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.560 
only ever get the amount of ammunition
that's<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.460> gun<00:03:14.610> when<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:14.940> pick<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.120> up<00:03:15.330> so

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
that's in the gun when you pick it up so

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.510 
that's in the gun when you pick it up so
you'll<00:03:16.020> like<00:03:16.170> get<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.410> shotgun<00:03:16.710> with<00:03:17.040> literally

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
you'll like get a shotgun with literally

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.730 
you'll like get a shotgun with literally
about<00:03:18.000> two<00:03:18.300> shots<00:03:18.630> in<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.140> then<00:03:19.590> you'll

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
about two shots in it and then you'll

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.320 
about two shots in it and then you'll
just<00:03:19.920> throw<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.280> away<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.610> pick<00:03:20.760> up<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.000> next

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
of threw you for a loop instead of just

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.420 
of threw you for a loop instead of just
one<00:04:46.050> similar<00:04:46.530> looking<00:04:46.830> corridor<00:04:47.250> after

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
one similar looking corridor after

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.640 
one similar looking corridor after
another<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:48.390> audio<00:04:48.690> really<00:04:48.990> helps<00:04:49.410> sell<00:04:49.620> the

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
another the audio really helps sell the

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.830 
another the audio really helps sell the
whole<00:04:49.920> experience<00:04:50.340> on<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.760> other<00:04:50.880> hand<00:04:51.180> there

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
whole experience on the other hand there

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.810 
whole experience on the other hand there
isn't<00:04:52.080> a<00:04:52.140> whole<00:04:52.260> lot<00:04:52.290> of<00:04:52.530> music<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.670> voice

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
isn't a whole lot of music and the voice

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.490 
isn't a whole lot of music and the voice
acting<00:04:54.240> is<00:04:54.360> good<00:04:54.690> but<00:04:54.930> there<00:04:55.050> isn't<00:04:55.170> that<00:04:55.290> much

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
acting is good but there isn't that much

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.310 
acting is good but there isn't that much
of<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.770> but<00:04:55.950> what's<00:04:56.760> really<00:04:57.030> impressive<00:04:57.990> about

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
of it but what's really impressive about

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.070 
of it but what's really impressive about
the<00:04:58.590> sound<00:04:58.830> is<00:04:58.980> just<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.730> sound<00:05:00.090> of<00:05:00.390> things

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080
