 the Normandy bridge and we take advantage of

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.790
 Normandy 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.350
 the purpose of a reservation is not to 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.760
 put under a bell to preserve it 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.710

 and then to give oneself the means to manage 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.650
 this heritage and possibly the 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.630
 to develop one to help him to get himself 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.580

 reserve of the estuary of the Seine in 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.050
 made to the peculiarity of bringing together

 treasures 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.140
 the nature reserve team must 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.270
 ensure the proper balance of environments and 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.280

 huge 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.280
 she is sure the two regions high and 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.280
 low normandy on three departments 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.320
 out of 16 communes and the two crazy people 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.530
 seen hidden in the reeds that are 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.690
 friends for 25 years are constantly 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.580
 on the roads in the reeds in 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.840
 is in the undergrowth also for 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.730
 go filming and photographing 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.959
 animals and helene precisely there a 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.970
 little anecdote to tell for 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.040
 to photograph especially when we see the 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.760
 photographs the images that are taken 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.109
 in the middle of the night 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.910
 but in fact these animal photographers 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.890
 are in their car they open the 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.479
 sunroof and they have a big spot a 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.729
 car headlight that allows them 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.979
 to illuminate animals like this and 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.580
 especially he leaves the engine on 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.710
 since if we extend the engine is well 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.229
 the bird is scared he is a lot 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.129
 more accustomed to preachers than to 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.169
 noise that can do man 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.520
 in a nocturnal silence and I thank

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.689
