 I tell you this is the highway 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.489
 60% of possession anyway ah yeah 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.530
 but who does nothing he does not touch a 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.110
 he ball being struck in fact 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.570
 hit is all that makes the go 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.370

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.350
 gold yesterday fault but there is fault 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.870
 the alarmist is a fault apart from putting 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.739
 red you know how do you come from 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.750
 live back yes yes at this rate there 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:25.270
 will end up putting it for sure it's 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:28.810
 sure no no that was good 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.729
 happen I do anything unfeigned 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.729
 at sea but no no 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.430
 oh that's not enough a draw that's not enough 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:51.210
 not to let them least one last a 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:55.590
 last wanted to go to bedside 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.890
 solid on the fly sorry all that is 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.360
 rather for what all these tutorials 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.940
 go we look at the details and for 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.220
 see ah bah yeah yeah I have the 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.270
 possession and he has ti there but 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.420
 you saw him at the same time he did 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.920
 that pull the whole game he made it 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.960
 it's a shame but frankly 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.700
 you see that with a team like that 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.740
 it's possible it's possible to win 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.210
 the title we need to remember from this match 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.760
 and it's clear I'm not an example 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.380
 it is necessary to remain concentrated at 100% 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.510
 until death these 90 minutes 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.340
 it's like football you saw well 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.840
 that even with a team where we do not have 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.740
 the most expensive players in the game or 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.390
 can win the title 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.250
 because we had it then you who is 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.520
 behind the gesture screen is there since the 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.930
 beginning 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.790
 I have nothing at all 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.680
 unfortunately this is the end of these tutorials 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.260
 I hope you have taken so many 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.870
 pleasure than me to follow this team ok 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.340
