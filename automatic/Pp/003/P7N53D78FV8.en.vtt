00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
aside this game is great I I can

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.600 
aside this game is great I I can
honestly<00:03:58.239> say<00:03:58.659> if<00:03:59.409> this<00:03:59.860> game<00:04:00.129> had<00:04:00.159> been<00:04:00.370> on

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
honestly say if this game had been on

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.020 
honestly say if this game had been on
the<00:04:00.700> ps3<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.690> would<00:04:01.870> probably<00:04:02.319> be<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:03.849> best

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
the ps3 it would probably be the best

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.780 
the ps3 it would probably be the best
game<00:04:04.330> ever<00:04:04.540> but<00:04:05.110> sadly<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.680> was<00:04:05.920> on<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.129> PSP<00:04:06.370> so

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
game ever but sadly it was on the PSP so

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.210 
game ever but sadly it was on the PSP so
it's<00:04:07.060> not<00:04:07.330> but<00:04:07.780> it's<00:04:07.900> one<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.230> very<00:04:08.560> few<00:04:08.680> games

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
it's not but it's one of very few games

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.880 
it's not but it's one of very few games
and<00:04:09.459> I've<00:04:09.790> actually<00:04:10.000> SAT<00:04:10.450> after<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.049> got

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
and I've actually SAT after I got

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.750 
and I've actually SAT after I got
through<00:04:11.950> everything<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:13.890> made<00:04:14.890> my<00:04:15.160> character

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
through everything and made my character

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.969 
through everything and made my character
super<00:04:16.239> strong<00:04:16.540> I<00:04:16.750> mean<00:04:16.959> I'm<00:04:17.169> not<00:04:17.470> even<00:04:17.709> level

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
super strong I mean I'm not even level

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.879 
super strong I mean I'm not even level
99<00:04:18.310> but<00:04:18.880> I'm<00:04:19.090> virtually<00:04:19.780> indestructible<00:04:20.769> I

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
99 but I'm virtually indestructible I

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:21.900 
99 but I'm virtually indestructible I
think<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.190> only<00:04:21.220> character<00:04:21.699> that<00:04:21.820> can

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
think the only character that can

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.150 
think the only character that can
probably<00:04:22.060> kill<00:04:22.449> me<00:04:22.570> is<00:04:22.690> Minerva<00:04:22.990> and<00:04:23.320> even

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
probably kill me is Minerva and even

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.740 
probably kill me is Minerva and even
Minerva's<00:04:24.610> not<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:24.940> big<00:04:25.060> of<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.240> challenge<00:04:25.389> to

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
Minerva's not that big of a challenge to

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.850 
Minerva's not that big of a challenge to
me<00:04:25.780> so<00:04:26.280> wow<00:04:27.539> it<00:04:28.539> took<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.990> long<00:04:29.199> time<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.590> get<00:04:29.800> to
