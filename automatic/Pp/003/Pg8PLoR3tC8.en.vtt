00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
biggest boon of the app or at least the

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.020 
biggest boon of the app or at least the
difference<00:03:16.680> between<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.189> and<00:03:17.250> say<00:03:17.579> just<00:03:17.879> a

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
difference between this and say just a

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.869 
difference between this and say just a
prebuilt<00:03:18.750> workout<00:03:19.739> machine<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.549> that's<00:03:20.669> in

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
prebuilt workout machine and that's in

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.819 
prebuilt workout machine and that's in
the<00:03:21.030> sense<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:21.479> hit<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.290> then<00:03:22.769> you

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
the sense that you hit this and then you

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.069 
the sense that you hit this and then you
can<00:03:22.979> tell<00:03:23.159> everything<00:03:23.669> that<00:03:24.090> you've<00:03:24.569> got<00:03:24.870> all

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
can tell everything that you've got all

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.349 
can tell everything that you've got all
the<00:03:25.199> stuff<00:03:25.439> that's<00:03:25.470> nearby<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.400> exactly<00:03:27.209> what

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
the stuff that's nearby and exactly what

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.670 
the stuff that's nearby and exactly what
you're<00:03:27.479> looking<00:03:27.509> for<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:27.989> work<00:03:28.169> out<00:03:28.349> and<00:03:28.530> it

you're looking for in to work out and it

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.710 
you're looking for in to work out and it
will<00:03:28.769> create<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.340> there's<00:03:29.849> obviously<00:03:30.269> lots<00:03:30.359> of
