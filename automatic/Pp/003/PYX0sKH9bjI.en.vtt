this will make it so if you start a game

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.940 
this will make it so if you start a game
with<00:01:30.490> two<00:01:30.670> people<00:01:31.119> well<00:01:31.899> here's<00:01:32.350> one<00:01:32.560> person

with two people well here's one person
here's<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.549> other<00:01:33.609> one<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:34.270> start<00:01:34.539> out<00:01:34.600> with

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
here's the other one you start out with

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.109 
here's the other one you start out with
three<00:01:34.990> people<00:01:35.380> well<00:01:35.920> two<00:01:36.130> people<00:01:36.310> spawn<00:01:36.819> here

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
three people well two people spawn here

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.940 
three people well two people spawn here
randomly<00:01:37.569> and<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:37.990> third<00:01:38.170> person<00:01:38.380> will<00:01:38.679> spawn

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
randomly and the third person will spawn

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.590 
randomly and the third person will spawn
at<00:01:39.189> one<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.460> those<00:01:39.579> places<00:01:39.639> so<00:01:40.240> it<00:01:40.389> always

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
at one of those places so it always

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.389 
at one of those places so it always
makes<00:01:41.139> sure<00:01:41.289> that<00:01:41.409> there's<00:01:41.740> two<00:01:41.920> in<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.130> arena

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
makes sure that there's two in the arena

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.879 
makes sure that there's two in the arena
and<00:01:42.670> all<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.060> extra<00:01:43.450> people<00:01:43.780> spawn<00:01:44.109> somewhere

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889 
and all the extra people spawn somewhere

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:47.219 
and all the extra people spawn somewhere
else<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.729> can<00:01:46.030> do<00:01:46.119> things<00:01:46.149> like<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:46.719> that

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
else so you can do things like that that

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.690 
else so you can do things like that that
was<00:01:47.380> kind<00:01:47.560> of<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.709> side<00:01:47.889> note<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.189> wanted<00:01:48.579> to

weren't<00:03:48.139> aware<00:03:48.379> of<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:48.699> so<00:03:49.699> if<00:03:50.120> that's<00:03:50.629> the

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
weren't aware of it so if that's the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.349 
weren't aware of it so if that's the
case<00:03:51.109> you<00:03:51.349> can<00:03:51.500> go<00:03:51.620> here<00:03:51.980> open<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.489> up<00:03:52.669> delete

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
case you can go here open it up delete

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.539 
case you can go here open it up delete
all<00:03:53.569> of<00:03:53.690> these<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.109> yes<00:03:54.349> then<00:03:55.040> go<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.250> save

game if you guys are still dying then
there's<00:04:03.409> probably<00:04:03.859> something<00:04:04.159> else<00:04:04.459> causing

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
there's probably something else causing

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.819 
there's probably something else causing
it<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.479> only<00:04:05.690> other<00:04:05.750> things<00:04:06.349> that<00:04:06.500> I

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
it the only other things that I

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.740 
it the only other things that I
personally<00:04:07.280> am<00:04:07.669> aware<00:04:08.030> of<00:04:08.090> that<00:04:08.419> can<00:04:08.569> really

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
personally am aware of that can really

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.659 
personally am aware of that can really
kill<00:04:09.169> you<00:04:09.379> right<00:04:09.709> when<00:04:09.889> you<00:04:09.979> start<00:04:10.280> besides

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
kill you right when you start besides

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.800 
kill you right when you start besides
those<00:04:11.000> is<00:04:11.440> um<00:04:12.489> there's<00:04:13.489> a<00:04:13.579> two<00:04:14.299> more<00:04:14.599> things

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
those is um there's a two more things

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.289 
those is um there's a two more things
one<00:04:15.319> obviously<00:04:15.829> is<00:04:15.949> a<00:04:16.489> kill<00:04:16.880> ball<00:04:17.060> now

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
one obviously is a kill ball now

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.449 
one obviously is a kill ball now
everybody<00:04:17.930> knows<00:04:18.019> kill<00:04:18.470> balls<00:04:18.680> kill<00:04:19.190> and

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
everybody knows kill balls kill and

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.390 
everybody knows kill balls kill and
they're<00:04:20.299> in<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.510> shape<00:04:20.659> of<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.900> ball<00:04:21.049> yay<00:04:22.039> for

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
they're in the shape of the ball yay for

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.149 
they're in the shape of the ball yay for
deduction<00:04:22.970> a<00:04:23.120> cue<00:04:23.840> ball<00:04:23.870> will<00:04:24.349> kill<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.889> if

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
deduction a cue ball will kill you if

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.040 
deduction a cue ball will kill you if
you<00:04:25.190> do<00:04:25.669> it<00:04:25.820> like<00:04:25.940> this<00:04:26.180> if<00:04:26.479> you<00:04:26.630> put<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:26.930> around

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
you do it like this if you put it around

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.950 
you do it like this if you put it around
this<00:04:27.320> starting<00:04:28.310> point<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:29.570> respawn

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
this starting point and the respawn

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.290 
this starting point and the respawn
point<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.740> moment<00:04:31.130> you<00:04:31.190> spawn<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.789> kills<00:04:32.120> you

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
point the moment you spawn it kills you

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.480 
point the moment you spawn it kills you
the<00:04:32.570> moment<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:32.930> respond<00:04:33.289> it<00:04:33.440> kills<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.830> well

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
the moment you respond it kills you well

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.969 
the moment you respond it kills you well
this<00:04:35.090> one's<00:04:35.330> really<00:04:35.690> obvious<00:04:36.289> to<00:04:36.440> tell<00:04:36.710> if

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
this one's really obvious to tell if

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.940 
this one's really obvious to tell if
that's<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.820> corporate<00:04:38.240> because<00:04:38.800> when<00:04:39.800> you

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
that's the corporate because when you

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.980 
that's the corporate because when you
spawn<00:04:40.250> you'll<00:04:40.700> see<00:04:40.880> this<00:04:41.029> really<00:04:41.270> reddish

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
spawn you'll see this really reddish

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.800 
spawn you'll see this really reddish
screen<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.350> it's<00:04:42.830> fuzzy<00:04:43.190> and<00:04:43.700> that's<00:04:44.510> usually

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
screen and it's fuzzy and that's usually

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.800 
screen and it's fuzzy and that's usually
the<00:04:45.080> sign<00:04:45.380> of<00:04:45.710> your<00:04:45.920> own<00:04:46.010> achil<00:04:46.250> ball<00:04:46.460> now<00:04:46.940> the

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
the sign of your own achil ball now the

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.320 
the sign of your own achil ball now the
other<00:04:47.990> reason<00:04:48.830> that<00:04:49.100> could<00:04:49.430> cause<00:04:49.700> something

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
other reason that could cause something

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.960 
other reason that could cause something
like<00:04:50.360> this<00:04:50.720> is<00:04:51.190> but<00:04:52.190> this<00:04:52.340> is<00:04:52.460> much<00:04:52.640> less

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
like this is but this is much less

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.110 
like this is but this is much less
likely<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:53.750> also<00:04:53.930> another<00:04:54.380> very<00:04:54.880> obvious<00:04:55.880> to

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
likely and also another very obvious to

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.110 
likely and also another very obvious to
tell<00:04:56.390> if<00:04:56.720> you<00:04:57.350> accidentally<00:04:58.070> made<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.340> map<00:04:58.700> over

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
tell if you accidentally made a map over

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.030 
tell if you accidentally made a map over
water<00:04:59.360> and<00:04:59.720> you've<00:04:59.840> dropped<00:05:00.200> a<00:05:00.440> respawn<00:05:00.770> point

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
water and you've dropped a respawn point

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.190 
water and you've dropped a respawn point
in<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.340> water<00:05:01.520> like<00:05:01.670> poop<00:05:02.120> all<00:05:02.690> right<00:05:02.930> that's

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
in the water like poop all right that's

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.670 
in the water like poop all right that's
in<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.530> water<00:05:03.790> well<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:05.240> moment<00:05:05.450> you<00:05:05.810> spawn

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
in the water well the moment you spawn

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.950 
in the water well the moment you spawn
if<00:05:07.190> you<00:05:07.580> don't<00:05:07.730> have<00:05:07.820> initiation<00:05:08.330> points<00:05:08.840> it

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
if you don't have initiation points it

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.600 
if you don't have initiation points it
will<00:05:09.020> default<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:09.830> one<00:05:10.070> of<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.250> respawn

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
will default to one of the respawn

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.180 
will default to one of the respawn
points<00:05:11.030> you'll<00:05:11.540> obviously<00:05:11.990> spawn<00:05:12.620> in<00:05:12.890> the

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
points you'll obviously spawn in the

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.680 
points you'll obviously spawn in the
water<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:13.640> it<00:05:14.090> will<00:05:14.210> kill<00:05:14.390> you<00:05:14.510> because

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
water and it will kill you because

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.050 
water and it will kill you because
spartans<00:05:15.350> never<00:05:15.620> took<00:05:15.950> swimming<00:05:16.280> 101<00:05:16.850> and

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
spartans never took swimming 101 and

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.510 
spartans never took swimming 101 and
they<00:05:17.480> drown<00:05:17.750> instantly<00:05:18.410> that's<00:05:18.890> also<00:05:19.100> an<00:05:19.340> easy

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
they drown instantly that's also an easy

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.800 
they drown instantly that's also an easy
one<00:05:19.760> to<00:05:19.850> tell<00:05:20.060> if<00:05:20.180> that's<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.540> culprit

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
one to tell if that's the culprit

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.500 
one to tell if that's the culprit
because<00:05:21.620> obviously<00:05:21.950> you'll<00:05:22.820> spawn<00:05:23.090> in<00:05:23.390> the

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
because obviously you'll spawn in the

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.120 
because obviously you'll spawn in the
water<00:05:23.690> and<00:05:24.050> you'll<00:05:24.260> see<00:05:24.410> yourself<00:05:24.740> drowning

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
water and you'll see yourself drowning

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.210 
water and you'll see yourself drowning
so<00:05:25.760> those<00:05:26.630> two<00:05:26.990> are<00:05:27.140> really<00:05:27.410> easy<00:05:27.650> to<00:05:27.950> tell<00:05:28.190> if

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
so those two are really easy to tell if

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.520 
so those two are really easy to tell if
that's<00:05:28.520> the<00:05:28.820> reason<00:05:28.970> why<00:05:29.210> your<00:05:29.690> spawn<00:05:30.140> and

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
that's the reason why your spawn and

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.650 
that's the reason why your spawn and
then<00:05:30.680> die<00:05:30.950> the<00:05:31.730> ones<00:05:31.970> that<00:05:32.090> aren't<00:05:32.480> so<00:05:32.630> obvious

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
then die the ones that aren't so obvious

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.710 
then die the ones that aren't so obvious
is<00:05:33.200> the<00:05:33.470> safe<00:05:33.860> zone<00:05:34.250> or<00:05:34.460> safe<00:05:34.910> area<00:05:35.300> and<00:05:35.540> the

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
is the safe zone or safe area and the

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.800 
is the safe zone or safe area and the
kill<00:05:36.020> area<00:05:36.530> so<00:05:37.070> definitely<00:05:37.970> check<00:05:38.360> out<00:05:38.660> your

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
kill area so definitely check out your

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.630 
kill area so definitely check out your
