00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.570
 Accompany Carlos who will help me 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.610
 make a cold soup of codito I 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.980
 I'm doing for is a way to 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.839
 make life easier for new moms who 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.329
 they have their baby accompany them and another 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:23.599
 way to facilitate the is the diapers of 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:26.599
 baby tips do this recipe is very 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.640
 simple is for those people who 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.289
 they have this complication does not know what 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.520
 is the complication of having the baby on 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.730
 husband have this diaper change and 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.290
 well let's harass the pasta you've already 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.530
 given some examples of how 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.570
 get it now you know she is cooked 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.700
 we put this there I recommend you in 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.100
 this case you put a little salt to the 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.690
 water so your recipe will not have much 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.390
 salt but will have the taste the pasta what 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.610
 will take is a package of soup 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.320
 I think they are almost always coming in 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.540
 200 250 and 220 packages in those ranges 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.070
 also a liter of cream I like 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.070
 very much believe it very creamy 

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:12.439
 but then I'm going to put a liter 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.649
 of cream can have the liter ready and 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.869
 live putting him depending also 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.289
 half a kilo of ham the ham we're going to 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.799
 order in a thick slice and we're going 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.469
 to diced the same case with 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.959
 yellow cheese 250 grams and we're going 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.959
 to apply in squares that simple 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:37.479
 as simple as how to put the cream 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.479
 everything and we are going to put a little 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.270
 I put you I move him press 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.610
 if you want before continuing to put 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.610
 add the ham 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.750
 another important thing to season is 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.270
 our seasoning powder that carlos now 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.670
 I helped him do it and was terrific 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.009
 you can put my liking 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.340
 a lot with garlic when he put me over a 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.489
 little herbs I bring you osasuna if by 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.489
 favor 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.940
 when I want is that I put a look 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.099
 teaspoon and let's go this one and you're going 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.470
 trying I think with that teaspoon 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.000
 it's more than enough let me move you 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.830
 before you finish 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.740
 I imagine that this is going to give you a lot of flavor 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.710
 to jump apart 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.850
 now we add what do you think about the cheese 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.700
 surprise 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.720
 I chose that your yellow can be another 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.720
 type of cheese that is 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.870
 I was struck by the color of the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.450
 cheese also for the sides and for itself 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.520
 they already have children, I think it's less 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.030
 that the fun does not 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.790
 if that father in sight is what 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.850
 we always say that also those acts 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.500
 that the community also has to be 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.570
 pretty nice and another first 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.670
 generally by sight not of faith and 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.260
 to the stomach, well, I did not put all 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.420
 the cream will do just as you 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.240
 like you thank you very much 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.940
 and you can put some cream in the 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.720
 table and everyone and if you want to throw 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.720
 a teaspoon 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.130
 I am and benavides and remember that we are what 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.130
