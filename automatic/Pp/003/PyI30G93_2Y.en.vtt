00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.710

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.740
 as I have always done against the other, but at last 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.439

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.000

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.400
 never divulging 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.290

 difficulty so I kept my head I 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.020

 at the beginning of the year that the burning and 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.990

 Studying abroad, I'm going to miss the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.590
 your family 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.910
 the floods lack people always feel 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.500

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.770
 investments in you - demanded is 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.290

 and I'm not instruments not them 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.980
 well back because when I 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.410
 I was out there was the one I was actually living 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.410
 It was two years out so it was very quiet. 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.150
 Aninha coast the half juninho the canopy to 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.709
 It almost happened to you the worst of me. 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.110
 thing that happened to me was when 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.890
 I discovered ten years ago I was 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.799
 cancer 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.440
 it was horrible and had to stage at the entrance 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.850
 in the hospital so kind on the verge of death 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.920
 Mother of God, everything went well and I stayed 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.049
 super sad I cried and prayed very much that 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.130
 my voice is the love of my life but 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.130
 Thank God she's great. 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.049
 Marli Fernandes, how old are you? 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.600
 She dated her ex-boyfriend. 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:51.530
 Kisses for me look I'm not he had 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.860
 16 years in my is my current is another 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.660
 but he was dark and he was already 16 years old. 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.570
 people have dated a year I do not know if it is 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.329
 this the question over here and a kiss 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.959
 carolina morais asked mobile you are 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.610
 whether you've ever seen or even the 3rd year of 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.410
 high school how was your choice 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.260
 for such faculty I did three years 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.079
 enem I did in the first year second year 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.700
 of the 3rd year and the choice I did not know 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.609
 right what I really wanted what 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.430
 excludes the type I do not take with me but 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.830
 mother started the stage no daughter see other 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:31.880
 other professions and such and presentations 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:33.949
 I'm going to have enough at the marina 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.020
 Menezes asked how was that? 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.759
 high school graduation, it is true that 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.590
 all say that after just me 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.020
 miss a lot and is completely 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.000
 different from the faculty in our doubts 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.949
 because I'm turning out to be a little 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.240
 less of chemistry i hope that comes ramon 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.090
 sent me a kiss 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.710
 Mariana kiss and I adore you 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.919
 work ending he died 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.770
 shot in the end graduation was very 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.199
 cool 80 high school was pretty cool 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.509
 even so my life to my class 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.550
 and it's a race we know each other 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.800
 since obviously it was between 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.039
 other people to complement 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.919
 but the class but had my friends there 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.479
 that he had known for 14 years, 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.340
 hold on 15 years now 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.169
 so it's always been a close- knit house 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.570
 that we come in a few 21 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.250
 18 She does not run very close. 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.289
 It was really cool so what I do not feel 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.900
 miss school do not feel what I 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.120
 I miss it, it's my friends' only 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.750
 School, I feel nothing. This is a lie to us. 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.760
 you will not take risk as you enter 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.500
 in college is different because neither 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.270
 always this room is joined by mine 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.229
 fully disjointed example has several 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.820
 little groups 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.080
 We talk to each other but it is not 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.479
 same thing was a little disappointing 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.970
 because I was accustomed to talking to 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.110
 everybody unbeaten run in the world and 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.009
 college did not go well that way 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.599
 happened to me but we are very good 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.520
 so I quite liked it for 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.320
 college people these new experiences 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.330
 new friendships 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.099
 so it is very worth the leader 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.680
 got a little scared but thinks 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:07.070
 so when it's in college will you enter 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.930
 people like what kind of is for obviously 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.460
 cases happen people already know each other 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.349
 but usually when you're on the 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.509
 college you enter alone by 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:17.690
 example you do not enter with a friend or 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:19.159
 with a guy everyone she was then 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.750
 everybody wants to make friends nobody 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.909
 You want to be alone so it ends there. 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:29.120
 that is creating the groups and so it is 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:30.950
 cool I really liked her so much 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.440
 sofia with your favorite lipstick color 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.150
 red 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.710
 the maciel luiza asked you already 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.510
 finish 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.520
 the college I'm at the end of the second 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.650
 year and then four years have also 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.690
 drawings people apologize to the light with a 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.640
 bit bad but like the video of questions 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.250
 and answers I thought it would not go so huge 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:51.160
 Sorry for anything that first 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:54.250
 Kiss the date support agent 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.870
 operational in the field, so do not 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.550
 only when the lion has finished 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.550
 college and 2016 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.590
 Do you have a boyfriend and do you think about getting married? 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.290
 we think about medical married in a 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:08.430
 eight years and you can do more 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.430
 tattoos yes 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.050
 so girls choosing these questions is 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.250
 that answer to you I do not know if 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.220
 I think the video stayed a little bit 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.750
 Long and I really liked those 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.730
 Asking questions, why do not you 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.870
 Do you know the best thing about your affection? 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.120
 I really like 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.860
 so always follow me on facebook and 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.900
 example instagram I'll leave here 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.880
 underneath for you because I so request 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.080
 for you to ask a question born in your 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.340
 social networks 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.170

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.450
