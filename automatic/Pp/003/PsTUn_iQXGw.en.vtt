00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
sweat and it's going to trap in more

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.470 
sweat and it's going to trap in more
nastiness<00:03:21.010> if<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.489> will<00:03:21.670> but<00:03:22.000> it's<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.390> a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
nastiness if you will but it's just a

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.000 
nastiness if you will but it's just a
recommendation<00:03:22.900> if<00:03:23.380> you're<00:03:23.560> really<00:03:23.739> really

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
recommendation if you're really really

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.740 
recommendation if you're really really
worried<00:03:24.430> about<00:03:24.489> your<00:03:24.820> waves<00:03:25.030> kind<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.480> spread

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
worried about your waves kind of spread

worried about your waves kind of spread
apart

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
apart

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.300 
apart
you<00:03:26.410> know<00:03:26.530> if<00:03:26.650> your<00:03:26.769> hair's<00:03:26.920> really<00:03:27.190> not

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
you know if your hair's really not

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.830 
you know if your hair's really not
trained<00:03:27.610> yet<00:03:27.790> so<00:03:28.060> that's<00:03:28.360> that's<00:03:28.660> probably

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
trained yet so that's that's probably

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.360 
trained yet so that's that's probably
something<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.320> you<00:03:29.440> want<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.739> look<00:03:29.860> for<00:03:30.040> look

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
something that you want to look for look

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.979 
something that you want to look for look
into<00:03:30.760> it's<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.090> same<00:03:31.300> old<00:03:31.480> thing<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.810> mean

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
into it's the same old thing I mean

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.199 
into it's the same old thing I mean
don't<00:03:32.530> get<00:03:32.709> too<00:03:32.920> much<00:03:33.160> in<00:03:33.459> depth<00:03:33.790> with<00:03:33.970> this

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
don't get too much in depth with this

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.580 
don't get too much in depth with this
stuff<00:03:34.420> I<00:03:34.570> mean<00:03:34.720> it's<00:03:34.840> really<00:03:35.080> not<00:03:35.320> that<00:03:35.380> hard

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
stuff I mean it's really not that hard

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.259 
stuff I mean it's really not that hard
just<00:03:36.010> keep<00:03:36.220> brushing<00:03:36.489> your<00:03:36.760> hair<00:03:36.820> until<00:03:37.120> it

strain and then you don't got to worry

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.199 
strain and then you don't got to worry
about<00:03:38.560> anything<00:03:38.980> usually<00:03:39.370> takes<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:40.120> know
