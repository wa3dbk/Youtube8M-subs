00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.470 
glove I get all my gloves the same size
and<00:00:49.260> found<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> g2<00:00:50.129> aqua<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.879> size<00:00:51.149> 10

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and found that the g2 aqua in size 10

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.260 
and found that the g2 aqua in size 10
had<00:00:51.719> way<00:00:52.050> too<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.500> negative<00:00:53.039> space<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.610> just

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
had way too much negative space or just

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.209 
had way too much negative space or just
open<00:00:54.510> space<00:00:54.750> between<00:00:55.320> my<00:00:55.469> hands<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.890> the

open space between my hands and the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.760 
open space between my hands and the
glove<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:57.360> negative<00:00:57.780> space<00:00:57.870> led<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> my<00:00:58.530> hand

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
glove this negative space led to my hand

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.470 
glove this negative space led to my hand
sliding<00:00:59.129> around<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> glove<00:00:59.820> way<00:01:00.059> too<00:01:00.120> often

sliding around the glove way too often

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
sliding around the glove way too often
this<00:01:00.930> could<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.230> because<00:01:01.530> my<00:01:01.680> hands<00:01:01.949> are<00:01:02.039> long

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
this could be because my hands are long

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.700 
this could be because my hands are long
but<00:01:02.910> skinny<00:01:03.329> making<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.870> harder<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.229> fill<00:01:04.589> out

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the gloves made it super difficult for
