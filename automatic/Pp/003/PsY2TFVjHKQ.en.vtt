00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
one so just make sure you I was using

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.940 
one so just make sure you I was using
the<00:00:47.820> actual<00:00:48.420> zipper<00:00:48.930> itself<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.500> not<00:00:49.590> trust

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the actual zipper itself and not trust

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.869 
the actual zipper itself and not trust
in<00:00:50.129> these<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:52.170> front<00:00:52.440> pocket<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.699> kind<00:00:53.850> of

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
in these the front pocket it's kind of

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.420 
in these the front pocket it's kind of
hard<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.480> there<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:56.100> know<00:00:56.160> could

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
hard to get in there so you know could

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.200 
hard to get in there so you know could
be<00:00:56.579> open<00:00:56.940> could<00:00:57.390> open<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> little<00:00:57.899> bit<00:00:57.989> easier

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
be open could open a little bit easier

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
be open could open a little bit easier
not<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> big<00:01:00.510> deal<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.050> just<00:01:01.460> one<00:01:02.460> thought<00:01:04.220> it's

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
not a big deal but just one thought it's

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.640 
not a big deal but just one thought it's
nice<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.970> doesn't<00:01:06.290> they<00:01:07.290> don't<00:01:07.320> give

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
nice because it doesn't they don't give

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.859 
nice because it doesn't they don't give
you<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.799> option<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.280> expand<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.030> which<00:01:09.720> you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you the option to expand it which you

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.429 
you the option to expand it which you
know<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.080> always<00:01:10.700> what<00:01:11.700> did<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.880> say<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.869> they
