00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
SuperSpeed I am and that's it so I just

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.360 
SuperSpeed I am and that's it so I just
started<00:04:38.280> mixing<00:04:38.430> mixing<00:04:38.969> lots<00:04:39.479> of<00:04:39.599> mixing<00:04:40.370> it

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
started mixing mixing lots of mixing it

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.939 
started mixing mixing lots of mixing it
kind<00:04:41.580> of<00:04:41.639> comes<00:04:41.879> out<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.479> a<00:04:42.509> consistency<00:04:43.110> you

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
kind of comes out to a consistency you

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.550 
kind of comes out to a consistency you
know<00:04:44.009> kind<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.340> creamy<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.900> think<00:04:46.199> here

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560

there<00:04:47.250> was<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.610> was<00:04:47.729> a<00:04:47.759> little<00:04:47.939> too<00:04:48.150> liquidy<00:04:48.599> as

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
there was it was a little too liquidy as

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.119 
there was it was a little too liquidy as
you<00:04:48.870> can<00:04:48.990> see<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:49.289> kind<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.560> moved<00:04:49.710> around<00:04:49.860> the

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
just used a ladle that works pretty well

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:43.129 
just used a ladle that works pretty well
then<00:05:41.159> just<00:05:41.250> fill<00:05:41.520> it<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:41.819> know<00:05:42.139> almost

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
then just fill it you know almost

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.279 
then just fill it you know almost
through<00:05:43.529> the<00:05:43.650> top<00:05:44.150> if<00:05:45.150> you<00:05:45.330> want<00:05:45.479> a<00:05:45.539> really<00:05:46.080> big

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
the way up to the top as you can see I

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.950 
the way up to the top as you can see I
did<00:05:51.839> that<00:05:51.990> to<00:05:52.169> some<00:05:52.349> of<00:05:52.379> them<00:05:52.589> by<00:05:52.710> accident<00:05:52.860> but

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
did that to some of them by accident but

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:05.570 
did that to some of them by accident but
turns<00:05:54.960> out<00:05:55.110> good<00:05:55.289> either<00:05:55.740> way<00:06:03.830> so<00:06:04.830> I'm<00:06:05.189> still

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
turns out good either way so I'm still

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.890 
turns out good either way so I'm still
filling<00:06:05.969> them<00:06:06.300> up<00:06:06.389> in<00:06:06.599> the<00:06:06.689> pan<00:06:08.599> and<00:06:09.599> like<00:06:09.779> I

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
filling them up in the pan and like I

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.969 
filling them up in the pan and like I
said<00:06:09.960> preheated<00:06:10.710> oven<00:06:10.949> to<00:06:11.189> 400<00:06:11.909> degrees<00:06:12.300> and

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:21.379 

and<00:06:16.979> we<00:06:17.219> go<00:06:19.250> and<00:06:20.250> they

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
and we go and they

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.809 
and we go and they
these<00:06:22.110> can't<00:06:22.409> cook<00:06:22.560> you<00:06:23.129> know<00:06:23.219> on<00:06:23.430> average

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
these can't cook you know on average

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.040 
these can't cook you know on average
about<00:06:23.939> 15<00:06:24.509> minutes

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
about 15 minutes

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.619 
about 15 minutes
I<00:06:25.080> think<00:06:25.319> the<00:06:25.379> recipe<00:06:25.560> calls<00:06:25.979> for<00:06:26.090> 14<00:06:27.090> to<00:06:27.300> 16

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:27.629 
I think the recipe calls for 14 to 16

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:31.459 
I think the recipe calls for 14 to 16
minutes<00:06:28.430> and<00:06:29.430> I<00:06:29.849> am<00:06:29.879> using<00:06:30.270> a<00:06:30.509> convection<00:06:30.900> oven

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:31.469 
minutes and I am using a convection oven

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:33.589 
minutes and I am using a convection oven
here<00:06:32.340> as<00:06:32.580> you<00:06:32.729> can<00:06:32.789> see<00:06:32.939> they're<00:06:33.449> looking

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
here as you can see they're looking

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:38.390 
here as you can see they're looking
really<00:06:34.050> good<00:06:35.900> so<00:06:36.900> it's<00:06:37.080> I<00:06:37.349> cooked<00:06:37.979> a<00:06:38.129> little

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
really good so it's I cooked a little

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.209 
really good so it's I cooked a little
bit<00:06:38.819> quicker<00:06:39.289> let's<00:06:40.289> say<00:06:40.439> like<00:06:40.590> 14<00:06:41.039> minutes

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219 
bit quicker let's say like 14 minutes

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:45.529 
bit quicker let's say like 14 minutes
and<00:06:42.259> oh<00:06:43.580> this<00:06:44.580> is<00:06:44.759> pretty<00:06:44.909> cool<00:06:45.030> you<00:06:45.360> can

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
and oh this is pretty cool you can

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.860 
and oh this is pretty cool you can
actually<00:06:45.569> save<00:06:46.139> the<00:06:46.439> batter<00:06:47.270> for<00:06:48.270> weeks

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
actually save the batter for weeks

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.600 
actually save the batter for weeks
because<00:06:49.439> of<00:06:49.650> the<00:06:49.830> buttermilk<00:06:50.099> it<00:06:50.370> kind<00:06:50.550> of

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
because of the buttermilk it kind of

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.390 
because of the buttermilk it kind of
keeps<00:06:50.849> it<00:06:51.030> so<00:06:51.719> I<00:06:52.110> just<00:06:52.289> say<00:06:52.530> you<00:06:52.919> know<00:06:53.039> half<00:06:53.250> the

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
keeps it so I just say you know half the

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.059 
keeps it so I just say you know half the
batter<00:06:54.259> more<00:06:55.259> than<00:06:55.409> half<00:06:55.560> the<00:06:55.680> batter<00:06:55.889> it

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:56.069 
batter more than half the batter it

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:58.670 
batter more than half the batter it
makes<00:06:56.250> so<00:06:56.370> a<00:06:56.400> good<00:06:56.550> amount<00:06:56.669> and<00:06:57.409> put<00:06:58.409> it<00:06:58.500> in<00:06:58.590> the

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
makes so a good amount and put it in the

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.399 
makes so a good amount and put it in the
fridge<00:06:58.919> so<00:06:59.330> if<00:07:00.330> they're<00:07:00.900> eating<00:07:01.199> all<00:07:01.379> by
