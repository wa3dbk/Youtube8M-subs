00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the moment on on this course we ask

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.090 
the moment on on this course we ask
people<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.509> apply<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.590> project<00:01:58.860> proposal

and that's the starting point for a

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.179 
and that's the starting point for a
two-year<00:02:03.030> program<00:02:03.240> which<00:02:03.689> hopefully<00:02:04.189> engages

it's also essential that they have a

it's also essential that they have a

the work that they create anywhere I go

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.390 
the work that they create anywhere I go
in<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> world<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.440> say<00:02:31.680> I'm<00:02:31.739> from<00:02:32.099> Central

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
Saint Martin's people are just kind of

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.990 
Saint Martin's people are just kind of
silenced

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.970 

we're<00:02:37.660> quite<00:02:38.050> happy<00:02:38.080> for<00:02:38.320> students<00:02:38.710> to<00:02:38.770> find

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
we're quite happy for students to find

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.800 
we're quite happy for students to find
out<00:02:39.130> where<00:02:39.370> they<00:02:39.640> end<00:02:39.910> up<00:02:40.090> at<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.420> end<00:02:40.570> of<00:02:40.690> the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
out where they end up at the end of the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.570 
out where they end up at the end of the
two<00:02:40.990> years<00:02:41.230> but<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.560> think<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.920> world<00:02:42.430> of

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
two years but I think the world of

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.180 
two years but I think the world of
photography<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:43.600> changing<00:02:44.080> so<00:02:44.320> rapidly<00:02:44.590> at

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
photography is changing so rapidly at

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.330 
photography is changing so rapidly at
the<00:02:45.310> moment<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:47.170> possibilities<00:02:47.950> have<00:02:48.100> sort

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
the moment the possibilities have sort

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.610 
the moment the possibilities have sort
of<00:02:48.430> quite<00:02:49.030> unknown<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.720> think<00:02:49.930> as<00:02:50.260> we<00:02:50.380> kind<00:02:50.500> of

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
of quite unknown I think as we kind of

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.600 
of quite unknown I think as we kind of
move<00:02:50.680> forward<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:51.400> period<00:02:52.330> of<00:02:52.450> history
