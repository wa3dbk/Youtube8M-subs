00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.920
 who are watching out there and there are good 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.660
 herbs and spices that we should consume 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.430
 they are to be healthier and not 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.730
 to conserve it to figure the hits 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.039
 here you are in growing better in climates 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.230
 wet and hot then this is the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.780
 best time to have these herbs and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.330
 is when now its maximum benefit that 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.970
 you can take 3 you can use the sheet 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.000
 you can use the mill plant can be 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.900
 the seed or the root then here we go 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.900
 to see different 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.570
 all right 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.570
 plus 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.710
 and is known more especially for its 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.930
 digestive effects if a person 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.030
 have abdominal distension or give 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.880
 when you take a tea storm this 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.010
 reduces in a very clear way the 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:07.300
 symptomatology and at the same time also 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:07.300
 it's rich 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.740
 this also has effects on the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.740
 process improvement management 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.930
 digestive but the other part that uses the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.600
 same traditional china this what 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.250
 recommend for 180 provinces 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.810
 then already fears of the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.640
 recommendations, let's try a 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.380
 little knowing if they work is 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.380

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.550
 extraordinary investigations 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.550

 well the fatty tissue cells that 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.640
 this was going to lose fat 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:34.970
 and this is mostly here we have books 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.769
 this also has as for 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.549
 Detoxify the body and finally
