to<00:02:16.260> say<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:17.480> it's<00:02:18.480> its<00:02:19.260> power<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.739> much<00:02:20.370> less

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
to say it's it's its power is much less

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.550 
to say it's it's its power is much less
it<00:02:20.970> kind<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.239> Li<00:02:21.390> kind<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.690> like<00:02:21.959> gets<00:02:22.410> worse

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
it kind of Li kind of like gets worse

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.390 
it kind of Li kind of like gets worse
and<00:02:22.739> worse<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.010> worse<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.250> worse<00:02:23.340> until

and worse and worse and worse until

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.130 
and worse and worse and worse until
finally<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.180> can<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.540> sort<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.780> becomes

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
finally you can it sort of becomes

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.140 
finally you can it sort of becomes
almost<00:02:25.349> useless<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.489> quite<00:02:26.700> useful<00:02:26.879> for

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
almost useless but it's quite useful for

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.960

strategy so first things first here is a

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.330 
strategy so first things first here is a
very<00:04:46.970> very<00:04:47.330> fast<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:48.050> kind<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.680> save<00:04:48.920> strategy

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
very very fast and kind to save strategy

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.380 
very very fast and kind to save strategy
which<00:04:49.790> I'm<00:04:50.000> about<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.450> teach<00:04:50.600> you<00:04:50.810> this<00:04:51.290> is<00:04:51.530> the

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.110 
the the fan and acid trap are kind of
strategy<00:04:58.070> what<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.280> do<00:04:58.460> is<00:04:58.640> you<00:04:58.760> run<00:04:58.970> between

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
strategy what you do is you run between

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.250 
strategy what you do is you run between
the<00:04:59.630> fan<00:05:00.380> trap<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:00.980> the<00:05:01.670> acid<00:05:02.390> trap<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:02.960> use

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
the fan trap and the acid trap and use

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.930 
the fan trap and the acid trap and use
them<00:05:03.440> both<00:05:03.530> individually<00:05:04.040> what<00:05:04.460> this<00:05:04.670> will<00:05:04.790> do

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
them both individually what this will do

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.670 
them both individually what this will do
is<00:05:04.970> hopefully<00:05:05.510> spawn<00:05:05.750> most<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.380> zombies

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
is hopefully spawn most of the zombies

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.230 
is hopefully spawn most of the zombies
behind<00:05:06.980> you<00:05:07.100> some<00:05:07.370> will<00:05:07.520> call<00:05:07.550> spawn<00:05:07.970> in<00:05:08.060> front

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
behind you some will call spawn in front

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.940 
behind you some will call spawn in front
of<00:05:08.300> you<00:05:08.390> but<00:05:08.600> there's<00:05:09.470> something<00:05:09.710> you<00:05:09.770> can<00:05:09.800> do

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
to use the fan trap and it has kind of a

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.890 
to use the fan trap and it has kind of a
safe<00:06:09.110> pretty<00:06:09.800> fast<00:06:10.220> strategy<00:06:11.000> guys<00:06:11.180> make<00:06:11.780> sure

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
safe pretty fast strategy guys make sure

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.500 
safe pretty fast strategy guys make sure
you<00:06:11.930> keep<00:06:12.200> that<00:06:12.260> that<00:06:13.100> shield<00:06:13.430> topped<00:06:14.150> up<00:06:14.330> and

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
you keep that that shield topped up and

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.330 
you keep that that shield topped up and
once<00:06:14.990> you<00:06:15.080> get<00:06:15.260> into<00:06:15.350> a<00:06:15.470> pattern<00:06:15.680> you'll<00:06:16.070> CERN

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
once you get into a pattern you'll CERN

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.180 
once you get into a pattern you'll CERN
you'll<00:06:16.670> soon<00:06:16.910> learn<00:06:17.060> you<00:06:17.270> can<00:06:17.420> kind<00:06:17.600> of<00:06:17.690> the

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
you'll soon learn you can kind of the

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.830 
you'll soon learn you can kind of the
shield<00:06:19.190> get<00:06:19.790> them<00:06:19.970> back<00:06:20.240> and<00:06:20.510> forward<00:06:20.810> and

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
shield get them back and forward and

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.270 
shield get them back and forward and
back<00:06:20.930> and<00:06:21.020> border<00:06:21.350> backboard<00:06:21.680> it's<00:06:22.010> kind<00:06:22.250> of

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
back and border backboard it's kind of

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.010 
back and border backboard it's kind of
really<00:06:22.430> easy<00:06:22.640> and<00:06:22.850> it'll<00:06:23.570> get<00:06:23.690> into<00:06:23.840> a<00:06:23.870> rhythm

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
really easy and it'll get into a rhythm

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.800 
really easy and it'll get into a rhythm
so<00:06:24.920> that's<00:06:25.100> one<00:06:25.490> of<00:06:25.520> the<00:06:25.940> techniques<00:06:26.240> guys<00:06:26.540> and

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
so that's one of the techniques guys and

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.220 
so that's one of the techniques guys and
the<00:06:27.050> other<00:06:27.350> technique<00:06:28.070> is

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
the other technique is

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.540 
the other technique is
classic<00:06:29.680> technique<00:06:29.950> this<00:06:30.070> is<00:06:30.160> the<00:06:30.280> one<00:06:30.370> I<00:06:30.400> was

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
classic technique this is the one I was
