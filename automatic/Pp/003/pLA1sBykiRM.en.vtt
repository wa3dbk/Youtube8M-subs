trying to cram an entire 2016 keyboard

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.770 
trying to cram an entire 2016 keyboard
into<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.260> space<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.549> many<00:01:05.760> keys<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.450> feel

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
into that space it's so many keys I feel

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.109 
into that space it's so many keys I feel
constricted<00:01:07.470> by<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.680> keyboard<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.939> feel

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
constricted by the keyboard I just feel

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.000 
constricted by the keyboard I just feel
very<00:01:09.150> overwhelmed<00:01:09.479> there's<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.260> many<00:01:10.350> buttons

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
very overwhelmed there's so many buttons

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
very overwhelmed there's so many buttons
it's<00:01:11.159> time<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.400> think<00:01:11.610> about<00:01:11.729> how<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.659> do

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
it's time to think about how can we do

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.499 
it's time to think about how can we do
this<00:01:13.140> better<00:01:13.580> using<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> technology<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.240> we

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
this better using the technology that we

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.370 
this better using the technology that we
have

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
have

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.950 
have
and<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.280> where<00:01:17.460> Gmail<00:01:17.790> tap<00:01:18.000> comes<00:01:18.270> in

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
and that's where Gmail tap comes in

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.050 
and that's where Gmail tap comes in
so<00:01:20.500> I've<00:01:20.710> always<00:01:21.070> known<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.430> I<00:01:21.490> was<00:01:21.550> related

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
so I've always known that I was related

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.240 
so I've always known that I was related

Morse<00:01:47.320> code<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.710> perfect<00:01:48.130> it's<00:01:48.729> just<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:49.119> dot<00:01:49.330> in

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.120 

when<00:01:55.150> we<00:01:55.240> first<00:01:55.510> conceived<00:01:55.900> of<00:01:56.050> Gmail<00:01:56.380> tap<00:01:56.650> is

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
when we first conceived of Gmail tap is

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.920 
when we first conceived of Gmail tap is
all<00:01:57.280> about<00:01:57.460> making<00:01:57.640> input<00:01:58.479> on<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.750> phone

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
all about making input on the phone

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.380 
all about making input on the phone
faster<00:01:59.409> we<00:02:00.280> realized<00:02:00.610> that<00:02:00.729> we<00:02:00.880> could<00:02:00.909> double

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
faster we realized that we could double

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.030 
faster we realized that we could double
the<00:02:01.450> speed<00:02:01.659> again<00:02:01.840> by<00:02:02.260> doubling<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.800> number

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
the speed again by doubling the number

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.160 
the speed again by doubling the number
of<00:02:03.070> keyboards<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.580> can<00:02:04.330> actually<00:02:04.690> split<00:02:04.930> your

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
of keyboards you can actually split your
