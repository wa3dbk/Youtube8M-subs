00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.860 
it was just like it pulled down at the

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
back because he was kind of facing the

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.620 
back because he was kind of facing the
friends<00:05:10.229> but<00:05:10.440> either<00:05:10.680> way<00:05:10.919> I<00:05:11.330> feel<00:05:12.330> bad<00:05:12.479> for

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
friends but either way I feel bad for

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.210 
friends but either way I feel bad for
him<00:05:12.780> if<00:05:12.870> he<00:05:12.960> was<00:05:13.139> because<00:05:13.410> that<00:05:13.650> would<00:05:14.160> have

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
him if he was because that would have

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.159 
him if he was because that would have
been<00:05:14.280> pretty<00:05:14.610> embarrassing<00:05:14.750> but<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.780> guess<00:05:15.990> in

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
been pretty embarrassing but I guess in

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.930 
been pretty embarrassing but I guess in
like<00:05:16.289> year<00:05:16.500> five<00:05:16.770> they're<00:05:17.310> all<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.580> same<00:05:17.639> size

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
like year five they're all the same size

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.629 
like year five they're all the same size
anyway<00:05:18.389> so<00:05:18.930> it's<00:05:19.740> not<00:05:19.889> like<00:05:20.039> if<00:05:20.220> he<00:05:20.310> was<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:20.460> late

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639
