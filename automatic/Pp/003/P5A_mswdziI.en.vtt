00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.010
 dvd criticism and now it is about one 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.290
 agent or spy thrillers go on 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.480
 which you do not even look away for a minute 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.070
 if you can not otherwise the action 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:22.470
 can track more and that 's it 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:27.490
 now for lady king as spy why am 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:31.470
 I here it goes once again 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.390
 at the top of the server 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.000
 he has been sitting there for years 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.410
 you have to do something for me go 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.210
 assuming that you watch them 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.829
 if you catch them what the devil 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.810
 they can not seek security 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.059
 rely on me 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:51.440
 He is a fanatic and fanatic 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.440
 always hide a secret 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.790
 Hello 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.770
 I have to talk to him why 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.410
 there is a woman 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.760
 I know who they are 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.960
 she had information about you 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.799
 double agent 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.799
 what she has for me 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 sensation 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.530
 raus so he has our man in 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.870
 istanbul killed 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.220
 it's all so dirty built 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.810
 we are the only ones between 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.130
 moscow and the third world war 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.130
 the moment has come 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.430
 it's one in five 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.380
 the koran 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.410
 lady king as spy original tinker 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.660
 tailor soldier spy shots 2011 defunct 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.370
 and 27 minutes is 12 years 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.910
 released and shipped us into the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.560
 1973 so in the middle of the cold 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.900
 Warrior in which it is a secret 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.730
 should meet to come in hungary one the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.400
 but assassination is the basis and the 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.739
 question who has betrayed little here 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.720
 There seems to be an agent 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.790
 or a doppler money or a 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.700
 mole in the top tier of the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.760
 circus the secret service of the uk 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.590
 or england and the question who is this 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.750
 human and what does all this have in common 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.670
 to do and then be a series of 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.360
 former also agents on the plan 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.099
 called 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.959
 they should try within this 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.030
 However, it does not determine any circles 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.739
 may still be conspicuous certain 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.120
 can not ask and ask questions 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.430
 always on a wire rope act 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.860
 go and the whole thing takes place on one 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.989
 psychologically very intense level 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.480
 instead of and thus is lady king as spy 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.459
 a film of one or the other 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.959
 very long-winded is therefore good over 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.910
 two hours you go anyway 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.130
 no second can even look away 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.600
 to be dropped at so many poor here 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.680
 within the film you try everything 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.730
 must and a strand of action 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.410
 integrate 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.329
 that almost makes the spectator hard 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.400
 falls in with what exactly now when 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.780
 why happened and a little bit 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.000
 historical feedback or 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.440
 basic knowledge of the cold war would be 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.940
 of course also very good if you 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.170
 The film looks very much like that 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.299
 is intense and above all with one 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.160
 strong cast glitters you need too 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.410
 just a movie makes a lot of it 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.000
 quiet moments were built solely from strong 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.910
 dialogogen exists so we have the 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.099
 main actors gary oldman colin firth 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.240
 tom hardy benedict cumberbatch mark 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.250
 strong or his or her 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.900
 other known face more and that 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.390
 makes this movie a year 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.580
 spy thriller of a different kind 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.930
 because very intense and also for many 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.490
 I have to admit, I suppose 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.560
 very boring you have to have one 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.580
 Great interest for this niche 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.710
 bring and then the film 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.620
 quite a discovery gets from me 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.240
 as espionage thriller worth seeing 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.920
 seven and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.760
 a total of seven out of ten possible 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.290
 points 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.460
 and quite a movie in which one 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.530
 also probably a second or 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.910
 third time should look around 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.190
 really understand everything 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.140
 By the way, the handle to the blu-ray my 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.610
 opinion does not necessarily mean the 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.740
 Quality is not so bombastic here 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.510
 points used my songs from blu-ray 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.220
 we were in the movie had him in 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.200
 cinema seen if yes please write 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.320

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.370
 me now to dame king as spy that 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.870
 you would like to take time there everyone would be 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.280
 let it be that will stay 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.050
 Look at my last two movies 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.980

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.480

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.830
 because otherwise write about films 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.420
