00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.809
 pain 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.730
 hello kids what 's good how are you 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.610
 looking behind me 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.550
 today we are going to see an automatic farm of 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.100
 cocoa and nothing uses the pistons and 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.880
 they subtracted as not good we're going to see their 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.880
 pretty basic operation when pressing 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.240
 would activate some pistons good will 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.180
 will contract in non-pythons would pass a 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.640
 stream of water and they would take us the 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.040
 cocoa in the area 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.590
 as you see, it has taken us in a stack 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.120
 whole but because they were not all 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.090
 planted why are you going to just place 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.809
 but when they are here, all of them 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.199
 Dark orange can give almost 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.550
 in almost two good stacks we have to 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.660
 go up 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.240
 and plant it so nothing is quite 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.250
 pretty simple and good I'm going to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.440
 explain step by step how to build 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.180
 we are already here in the first place 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.490
 let's see how the pistons work 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.640
 we have to place a torch and the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.090
 pistons 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.070
 but it does it in the lake go well 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.109
 and already the good water flow I'm 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.000
 so that it understood jce here we are going to 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.549
 see the operation this is a 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.439
 inverter that explained a thousand times 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.530
 When the signal arrives , the 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.270
 signal of good the signal is not reversed 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.750
 in the torch he stops and the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.000
 piston is contracted worth this we're going to 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.579
 have to do online until you speak 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.579
 what is said then they are going to contract 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.469
 all friends we have to place this 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.929
 let's start now with the manufacture of 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:56.649
 the automatic farm we have to place 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:02:00.750
 at height three blocks and of length or 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.400
 that is, from the tree what you want 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.800
 and I do not recommend that it be higher because 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.119
 if it's not going to cost us a lot of power 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.850
 plant the seeds then we should 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.270
 place the pistons such that this way 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.790
 behind 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.560
 well here I have done almost and good 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.400
 this would already be whole if in the current 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.200
 of water then I will apply the 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.120
 we had to put it like that and then 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.290
 here a stream of water we can 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.290
 put here 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.470
 to an instance block but it does not matter 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.180
 you can do it where you want then 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.180
 when the signal arrives 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.560
 I would collect all the cocoa and nothing here 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.069
 let's see how we do not expect to be 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.569
 forgot to put me a good cube then 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.480
 how as I suppose you know the berries 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:59.360
 when there is a mesh it is worth when there 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.730
 nabai to water does not pass but the items 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.920
 and then with this we are going to use 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.450
 for good, now I explain it 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.180
 this we are going to use for this 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.520
 exactly when the water passes through here 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.810
 and drag it all we have to place 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.960
 around here also blocks so you do not 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.050
 out 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.590
 fall but the good happens here the los 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.550
 items will fall and will not take you to the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.590
 area that we want 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.590
 and finally to tell you 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.460
 next to this 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.710
 place ice for what 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.980
 go much faster the current of 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.050
 water as you know and if the current of 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.070
 water reaches us there is no problem you have 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.470
 that to place a block here you have to 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.730
 place water again and then already if 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.150
 it did not arrive 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.760
 it arrives and it gives good until here the video 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.340
 today I hope you liked the 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.160
 truth is quite short but very useful and 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.230
 nothing if you liked to like it or 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.720
 up to those things and you can subscribe 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.320
 because I will be uploading little by little 'videos 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.900
 as always I say survival 9 tutorials 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.900
 always a greeting and until next time
