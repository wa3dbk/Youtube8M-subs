00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.070
 hello everyone I bring the hack of 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.590
 zombies for modern warfare 2 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.180
 specifically for the terminal map and 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.910
 good as you are going to see is not like others 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.520
 maps in which I have taught that one 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.550
 is out of the map here you will see what 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.829
 good is the same map exactly the same 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.870
 we are inside the map but there are good 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.300
 areas where we can not move like this 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.160
 which is quite small and good for 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.289
 those who do not know this is for the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.760
 version 1.11 is worth to play with some 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.320
 friend you should use the patch 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.180
 blogger is worth and good 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.980
 this patch many have told me that 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.930
 you see it rather as a way 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.840
 survival and not a zombie mode not 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.310
 really this patch is set 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.130
 rather in zombie mode that was not 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.230
 survival since apart from that in 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.559
 the patch puts zombies mode it does not put 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.390
 no survival , you'll see what 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.860
 that are the weapons and things of these are 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.620
 rather set in what are the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.229
 zombies is the only thing that is adapted 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.670
 to modern warfare2 and good in this 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.710
 particular game you will not see any 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.270
 special weapon but good you know that 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.640
 coke the is going up a series of his 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.310
 channel about this car 7 is also 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.450
 uploading now some videos worth about 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.740
 this also so good there 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.830
 you will surely see more games 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.780
 complete with special weapons and that and 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.119
 good I wanted to teach this from here it's worth 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.420
 it's a help package but we pay for it 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.520
 and we can go upstairs because 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.860
 As I said, this map is pretty 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.860
 limited there are no pieces in which no 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.350
 you can go no and here you see this 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.540
 package is to go to the plane and the other 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.399
 package would take you some boxes and good 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.810
 as I was saying there are pieces that are 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.789
 pretty limited to breaking glass 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.530
 I can not go wrong, they do it for 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.540
 reduce the map a little bit these packages 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.070
 that are here are for you to prevent 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.299
 climb from below valuable that from 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.549
 down you can not go around there you have to 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.150
 pay for eggs is worth the package 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.190
 down 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.940
 and well now you will see also the 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.760
 backs on this map there is just 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.549
 there between the two between the two 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.220
 elevators good the two elevators those 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:21.250
 that there are the elevators sorry 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.110
 well there is a backup and now you will see 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.569
 that I go to the plane and teach there 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.549
 couple of respawn more than there is one are in 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.069
 the side of the plane just and another is 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.890
 at the bottom it is now as you will see 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.660
 I will shoot there 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.500
 right there is where the other one is 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.500
 respawn vale 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.080
 and right here is the other as you are 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.930
 seeing that they appear there wrong those are the 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.400
 three remaining on this map 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.340
 at the beginning how are you the first 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.320
 rounds you'll say fuck because it goes very 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.030
 slow the zombies or the soldiers these 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.580
 They do not go very slow because it is the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.000
 beginning then every time you put a 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.820
 bit harder and not good now 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.459
 I'm jumping around here and that's a bit 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.540
 you're not going to see anything either 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.370
 spectacular as I say if you want 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.020
 stop by the poche or ccoo canal 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.510
 that they are uploading a 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.890
 series let's say a little more complete in the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.420
 sense that they teach the game more 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.360
 complete I'm just taking 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.209
 some pieces are worth and nothing simply 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.040
 that will leave your channels in the description 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.180
 It's worth it if you want to go see there and 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.700
 take a look whatsoever since 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.260
 they also teach a little bit of other maps and 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.430
 little better so I'm going to leave 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.810
 with the rest of the video I hope that you 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.220
 I liked those who liked to vote me 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.600

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.600

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.319

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.750
