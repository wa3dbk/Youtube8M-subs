00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
already been done by the machine

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.750 
already been done by the machine
operator<00:00:15.529> so<00:00:16.529> all<00:00:16.770> that's<00:00:16.949> left<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.490> them<00:00:17.730> to

operator so all that's left for them to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.250 
operator so all that's left for them to
do<00:00:18.000> manually<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.779> middle<00:00:19.020> boxes<00:00:21.260> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
do manually is the middle boxes the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.710 
do manually is the middle boxes the
machine<00:00:22.710> operator<00:00:23.100> was<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.150> missing<00:00:24.449> me

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
machine operator was just missing me

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.839 
machine operator was just missing me
about<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.320> try<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.980> get<00:00:26.220> another<00:00:26.460> machine

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
about I try to get another machine

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.929 
about I try to get another machine
operator<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:28.019> they<00:00:28.170> were<00:00:28.320> charging<00:00:28.680> far<00:00:29.670> too

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
operator but they were charging far too

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.620 
operator but they were charging far too
much<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.380> decided<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:33.090> do<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.270> manually

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
much so I decided to just do it manually

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.500 
much so I decided to just do it manually
so<00:00:34.260> I've<00:00:34.410> got<00:00:34.680> some<00:00:34.920> boys<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> whole

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
so I've got some boys to do the whole

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.270 
so I've got some boys to do the whole
feeling<00:00:36.809> manually<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.559> that's<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.070> best

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
feeling manually and that's the best

00:00:38.280 --> 00:01:01.060 
feeling manually and that's the best
decision<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.760> ever<00:00:38.790> made

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
for you you go you go build no problem

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.089 

this<00:03:27.569> is<00:03:27.719> the<00:03:27.810> first<00:03:28.049> stage<00:03:28.379> of<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.890> FINA

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
this is the first stage of the FINA

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.640 
this is the first stage of the FINA
finally<00:03:29.370> complete<00:03:30.060> one<00:03:30.719> is<00:03:30.900> happen<00:03:31.290> now<00:03:31.439> is

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
finally complete one is happen now is

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.860 
finally complete one is happen now is
that<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.980> sand<00:03:32.219> needs<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.549> settle<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.150> if<00:03:33.689> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
that the sand needs to settle and if the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.119 
that the sand needs to settle and if the
rain<00:03:34.049> comes<00:03:34.379> that'll<00:03:34.620> be<00:03:34.709> even<00:03:34.980> better

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
rain comes that'll be even better

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.459 
rain comes that'll be even better
because<00:03:35.459> then<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.969> sand<00:03:36.239> can<00:03:36.480> sink<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.049> some

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:37.469 
because then the sand can sink in some

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.250 
because then the sand can sink in some
more<00:03:37.680> then<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.519> need<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:38.849> top<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.239> up<00:03:39.359> once<00:03:39.959> more

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
more then I need to top it up once more

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.699 
more then I need to top it up once more
