00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.379
 The flute say whether very much Hello post crown of flute do what it is today 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:16.640
 I would like to think about how to bow when you hold it 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:17.510
 When it's played, of course in the orchestra always say hello before and after playing 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.130
 It is enough to do 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:24.660
 Of course also Naku' the Tteyuu who was this decided 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:31.310
 It depends on the performer. Try holding it with both hands and say hello 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:35.270
 We bow while lost me to one hand with anti wondering Hao real or try to say hello to urge to 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:40.660
 So I fit myself in this video 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:45.040
 I think that we want to validate the best-looking good your urge to either say how to bow 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.750
 The remains of the first best standard with both hands 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.950
 school 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.950
 It feels like delivery , but after all it's got with one hand 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:03.020
 In which something is to do this while keeping horizontally anti instruments 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:08.260
 I say hello when I bow this 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:12.210
 It seems to prevent water droplets from sticking to the tone holes 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.210
 It is also important that you walk around like this 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.140
 It 's cool to say hello with one hand, but the instrument is a bit unstable 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.040
 Naa 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.040
 Try to hold this side 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.170
 Say Therefore, Teru Hidari 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:52.190
 Well I see 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:56.090
 It is the result I saw, but I think it's quite good to have it standing with one hand 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.460
 If you just listen to this as it is , your left hand is amazing 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.750
 It looks like no hand on hand 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:07.340
 So when Mao urge to after all have in both hands 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.630
 I thought to bow is also but I think that I wonder if Well innocuous of 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.170
 I want you to hold it with one hand 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.800
 I wonder if I can not bow this well 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.800
 think 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.560
 At first I thought this way and have it when I bow 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.040
 Back to 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.040
 How is it 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.630
 It came in 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.620
 Entered at the time of his uncle 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.569
