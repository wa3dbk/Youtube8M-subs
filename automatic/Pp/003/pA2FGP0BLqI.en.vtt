00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.429
 hello my dear gardeners and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.849
 gardeners without flowers we just live not 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.690
 we can because looking at the flowers we are all 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:20.210
 forget and so everyone has everyone 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.590
 gardener in the garden there is a must 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.619
 extraordinary flowers and today I tell you 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.550
 talk about phlox because phlox we 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.050
 love for the extraordinary beauty and therefore 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.590
 we grow 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.450
 every garden here look phlox 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.309
 what inflorescences huge caps they are different 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.059
 forms 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:48.840
 round paniculate umbrella of note 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.649
 what kind of phlox is there 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.239
 for example in love with snow-white inflorescence 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.449
 and in pink in lilac purple in general 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.600
 and what a delicate aroma but grow 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.909
 phlox also need to be able to 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.330
 because some here just me 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.840
 signs and but once they call and write 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.570
 they say that phloxs are dying from what 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.820
 perish we do not know but just want you 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.869
 say expensive gardeners and gardeners and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.420
 phlox is such a mealy disease 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.360
 dew that is right now you see me 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.670
 No radiant times and see the leaves 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:38.340
 what are such green beautiful just 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:43.110
 wonderful leaves to clean but just 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.960
 unusual flavor than to fight if 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.470
 you have powdery mildew 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.180
 Well, flowers are still not vegetables and their 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.810
 you can sprinkle 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.409
 than sprinkle on mealy dew and therefore 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.920
 what if 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.560
 i got it purely once and on phlox 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.039
 then the leaves they quickly quickly at the beginning 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.160
 such becomes white dirty and then 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.650
 all the decorativeness turn completely yellow 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.720
 these ones 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:18.250
 phlox wonderful extraordinary 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.190
 beautiful flowers all this spoils therefore 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.220
 is it possible for prevention i jump or 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.970
 as powdery mildew found something on 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.390
 leaflets 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.650
 you need to immediately sprinkle than spray 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.400
 aku pure race 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.620
 from powdery mildew oprah skete very 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.420
 beautiful drug is ridomil gold 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:44.709
 it takes 12 grams per 10 liters of water 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:48.700
 and most importantly expensive gardeners 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:52.660
 at the end of flowering need to process 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.329
 these bushes can not only reedil them goal 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.510
 but can be processed 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:02.560
 chlorine with copper oxide ie hill a 40 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.310
 grams per 10 liters of water you need 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.639
 process 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.549
 very effective topaz in general or 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:13.060
 Bordeaux mix and that's when you 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:18.430
 processed need to take a piece of film and 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:22.410
 already cut all the plants up 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.870
 the stems are cut to the ground and 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.269
 stored and be sure to burn here 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.000
 only after processing if you will not 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.340
 process the world and you will cut it 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.220
 just spread the buoys 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:42.129
 this disease throughout the site and phlox 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.129
 you will get sick every year 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.730
 multiply phlox 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.940
 by the division method this is the best but 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.230
 can be propagated by cuttings and cuttings 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:00.980
 very simple and now I will cut one by one 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:05.090
 the plant is now so green cuttings 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:08.269
 Here, for example, see we take such 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:14.269
 small just two pairs of leaves 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:18.139
 century two pairs 1 2 3 4 and these lower 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:22.639
 cut the leaves and cut the top 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:25.610
 half and land a good 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.979
 prepared soil with sand but necessary 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.320
 remember to cover with a covering 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.560
 material and through covering material 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.780
 almost every day not every day we 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.750
 be sure to sprinkle so they 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.250
 were wet like that 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.760
 here landed well how would i tell you now 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.850
 show here landed wiki and in this way 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.660
 these cuttings will give fast root 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.300
 the system 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.210
 but you have to plant very thickly right on 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.910
 apart gay be one or two 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.340
 centimeter and they will give you these cuttings 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.789
 root system and you sweat them 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.940
 transplant to a permanent place like this 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.400
 grow and remember that very well 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.760
 phlox when you cut them handle 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:15.260
 you can divide them but divides phlox when 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.419
 it has been around for about 34 years 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.330
 5 if yo take and divide 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:24.580
 then phlox you will bloom more 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.580
 more magnificent more beautiful 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.629
 spirit
