00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 a fairly diversified activity and then a welcome project 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.380

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.930
 to lead a property 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.790

 of this complaint in August on request the agricultural activity 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.360
 I still have the activities of starting a deer farm 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.550
 of limousine cows with kevin some of the animals that are fattened 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.400
 so is a direct sale of meat 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.550
 in breeding so we have cocoons of what is still a few hives in 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.960
 Roma culture therefore does vegetable productions 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.800
 in europe the Roma on 3 hectares 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.920
 e vegetable seed production 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.180
 part of the vegetables and canned 2 condiments we are aware 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.450
 that he can more classic 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.860
 we have a small berry production too 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.660
 and then for 100 th so on the second site there is seed production 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.810
 floral 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.990
 and then a children's activity 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 so a children's welcome mainly during the school holidays 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.400
 from production, but we have a lot of proof that we produce 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.530
 if I can say it's percent 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.859
 the impact on the landscape is the information of the social link 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.799
 we do not talk much about these things but for me are as important as the 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.510
 production 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.440
 funny agricultural products 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.780
 as our time to associate with us had left percent who had 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.990
 the insolent property desired pace that this place continual 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.690
 without being a closed ones can continue to look at particular vegetables 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.330
 and could if possible in connection with us 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.620
 so body 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.700
 we immediately thought for 100 euros bought this property there 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:15.029
 and think about it but it's also an opportunity to associate people 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.269
 around us and deschamps who% and think it's important to the world 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.609
 discharge their responsibilities for 100 euros level of the land it is 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:23.969
