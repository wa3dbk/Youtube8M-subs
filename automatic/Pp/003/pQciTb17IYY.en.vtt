00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.790
 different game the game of today is field 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:13.590
 mined mine field galician 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.960
 I know you will not comment that you can 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.500
 to say that they already know that they will 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.060
 comment but is so sure of one thing 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.710
 80% of folks do not think this video is bad 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.119
 knows how to play field mine 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.880
 Do you think that just staying here we go? 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.400
 it does not guarantee a whole spirit within the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.980
 game is already difficult you think the game is 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.020
 Difficult is difficult Difficult is I 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.940
 teach your place in this video, come on 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.140
 1ยบ are in the middle because it is a place 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.329
 nice, right 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.420
 the good thing is the taste has the numbers one 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.219
 have today you have a little understand 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.190
 championship that the public did not understand to 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.370
 Fan because I do not understand now, okay? Come on. 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.010
 has 122 means that there is around the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.600
 Square giant here have here O 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.550
 the two as examples these two here 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.649
 as an example around itself square 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.050
 here are going to have two bombs around it 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.940
 that can only be this and this galera to 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.840
 people with pain and for me to mark that 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.479
 have a clean pump 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.430
 Good if you have one that has a bomb. 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.460
 around the sac has a pump 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.229
 then it means that any bomb 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.790
 this is 12 means that there are two 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.590
 bombs can only be this and this is simple 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.110
 it's fast and easy 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.600
 it's good to have one more here O that a catch 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.360
 here because you can not get a gene 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.700
 one or another number here a car 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.990
 just dream is now part of the thinking 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.229
 because I did not feel any good 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.290
 is there 12 here that 2 action is not 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.680
 It's these two here already show the two here 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.860
 Ok guys and this 25 stay one is from here and 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.960
 one of these four 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.780
 here comes the tricky part the game does not have 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.180
 to know what the rest of the good number 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.219
 this number 1 did not predict in this world 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.899
 here also if one here I want to stay 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.579
 but he only has one bomb that is already this 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.469
 so it means that round it 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.600
 It is not silly ok is not good here is good it is 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.719
 good hit me this one means everything 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.630
 around it only has one that is good that 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.630
 this here then this here at the pump 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.550
 Beauty is this one only has a year that 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.590
 if it is not good here, then 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:23.160
 everyone around and get this deal there 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.560
 that amplifies the map is only the tip 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.060
 Well here we have 22 means that two 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.210
 bomb attacks, then the two 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.340
 lots are good and this one this 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.200
 two people around him have already got a 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.790
 pump up here and another pump that 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.570
 what I want this is not so 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.220
 good but, look, this two here means 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.020
 that has two bombs here has three 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.270
 square and here two are good then 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:50.910
 this is not bomb ten years of course 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.970
 this Hungarian got one here that is here 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.650
 bomb and do not forget this is bomb 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.310
 so it means that here is a good one 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.850
 this one at the pump had played with the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.000
 guys 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.170
 in 2002 this one is bomb then that 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.870
 here too is bomb 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.970
 Okay, you got to understand is understand, right? 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.190
 guys here how to play the championship 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.630
 they're putting it back through the emi 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.790
 not by 2 to 1 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.280
 new 2 means that around this 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.090
 giant frame around it has two 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.190
 bombs 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.050
 So this one is a bomb already confirmed. 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.000
 by the universe that is a good one then only 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.620
 She threw him this is also a pump 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.060
 then it means that this or that 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.060
 neighborhood already shows this here it's good we are 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.060
 here at the pump this pump is exclaimed 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.490
 game I was very inspired by that 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.200
 I got sick playing yesterday r guys have 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.090
 several different ways of playing 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.420
 you can here there are difficulty options and 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.350
 if that is not only here, this is more 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:02.540
 the time when it 's more radical than that 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.950
 Here you go. 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.860
 I will not do it they made the 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.120
 what 15 minutes doing and sat 15 minutes 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.500
 in a slip or snake show here 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.270
 below reminds us that they are much more 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.940
 I hope that you understand this 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.640
 heavy dirt 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.310
 it's too heavy I hope nobody stays 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.540
 hurt and win remembered today we have 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.280
 we should at 10 o'clock the gta wine with 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.650
 very funny, I in my opinion 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.510
 was addressed at noon we had the 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.140
 plan depends on what I left maschmann 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.050
 with a good case, right? 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.580
 and this video displays and remembering the 4 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.930
 hours of the afternoon four rounds are in 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.580
 doubt because you now have a problem 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.110
 from the series to one of fire that they are very 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.060
 Good, but it's a bit complicated to record. 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.310
 because my schedule is hakimullah and 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.700
 caught the mic cycle they have to 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.740
 they hit a taxi and that is 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.500
 The problem then folks have to beat each other. 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.350
 bisson palm xxi do not hit does not have 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.770
 then it 's like inpex on the first day to 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.110
 people meet to record and if not 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.330
 It's not going to hit , so it's going to 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.490
 almost at the time of 14 in the afternoon but not 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.760
 found this online male video that is 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.940
 male or not, that was worth kissing and even 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.940
 it was
