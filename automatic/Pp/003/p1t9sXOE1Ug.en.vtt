00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
oh we have here's the blackstone best

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.160 
oh we have here's the blackstone best
setup<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.240> show<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.480> some<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.810> internal

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
setup to show you some of the internal

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.200 
setup to show you some of the internal
tweaking<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.740> can<00:00:07.859> do<00:00:07.979> I<00:00:08.160> have<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.090> in

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
tweaking that you can do I have it in

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.900 
tweaking that you can do I have it in
the<00:00:09.330> red<00:00:09.599> drive<00:00:10.130> both<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.490> internal

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
the red drive both of the internal

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.640 
the red drive both of the internal
capacitors<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.660> can<00:00:12.810> change<00:00:13.020> affect

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
capacitors that you can change affect

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.279 
capacitors that you can change affect
the<00:00:13.950> red<00:00:14.130> drive<00:00:14.430> and<00:00:14.760> you'll<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:15.840> able<00:00:15.930> to<00:00:16.080> hear

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
the red drive and you'll be able to hear

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.670 
the red drive and you'll be able to hear
the<00:00:16.470> differences<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.460> gain<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.680> treble

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the differences on the gain and treble

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.470 
the differences on the gain and treble
also<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.700> so<00:00:20.910> we're<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.330> fool

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
also on that so we're not going to fool

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.520 
also on that so we're not going to fool
around<00:00:21.600> with<00:00:21.780> the<00:00:21.900> front<00:00:22.080> anymore<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.470> I

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
around with the front anymore but I

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.630 
around with the front anymore but I
wanted<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.770> show<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.280> you

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
wanted to show it to you

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.050 
wanted to show it to you
here<00:00:24.000> before<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.420> got<00:00:24.570> started<00:00:25.760> here's<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.850> gut

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
here before we got started here's a gut

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.939 
here before we got started here's a gut
shot<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.660> black<00:00:28.199> stone<00:00:28.410> appliances

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
shot of the black stone appliances

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.349 
shot of the black stone appliances
you'll<00:00:29.400> notice<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.850> there<00:00:30.029> are<00:00:30.150> two

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
you'll notice that there are two

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.380 
you'll notice that there are two
socketed<00:00:30.960> capacitors<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:32.039> here<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.579> one

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
socketed capacitors one here and one

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.169 
socketed capacitors one here and one
here<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.870> can<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.050> changed<00:00:34.609> one<00:00:35.609> affects<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:36.179 
here that can be changed one affects the

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.020 
here that can be changed one affects the
overall<00:00:36.210> presence<00:00:37.199> and<00:00:37.499> the<00:00:38.339> other<00:00:38.519> affects

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
overall presence and the other affects

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.299 
overall presence and the other affects
the<00:00:39.210> amount<00:00:39.359> of<00:00:39.510> bass<00:00:39.690> let<00:00:40.079> through<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the amount of bass let through in the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.169 
the amount of bass let through in the
red<00:00:42.319> setting<00:00:43.319> so<00:00:43.859> I<00:00:44.129> showed<00:00:44.729> you<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> setting

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179 
red setting so I showed you the setting

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.090 
red setting so I showed you the setting
before<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.870> we're<00:00:46.019> in<00:00:46.170> red<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.769> effect

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
before that we're in red so this effect

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.739 
before that we're in red so this effect
that<00:00:47.159> there<00:00:47.670> are<00:00:47.850> two<00:00:47.969> things<00:00:47.999> to<00:00:48.420> note<00:00:48.569> is

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
that there are two things to note is

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.059 
that there are two things to note is
down<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.469> there<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.269> total<00:00:51.269> gain<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:52.069 
down here that there is a total gain and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:56.509 
down here that there is a total gain and
a<00:00:53.069> total<00:00:53.460> treble<00:00:54.589> pot<00:00:55.589> there<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.159> we<00:00:56.309> can

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
a total treble pot there that we can

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:06.890 
a total treble pot there that we can
impact<00:00:56.909> as<00:00:57.089> well<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:59.010> current<00:00:59.429> setting

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.050 

so<00:01:07.900> that<00:01:08.140> is<00:01:08.320> stock<00:01:09.310> capacitors<00:01:09.940> and

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
so that is stock capacitors and

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.740 
so that is stock capacitors and
everything

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:35.550 

turn<00:01:17.750> up<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:17.960> gain<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.140> little

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:54.050 

Tribble

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:04.720 

I<00:01:54.890> gets<00:01:55.890> freaky<00:01:56.220> there<00:01:56.369> at<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.520> top

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:12.440 

all<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.450> way<00:02:05.540> down

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.930 

the<00:02:13.440> next<00:02:13.680> thing<00:02:13.800> we're<00:02:13.920> gonna<00:02:13.980> do<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.310> leaving

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
the next thing we're gonna do is leaving

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.240 
the next thing we're gonna do is leaving
it<00:02:15.030> there<00:02:15.240> we're<00:02:15.690> actually<00:02:15.870> going<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.349> play

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it there we're actually going to play

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.830 
it there we're actually going to play
with<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> couple<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.790> capacitors<00:02:18.360> I've<00:02:18.569> picked

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
with a couple of capacitors I've picked

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.620 
with a couple of capacitors I've picked
out<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.989> couple<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:20.180> note<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.450> this

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
out a couple that I like note that this

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.920 
out a couple that I like note that this
is<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.980> capacitor<00:02:23.520> up<00:02:23.580> here<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.849> a<00:02:23.880> 103<00:02:24.300> J

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
is a this capacitor up here is a 103 J

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.780 
is a this capacitor up here is a 103 J
by<00:02:25.140> default<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.800> pedal<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.160> got<00:02:26.400> I'm

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
by default in the pedal that I got I'm

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.190 
by default in the pedal that I got I'm
gonna<00:02:27.090> switch<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.690> little<00:02:27.870> bit<00:02:27.959> bigger

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
gonna switch it to a little bit bigger

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.940 
gonna switch it to a little bit bigger
one<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.970> 104<00:02:29.970> J<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.380> here<00:02:31.620> we<00:02:31.920> are

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
one this is the 104 J so here we are

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:49.790 
one this is the 104 J so here we are
before<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.430> capacitor<00:02:32.790> switch<00:02:40.880> for<00:02:41.880> Jake

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.980 

and<00:02:50.800> here<00:02:51.700> we<00:02:51.819> are<00:02:51.850> after<00:02:52.330> switching<00:02:52.630> the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
and here we are after switching the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:07.949 
and here we are after switching the
stock<00:02:53.970> 331<00:02:54.970> K<00:02:55.300> into<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.260> 102<00:02:56.770> J<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.760> then<00:03:07.720> you

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
stock 331 K into a 102 J and then you

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.420 
stock 331 K into a 102 J and then you
can<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.260> course<00:03:08.290> play<00:03:08.650> with<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.920> other<00:03:09.040> things

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
can of course play with the other things

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:31.390 
can of course play with the other things
as<00:03:09.640> well<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:11.459> increase<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.640> gain<00:03:12.850> again

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.729 

remember<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.519> doesn't<00:03:32.730> preclude<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.390> other

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
remember this doesn't preclude the other

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.869 
remember this doesn't preclude the other
changes<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.890> can<00:03:34.980> make<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.400> pedal<00:03:35.730> on<00:03:35.819> the

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
changes you can make to the pedal on the

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.849 
changes you can make to the pedal on the
front<00:03:36.239> but<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.140> kind<00:03:37.379> of<00:03:37.409> setting<00:03:37.650> a

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
front but this is kind of setting a

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.539 
front but this is kind of setting a
tonal<00:03:38.219> range<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.879> an<00:03:39.870> overall<00:03:40.650> game<00:03:41.010> profile

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
tonal range and an overall game profile

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.000 
tonal range and an overall game profile
for<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.849> pet
