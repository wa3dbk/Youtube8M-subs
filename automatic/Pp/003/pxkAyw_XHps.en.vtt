that was released a little while ago

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.110 
that was released a little while ago
with<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.289> Omega<00:04:26.620> goons<00:04:26.919> in<00:04:27.190> it<00:04:27.370> as<00:04:27.520> well<00:04:27.910> as

some of the other characters they all

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.950 
some of the other characters they all
have<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.850> same<00:04:31.000> voice<00:04:31.240> when<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:31.600> scan<00:04:31.840> them
