years<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.079> explain<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.110> my<00:00:40.370> viewers<00:00:41.370> where<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
years so explain to my viewers where to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.959 
years so explain to my viewers where to
get<00:00:42.090> your<00:00:42.239> protein<00:00:42.660> from<00:00:42.690> yeah<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.860> very<00:00:44.160> easy

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
get your protein from yeah so very easy

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.910 
get your protein from yeah so very easy
-<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.450> protein<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.930> found<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.379> all<00:00:46.620> foods

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
- so protein is found in all foods

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
- so protein is found in all foods
smaller<00:00:47.850> amounts<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.360> some<00:00:48.600> foods<00:00:48.809> large

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
smaller amounts in some foods large

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.930 
smaller amounts in some foods large
amounts<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.590> others<00:00:49.770> especially<00:00:50.039> dark

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
amounts and others especially dark

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.209 
amounts and others especially dark
greens<00:00:51.239> beans<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.379> other<00:00:52.440> legumes<00:00:52.860> nuts

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
greens beans and other legumes nuts

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.689 
greens beans and other legumes nuts
seeds<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:55.680> other<00:00:56.160> other<00:00:56.399> foods

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
seeds and you know other other foods

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.849 
seeds and you know other other foods
like<00:00:56.879> tofu<00:00:57.270> tempeh<00:00:57.840> seitan<00:00:58.320> things<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.680> that

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
like tofu tempeh seitan things like that

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.459 
like tofu tempeh seitan things like that
but<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.579> general<00:00:59.609> protein<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.870> easy<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.320> get

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
but in general protein is so easy to get

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.619 
but in general protein is so easy to get
and<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.920> only<00:01:02.039> need<00:01:02.280> about<00:01:02.359> 10<00:01:03.359> percent

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
and really we only need about 10 percent

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.329 
and really we only need about 10 percent
of<00:01:03.690> our<00:01:03.719> calories<00:01:03.960> from<00:01:04.170> protein<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:05.010> that's

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
of our calories from protein so that's

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.920 
of our calories from protein so that's
that's<00:01:05.489> very<00:01:05.820> easy<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.150> find<00:01:06.299> that's<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.689> just

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
that's very easy to find that's on just

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.630 
that's very easy to find that's on just
a<00:01:06.990> pure<00:01:07.320> vegetable<00:01:07.530> diet<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.400> would<00:01:08.549> achieve

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
a pure vegetable diet you would achieve

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.460 
a pure vegetable diet you would achieve
that<00:01:08.820> based<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.470> macronutrient

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that based on the macronutrient

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.880 
that based on the macronutrient
breakdown<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:11.460> foods<00:01:12.030> there<00:01:12.750> any<00:01:13.290> any<00:01:13.560> given

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
breakdown of foods there any any given

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.920 
breakdown of foods there any any given
food<00:01:14.070> their<00:01:14.460> percentage<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.509> food<00:01:15.780> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
food their percentage of that food it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
food their percentage of that food it
would<00:01:15.990> say<00:01:16.110> potato<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.680> its<00:01:17.040> carbohydrate

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
would say potato of its carbohydrate

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.999 
would say potato of its carbohydrate
protein<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.240> fat<00:01:18.420> etc<00:01:18.630> almost<00:01:19.530> all<00:01:19.740> foods

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
protein and fat etc almost all foods

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.340 
protein and fat etc almost all foods
will<00:01:20.189> fall<00:01:20.369> into<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.700> category<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.840> you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
will fall into that category to have you

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.440 
will fall into that category to have you
know<00:01:22.439> 10<00:01:22.650> percent<00:01:23.009> or<00:01:23.100> more<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.520> very<00:01:24.090> easy<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
know 10 percent or more so very easy to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.830
