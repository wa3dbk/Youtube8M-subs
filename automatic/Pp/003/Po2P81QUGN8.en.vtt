against<00:05:06.250> Jackson<00:05:06.729> in<00:05:06.820> this<00:05:06.970> place<00:05:07.240> I<00:05:07.479> don't

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
against Jackson in this place I don't

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.600 
against Jackson in this place I don't
think<00:05:08.050> so<00:05:08.290> because<00:05:08.320> they<00:05:08.830> come<00:05:09.070> from<00:05:09.100> the<00:05:09.280> same

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
think so because they come from the same

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.360 
think so because they come from the same
camp<00:05:10.000> arona<00:05:10.780> and<00:05:11.229> push<00:05:11.440> them<00:05:11.560> out<00:05:11.740> of<00:05:11.800> it<00:05:11.979> so

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
camp arona and push them out of it so

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.700 
camp arona and push them out of it so
they<00:05:12.490> trained<00:05:12.850> the<00:05:13.030> same<00:05:13.479> so<00:05:13.780> I<00:05:13.810> think<00:05:13.990> it's

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
they trained the same so I think it's

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.469 
they trained the same so I think it's
not<00:05:14.979> gonna<00:05:15.130> be<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:15.370> major<00:05:15.669> factor<00:05:16.000> but<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.360> know
