00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
alright let's slowly go all right oh and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.050 
alright let's slowly go all right oh and
I<00:01:15.210> broke<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.080> let's<00:01:16.830> uh<00:01:17.130> let's<00:01:17.340> take<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> little

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
I broke so let's uh let's take a little

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.280 
I broke so let's uh let's take a little
checkpoint<00:01:18.360> right<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.520> let's<00:01:20.520> actually

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
checkpoint right here and let's actually

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.780 
checkpoint right here and let's actually
actually<00:01:22.290> let<00:01:22.560> me<00:01:22.650> start<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:23.070> oh<00:01:23.250> poor<00:01:23.460> over

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
actually let me start up oh poor over

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.710 
actually let me start up oh poor over
here<00:01:24.110> because<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.820> think<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.240> second

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
here because I think this is the second

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.649 
here because I think this is the second
checkpoint<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.270> sadly<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:30.420> thing

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
checkpoint to get to and sadly my thing

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.920 
checkpoint to get to and sadly my thing
just<00:01:30.900> broke<00:01:31.049> at<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.860> moment<00:01:32.570> all<00:01:33.570> right<00:01:33.720> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
just broke at that moment all right and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.130 
just broke at that moment all right and
I<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.650> about<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.280> same<00:01:35.880> exact<00:01:36.720> kind

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
I think it is about the same exact kind

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.700 
I think it is about the same exact kind
of<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.320> format<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.180> first<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:39.810> but

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
of like format of the first one but

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.429 
of like format of the first one but
alright<00:01:41.189> let's<00:01:41.369> get<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.880> side<00:01:42.439> so

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
alright let's get on this side so

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.340 
alright let's get on this side so
basically<00:01:44.040> there's<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.579> two<00:01:44.820> stages<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.899> I'm

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
basically there's like two stages so I'm

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.660 
basically there's like two stages so I'm
not<00:01:46.530> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> reach<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.130> blue<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.369> I've

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
not going to reach that blue one I've

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.980 
not going to reach that blue one I've
kind<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.909> been<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.540> newbie<00:01:48.840> ways

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
kind of been going like the newbie ways

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.679 
kind of been going like the newbie ways
and<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.369> finish<00:01:50.909> line<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.450> right

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and this is the finish line is right

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.080 
and this is the finish line is right
here<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.770> took<00:01:52.920> me<00:01:53.100> two<00:01:53.369> tries<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:54.000> I'm

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
here so that took me two tries and I'm

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.249 
here so that took me two tries and I'm
going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.270> leave<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.479> right<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:54.840> and

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
going to leave that right there and

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.310 
going to leave that right there and
let's<00:01:55.740> uh<00:01:55.950> go<00:01:56.520> back<00:01:56.759> up<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> top<00:01:57.479> well<00:01:58.020> I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
let's uh go back up in the top well I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.780 
let's uh go back up in the top well I
get<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.710> lag<00:01:59.310> spike<00:01:59.670> all<00:02:00.030> those<00:02:00.600> squids<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
get the lag spike all those squids and

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.609 
get the lag spike all those squids and
let's<00:02:02.790> try<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.810> more<00:02:03.869> time<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.560> then

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
let's try this one more time and then

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.889 
let's try this one more time and then
I'll<00:02:05.610> show<00:02:05.640> off<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> map<00:02:06.360> which<00:02:06.630> right<00:02:06.869> now

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
I'll show off the map which right now

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.050 
I'll show off the map which right now
you<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.409> kind<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.950> see<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.489> little<00:02:08.610> bit<00:02:08.879> but

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
you can kind of see it a little bit but

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.350 
you can kind of see it a little bit but
i'll<00:02:09.239> give<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.660> more<00:02:09.899> detailed

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
i'll give a more detailed

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.200 
i'll give a more detailed
look<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.140> map<00:02:12.350> once<00:02:12.650> i<00:02:12.920> finish<00:02:13.370> my<00:02:13.400> second

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
look of the map once i finish my second

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.350 
look of the map once i finish my second
round<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:15.290> basically<00:02:15.860> well<00:02:16.730> i'm<00:02:16.850> blind<00:02:17.210> up

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
round so basically well i'm blind up

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.110 
round so basically well i'm blind up
here<00:02:17.510> how<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.780> works<00:02:18.020> is<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.710> have<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.400> boat<00:02:19.700> in<00:02:20.000> my

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
here how it works is I have a boat in my

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.720 
here how it works is I have a boat in my
touring<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.690> boat<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:22.280> boat<00:02:22.490> is

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
touring the boat is the boat is

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.950 
touring the boat is the boat is
differently<00:02:23.720> textured<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.680> placed<00:02:25.720> which<00:02:26.720> is

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
differently textured and placed which is

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.350 
differently textured and placed which is
pretty<00:02:27.440> cool<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.340> because<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:28.940> the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
pretty cool that is because of the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.240 
pretty cool that is because of the
texture<00:02:29.750> pack<00:02:29.960> and<00:02:30.620> use<00:02:30.770> this<00:02:30.920> guy<00:02:31.130> right

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
texture pack and use this guy right

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.910 
texture pack and use this guy right
there<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:32.210> let's<00:02:32.870> let's<00:02:33.080> try<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.500> one<00:02:33.770> more

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
there so let's let's try this one more

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.670 
there so let's let's try this one more
time<00:02:34.930> alright<00:02:35.930> let's<00:02:36.890> try<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.280> go<00:02:37.490> this<00:02:37.850> way

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
time alright let's try to go this way

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.040 
time alright let's try to go this way
this<00:02:39.680> soy<00:02:39.890> seems<00:02:40.190> fairly<00:02:40.640> interesting<00:02:41.420> all

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
this soy seems fairly interesting all

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.980 
this soy seems fairly interesting all
right<00:02:43.450> yeah<00:02:44.450> let's<00:02:45.080> make<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.470> little<00:02:45.680> turn

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
right yeah let's make that little turn

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.600 
right yeah let's make that little turn
not<00:02:47.990> gonna<00:02:48.110> make<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.290> blue<00:02:48.590> one<00:02:48.620> why<00:02:49.280> am<00:02:49.430> i

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
not gonna make that blue one why am i

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.940 
not gonna make that blue one why am i
lagging<00:02:50.120> this<00:02:50.360> minigame<00:02:50.600> must<00:02:50.959> be<00:02:51.110> all<00:02:51.530> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
lagging this minigame must be all the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.120 
lagging this minigame must be all the
particles<00:02:52.430> effects<00:02:53.500> alright<00:02:54.500> let's<00:02:54.739> let's

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
particles effects alright let's let's

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.449 
particles effects alright let's let's
try<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.400> let's<00:02:55.640> try<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:55.970> avoid<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:57.459> make

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
try to let's try to avoid this and make

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.690 
try to let's try to avoid this and make
the<00:02:58.640> little<00:02:58.790> turn<00:02:59.360> off<00:02:59.570> right<00:02:59.840> here<00:03:00.700> alright

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
the little turn off right here alright

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.540 
the little turn off right here alright
so<00:03:02.420> far<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:02.989> good<00:03:03.200> let's<00:03:04.070> go<00:03:04.190> through<00:03:04.400> this

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
so far so good let's go through this

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.470 
so far so good let's go through this
little<00:03:05.030> little<00:03:05.660> like<00:03:05.810> yellow<00:03:06.260> path<00:03:07.480> alright

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
little little like yellow path alright

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.310 
little little like yellow path alright
and<00:03:09.380> let's<00:03:09.410> make<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.130> turn<00:03:10.489> I'm<00:03:10.970> in<00:03:11.390> oh<00:03:11.630> don't

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
and let's make that turn I'm in oh don't

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.979 
and let's make that turn I'm in oh don't
get<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.500> hit<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.680> path<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.700> did<00:03:14.000> was<00:03:14.750> so

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
get it hit that path and I did was so

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.830 
get it hit that path and I did was so
close<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.709> UM<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.150> little<00:03:17.540> finish

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
close to the UM to the little finish

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.620 
close to the UM to the little finish
line<00:03:18.049> to<00:03:18.760> really<00:03:19.760> close<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.180> almost<00:03:20.390> made<00:03:20.600> that

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
line to really close I almost made that

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.680 
line to really close I almost made that
one<00:03:20.989> go<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.230> oh<00:03:21.650> really<00:03:22.549> entertaining<00:03:23.450> though

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
one go to oh really entertaining though

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.840 
one go to oh really entertaining though
for<00:03:23.930> being<00:03:24.110> a<00:03:24.200> small<00:03:24.530> non-complex<00:03:25.310> minigame

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
for being a small non-complex minigame

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.140 
for being a small non-complex minigame
so<00:03:26.450> let<00:03:26.600> me<00:03:26.690> turn<00:03:26.870> my<00:03:27.140> order<00:03:28.100> distance<00:03:28.459> too<00:03:28.700> far

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
so let me turn my order distance too far

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.320 
so let me turn my order distance too far
and<00:03:29.450> as<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:30.530> can<00:03:30.680> see<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.190> basically<00:03:31.670> made

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
and as you can see it is basically made

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.050 
and as you can see it is basically made
just<00:03:32.660> with<00:03:32.780> snow<00:03:33.080> and<00:03:33.110> this<00:03:33.709> is<00:03:33.890> water<00:03:34.160> acting

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
just with snow and this is water acting

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.240 
just with snow and this is water acting
as<00:03:35.269> snow<00:03:35.630> with<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.170> texture<00:03:36.560> of<00:03:36.650> snow<00:03:37.040> with

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
as snow with the texture of snow with

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.120 
as snow with the texture of snow with
the<00:03:37.340> texture<00:03:37.670> pack<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.769> you<00:03:39.769> can<00:03:39.920> see<00:03:40.100> the

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
the texture pack and you can see the

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.130 
the texture pack and you can see the
different<00:03:40.670> colors<00:03:40.940> i<00:03:41.030> believe<00:03:41.510> indicate<00:03:41.989> the

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
different colors i believe indicate the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.620 
different colors i believe indicate the
different<00:03:42.290> levels<00:03:42.830> of<00:03:43.070> how<00:03:43.340> hard<00:03:43.790> each<00:03:44.299> level

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
different levels of how hard each level

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.509 
different levels of how hard each level
is<00:03:45.019> and<00:03:45.350> it<00:03:46.340> is<00:03:46.489> built<00:03:46.730> really<00:03:47.980> like<00:03:48.980> creative

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
is and it is built really like creative

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.150 
is and it is built really like creative
I<00:03:49.760> mean<00:03:49.940> it's<00:03:50.420> really<00:03:50.660> well<00:03:51.080> built<00:03:51.530> for<00:03:51.980> being

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
I mean it's really well built for being

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.449 
I mean it's really well built for being
a<00:03:52.280> snowboarding<00:03:52.790> minigame<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:54.459> especially

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
a snowboarding minigame and especially

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.390 
a snowboarding minigame and especially
being<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.940> non<00:03:56.180> redstone<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:57.200> non<00:03:57.590> redstone<00:03:58.100> and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
being a non redstone a non redstone and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.229 
being a non redstone a non redstone and
fully<00:03:59.209> texture<00:03:59.690> pack<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.200> just<00:04:00.410> created

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
fully texture pack and just created

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.850 
fully texture pack and just created
minigame<00:04:02.239> really<00:04:02.930> well<00:04:03.110> done<00:04:03.290> again<00:04:03.680> if<00:04:03.799> you

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
minigame really well done again if you

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.229 
minigame really well done again if you
want<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:04.070> go<00:04:04.130> play<00:04:04.160> this<00:04:04.549> for<00:04:04.760> yourself<00:04:04.910> will
