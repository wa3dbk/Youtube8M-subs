it here at to store and i have good very
good<00:01:04.229> feedback<00:01:04.830> great<00:01:05.129> feedback<00:01:05.339> actually

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000

its<00:01:06.330> mineral<00:01:06.780> oil<00:01:07.080> or<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.950> conductive

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
its mineral oil or with conductive

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.850 
its mineral oil or with conductive
filler<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:10.969> the<00:01:11.969> oil<00:01:12.509> is<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:12.869> vibrating<00:01:13.619> in

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
filler so the oil is not vibrating in

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
filler so the oil is not vibrating in
that<00:01:14.009> conductive<00:01:14.579> filler<00:01:15.590> provide

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
that conductive filler provide

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.840 
that conductive filler provide
connectivity<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.570> guess<00:01:18.869> part<00:01:19.530> my<00:01:19.770> English<00:01:20.130> so

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
connectivity I guess part my English so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.630 
connectivity I guess part my English so
if<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.649> if<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.189> use<00:01:23.399> it<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.539> small

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
if you if you if you use it in a small

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.730 
if you if you if you use it in a small
yes<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.880> using<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.539> that<00:01:27.719> small<00:01:28.020> dispenser

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
yes so using with that small dispenser

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.980 
yes so using with that small dispenser
thing<00:01:29.009> has<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:31.039> small<00:01:32.039> needle<00:01:32.329> to<00:01:33.329> drop<00:01:33.960> that

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
thing has a small needle to drop that

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.649 
thing has a small needle to drop that
stuff<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:35.100> kind<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.399> red<00:01:37.789> almost<00:01:38.789> no<00:01:39.240> smell

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
stuff it's kind of red almost no smell

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.749 
stuff it's kind of red almost no smell
and<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.109> oil<00:01:40.350> too<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> i<00:01:42.380> cover<00:01:43.380> about<00:01:43.979> 20

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and it's oil too so I i cover about 20

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.230 
and it's oil too so I i cover about 20
engines<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.509> point<00:01:46.490> if<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.030> if

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
engines at this point if you if you if

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.179 
engines at this point if you if you if
you're<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.840> hurry<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.469> you<00:01:49.799> don't<00:01:50.100> know

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
you're in a hurry and you don't know

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.069 
you're in a hurry and you don't know
what's<00:01:50.429> going<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.149> example<00:01:51.600> with<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
what's going on for example with a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.490 
what's going on for example with a
switch<00:01:52.469> point<00:01:52.859> or<00:01:53.520> something<00:01:54.259> connector<00:01:55.259> see

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
switch point or something connector see

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.550 
switch point or something connector see
you<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.920> drop<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> little<00:01:56.460> bit<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.030> stuff

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
you can drop a little bit of this stuff

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.370 
you can drop a little bit of this stuff
on<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.820> switch<00:02:00.149> points<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.840> figure<00:02:01.350> out

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
on the switch points and figure out

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.410 
on the switch points and figure out
later<00:02:01.829> or<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.429> keep<00:02:02.609> it<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.909> know<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.210> will

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
later or just keep it you know it will

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.239 
later or just keep it you know it will
be<00:02:03.539> in<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.689> good<00:02:03.840> even<00:02:04.229> joiner<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.859> can<00:02:05.039> put

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
be in a good even joiner you can put

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:09.889 
be in a good even joiner you can put
stuff<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.670> joiners<00:02:06.439> temporarily<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:09.149> figure

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
stuff on joiners temporarily to figure

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.870 
stuff on joiners temporarily to figure
out<00:02:10.020> what's<00:02:10.289> going<00:02:10.380> on<00:02:10.740> with<00:02:11.009> them<00:02:11.250> with<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
out what's going on with them with the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.940 
out what's going on with them with the
problem<00:02:12.240> on<00:02:12.390> layout<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:13.019> course<00:02:13.260> engines<00:02:13.739> I

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
problem on layout of course engines I

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.399 
problem on layout of course engines I
recover<00:02:14.700> more<00:02:15.090> clean<00:02:15.420> engines<00:02:15.840> they<00:02:16.019> have<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
recover more clean engines they have the

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.509 
recover more clean engines they have the
the<00:02:16.800> worst

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
the worst

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.190 
the worst
combination<00:02:18.519> of<00:02:18.609> the<00:02:18.760> metal<00:02:19.150> they<00:02:19.269> using<00:02:19.689> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
combination of the metal they using a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.119 
combination of the metal they using a
aluminum<00:02:21.099> body<00:02:21.579> with<00:02:22.359> the<00:02:22.689> copper<00:02:23.439> connectors

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
aluminum body with the copper connectors

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.509 
aluminum body with the copper connectors
to<00:02:24.639> it<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.030> it's<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:26.219> worst<00:02:27.219> case

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
to it so it's just the worst case

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.479 
to it so it's just the worst case
scenario<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.499> even<00:02:29.499> knew<00:02:29.739> or<00:02:29.859> locomotive

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
scenario and even knew or locomotive

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.069 
scenario and even knew or locomotive
