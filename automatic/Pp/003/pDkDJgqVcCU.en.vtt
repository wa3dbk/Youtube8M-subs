it<00:03:04.390> has<00:03:04.599> a<00:03:04.629> better<00:03:04.870> queuing<00:03:05.230> system<00:03:05.620> and

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
it has a better queuing system and

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.430 
it has a better queuing system and
clearly<00:03:06.459> see<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:07.209> general<00:03:07.569> populace<00:03:08.080> thinks

clearly see the general populace thinks
it's<00:03:08.620> better<00:03:08.920> because<00:03:09.519> there<00:03:09.819> are<00:03:09.940> more

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120

it's better because there are more
people<00:03:10.360> queuing<00:03:10.870> therefore<00:03:11.590> it's<00:03:12.430> better<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
people queuing therefore it's better the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.330 
people queuing therefore it's better the
other<00:03:13.959> thing<00:03:14.200> about<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.440> Xbox<00:03:14.800> one<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.129> course

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
other thing about the Xbox one of course

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.640 
other thing about the Xbox one of course
is<00:03:15.610> that<00:03:15.730> it's<00:03:15.910> always<00:03:16.090> on<00:03:16.629> it's<00:03:17.080> always

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
is that it's always on it's always

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.380 
is that it's always on it's always
watching<00:03:18.280> it's<00:03:18.400> always<00:03:18.670> making<00:03:19.000> sure<00:03:19.030> your

bear<00:03:19.629> which<00:03:19.810> is<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:19.989> good<00:03:20.200> thing<00:03:20.230> probably<00:03:20.920> a

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
bear which is a good thing probably a

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.740 
bear which is a good thing probably a
good<00:03:21.160> thing<00:03:21.340> except<00:03:21.910> Microsoft<00:03:22.360> seems<00:03:22.599> to

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
good thing except Microsoft seems to

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.330 
good thing except Microsoft seems to
have<00:03:22.870> reversed<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.440> decision<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:24.190> said

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
have reversed that decision and said

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.250 
have reversed that decision and said
that<00:03:24.459> connect<00:03:24.760> isn't<00:03:25.030> always<00:03:25.180> on<00:03:25.450> but<00:03:26.140> it

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
that connect isn't always on but it

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.119 
that connect isn't always on but it
might<00:03:26.410> be<00:03:26.530> on<00:03:26.790> who<00:03:27.790> knows<00:03:28.000> also<00:03:28.660> if<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.590> buy<00:03:29.620> it

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
might be on who knows also if you buy it

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.270

how do you think we did with our console

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.809 
how do you think we did with our console
war<00:05:19.470> I<00:05:20.389> think<00:05:21.389> by<00:05:21.539> one<00:05:21.750> III<00:05:22.740> think<00:05:23.039> I<00:05:23.400> came<00:05:23.639> up

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
war I think by one III think I came up

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.879 
war I think by one III think I came up
with<00:05:23.849> some<00:05:24.180> goods<00:05:24.419> hard<00:05:24.780> selling<00:05:25.289> points<00:05:25.740> as

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
with some goods hard selling points as

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.480 
with some goods hard selling points as
well<00:05:27.199> but<00:05:28.199> the<00:05:28.349> truth<00:05:28.650> of<00:05:28.889> the<00:05:28.949> matter<00:05:29.009> is

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
well but the truth of the matter is

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.659 
well but the truth of the matter is
really<00:05:29.970> I<00:05:30.210> think<00:05:30.690> we<00:05:31.500> should<00:05:31.979> probably<00:05:32.220> lay

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
really I think we should probably lay

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.339 
really I think we should probably lay
our<00:05:32.759> cards<00:05:32.789> the<00:05:33.090> table<00:05:33.389> and<00:05:33.539> save<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:34.139> fact

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
our cards the table and save the fact

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.540 
our cards the table and save the fact
I've<00:05:34.919> already<00:05:35.160> pre-ordered<00:05:35.520> a<00:05:36.319> Playstation<00:05:37.319> 4

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550

I've already pre-ordered a Playstation 4
I<00:05:38.550> have<00:05:39.150> as<00:05:39.449> well<00:05:40.250> so<00:05:41.250> um<00:05:42.380> yeah<00:05:43.380> this<00:05:44.220> is

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
I have as well so um yeah this is

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.460 
I have as well so um yeah this is
awkward<00:05:44.729> and<00:05:45.270> it<00:05:45.690> probably<00:05:45.840> doesn't<00:05:45.990> help<00:05:46.199> as

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
awkward and it probably doesn't help as

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.610 
awkward and it probably doesn't help as
well<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:47.280> we<00:05:47.370> spent<00:05:47.669> the<00:05:47.699> last<00:05:47.759> two<00:05:48.330> hours
