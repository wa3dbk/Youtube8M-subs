work slip 1 purlwise roll our way to
that<00:02:40.420> gap<00:02:40.630> again<00:02:43.709> there's<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.829> gap

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.240 

and<00:02:48.240> curling<00:02:49.140> two<00:02:49.290> together<00:02:49.410> one<00:02:49.890> from<00:02:50.130> each

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
and curling two together one from each

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.620

so<00:02:54.630> I've<00:02:54.720> swallowed<00:02:55.170> up<00:02:55.440> all<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.740> extra

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
so I've swallowed up all the extra

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.040 
so I've swallowed up all the extra
stitches<00:02:57.440> on<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.880> I<00:02:59.910> had<00:03:00.300> originally<00:03:00.540> left

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
stitches on that I had originally left

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.530 
stitches on that I had originally left
on<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.130> other<00:03:02.250> needle<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:02.850> now<00:03:03.000> knit<00:03:03.330> two

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
on the other needle so now knit two

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.059 
on the other needle so now knit two
that's<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.319> last<00:03:04.530> time<00:03:06.380> one<00:03:07.380> for<00:03:07.590> me<00:03:07.680> side<00:03:07.890> the

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
that's the last time one for me side the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.830 
that's the last time one for me side the
gap<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.730> we're<00:03:08.970> done<00:03:09.180> turning<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.660> heel

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
gap and we're done turning the heel

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.070 
gap and we're done turning the heel
that's<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:11.640> it's<00:03:11.790> narrowed<00:03:12.330> in<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.810> little

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
that's it so it's narrowed in a little

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.130 
that's it so it's narrowed in a little
bit<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:14.300> inserted<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.390> couple<00:03:15.630> extra<00:03:15.930> rows

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
bit and inserted a couple extra rows

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.720 
bit and inserted a couple extra rows
right<00:03:16.440> here<00:03:18.709> so<00:03:19.709> that's<00:03:19.890> turning<00:03:20.250> now<00:03:20.670> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
right here so that's turning now the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.100 
right here so that's turning now the
heel<00:03:21.000> has<00:03:21.120> been<00:03:21.239> trying<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.510> see<00:03:21.600> how<00:03:21.690> it's

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
heel has been trying to see how it's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.470 
heel has been trying to see how it's
created<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.650> little<00:03:22.769> wedge<00:03:23.010> or<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.820> little<00:03:24.120> it's

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.360 
created a little wedge or a little it's
turned<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:26.150> created<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.209> nice<00:03:27.330> rounded<00:03:27.720> edge

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
turned and created a nice rounded edge

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:37.070 
turned and created a nice rounded edge
now<00:03:29.370> we're<00:03:29.580> ready<00:03:29.790> for<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:31.470> gusset<00:03:36.080> the
