Shiro

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.809 

and<00:03:28.799> then<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.549> go<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.760> beat<00:03:30.120> seven<00:03:30.890> now<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.250> hope

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
you know where b7 is it's not a

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.890 
you know where b7 is it's not a
particularly<00:03:35.220> simple<00:03:35.549> call<00:03:36.000> but<00:03:36.360> you<00:03:36.690> might

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
particularly simple call but you might

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.170 
particularly simple call but you might
have<00:03:37.019> noticed<00:03:37.440> in<00:03:37.590> these<00:03:37.799> tutorials<00:03:38.099> I<00:03:38.730> don't

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
have noticed in these tutorials I don't

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.500 
have noticed in these tutorials I don't
really<00:03:39.390> go<00:03:39.599> into<00:03:39.810> explaining<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:41.129> calls

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
really go into explaining the calls

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.089 
really go into explaining the calls
specifically<00:03:42.510> there<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.379> plenty<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.830> places

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
specifically there is plenty of places

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.399 
specifically there is plenty of places
on<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.519> internet<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.150> called<00:03:45.720> books<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.230> so

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
on the internet and called books and so

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.649 
on the internet and called books and so
on<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.069> take<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.700> for<00:03:47.940> granted<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.450> you

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
on so I take it for granted that you

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.839 
on so I take it for granted that you
already<00:03:49.079> know<00:03:49.319> these<00:03:49.530> fairly<00:03:50.099> simple<00:03:50.459> chords

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
already know these fairly simple chords

00:03:50.849 --> 00:04:01.910 
already know these fairly simple chords
so<00:03:51.659> we<00:03:51.900> go<00:03:52.049> to<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.290> b7<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:56.329> gone.i<00:03:57.680> 2<00:03:58.680> 3<00:03:59.370> 4<00:03:59.970> p7<00:04:00.780> 2

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
so we go to the b7 and gone.i 2 3 4 p7 2

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.850 
so we go to the b7 and gone.i 2 3 4 p7 2
