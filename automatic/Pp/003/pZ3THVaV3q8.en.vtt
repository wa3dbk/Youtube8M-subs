00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.339 
think I put peppers on the bottom I'm
not<00:03:49.360> sure<00:03:49.510> what<00:03:49.750> I'm<00:03:49.840> learning<00:03:49.930> about<00:03:50.109> them

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
not sure what I'm learning about them

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.990 
not sure what I'm learning about them
I'm<00:03:50.470> sorry<00:03:50.739> but<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.099> darkest<00:03:51.519> color<00:03:51.730> went<00:03:51.940> on

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
I'm sorry but the darkest color went on

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.050 
I'm sorry but the darkest color went on
the<00:03:52.120> bottom<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:53.620> don't<00:03:53.799> know<00:03:54.129> you<00:03:54.190> guys<00:03:54.519> but

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
the bottom and I don't know you guys but

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.420 
the bottom and I don't know you guys but
I<00:03:55.299> should<00:03:55.780> have<00:03:55.930> gotten<00:03:56.140> more<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:57.010> die

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
I should have gotten more of this die

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.110 
I should have gotten more of this die
because<00:03:58.299> my<00:03:58.450> die<00:03:58.720> was<00:03:59.170> so<00:03:59.530> watery<00:04:00.040> it<00:04:00.370> was<00:04:00.519> the

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
because my die was so watery it was the

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.809 
because my die was so watery it was the
consistency<00:04:01.959> of<00:04:02.109> a<00:04:02.470> water<00:04:02.799> bottle<00:04:03.099> so<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.730> was

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
consistency of a water bottle so it was

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.339 
consistency of a water bottle so it was
just<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.150> hard<00:04:04.359> for<00:04:04.450> me<00:04:04.599> to<00:04:04.629> apply<00:04:05.049> it<00:04:05.109> on<00:04:05.230> the

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
just so hard for me to apply it on the

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.819 
just so hard for me to apply it on the
brush<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:06.780> yeah<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:08.019> was<00:04:08.049> just<00:04:08.319> difficult<00:04:08.470> so

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
brush and yeah it was just difficult so

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.349 
brush and yeah it was just difficult so
I<00:04:08.890> didn't<00:04:09.069> really<00:04:09.160> get<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.370> record<00:04:09.760> much<00:04:10.000> but

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
I didn't really get to record much but

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.580 
I didn't really get to record much but
you<00:04:10.480> know<00:04:10.599> I<00:04:10.840> just<00:04:12.480> applied<00:04:13.480> it<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:14.230> darkest

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
you know I just applied it the darkest

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.060 
you know I just applied it the darkest
color<00:04:14.799> on<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:14.980> bottom<00:04:15.129> and<00:04:15.489> then<00:04:15.579> applied<00:04:15.910> the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
color on the bottom and then applied the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.949 
color on the bottom and then applied the
other<00:04:18.070> part<00:04:18.430> on<00:04:18.579> the<00:04:18.669> top<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.180> that's<00:04:19.660> pretty

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
other part on the top and that's pretty

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.200 
other part on the top and that's pretty
much<00:04:20.169> what<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.470> got<00:04:20.829> I<00:04:21.130> don't<00:04:21.370> know<00:04:21.579> why<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:21.940> was

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
much what I got I don't know why it was

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.990 
much what I got I don't know why it was
so<00:04:22.270> thin<00:04:22.900> I've<00:04:23.320> seen<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.680> lot<00:04:23.950> of<00:04:24.010> videos<00:04:24.220> with<00:04:24.789> a

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
so thin I've seen a lot of videos with a

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000 
so thin I've seen a lot of videos with a
door<00:04:25.410> solution<00:04:26.410> being<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.710> little<00:04:26.919> more

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
door solution being a little more

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.529 
door solution being a little more
thicker<00:04:27.280> maybe<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.700> got<00:04:27.849> a<00:04:27.910> different<00:04:28.330> solution

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
thicker maybe I got a different solution

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.810 
thicker maybe I got a different solution
I<00:04:28.780> don't<00:04:28.960> know<00:04:29.050> but<00:04:29.260> I<00:04:29.410> just<00:04:29.440> did<00:04:29.830> not<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:30.340> could
