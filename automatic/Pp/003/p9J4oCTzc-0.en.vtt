00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
unique because of course its title there

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.000 
unique because of course its title there
are<00:00:27.060> hardly<00:00:27.269> any<00:00:27.480> rivers<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.380> run<00:00:28.439> through

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
are hardly any rivers that run through
