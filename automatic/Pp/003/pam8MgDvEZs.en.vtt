point<00:03:54.330> throughout<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.870> series<00:03:55.320> I'm<00:03:55.590> sure

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
point throughout the series I'm sure

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.460 
point throughout the series I'm sure
which<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.720> know<00:03:57.810> I'm<00:03:58.080> not<00:03:58.260> too<00:03:58.440> thrilled

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
about but hey I think it's kind of

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.920 
about but hey I think it's kind of
unavoidable<00:04:00.870> when<00:04:01.320> you<00:04:01.490> suddenly<00:04:02.900> create<00:04:03.900> a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
unavoidable when you suddenly create a

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.770 
unavoidable when you suddenly create a
huge<00:04:04.470> army<00:04:04.740> of<00:04:05.150> crazy<00:04:07.130> super-powered<00:04:08.130> females
