00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.869
 and show the possible solutions 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.749
 When creating a score, it is best to write all the notes of 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:29.800
 joints 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.780
 dynamic lyrics encryption of chords and so on before thinking about the design 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.910
 of the score 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.880
 the primary objective is simplicity 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.130
 that the score is easy to read and that there are no overlays 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.270
 you should also avoid half-empty pages occupied only by one or two 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.270
 staves 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.220
 when formatting the score always change the global parameters first 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.490
 and then make small adjustments if necessary 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.750
 I'm going to use this score to show how to solve some 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.820
 usual design problems 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.510
 the first thing you see in this score is that in many empty compasses 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.860
 when one more and strum then they are not touching 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.900
 I can hide these empty compasses which will save space nation 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.170
 dear style avoid the general style tab sheet music 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.200
 from the box on the left 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.340
 click on conjugate empty staves and hit affect 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.470
 automatically the design of the score has changed substantially 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.170
 now I have a loose system at the end 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.860
 I see that there is a lot of free space in the first two sheets so I'm going to 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.360
 change some parameters so that the last system happened to be in the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.470
 page 2 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.150
 there are several options 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.630
 I can bet the distance between staves ie 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.500
 between individual instruments 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.970
 with just distance between systems ie groups of instruments 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.230
 or the distance between the letters and the upper staff today inside 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.079
 I'm going to start with the letters 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:19.229
 the overturn between the text and the lower staff is quite broad 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.639
 I would reduce it to save space 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.790
 buoy style avoid the general style tab page 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.469
 many of the parameters of the format are here 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.840
 and it's a good idea to experiment with each of them until you find the 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:38.509
 solution that fits best with the score that they are making 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:43.049
 I'm going to reduce the lower margin of the letters to 'f1' zero point 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.419
 when clicking apply you will see the changes on the screen behind the window 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.640
 now adjust the distance between systems 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.359
 going to style 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.169
 avoid the general style 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.849
 page tab 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.849
 this time reduces the distance between systems 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:05.239
 Now, when you click on Apply, it looks like the last staff placed at the end of 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.859
 the second page 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:08.949
 by last 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.949
 I'm going to adjust the design of the last measures 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:16.299
 I want the compass 17 this one in the last system 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.250
 and I can move it manually 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.250
 creating a staff jump in the previous measure 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.689
 to do so I click on the palette saints and spacer 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.609
 selected the staff jump and dragged it to the beat that 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.609
 interest 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.249
 Now that I have the score with the right design, I can move on to 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:38.029
 print them 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:42.349
 In the second part of this video we will deal with other usual aspects of 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.200
 design of ada exhibition halls andrade 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.869

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:49.720
 is 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.720
