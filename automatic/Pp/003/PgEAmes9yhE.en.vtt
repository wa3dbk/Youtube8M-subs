00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
effective and it takes great pictures

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.570 
effective and it takes great pictures
the<00:01:13.290> picture<00:01:13.590> quality<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.130> any<00:01:14.310> better

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the picture quality is not any better

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.429 
the picture quality is not any better
than<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> standard<00:01:16.400> camera<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:18.439> existent

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
than the standard camera but existent

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.810 
than the standard camera but existent
the<00:01:19.830> simplest<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.490> other<00:01:22.189> so<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the simplest the other so there is the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.560 
the simplest the other so there is the
camera<00:01:24.000> button<00:01:25.729> like<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:28.759> okay<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.390> let's

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
camera button like that okay and let's

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.060 
camera button like that okay and let's
save<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.020> image<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.500> check<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.860> image

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
save the image you can check the image

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.219 
save the image you can check the image
there<00:01:32.479> it's<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.720> picture<00:01:33.990> my<00:01:34.140> desk<00:01:34.430> and

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
there it's just a picture my desk and

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.149 
there it's just a picture my desk and
then<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.439> change<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.740> over<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.009> video

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
then you can change it over the video

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.160 
then you can change it over the video
here<00:01:40.159> okay<00:01:41.159> I've<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.210> go<00:01:42.570> straight<00:01:42.930> into
