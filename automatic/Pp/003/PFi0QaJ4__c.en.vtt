some ideas you guys I mean there are
there<00:01:40.000> are<00:01:40.149> tens<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.690> thousands<00:01:41.289> of<00:01:41.380> records

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
there are tens of thousands of records

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.710 
there are tens of thousands of records
out<00:01:41.950> there<00:01:42.160> and<00:01:42.340> give<00:01:42.520> us<00:01:42.610> World<00:01:42.819> Records<00:01:43.209> Oh

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
out there and give us World Records Oh

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.630 
out there and give us World Records Oh
which<00:01:44.530> we<00:01:44.679> really<00:01:44.950> privileged<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.459> work<00:01:45.580> with

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
which we really privileged to work with

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.699 
which we really privileged to work with
they<00:01:46.209> just<00:01:46.450> maintain<00:01:46.899> all<00:01:47.080> of<00:01:47.110> these<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.590> so

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
they just maintain all of these and so

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:49.380 
they just maintain all of these and so
is<00:01:47.890> really<00:01:48.130> tricky<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.700> try<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.000> come<00:01:49.149> up<00:01:49.179> with

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
is really tricky to try and come up with

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.510 
is really tricky to try and come up with
what<00:01:49.929> will<00:01:50.080> be<00:01:50.229> on<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.590> best<00:01:50.920> collection<00:01:51.220> the

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
what will be on the best collection the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.520 
what will be on the best collection the
best<00:01:51.729> early<00:01:51.970> on<00:01:52.119> body<00:01:52.300> record<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:52.780> do<00:01:52.929> so<00:01:53.380> what

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
best early on body record to do so what

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.199 
best early on body record to do so what
we<00:01:53.619> do<00:01:53.740> we<00:01:53.770> took<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.250> different<00:01:54.759> look<00:01:54.850> at<00:01:55.000> it<00:01:55.090> and

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
we do we took a different look at it and

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.840 
we do we took a different look at it and
sort<00:01:55.450> of<00:01:55.539> think<00:01:55.750> what<00:01:56.170> inputs<00:01:56.800> what<00:01:57.069> controls

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
sort of think what inputs what controls

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.910 
sort of think what inputs what controls
you<00:01:58.090> think<00:01:58.330> a<00:01:58.450> really<00:01:58.720> fun<00:01:58.929> so<00:01:59.530> we've<00:01:59.649> got<00:01:59.770> like

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
you think a really fun so we've got like

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.740 
you think a really fun so we've got like
I'm<00:02:00.100> pushing<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.640> pulling<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.060> lifting<00:02:01.569> and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
I'm pushing and pulling and lifting and

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.969 
I'm pushing and pulling and lifting and
all<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:01.990> kind<00:02:02.200> of<00:02:02.259> stuff<00:02:02.319> and<00:02:02.470> so<00:02:02.740> we<00:02:02.830> thought

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
all that kind of stuff and so we thought

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.710 
all that kind of stuff and so we thought
we'll<00:02:03.369> take<00:02:03.610> that<00:02:03.759> trap<00:02:04.060> will<00:02:04.300> make<00:02:04.509> their

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
we'll take that trap will make their

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.960 
we'll take that trap will make their
games<00:02:04.959> based<00:02:05.349> about<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.860> inputs<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.880> we've

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
games based about the inputs so we've

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.210 
games based about the inputs so we've
got<00:02:07.090> like<00:02:07.240> 35<00:02:07.690> 36<00:02:08.170> different<00:02:08.470> games<00:02:08.860> on<00:02:09.039> each

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
got like 35 36 different games on each

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.250 
got like 35 36 different games on each
one's<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.640> very<00:02:10.000> different<00:02:10.420> control<00:02:10.720> mechanism

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
one's a very different control mechanism

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.650 
one's a very different control mechanism
that<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:12.040> intuitive<00:02:12.670> but<00:02:13.060> actually<00:02:13.390> makes<00:02:13.540> you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
that is intuitive but actually makes you

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.559 
that is intuitive but actually makes you
really<00:02:13.900> feel
