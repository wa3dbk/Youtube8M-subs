00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello year to our channel and in honor 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.899
 This I decided to do something about what you long ago 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.040
 have requested 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.780
 it is the contest that I myself am very much about it 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.509
 thought a lot thought what people want 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.699
 participate something interesting and recently 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.210
 in one of my videos I talked about 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.769
 the idea 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.529
 to make prizes as a gift 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.310
 games in the incentive and now I finally matured 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.640
 ready to arrange a competition with a draw 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.100
 I hope everyone has steam games 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.780
 because there is a certain effect 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.399
 limit on gifts a month first 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.770
 register to receive something 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.079
 so get ready in advance 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.800
 And now to the very competition that's this 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.719
 it will be and it will be a drawing contest 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.449
 draw me all all once 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.780
 drew so i think this is for starters 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.280
 the most wonderful thing about my 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.989
 VKontakte group will be made 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.710
 special photo album throw here 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.840
 so as not to be lost in any way 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.080
 link to the group as usual here 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.510
 here's the video will be in the description of what you need 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.560
 draw and draw need something 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.750
 About our channel it can be a factory 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.640
 heroes 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.909
 bionicles anything can be it 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.300
 no Lego all that you saw in my 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.850
 reviews 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.110
 video anything can be you 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.240
 want to draw the hero's horses from the game 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.660
 which I did not review but you would like 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.600
 so I'm reviewing then drawing it 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.850
 somehow link it to my channel but 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.450
 and even if you think you can't 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.880
 completely draw know what beauty 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.410
 drawing for me is not the most important thing 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.670
 Of course it is important but it is not the most important thing 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:58.060
 the main thing is this idea that it was 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.950
 so that's cool well, that is, either draw 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.740
 any masterpiece or draw 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.020
 anything with a mega cool idea and yes not 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.010
 forget to add descriptions to your 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.770
 drawing so I understand what 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.750
 depicted if there is something like that 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.890
 complicated and intricate so in 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.290
 Basically, here is such a simple 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.450
 competition 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.800
 a flight of fancy, I look to you for your 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.780
 drawings important remember the group 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.270
 a special album I'll create everything about it 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.690
 and make a special topic 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.690
 that there suddenly arise 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.880
 questions about the competition so that it is not somewhere 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.830
 on the wall was exactly special 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.110
 subject so that the person of wanted something 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.810
 ask he went read found the answer 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.970
 which and so what will we have 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.150
 specifically in the prizes you already understand something 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.030

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.450

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.170

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.540

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.730
 rubles for the first place any game on 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.810

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.060
 First, let's see how it goes 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.239

 you can lay out as many works 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.720
 but quantity is not the main thing as 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.519
 I already said this idea and then later on 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.910
 the second place is already the design itself 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.610

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.860

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.039
 I will immediately say that the competition so to speak 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.380

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.690
 general competition interesting because already 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.090
 I have plans to arrange such 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.139
 contests 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:58.510
 each month depends of course on your 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:01.520
 desires and i already thought that 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:05.600
 next month in October will be eve 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.970

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.030
 Of course there will be a certain contest 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.479
 there may be prizes already 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.639
 weight and or virtual and material 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:20.060
 it all again depends on your 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:23.300
 interest completion again remind 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.130
 all competition is brief and so we enter 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.240
 VKontakte group here it is here 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.919
 video in the description where it is in the second 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.200
 find a special photo album and 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.110
 add there your work well, of course 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.360
 draw them first then add to 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.300
 Third, do not forget that in the picture 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.580
 should reflect that what concerns 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.400
 my channel that is 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.530
 drawing can be about anything but that 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.449
 that it is connected to my channel it must 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.349
 be somehow displayed 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:56.180
 and the fourth winner is the first 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:58.370
 place will get the game for 300 rubles 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.949
 the runner- up will get 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.419
 game for 250 rubles and the winner who won 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:07.520
 third place will get the game up to 150 rubles 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.279
 whichever place you take 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.289
 choose the game yourself 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:13.460
 so we will have three winners 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.009
 accordingly there will be three games in 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.620
 draw which you can choose yourself 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.129
 and do not worry if I will not put 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.080
 likes under your work because not 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:27.460
 I think that this is relevant during the competition 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.240
 then yes then it is possible because if 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.400
 start myself 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.919
 like some specific work this 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.099
 may confuse other participants it is not 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:39.379
 quite beautiful so as if so 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:41.629
 I say at the time of the competition 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:44.300
 of the competition will not touch nor to 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:48.110
 that is, the video will not say anything either 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.629
 what about you participating no distraction 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.899
 no matter what my reviews are 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:55.399
 for the rest I dare not hold you 

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:58.539
 pick up pencils and pens 

00:06:55.399 --> 00:07:04.370
 paint pens and maybe 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:06.990
 mouse I wrote on the computer and let's 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.380
