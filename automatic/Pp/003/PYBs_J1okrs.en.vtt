really need to and i need to do this a

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.949 
really need to and i need to do this a
lot<00:02:46.130> actually<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.910> see<00:02:47.300> both<00:02:47.480> sides<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:47.870> the

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
lot actually is see both sides of the

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.890 
lot actually is see both sides of the
story<00:02:48.200> before<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.220> jumped<00:02:49.580> in<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.910> you<00:02:50.750> know

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
story before I jumped in and you know

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.170 
story before I jumped in and you know
the<00:02:51.320> Internet<00:02:51.709> can<00:02:52.010> can<00:02:52.459> have<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.700> boolean

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
the Internet can can have a boolean

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.060 
the Internet can can have a boolean
characteristic<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.170> crowd<00:02:54.440> behavior<00:02:54.650> and

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
characteristic and crowd behavior and

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.600 
characteristic and crowd behavior and
I've<00:02:55.130> learned<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:57.220> so<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.250> think<00:02:58.400> that

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
I've learned that and so I think that

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.820 
I've learned that and so I think that
this<00:02:58.820> is<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:59.030> great<00:02:59.120> way<00:02:59.330> for<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.260> photographer

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
this is a great way for the photographer

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.710 
this is a great way for the photographer
to<00:03:01.040> come<00:03:01.549> into<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.880> community<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.450> she

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
to come into the community and she

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.449 
to come into the community and she
basically<00:03:02.840> said<00:03:03.440> she<00:03:03.560> came<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.890> Kelowna<00:03:04.190> to

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
basically said she came to Kelowna to

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.590 
basically said she came to Kelowna to
start<00:03:04.760> over<00:03:04.940> um<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:07.640> know<00:03:07.670> so<00:03:08.299> she<00:03:08.360> put

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
start over um and you know so she put

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.160 
start over um and you know so she put
this<00:03:08.870> event<00:03:09.019> up<00:03:09.290> in<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.680> our<00:03:09.950> local<00:03:10.780> page<00:03:11.780> and

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
this event up in in our local page and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.620 
this event up in in our local page and
just<00:03:12.380> got<00:03:12.620> pummeled<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:13.940> I<00:03:14.180> think<00:03:14.299> that

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
just got pummeled and so I think that

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.960 
just got pummeled and so I think that
this<00:03:14.930> will<00:03:15.110> be<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.260> great<00:03:15.470> way<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.970> have

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
this will be a great way to have

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.370 
this will be a great way to have
something<00:03:17.330> really<00:03:17.480> good<00:03:17.720> come<00:03:17.959> out<00:03:18.080> of<00:03:18.140> this

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
now the thing that was really tough to

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.039 
now the thing that was really tough to
hear<00:03:21.280> was<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.510> people<00:03:23.510> were<00:03:23.690> threatening

back where you came from things like

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.390 
back where you came from things like
that<00:03:32.810> and

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
that and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.360 
that and
of<00:03:34.269> course<00:03:34.540> have<00:03:34.659> brought<00:03:34.870> on<00:03:35.019> tears<00:03:35.349> and<00:03:35.709> it's

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
of course have brought on tears and it's

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.630 
of course have brought on tears and it's
just<00:03:36.579> very<00:03:36.730> very<00:03:36.849> hurtful<00:03:37.269> so<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.950> think<00:03:39.310> that

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
just very very hurtful so I think that

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.009 
just very very hurtful so I think that
now<00:03:39.849> we<00:03:40.810> will<00:03:41.170> have<00:03:41.379> an<00:03:41.500> event<00:03:41.799> that<00:03:41.890> will

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
now we will have an event that will

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.240 
now we will have an event that will
benefit<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.140> lot<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.349> people<00:03:44.470> as<00:03:44.739> result<00:03:45.159> of

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
benefit a lot of people as result of

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.640 
benefit a lot of people as result of
this<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.720> I've<00:03:46.720> learned<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.110> lesson<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.590> I

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
this and I've learned a lesson and I

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.229 
this and I've learned a lesson and I
think<00:03:47.890> that<00:03:48.040> it's<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:48.670> going<00:03:48.939> to<00:03:49.030> turn<00:03:49.180> into

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
think that it's it's going to turn into
