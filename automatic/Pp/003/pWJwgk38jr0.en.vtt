that's<00:00:30.779> true<00:00:31.019> what<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.250> typically<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.940> my

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that's true what I see typically with my

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.660 
that's true what I see typically with my
clients<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.890> they're<00:00:34.890> they've<00:00:35.460> lost

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
clients is that they're they've lost

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.729 
clients is that they're they've lost
their<00:00:35.850> jobs<00:00:36.120> which<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> reason<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.170> they

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
their jobs which is the reason that they

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.040 
their jobs which is the reason that they
defaulted<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.399> their<00:00:38.550> mortgages<00:00:39.000> but<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
defaulted on their mortgages but it's a

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.630 
defaulted on their mortgages but it's a
combination<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.680> both<00:00:40.739> reasons<00:00:41.399> actually

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
combination of both reasons actually

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.090 
combination of both reasons actually
because<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.780> toxic<00:00:43.170> mortgages<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
because the toxic mortgages and the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.889 
because the toxic mortgages and the
types<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.640> mortgages<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.510> subprime

many borrowers were adjustable rate
mortgages<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:52.010> that<00:00:53.010> went<00:00:53.190> from<00:00:53.370> let's<00:00:53.610> say

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
mortgages that that went from let's say

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.209 
mortgages that that went from let's say
two<00:00:53.760> percent<00:00:54.329> four<00:00:54.539> percent<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.350> nine<00:00:55.770> percent

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
two percent four percent to nine percent

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.040 
two percent four percent to nine percent
ten<00:00:56.430> percent<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.030> not<00:00:57.420> only<00:00:57.660> could<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:57.899> not

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
ten percent so not only could they not

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.389 
ten percent so not only could they not
afford<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.500> mortgage<00:00:58.800> even<00:00:59.070> when<00:00:59.219> they<00:00:59.340> were

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
afford the mortgage even when they were

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
afford the mortgage even when they were
working<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.629> they've<00:01:00.809> lost<00:01:00.960> their<00:01:01.140> jobs

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
working but now they've lost their jobs

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.200 
working but now they've lost their jobs
it's<00:01:01.710> made<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.010> absolutely<00:01:02.219> impossible<00:01:02.820> for

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
it's made it absolutely impossible for

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.369 
it's made it absolutely impossible for
them<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> keep<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> mortgage

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
them to keep up with the mortgage

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.840 
them to keep up with the mortgage
payments<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> other<00:01:05.729> thing

payments and you know the other thing

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.880 
payments and you know the other thing
that<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> consider<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> sort

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that we have to consider here is a sort

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.730 
that we have to consider here is a sort
of<00:01:07.950> dichotomy<00:01:08.270> between<00:01:09.270> being<00:01:09.840> part<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
of dichotomy between being part of a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.280 
of dichotomy between being part of a
global<00:01:10.950> economy<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:11.729> also<00:01:11.880> being<00:01:12.869> part<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
global economy but also being part of a

global economy but also being part of a
global<00:01:13.439> workforce<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.670> know<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.939> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
global workforce and you know this is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.690 
global workforce and you know this is
where<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.479> lot<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.040> American<00:01:17.040> employees<00:01:17.340> get

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
where a lot of American employees get

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.940 
where a lot of American employees get
screwed<00:01:18.180> because<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.630> outsourcing<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.619> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
screwed because of outsourcing and you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.440 
screwed because of outsourcing and you
know<00:01:20.040> most<00:01:20.189> reports<00:01:20.640> say<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> jobs<00:01:21.240> will

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
know most reports say that the jobs will

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
know most reports say that the jobs will
continue<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> migrate<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> other<00:01:22.770> areas<00:01:22.920> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
continue to migrate to other areas of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.039 
continue to migrate to other areas of
the<00:01:23.490> world<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.180> seems<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.780> becoming

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the world so it seems like it's becoming

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.999 
the world so it seems like it's becoming
the<00:01:25.229> sort<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.500> vicious<00:01:25.830> cycle<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.790> way

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
the sort of vicious cycle in a way

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.469 
the sort of vicious cycle in a way
that's<00:01:29.009> definitely<00:01:29.430> true<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.119> what

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
that's definitely true and you know what

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
that's definitely true and you know what
scares<00:01:30.780> me<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.200> think<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.100> trend<00:01:32.430> now

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
scares me is I think that the trend now

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.399 
scares me is I think that the trend now
I<00:01:32.700> mean<00:01:32.970> what<00:01:33.119> we're<00:01:33.270> seeing<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.689> that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
I mean what we're seeing is that that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.080 
I mean what we're seeing is that that
Americans<00:01:34.860> continue<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.490> lose<00:01:35.640> their<00:01:35.880> jobs

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
Americans continue to lose their jobs

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.230 
Americans continue to lose their jobs
and<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.689> has<00:01:37.380> not<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.340> bet<00:01:38.670> has<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.030> gotten

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and that has not that bet has not gotten

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.760 
and that has not that bet has not gotten
better<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.049> employment<00:01:40.500> rate<00:01:40.590> has

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
better the the employment rate has

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.830 
better the the employment rate has
continued<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.400> increase<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.689> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
continued to increase and what that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.780 
continued to increase and what that
means<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:44.130> homeowners<00:01:44.610> will

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
means is that that homeowners will

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.819 
means is that that homeowners will
continue<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> default<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.259> their<00:01:46.380> mortgages
