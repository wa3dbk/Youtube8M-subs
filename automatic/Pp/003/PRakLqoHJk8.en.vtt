00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello to all and all these debates his 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.140
 motion for august for a new video 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.240
 on gta 5 and i showed you big caps 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.120
 the locations of the hidden weapons of 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.640
 class the golf club with and I you 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.650
 show the location it's right here 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.630
 so I comment after doing the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.699
 video since after otherwise it's too much 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.519
 too boring so he's at the golf club 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.289
 there are several techniques either you the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:36.870
 do not do it like that the shutter is you 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:38.820
 you make a shot of the gulf that will you 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.200
 will have them in your inventory and the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.210
 machine at the baseball bat I know 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.010
 at multiple locations but me 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.660
 I found this one it's me who has it 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.360
 found low can resist continuing 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.969
 for the crumpled leaves of the toilets 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.379
 and then hey I find the cloud and 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.270
 contrite location and you have the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.280
 baseball bat gisti signing them 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.230
 falls lay like that quietly 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.300
 I came out no it's just after 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.580
 I had the baseball bat these 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.840
 balls when I went to the ball 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.970
 land in may of my stuff 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.250
 then boats do not have the crowbar 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.350
 that I had found on a forum about 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.869
 jeuxvideo.com 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.590
 yes it had spoken to me and he said aire 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.150
 under the intersection is little sought I 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.470
 will search for the effect that you 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.119
 go back a bit to react 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.340
 found the crowbar like that at 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.009
 ask then I was good and we put 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.390
 six new propagated and there in this 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.390
 trial all filmed 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.750
 that on a video I was looking forward to tomorrow 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.450
 without doing it down here and then I 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.710
 am saying well why not put in 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.370
 place since it is a hidden weapon 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.770
 I was not going to obviously leave that as 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.910
 that's in plan since that's when 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.260
 even a hidden weapon that can not be 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.360
 unlock with the campane lake or in 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.860
 buying times go get them and has 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.030
 no way to have them there 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 several locations not for the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.230
 motorcycle buddy all that is 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.550
 crowbar 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.380
 just like that there is also the hammer 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.390
 but only to blocks and special edition 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.100
 we seem and here we are so I have 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.120
 tested do not hesitate to subscribe to the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.760
