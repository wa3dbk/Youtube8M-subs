it so I think that's pretty cool um all

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.120 
it so I think that's pretty cool um all
list<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.899> show<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.439> line<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.860> this

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
list you can show it in a line like this

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.969 
list you can show it in a line like this
but<00:01:44.430> press<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.970> button<00:01:46.369> my<00:01:47.369> bad<00:01:48.470> it<00:01:49.470> shows<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979
