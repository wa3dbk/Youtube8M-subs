for<00:01:20.700> its<00:01:21.060> recovery<00:01:21.479> partition<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.979> I'm

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
for its recovery partition so I'm

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550 
for its recovery partition so I'm
assuming<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.090> install<00:01:24.509> windows<00:01:25.020> seven

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
assuming if you install windows seven

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.490 
assuming if you install windows seven
instead<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:27.000> should<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.420> 20<00:01:27.930> gigs<00:01:28.200> more

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
instead you should have 20 gigs more

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.830 
instead you should have 20 gigs more
available<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.310> your<00:01:29.430> storage<00:01:29.850> which<00:01:30.450> is

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
available for your storage which is

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.890 
available for your storage which is
awesome<00:01:31.140> um<00:01:31.979> even<00:01:32.400> though<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.939> think<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.600> still

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
awesome um even though I think I still

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.109 
awesome um even though I think I still
would<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.890> more<00:01:35.189> memory<00:01:35.520> than<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.970> do

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
would like to have more memory than I do

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.170 
would like to have more memory than I do
so<00:01:36.900> if<00:01:37.229> you're<00:01:37.409> not<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.740> Arras<00:01:38.040> i<00:01:38.430> would<00:01:39.030> say

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
so if you're not in Arras i would say

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.920 
so if you're not in Arras i would say
probably<00:01:39.210> wait<00:01:40.020> until<00:01:40.640> i<00:01:41.640> 7<00:01:42.240> version<00:01:42.450> comes

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
probably wait until i 7 version comes

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.600 
probably wait until i 7 version comes

i<00:02:19.940> read<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.180> question<00:02:20.720> about<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
i read a question about it in the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.009 
i read a question about it in the
comments<00:02:21.800> area<00:02:22.099> below<00:02:22.430> my<00:02:22.730> first<00:02:23.209> video<00:02:23.480> ah

but you might have a different

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.420 
but you might have a different
experience<00:02:26.300> about<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.500> just<00:02:27.560> try<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.220> out

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
experience about it so just try it out

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.190 
experience about it so just try it out

for yourself ah Barry a better life is
decent<00:02:33.739> ah<00:02:34.010> for<00:02:34.489> this<00:02:34.640> computer<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.959> takes

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
decent ah for this computer it takes

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.050 
decent ah for this computer it takes
about<00:02:36.349> two<00:02:36.769> and<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.950> half<00:02:36.980> hours<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.819> fully

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
about two and a half hours to fully

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.020 
about two and a half hours to fully
charge<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:39.019> battery<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:39.799> then<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.459> lasts

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
charge the battery and then it lasts

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.420 
charge the battery and then it lasts
about<00:02:41.150> six<00:02:41.330> hours<00:02:41.870> on<00:02:42.319> a<00:02:42.349> battery<00:02:42.650> saving<00:02:43.099> mode

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
about six hours on a battery saving mode

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.729 
about six hours on a battery saving mode
and<00:02:43.760> there<00:02:44.450> was<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.599> question<00:02:45.019> though<00:02:45.500> on<00:02:45.620> my

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
and there was a question though on my

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.270 
and there was a question though on my
first<00:02:46.040> video<00:02:46.579> um<00:02:47.120> if<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:48.019> makes<00:02:48.260> any<00:02:48.500> noise<00:02:48.620> and

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
first video um if it makes any noise and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.509 
first video um if it makes any noise and
it<00:02:49.489> doesn't<00:02:50.000> it's<00:02:50.599> super<00:02:50.989> silent<00:02:51.260> because<00:02:52.130> it

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
it doesn't it's super silent because it

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.850 
it doesn't it's super silent because it
had<00:02:52.760> only<00:02:53.120> solid<00:02:53.750> state<00:02:53.989> drive<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.500> doesn't

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
had only solid state drive it doesn't

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.339 
had only solid state drive it doesn't
have<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.340> hard<00:02:56.209> drive<00:02:56.299> in<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:57.110> would<00:02:57.290> have

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
have a hard drive in it that would have

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.330 
have a hard drive in it that would have
moving<00:02:58.040> parts<00:02:58.069> in<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.730> um<00:02:59.709> yes<00:03:00.709> it<00:03:00.950> doesn't

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
moving parts in it um yes it doesn't

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.180 
moving parts in it um yes it doesn't
make<00:03:01.459> any<00:03:01.700> noise<00:03:01.879> because<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.720> that<00:03:02.870> on<00:03:03.200> the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
make any noise because of that on the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.900 
make any noise because of that on the
and<00:03:05.030> also<00:03:05.450> solid<00:03:06.049> state<00:03:06.470> drive<00:03:06.769> makes<00:03:07.640> it

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
and also solid state drive makes it

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.930 
and also solid state drive makes it
faster<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:09.110> quick<00:03:09.410> stop<00:03:09.739> within<00:03:10.069> two

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
faster on a quick stop within two

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.440 
faster on a quick stop within two
seconds<00:03:11.510> after<00:03:11.750> sleep<00:03:12.500> mode<00:03:12.769> or<00:03:13.099> um<00:03:14.060> after

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
seconds after sleep mode or um after

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.750 
seconds after sleep mode or um after
it's<00:03:14.959> like<00:03:15.019> hooli<00:03:15.530> turned<00:03:15.769> off<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.250> will<00:03:16.489> boot

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
it's like hooli turned off it will boot

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.640 
it's like hooli turned off it will boot
in<00:03:16.970> about<00:03:17.239> eight<00:03:17.480> seconds<00:03:18.049> which<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.440> really

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
in about eight seconds which is really

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.050 
in about eight seconds which is really
fast<00:03:19.040> ah<00:03:20.500> then<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.530> does<00:03:21.950> get<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.340> little<00:03:22.609> warm

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
fast ah then it does get a little warm

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.720 
fast ah then it does get a little warm
when<00:03:23.359> I<00:03:23.389> use<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:23.900> like<00:03:24.079> on<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.440> couch<00:03:24.650> or<00:03:25.160> in<00:03:25.190> my

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
when I use it like on the couch or in my

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.390 
when I use it like on the couch or in my
bed<00:03:25.970> but<00:03:26.239> if<00:03:26.480> you're<00:03:26.690> not<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:27.109> lazy<00:03:27.350> user<00:03:27.829> like<00:03:28.190> I

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
bed but if you're not a lazy user like I

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.180 
bed but if you're not a lazy user like I
am<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:29.510> stays<00:03:29.810> pretty<00:03:30.049> cool<00:03:30.380> if<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.680> use<00:03:30.889> it<00:03:31.069> on

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
am it stays pretty cool if you use it on

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.199 
am it stays pretty cool if you use it on
the<00:03:31.220> desk<00:03:31.579> and<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.989> last<00:03:33.290> thing<00:03:33.799> is<00:03:33.859> a<00:03:34.730> few

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
the desk and the last thing is a few

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.460 
the desk and the last thing is a few
words<00:03:35.599> on<00:03:36.109> about<00:03:37.010> on<00:03:37.370> its<00:03:38.299> performance<00:03:39.170> in

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
words on about on its performance in

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.159 
words on about on its performance in
general<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.280> ran<00:03:40.700> windows<00:03:41.090> experience<00:03:41.750> index

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
general I ran windows experience index

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.610 
general I ran windows experience index
assessment<00:03:43.069> and<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.970> lowest<00:03:44.180> score<00:03:44.989> was<00:03:45.200> five

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
assessment and the lowest score was five

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.099 
assessment and the lowest score was five
point<00:03:46.040> five<00:03:46.310> out<00:03:46.639> of<00:03:46.700> nine<00:03:47.180> point<00:03:47.989> nine

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
point five out of nine point nine

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.370

possible<00:03:48.919> for<00:03:49.190> desktop<00:03:49.790> graphics<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:50.989> I<00:03:51.019> guess

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
possible for desktop graphics so I guess

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.430 
possible for desktop graphics so I guess
that's<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.829> little<00:03:52.040> downside<00:03:52.340> um<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:54.049> the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
that's a little downside um and the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.819 
that's a little downside um and the
high-scoring<00:03:55.099> was<00:03:55.209> 8.1<00:03:56.209> on<00:03:56.630> again<00:03:57.380> out<00:03:57.590> of

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
high-scoring was 8.1 on again out of

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.699 
high-scoring was 8.1 on again out of
nine<00:03:58.040> point<00:03:58.370> nine<00:03:58.430> possible<00:03:59.180> for<00:03:59.720> primary

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709
