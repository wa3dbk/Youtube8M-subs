mood of potential buyers of our cars so
for<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.160> reason<00:02:36.580> I'm<00:02:37.239> not<00:02:37.300> sure<00:02:37.810> if<00:02:38.080> we<00:02:38.320> see

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
for that reason I'm not sure if we see

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.830 
for that reason I'm not sure if we see
Russia<00:02:39.040> again<00:02:39.550> being<00:02:39.760> such<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> strong<00:02:40.420> market

as it had been last year so for that but

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.259 
as it had been last year so for that but
on<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.440> other<00:02:44.560> side<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:45.100> United<00:02:45.730> States<00:02:45.970> is

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
on the other side the United States is

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.970 
on the other side the United States is
an<00:02:46.390> excellent<00:02:46.720> market<00:02:47.170> for<00:02:47.350> us<00:02:47.470> Middle<00:02:47.830> East

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.620 
is in good shape and that comes all back
to<00:02:50.920> my<00:02:51.040> old<00:02:51.250> saying<00:02:51.549> you<00:02:51.970> should<00:02:52.150> never<00:02:52.330> put

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
to my old saying you should never put

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.870 
to my old saying you should never put
all<00:02:52.840> your<00:02:52.930> eggs<00:02:53.080> in<00:02:53.290> one<00:02:53.410> basket<00:02:53.700> make<00:02:54.700> sure

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
all your eggs in one basket make sure

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.720 
all your eggs in one basket make sure
that<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.209> are<00:02:55.330> globally<00:02:55.750> nicely<00:02:56.140> balanced

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
that you are globally nicely balanced

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.650 
that you are globally nicely balanced
when<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.820> look<00:02:58.000> at<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.180> Middle<00:02:58.390> East<00:02:58.540> you're

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
when you look at the Middle East you're

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.240 
when you look at the Middle East you're
not<00:02:58.840> being<00:02:59.110> affected<00:02:59.470> by<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.620> lower<00:02:59.830> price<00:03:00.100> of

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
not being affected by the lower price of

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.130 
not being affected by the lower price of
oil<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.610> mean<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.360> oil<00:03:01.510> price<00:03:01.750> now<00:03:01.989> is

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
oil I mean the oil price now is

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.890 
oil I mean the oil price now is
stabilizing<00:03:02.590> anyhow<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.489> it's<00:03:04.480> not<00:03:04.690> only

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
stabilizing anyhow and it's not only

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.960 
stabilizing anyhow and it's not only
about<00:03:05.200> oil<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:05.769> area<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.459> is<00:03:06.549> also<00:03:06.730> very

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
about oil in that area it is also very

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.550 
about oil in that area it is also very
much<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.329> course<00:03:07.360> about<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.930> stock<00:03:08.140> market

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
much of course about the stock market

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.590 
much of course about the stock market
the<00:03:08.650> stock<00:03:08.829> market<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:09.310> also<00:03:09.670> stabilizing<00:03:10.450> now

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
the stock market is also stabilizing now

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.930 
the stock market is also stabilizing now
and<00:03:10.870> for<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.709> reason<00:03:11.769> I'm<00:03:12.370> not<00:03:12.430> too<00:03:12.790> much

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
and for that reason I'm not too much

to see the same happening this year so

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.100 
to see the same happening this year so
it<00:03:47.800> will<00:03:47.950> take<00:03:48.190> some<00:03:48.490> time<00:03:48.540> until<00:03:49.540> this<00:03:49.660> effect

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
it will take some time until this effect

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.070 
it will take some time until this effect
really<00:03:50.350> goes<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.520> we<00:03:52.090> see<00:03:52.300> the<00:03:52.420> market<00:03:52.720> coming
