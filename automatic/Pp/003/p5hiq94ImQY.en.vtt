 hello dear reader what i here in the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.800
 holding hands is a rich smartphone in the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.670
 xxl format 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.720
 the device will be under 200 in april 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.080
 come out and is called 64 10 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 and 64 refers to the display size 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.730
 the diagonal of the screen with 64 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.910
 inches and thus the device plays in one 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.899
 big league with the sony xperia z ultra 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.120
 or the samsung galaxy mega, though 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.219
 brings the smartphone to the middle class 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.280
 equipment with such as 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.870
 also the galaxy tab of samsung so we 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.649
 for example have a hd display 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.809
 resolution 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.110
 we have one inside 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.320
 quadcore processor the mt 65 82 with 1.3 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.940
 gigahertz and only a gigabyte ram too 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.059
 the internal memory of the device is with 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.460
 four gigabytes very small for photos and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.680
 Music can, however, per 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.740
 micro sd card continue to make room 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.299
 only 9 3 millimeters make it 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.979
 Thick I think now in the well 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.920
 the biggest factor is not that big 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.390
 and it's made of plastic too 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.939
 if it's on the pictures right now 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.460
 Metallic brushed metallic looks 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.619
 this is a pure visual effect here 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.130
 we still see stereo speakers in 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.259
 the same direction emit an 8 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.020
 Megapixel camera is on board and on 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.790
 simple front LED lightning still sits 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.060
 a 2 megapixel camera as 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.730
 OS is Android 4.2 with one 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.630
 additional apps from 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.210
 archos installs this special feature 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.950
 Back buttons is the biggest factor 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.500
 owing to that one arrives 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.120
 a little better on the buttons ran and 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.490
 The device may be a retirement or 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.530
 the volume 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.530
 that was 164 10
