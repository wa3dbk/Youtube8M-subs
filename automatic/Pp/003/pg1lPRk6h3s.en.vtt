00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.460
 for many people spain is a 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.870
 first class tourist destination 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.680
 at the western end of the continent 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.690
 European 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.010
 the Iberian Peninsula almost separates 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.960
 completely Atlantic the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.220
 mediterranean so this one is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.220
 sometimes compared to a big lake 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.040
 the fish is always abundant along 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.750
 Spain's coastline and many 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.980
 cities own a fishing fleet 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.780
 very active 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.460
 but this traditional industry is 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.070
 supplanted for a long time by another 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.780
 activity tourism in some ports 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.290
 today my pleasure boats 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.310
 are more numerous than those fishing 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.570
 some vacationers do not want to 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.550
 walk the same time to join the 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.259
 beach and again recently the 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.729
 traders live tourism was 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.909
 ready to do anything to satisfy this kind of 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.710
 customer base 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.299
 that's why a lot of the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.970
 Spanish coasts disappeared under a 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.830
 continuous line of concrete 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.480
 and the most invading buildings do not 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.220
 are not all hotels but rather 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.570
 holiday apartments that are not 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.570
 occupied only a few weeks a year 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.730
 but Spain is something else 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.440
 that is it is a crowded Claude 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.390
 vast country full of contrasts that 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.590
 gives off an extraordinary charm as 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.590
 we are moving away from hordes of tourists 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.930
 even on the famous costa brava it remains 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.310
 some traditional villages as well 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.380
 that a few fishing ports still 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.759
 almost intact 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.439
 these places are very much appreciated by 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.060
 Spanish people themselves aware of 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.229
 heritage that they let loose during 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.420
 previous decades 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.130
 and now decided to stop any 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.130
 new urbanization on the coast 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.010
 on the coasts the local economy depends 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.570
 essentially tourism or the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.220
 population finds more easily 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.230
 jobs only in fishing or other 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.310
 industry 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.079
 today to find spain 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.609
 authentic you have to get away from the ribs 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.640
 and sink inwards 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.640
 land 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.760
 e 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.130
 in the center of spain the castile like 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.460
 his name reminds him is the land of 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.460
 castles 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.310
 this plateau windmills 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.579
 are still zealous about 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.579
 Heights 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.760
 in the north-east Spain is adorned with the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.620
 France by the natural barrier of 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.220
 Pyrenees where the snow often delays 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.220
 until spring 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.280
 north of the castile plateau the relief 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.570
 spicy in several mountain ranges 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.490
 in size and deep valleys 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.930
 trout fishing but it is not 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.930
 rare also to find coal 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.170
 the main broad- gauge network is 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.480
 operated by a state agency the 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.130
 renfe national railway network 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.360
 Spanish but other companies managed 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.989
 an important set of udm 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.989
 regional secondary 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.190
 the Spanish railways present 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.080
 so very varied aspects 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.080
 the traditional network is 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.880
 the new high-speed lines to 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.880
 normal spacing 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.970
 and the metric line
