00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
shinier than it used to be if you

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.990

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
before you see that my hair was really

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.500

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
used to just be so brittle and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.700 
used to just be so brittle and
everything<00:01:45.780> would<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:45.960> make<00:01:46.259> them<00:01:46.439> break
