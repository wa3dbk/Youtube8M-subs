his rocker kind of a guy like oh I've
kind<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.820> Riggs<00:01:33.500> maybe<00:01:34.500> well<00:01:34.650> maybe<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
kind of like Riggs maybe well maybe a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.649 
kind of like Riggs maybe well maybe a
little<00:01:34.979> bit<00:01:35.130> further<00:01:35.280> off<00:01:35.490> than<00:01:36.060> rigs<00:01:36.390> but

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
little bit further off than rigs but

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.350 
little bit further off than rigs but
kind<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.250> never<00:01:38.820> saw<00:01:39.090> him<00:01:39.210> as

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
kind of like that I never saw him as

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.990 
kind of like that I never saw him as
someone<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.659> actually<00:01:39.869> had<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> mental<00:01:41.000> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
someone that actually had a mental you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.080 
someone that actually had a mental you
no<00:01:42.119> problem<00:01:42.630> now<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> voices<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.490> his<00:01:44.579> head<00:01:44.640> I

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
no problem now the voices in his head I

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.910 
no problem now the voices in his head I
thought<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> voice<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.750> his<00:01:45.869> head<00:01:45.930> could<00:01:46.710> have

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
thought the voice in his head could have

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.340 
thought the voice in his head could have
worked<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.810> don't<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.110> does<00:01:49.290> because

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
worked I don't think it does because

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.490 
worked I don't think it does because
we've<00:01:50.250> seen<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.149> will<00:01:51.450> talk<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.960> himself<00:01:52.110> in

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
we've seen that will talk to himself in

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.330 
we've seen that will talk to himself in
his<00:01:52.590> head<00:01:53.180> so<00:01:54.180> again<00:01:54.829> we<00:01:55.829> know<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.250> this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
his head so again we know that this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.959 
his head so again we know that this
isn't<00:01:56.579> what<00:01:56.790> goes<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.360> his<00:01:57.479> head<00:01:58.969> it

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
isn't what goes on in his head it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.109 
isn't what goes on in his head it
doesn't<00:02:00.360> fit<00:02:00.540> with<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.290> know<00:02:01.409> passed

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
doesn't fit with the you know passed

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.120

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
white boxes as well so that means that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.920 
white boxes as well so that means that

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
done with one I don't know why we needed

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.670 
done with one I don't know why we needed
to<00:02:48.300> different<00:02:48.630> different<00:02:49.110> voices<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.590> his

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
head and more than that we don't have a

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.420 
head and more than that we don't have a
voice<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.290> his<00:02:52.470> head<00:02:52.560> that's<00:02:52.830> actually<00:02:53.220> his

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
voice in his head that's actually his

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.090 
voice in his head that's actually his
thought<00:02:54.060> process<00:02:54.739> because<00:02:55.739> these<00:02:55.830> are<00:02:55.980> just

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
thought process because these are just

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.120 
thought process because these are just
two<00:02:56.310> random<00:02:56.489> voices<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:57.180> say<00:02:57.390> things<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.130> he

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
two random voices that say things and he

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.660 
two random voices that say things and he
talks<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.700> them<00:03:00.800> it's<00:03:01.800> never<00:03:02.160> worked<00:03:02.430> like

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
talks to them it's never worked like

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.180 
talks to them it's never worked like
that<00:03:02.940> before<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:04.110> just<00:03:04.319> it's<00:03:04.500> kind<00:03:05.069> of

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
that before and it's just it's kind of

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.000 
that before and it's just it's kind of
hard<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.459> follow<00:03:05.700> because<00:03:06.650> this<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.800> kind<00:03:07.980> of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
hard to follow because this is kind of

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.340 
hard to follow because this is kind of
slept<00:03:08.250> in<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.489> two<00:03:08.930> stories<00:03:09.930> there's<00:03:10.290> a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
it took me like two panels to figure out

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.270 
it took me like two panels to figure out
that<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:21.239> wasn't<00:03:21.510> Deadpool<00:03:22.019> talking<00:03:22.500> because

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
that it wasn't Deadpool talking because

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.530 
that it wasn't Deadpool talking because
it<00:03:23.519> was<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.670> white<00:03:24.140> caption<00:03:25.140> box<00:03:26.180> why<00:03:27.180> would<00:03:27.420> you
