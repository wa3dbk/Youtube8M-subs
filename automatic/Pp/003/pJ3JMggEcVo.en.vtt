 brought many videos but just guys 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.309
 for various commitments I was busy 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.469
 just as you know we are guys 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.940
 come to the end of school e 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.219
 so in fact I have a lot of guys 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.340
 tasks in the classroom tasks 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.250
 obviously I mean and therefore for these 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.410
 reasons and others I was busy but 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.850
 let's not let ourselves start talking 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.760
 immediately this brand new episode of 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.760
 this section and how they are immediately after 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.340
 there guys in yu gi school oh 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.240
 we will talk a little about the different rarities that 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.680
 in fact we have boys in the papers if 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.869
 you for example also just started 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.930
 to play youtube 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.220
 if it is not so I say to the first 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.829
 weapons 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.680
 know that when we cover the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.340
 re-open envelopes we can find some 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.270
 various card numbers after the rare 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:47.189
 then let's start right away from how 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.930
 we can see this here with the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.840
 I can evaluate above all that the paper 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.530
 It is not bright and the fall is not there 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.420
 only the normal drawing drawn or not 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.960
 nothing special 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.409
 and this is the common here instead we have 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.799
 the rare kids he put god of 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.310
 figure is equal to the common only that 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.970
 the writing a little silvery 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.989
 the relief then pass boys to 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:21.160
 exceeded that we could find one that 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.380
 its average that the family is one of 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.290
 every four sachets can be found 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.349
 and it was now rose and pink 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.430
 you see it is illuminated by a rainbow 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:37.660
 very nice her guys we have the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.239
 ultra that I to the fall part 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.819
 furthermore the word inri really must 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:47.560
 beautiful that it can be found 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:54.340
 it seems to me every 12 sachets so the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:03:01.930
 box and we could find two beautiful then 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:05.640
 we have the secret race that presents itself 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.430
 so that is to say the writing the writing that 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.390
 multicolored and the image that to these and 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.019
 Smooth these diagonal stripes really 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.250
 beautiful this one here is much rarer 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:23.620
 of the others and the chance of being in 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:28.410
 one in every 24 I recommend a box 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.840
 we practically take the rare last 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.290
 that looks like this with all the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.950
 also the writing seems to seem 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.609
 beautiful metallic type and these 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.000
 boys 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.910
 in fact I have been informed but I don't know 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.250
 what media is in the bags 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.799
 so sorry, however, really a lot 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.380
 beautiful as if you know you guys from 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:57.329
 weak in the comments so I will take off 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:00.760
 which precisely this doubt really beautiful 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:04.030
 we have kids the game card that 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.840
 one of the rarest that is the area from 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.799
 August that is how the writing appears 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.920
 that changes color and is the figure that 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.890
 three-dimensional 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.900
 in fact to the light and three-dimensional 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.430
 wait I don't know how to show 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.160
 however three-dimensional it lights up 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.150
 a lot is this here guys can be 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.090
 found one every 300 64 sachets so it is 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.610
 really very rare 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.550
 finally guys there is a rarity that was 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.740
 come with the battle pack 2 expansion 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.520
 war of the giants or if to the frog 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.110
 mosaic that knows what we say 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.450
 a common team we take as it seems 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.990
 sly fair the dragon of the sky but to di 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:50.320
 squares while we have the star here 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.630
 fall that I have here with me seems to me ok 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.389
 after that I will find it with little stars 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.700
