listen to and enjoy it but there's no

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.310 
listen to and enjoy it but there's no
planning<00:07:11.580> that<00:07:11.700> goes<00:07:11.729> into<00:07:11.910> it<00:07:12.390> I<00:07:12.570> mean<00:07:12.810> none

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
planning that goes into it I mean none

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.740 
planning that goes into it I mean none
we've<00:07:13.770> dunno<00:07:14.370> planning<00:07:14.820> or<00:07:14.910> preparation<00:07:15.330> we

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
we've dunno planning or preparation we

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.480 
we've dunno planning or preparation we
hope<00:07:16.020> to<00:07:16.050> get<00:07:16.350> a<00:07:16.410> guest<00:07:16.620> every<00:07:16.979> week<00:07:17.190> and<00:07:17.370> when

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
hope to get a guest every week and when

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.250 
hope to get a guest every week and when
that<00:07:17.640> secure<00:07:18.030> then<00:07:18.240> we<00:07:18.360> hit<00:07:18.479> record<00:07:18.870> and<00:07:18.930> start

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 
that secure then we hit record and start

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.159 
that secure then we hit record and start
doing<00:07:19.590> it<00:07:19.680> so<00:07:20.250> it's<00:07:20.400> really<00:07:20.640> just<00:07:20.990> what<00:07:21.990> we've

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:22.169 
doing it so it's really just what we've

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:23.900 
doing it so it's really just what we've
done<00:07:22.380> that<00:07:22.590> week<00:07:22.830> and<00:07:23.010> who<00:07:23.250> we<00:07:23.400> are<00:07:23.610> at<00:07:23.729> that

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:23.910 
done that week and who we are at that

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.700 
done that week and who we are at that
time<00:07:24.210> in<00:07:24.360> our<00:07:24.450> lives<00:07:24.630> so<00:07:25.140> I<00:07:25.169> think<00:07:25.530> it's<00:07:25.650> just

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710 
time in our lives so I think it's just

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.880 
time in our lives so I think it's just
about<00:07:26.310> very<00:07:26.490> deep<00:07:27.150> natural<00:07:27.740> evolution<00:07:28.740> is

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:28.890 
about very deep natural evolution is

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.430 
about very deep natural evolution is
