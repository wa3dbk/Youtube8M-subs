00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
on hip piercings and all I came across

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.089 
on hip piercings and all I came across
was<00:00:08.360> people<00:00:09.360> getting<00:00:09.750> in<00:00:09.840> them<00:00:10.050> done<00:00:10.380> not

was people getting in them done not

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.089 
was people getting in them done not
actually<00:00:11.550> talking<00:00:11.940> about<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.480> afterwards<00:00:13.099> so

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
actually talking about it afterwards so

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.910 
actually talking about it afterwards so
that's<00:00:14.250> I'm<00:00:14.370> gonna<00:00:14.549> do<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:15.440> went<00:00:16.440> yesterday<00:00:16.560> to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
that's I'm gonna do I went yesterday to

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.189 
that's I'm gonna do I went yesterday to
get<00:00:17.430> my<00:00:17.580> hips<00:00:17.970> done<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:20.480> they<00:00:21.480> look<00:00:22.020> awesome

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
get my hips done and they look awesome

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:37.250 
get my hips done and they look awesome
and<00:00:28.010> they<00:00:29.010> hurt<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.519> lot<00:00:31.130> um<00:00:33.260> that<00:00:34.260> costed<00:00:36.260> 50

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
and they hurt a lot um that costed 50

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.170 
and they hurt a lot um that costed 50
bucks<00:00:37.469> each<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.730> 100<00:00:39.270> bucks<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:39.899> both<00:00:40.020> sides

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
bucks each so 100 bucks for both sides

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.360 
bucks each so 100 bucks for both sides
which<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.829> think<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:43.920> worth<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.280> but

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
which I think it's worth it but

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.790 
which I think it's worth it but
apparently<00:00:47.370> they<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:48.000> really<00:00:48.300> high

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
apparently they have a really high

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.340 
apparently they have a really high
rejection<00:00:49.800> rate<00:00:50.329> which<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:51.870> scares<00:00:52.289> me

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
rejection rate which really scares me

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.279 
rejection rate which really scares me
but<00:00:55.350> let's<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.829> hope<00:00:56.070> nothing<00:00:56.219> happens<00:00:57.289> um

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
but let's just hope nothing happens um

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.349 
but let's just hope nothing happens um
instead<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.829> using<00:00:59.070> the<00:01:00.170> metal<00:01:01.170> bar<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.359> got

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
instead of using the metal bar I got

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.429 
instead of using the metal bar I got
bioflex<00:01:04.820> which<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.060> basically<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.930> little<00:01:07.260> bar

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
bioflex which is basically a little bar

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.260 
bioflex which is basically a little bar
like<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:07.830> big<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.110> it's<00:01:10.580> flexible<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.060> it

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
like this big and it's flexible so it

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.990 
like this big and it's flexible so it
bends<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:12.810> skin<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.760> supposedly<00:01:14.760> they

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
bends with your skin and supposedly they

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.330 
bends with your skin and supposedly they
have<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> lower<00:01:15.570> projection<00:01:16.439> right<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:19.680> let's

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
have a lower projection right so let's

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.390 
have a lower projection right so let's
talk<00:01:20.490> about<00:01:20.549> pain<00:01:21.170> okay<00:01:22.170> um<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:25.500> hurt<00:01:28.400> he

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
talk about pain okay um it hurt he

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.210 
talk about pain okay um it hurt he
pinched<00:01:29.909> my<00:01:30.119> skin<00:01:30.570> instead<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.530> using<00:01:31.710> clamps

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
pinched my skin instead of using clamps

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.609 
pinched my skin instead of using clamps
because<00:01:33.180> my<00:01:33.479> skin<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> fitting<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
because my skin was a fitting in the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.679 
because my skin was a fitting in the
clamps<00:01:35.009> correctly<00:01:36.350> so<00:01:37.369> when<00:01:38.369> he<00:01:38.520> pinched<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
clamps correctly so when he pinched it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.429 
clamps correctly so when he pinched it
hurt<00:01:40.610> um<00:01:42.799> so<00:01:44.540> what<00:01:45.540> he<00:01:45.630> did<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:45.810> he<00:01:45.960> stuck<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
hurt um so what he did was he stuck the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.300 
hurt um so what he did was he stuck the
needle<00:01:46.680> through<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:53.040> didn't

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
needle through and that it didn't

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.120 
needle through and that it didn't
necessarily<00:01:53.399> hurt<00:01:54.180> too<00:01:54.509> bad<00:01:54.869> if<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.829> ever<00:01:55.920> had

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
necessarily hurt too bad if you ever had

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.620 
necessarily hurt too bad if you ever had
your<00:01:56.159> belly<00:01:56.490> button<00:01:56.790> pierced<00:01:57.119> that's<00:01:57.450> what

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
your belly button pierced that's what

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.620 
your belly button pierced that's what
that<00:01:57.780> felt<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.670> but<00:01:59.670> when<00:01:59.820> he<00:01:59.909> pushed<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.450> out

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that felt like but when he pushed it out

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.399 
that felt like but when he pushed it out
the<00:02:00.899> other<00:02:00.930> side<00:02:01.200> oh<00:02:02.149> my<00:02:03.149> god<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.630> felt<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.320> I

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the other side oh my god I felt like I

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.249 
the other side oh my god I felt like I
was<00:02:04.500> gonna<00:02:04.619> die<00:02:05.210> um<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:07.740> didn't<00:02:08.069> bleed<00:02:09.259> but

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
was gonna die um it didn't bleed but

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.010 
was gonna die um it didn't bleed but
when<00:02:10.440> we<00:02:10.560> did<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> left<00:02:11.099> side

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
when we did the left side

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.950 
when we did the left side
that<00:02:13.800> was<00:02:14.040> more<00:02:14.310> sensitive<00:02:15.030> for<00:02:15.510> some<00:02:15.540> odd

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
that was more sensitive for some odd

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.400 
that was more sensitive for some odd
reason<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:18.840> did<00:02:19.080> bleed<00:02:21.170> i'm<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.350> to

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
like little bars they're a little loose

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.180 
like little bars they're a little loose
right<00:02:35.760> now<00:02:36.200> but<00:02:37.640> that's<00:02:38.640> because<00:02:39.920> he<00:02:40.920> said

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
right now but that's because he said

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.600 
right now but that's because he said
that<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:43.010> piers<00:02:44.010> ian<00:02:44.310> will<00:02:44.550> swell<00:02:45.500> um<00:02:46.610> which

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
that the piers ian will swell um which

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.880 
that the piers ian will swell um which
could<00:02:48.170> make<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.590> tight<00:02:50.400> bar<00:02:51.470> feel<00:02:52.470> more

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
could make a tight bar feel more

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.130 
could make a tight bar feel more
uncomfortable<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.910> leave<00:02:54.570> less<00:02:54.870> room<00:02:55.110> for

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
uncomfortable and leave less room for

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.560 
uncomfortable and leave less room for
the<00:02:55.650> drainage<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.580> stuff<00:02:57.000> for<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.420> healing
