00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.030 
besides I'll show you what you can do
with<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> leftover<00:01:59.940> in<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.450> second<00:02:01.040> nice

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
with the leftover in a second nice

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.200 
with the leftover in a second nice
little<00:02:02.390> trick<00:02:04.370> alright<00:02:05.370> so<00:02:05.580> that<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.790> our

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
little trick alright so that is our

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.530 
little trick alright so that is our
celery<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.670> what<00:02:08.759> we're<00:02:08.880> going<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.119> now<00:02:09.240> is

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
celery so what we're going to do now is

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.380 
celery so what we're going to do now is
we're<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.380> figure<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:11.150> how<00:02:12.150> much<00:02:12.270> we

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
we're going to figure out how much we

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.410 
we're going to figure out how much we
need<00:02:12.510> how<00:02:12.660> much<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:12.900> don't<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.970> I've<00:02:15.060> got<00:02:15.240> a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
need how much we don't so I've got a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.400 
need how much we don't so I've got a
little<00:02:18.380> dish<00:02:19.380> here<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.880> only<00:02:21.060> need<00:02:21.410> about

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
little dish here and I only need about

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.600 
little dish here and I only need about
that<00:02:23.010> much<00:02:24.050> rust<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.350> don't<00:02:25.410> need<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.400> what

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
that much rust is I don't need so what

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.450 
that much rust is I don't need so what
I'm<00:02:26.700> going<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.850> do<00:02:27.000> I'm<00:02:27.660> going<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.840> put<00:02:27.960> this<00:02:28.460> in

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
I'm going to do I'm going to put this in

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.510 
I'm going to do I'm going to put this in
another<00:02:30.390> dish<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:33.920> we'll<00:02:34.920> come<00:02:35.100> back<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.400> what

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
another dish and we'll come back to what

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.070 
another dish and we'll come back to what
happens<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:35.940> later<00:02:36.240> but<00:02:36.600> you'll<00:02:36.780> see<00:02:36.959> that

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
happens to it later but you'll see that

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.250 
happens to it later but you'll see that
I<00:02:37.140> do<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.380> up<00:02:37.500> utilizing<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.100> entire<00:02:38.370> thing<00:02:38.459> so

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
I do it up utilizing the entire thing so

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.990 
I do it up utilizing the entire thing so
which<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> very<00:02:41.010> nice<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.670> point<00:02:41.910> being

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
which is a very nice the point being

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.980 
which is a very nice the point being
wasteful<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.090> get<00:02:45.150> all<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.390> celery<00:02:45.870> up

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
wasteful so I can get all this celery up

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:57.800 
wasteful so I can get all this celery up
my<00:02:46.110> knife<00:02:46.230> blade<00:02:53.030> alrighty<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:56.330> off<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.750> our

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
my knife blade alrighty so off to our

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.410 
my knife blade alrighty so off to our
next<00:02:57.930> vegetable
