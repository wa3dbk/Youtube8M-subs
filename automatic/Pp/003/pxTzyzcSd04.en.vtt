00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.980 
ingredient which is the juice so I'm
going<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.759> pour<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.000> slowly<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:57.899> I

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
going to pour this slowly because I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.719 
going to pour this slowly because I
don't<00:01:58.229> want<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.649> plate<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> overflow<00:01:59.490> and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
don't want this plate to overflow and

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.580 
don't want this plate to overflow and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
that's usually what happens if you use

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.469 
that's usually what happens if you use
more<00:02:01.860> than<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.040> fourths<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.969> cup<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.270> lime
