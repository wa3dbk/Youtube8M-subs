but then you get your playsets of these
guys<00:05:48.520> all<00:05:49.520> look<00:05:49.550> really<00:05:49.940> nice

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.580 

and<00:05:52.570> they<00:05:52.690> flip<00:05:52.900> it<00:05:53.020> over<00:05:53.170> and<00:05:53.350> it<00:05:53.440> got

Excalibur<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.250> God<00:05:54.490> story

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
Excalibur the God story

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.160 
Excalibur the God story
so<00:05:56.050> one<00:05:56.170> thing<00:05:56.290> to<00:05:56.410> keep<00:05:56.530> in<00:05:56.650> mind<00:05:56.860> is<00:05:57.310> that<00:05:59.820> the

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
so one thing to keep in mind is that the

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.570 
so one thing to keep in mind is that the
wording<00:06:02.170> on<00:06:02.260> these<00:06:02.440> is<00:06:02.710> incorrect<00:06:03.310> actually

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
wording on these is incorrect actually

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.460 
wording on these is incorrect actually
so<00:06:04.030> it<00:06:04.120> says<00:06:04.240> how<00:06:04.360> discard<00:06:04.750> another<00:06:04.990> car<00:06:05.230> named

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
so it says how discard another car named

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.320 
so it says how discard another car named
