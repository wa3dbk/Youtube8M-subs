00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.639

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.390
 you will have seen from the title is a video 5 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:23.350
 dark and private lipsticks so it is 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:29.230
 really a kind of king seen 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:51.309
 now you can become a make-up artist 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:57.000
 please pour mom mom then it is 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:59.320
 a video point as required by the title 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.779
 top five 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:08.529
 red the first is first of all is the of the 

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:14.649
 project the dark number you are looking for 

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:19.270
 this very shiny very red here not 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.289
 so dark for my people we say mine 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.859
 tastes 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:30.509
 it's not very dark and it's just shiny 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:33.969
 so this is not the first matt 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:40.859
 one of the lipsticks closed more often then 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:40.859
 there is this the pencils from the cell 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:50.609
 ok then there is this here what i wear 

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:54.849
 that is the pink number number levi's 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:57.989
 blue number with matt of the sciacca 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:02:02.649
 that my favorite 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:08.170
 this here and how you see darker then 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:09.520
 there is always the no of the sciacca il 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.240
 number 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.240
 drama of the ever matt of the sciacca 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:26.500
 that even darker than this here and it is 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.710
 one of the most renowned mine these two 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.080
 are those closes more often 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:39.070
 first of all then this which is a 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.240
 very hard lipstick in the sense that it is 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:46.140
 very dry as lipstick is the number 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.140
 547 of the rimmel 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.020
 I made this video because a lot of me 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:03:00.670
 you asked in the videos anyway too 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:03.070
 in the instagram photos of the wonder 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.050
 if you short your lipstick and I think 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:10.360
 the most frequent question the question the most 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:17.440
 frequent in the fairies so I decided to 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:24.940
 make you this this video is this here is 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:28.240
 that the rim of 547 that is very similar to 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.430
 this a little clearer then the last but 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.910
 not of importance because it is mine 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.400
 favorite is the first I think lipstick 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.520
 very dark that I took over two years 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.570
 ago or a year ago and the mac but yes 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.980
 it calls cyber and has been in fact in fact 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:52.930
 sorry conceal the range of lipsticks yes 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:56.320
 he calls sahteene and this dark plum 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.850
 this is very soft too 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.940
 it is never and it is precisely this plum 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.180
 tending to purple to black in other words a 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.450
 cold colors because in the end it is not 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.379
 red but also dark so I would say 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.120
 that these are mine 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:20.910
 one two three four five dark colors 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:27.479
 favorite and closed more often it seems 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:30.030
 much more make up then these are the 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:33.539
 Preferred then anyway escaping of 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.449
 pencils because there are pencils there 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:39.750
 my favorite is this sephora one 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:43.620
 that I still have heaven now 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:48.840
 is called are these rechargeable not 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:53.780
 they went you, but that was it 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:05:06.590
 in short, it is waterproof and is the 02 rose 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:08.910
 so it's a little pink is this here 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.440
 in short, it is that Lazio for some time 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:19.979
 I don't know any more about color than slightly 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.729
 rosata however it tends to the color a little 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.539
 strange 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.940
 I don't know how to describe the colors though 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:29.490
 patience and the second pencil you have or 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:35.669
 more often than that of war the 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:38.310
 number 9 myrtil who is very similar to 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:42.900
 I wore you here a little more 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:47.610
 dark and it is this below and these two 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:51.659
 they are pencils closed and more often now 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:55.440
 among all these handbags mine 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:06:01.870
 surely the number is preferred 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:03.880
 this one of the shac number 40 m drama 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.560
 it's my absolute favorite 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.509
 I recommend many products 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:12.819
 of the cia cast there is above all i 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:15.160
 red lipsticks but you because these 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:16.930
 they last a lot I did the same 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.870
 video and other day by mistake and I have it 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:25.960
 deleted deleted buys then 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:30.220
 I cleaned the whole hand and the 2 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:32.289
 lipsticks that I still had the mark were 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.310
 precisely these two those over there 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.509
 choice 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:40.539
 hello so I really recommend you 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:44.340
 so many these lipsticks because 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:47.580
 they are really crazy, they last a bang 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.020
 and above all those of sciacca I say 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.750
 they are wonderful i think i will go 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.000
 buy other other of the rossisti 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.699
 sciacca also holding more rose 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.289
 however other other types 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:01.330
 I really hope for this video there 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:05.500

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:07.449
