00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
and obviously from there we could go to

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.740 
and obviously from there we could go to
options<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:31.370> go<00:04:32.370> into<00:04:32.730> device<00:04:32.910> at<00:04:33.330> status

obviously you can scroll down and check

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.190 
obviously you can scroll down and check
out<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.130> battery<00:04:38.490> levels<00:04:38.880> so<00:04:39.300> that's<00:04:39.540> pretty

cool<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:41.460> see<00:04:41.490> if<00:04:41.700> we<00:04:41.910> could<00:04:41.940> check<00:04:42.330> something

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
cool to see if we could check something

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.770 
cool to see if we could check something
else<00:04:42.870> here<00:04:43.140> maybe<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.620> signal<00:04:46.610> check<00:04:47.780> signal

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
else here maybe the signal check signal

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:57.260 
else here maybe the signal check signal

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.320 

okay<00:07:08.740> looks<00:07:08.949> like<00:07:09.009> we've<00:07:09.310> crashed<00:07:09.880> an<00:07:10.030> advice

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330 
okay looks like we've crashed an advice

okay looks like we've crashed an advice
but<00:07:10.690> uh<00:07:10.720> obviously<00:07:12.030> normally<00:07:13.289> it<00:07:14.289> would<00:07:14.470> spike

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
but uh obviously normally it would spike

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.180 
but uh obviously normally it would spike
directions<00:07:15.759> to<00:07:16.360> London<00:07:16.720> as<00:07:16.870> such<00:07:17.110> but<00:07:17.380> uh<00:07:17.440> we
