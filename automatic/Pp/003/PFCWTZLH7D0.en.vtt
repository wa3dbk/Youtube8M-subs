00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 the following a few minutes ago we were 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.919
 talking about moving to lose 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.170
 to a loved one and notice that they have 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.360
 investigated throughout my life a 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.540
 amount of testimonials that obviously 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.970
 with all the burden of faith that leads 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.650
 this issue is that people who were 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.810
 about to die inexplicably eye 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 something happened like something that impulses 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.760
 back with say to take a step towards 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.579
 sidewalk and passed a car or people's 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.290
 children who fall from a third floor that does not 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.910
 the qualifies save and the grace that you 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.440
 want the other friends are going to let you know 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.020
 Ivan's dad and he has no one is 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.020
 degree and there are some that have described 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.300
 obviously how a light comes with a 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.950
 the one that saves them exactly that is 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.440
 let's say cases like this there are lots of 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.629
 however since multiplication 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.520
 of cell phone cameras has 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.620
 could somehow graph that 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.000
 you know only angels manifest as 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.340
 what we are seeing in the america 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.670
 who is the white master or everything 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.940
 what is happening there are several say 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.950
 that obviously in this place in the mecca 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.930
 after the pilgrimage of the Muslims 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.890
 which incidentally also they believe the same thing 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.710
 you can see this vaporous figure that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.800
 descend let's say how using as 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.540
 a manifesto the absolute veneration 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.990
 respect to which all the faithful are 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.790
 there doing their god then 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.250
 faithful has spent everything and suddenly see 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.950
 so exact that space 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.920
 well there are many examples of these from 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.380
 people that even young people with campfire 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.060
 and guitar singing in this output is 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.369
 certain terrain let's say of departures 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.490
 spiritual religious sections in 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.590
 where they have told similar things exactly 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.690
 and this some of them in the last 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.490
 time there are more and more records what 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.259
 same here you can interpret many 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.649
 things someone out there can say good 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.300
 it's a reflection but this is just one of 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.090
 the cases and they can be but in salfate 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.460
 who have invoked it contradicting the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.929
 theory that explained to us in the summer 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.410
 there was a stick to that for example 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:10.590
 a human being is not capable of 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.710
 because its luminosity does not allow it but 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.200
 therefore you invoke something appears be 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.180
 something and you see it then 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.740
 how you could understand is very 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.920
 interesting that question because look 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.990
 the average virgin of an angel and others 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.300
 prophets also found themselves with 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.160
 angels on the way teatre etcetera and 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.930
 what they see is what inside the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.930
 religion is considered as many 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.190
 names that are like the metatron 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.880
 we for example if God is 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.700
 manifest in let's say in all its glory 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.620
 see that we would know the body is not capable 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.510
 of enduring it then has as a 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.240
 sort of ambassadors that what 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.580
 they represent so that it is like facing 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.320
 to my ability to understand it and they are types 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.360
 of angels in that category for the same 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.700
 in fact there is an angel in israel 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.740
 we have a great example battery for 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.120
 show deciding whether or not this 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.040
 corresponds to the image of one that by 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.250
 please when you play because we are in 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:11.069
 israel now and yes yes I correct myself 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:14.849
 this is the most famous of all this 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.560
 a formation as well as a bush in 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.849
 called very similar for example what he saw 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.620
 Moses in the Sinai mountains as 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.569
 representation of god the same as 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.519
 wrote the tables of commandments and 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.260
 they see that it goes from one place to another 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.170
 postponing by the face of thinking 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.109
 then it moves, even though it does not 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.939
 there is necessarily a break 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.409
 complete in the car then what are 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.510
 the explanations that were given in a 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.090
 I begin that that could be the reflection 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.519
 of the sun that hits in a very 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.489
 capricious on the windshield that is to say but 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.349
 however, notice that although it is in 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.389
 a constant curve is not returned 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.879
 it seems like it has a movement 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:54.030
 independent in the step how the 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.889
 car and eye when one sees a reflection of 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.750
 this way has there crosses where 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.060
 exactly one being close to the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.889
 window one stops seeing it as a reflection 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.040
 one understands it as something that is 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.489
 out of true glass and the kids that 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.480
 they are there or the people are quite 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.940
 ecstatic about this phenomenon that is 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.860
 attributes precisely that an angel 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.870
 and some manifest human action as 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.120
 a glorious manifestation and that 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.519
 good problem angels we give name to 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.959
 any kind of call that 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.670
 we call religiosity the 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.650
 spirituality and that manifests 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.720
 we have another an angel that I was going to look for 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.110
 a child attention with history we put 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.440
 full screen video and it says well 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.660
 in kazakhstan the shepherd and clasp 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.940
 ensures that he has been able to record in the 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.980
 city certain angels taking to the 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.420
 sky a child who had died that 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.910
 same day is the story behind 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.320
 this video good when the father managed 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.020
 record this immediately find out that 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.270
 in those moments his little boy has just 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.940
 dying right in the building where 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.760
 these events happen that what happens to 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.040
 see I insist here many people can 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.720
 see thousands of explanations this event 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.610
 let's say crystallization of the quota 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.410
 that seem to be achieved not only in 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.720
 the other beings but with this the funny thing 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.360
 that he let go of the other side then 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.000
 they go down two looks wait you low are not 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.620
 just deposited in the sky and the 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.070
 speed with which the sun hides 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.530
 let's say in the center that rightly 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.020
 they appear like this and one descends and like 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.970
 they go to the place precisely where it could 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.170
 be located your child and then what 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.300
 will search only to get or not 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.090
 it's a round object let's say that 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.340
 they flash but if they go to how they 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.620
 get in addition to forums the crazy 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.690
 and as a human figure it is different from the 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.510
 other images that are more diffuse or 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.780
 good now the good news all this 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.660
 existing therapies as much 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.790
 form one that has to do with therapies 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.710
 of angels that's why some 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.020
 Latifi time that accompanies us here 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.360
 taught that there were angels with names and 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.639
 surname to beg for an improvement 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.770
 of work others for health others 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.330
 for love and for all the issues that 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.310
 it can happen you who are 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.199
 those angels besides the one that accompanies it 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.820
 throughout his life and what is the prayer 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.560
 that we do all your details more 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.850
 a lot of material to the 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.850
 back this brief let's go to commercial
