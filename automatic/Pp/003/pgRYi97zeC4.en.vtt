into<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.190> low<00:00:50.520> bond<00:00:50.960> because<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.559> only<00:00:52.800> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
into a low bond because this is only a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.060 
into a low bond because this is only a
lace<00:00:53.399> front<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.960> doesn't<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.469> any<00:00:55.710> poems

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
lace front and it doesn't have any poems

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.000 
lace front and it doesn't have any poems
or<00:00:56.460> anything<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> straps<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> back

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
or anything just the straps in the back

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.270 
or anything just the straps in the back
so<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.430> had<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.109> pulled<00:01:01.109> down<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> back<00:01:01.949> and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
so I had it pulled down in the back and

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.649 
so I had it pulled down in the back and
into<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.940> low<00:01:03.270> bun<00:01:03.570> something<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.659> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
into a low bun something like this and I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.679 
into a low bun something like this and I
went<00:01:07.590> swimming<00:01:07.760> now<00:01:08.760> I'm<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.390> very<00:01:09.600> good
