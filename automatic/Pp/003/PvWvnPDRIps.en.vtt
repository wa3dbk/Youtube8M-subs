am getting there I'm very happy that I'm
2400<00:04:57.639> total<00:04:58.120> finally<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:58.870> I'm<00:04:58.990> over<00:04:59.410> it<00:04:59.440> by<00:04:59.860> a

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
2400 total finally and I'm over it by a

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.100 
2400 total finally and I'm over it by a
lot<00:05:00.250> actually<00:05:00.520> now<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:01.150> it's<00:05:01.600> going<00:05:01.870> really

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
lot actually now and it's going really

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.409 
lot actually now and it's going really
well<00:05:02.229> actually<00:05:02.530> so<00:05:03.340> hopefully<00:05:03.940> I<00:05:03.970> should<00:05:04.270> be

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
well actually so hopefully I should be

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.020 
well actually so hopefully I should be
scaling<00:05:04.780> a<00:05:04.840> lot<00:05:05.020> more<00:05:05.169> and<00:05:05.470> I<00:05:06.039> I<00:05:06.550> might<00:05:06.820> as<00:05:06.970> well

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
scaling a lot more and I I might as well

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.600 
scaling a lot more and I I might as well
