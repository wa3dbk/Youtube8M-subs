00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.390
 as such to the training of dogs of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.010
 the pit bull race for clandestine fights 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.150
 according to an intelligence report

 municipal mexicalli became a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.290
 important series of these practices before 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.750
 the restrictions in california and 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.850
 arizona is a form of maltreatment is 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.920
 altering the natural behavior of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.320
 the animals and good is something that is 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.060
 intended as a punishable conduct 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.949
 both in the state law of protection to 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.270
 domestic animals as in the 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.059
 regulation for the control of 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.739
 food a recent report from the pcr 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.019
 determined that it lowers california and 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.390
 Tamaulipas are areas where there is presence 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.309
 of clandestine fights of linked dogs 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.350
 to criminal groups such as gangs 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.679
 transnational and drug cartels 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.710
 for us there are 14 dangerous races the 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.620
 we are going to regulate to indicate to the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.120
 people the kind of races they're going to get 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.270
 avoiding this kind of post issues of 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.830
 abuse if there is there we have known about 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.900
 mistreatment of animals in relation to 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.390
 training for clandestine struggles 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.670
 we have no evidence we have only 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.280
 hired certain corpses 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.960
 that people commonly come to ask for their 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.440
 pitbull which never comes here with 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.830
 we but young young dogs 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.650
 adult dogs and they get lost and we do not know 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.560
 why do we suspect that it is because 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.600
 training issues or litigation 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.820
 fighting dogs devoted in destinations is 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.250
 proved that the temperament of a 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.200
 dog is owed by 90 percent 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.290
 about environmental issues 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.240
 what does this mean about the treatment they receive 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.130
 the animals of its environment if it is a 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.650
 animal to which a person but it is 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.450
 getting used to them are scaring them for 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.790
 train them then they are definitely 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.160
 animals that will react to the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.380
 minimal situation before the 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.240
 restrictions in the USA to realize this 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.760
 type of fights and a series of operatives 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.040
 that were made in Tijuana authorities 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.230
 police and specialists pointed out that 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.000
 Mexicalli became regional headquarters 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.860
 of these clandestine fights 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.570
 gustavo larios presidents of the 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.760
 Mexican association for the rights of 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.480
 the animals pointed by phone from 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.580
 the district 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.069
 the expression is that the clashes 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.500
 of fighting dogs are synonymous with 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.780
 cruelty and abuse besides they are 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.849
 altered genetics and hormonal mind to 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.560
 through chemicals without leaving 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.540
 sideways extreme conditions in your 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.879
 environment like leaving them without eating 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.830
 days snout organs to strengthen 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.720
 your jaws or give them downloads 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.349
 electric in genitals to make them 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.349
 more aggressive 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.820
 do not 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.120
 the force and also the selected 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.120
 do not 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.239
 municipal police sources as well as 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.040
 the animal control center reported 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.989
 that in the periphery of the city is a 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.239
 corpse dumps have been found 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.790
 of fighting dogs particularly of the 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.709
 pitbull race the modus operandi is a 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.870
 through social networks and chats where 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.310
 those who attend agree to 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.530
 through keys to go to the 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.959
 places as well as the amounts of bets 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.310
 the money trail is complicated given 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.409
 that deposit in several accounts 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.540
 national and North American banks 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.489
 besides using fast shipping systems 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.590
 the other aspect that worries the 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.689
 activists authorities is the amount 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.209
 important of pit bull puppies that 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:52.700
 disappear apparently stolen for 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.139
 be trained in this type of fights the 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.000
 fact that gangs and gangs 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.159
 criminals are behind this business 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.650
 makes the municipal control center difficult 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.989
 animal in the detection and complaint with the 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.200
 dangerousness one of the five goals is 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.400
 those precisely that in the future 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.019
 makes people train themselves 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.519
 us the new song that comes from the 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.940
 police academy or pass by the 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.100
 police academy for 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.990
 I recycle defense now if there are many 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.260
 aggressions before the personnel before 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.420
 our units and this and also at 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.100
 moment of capture before this kind of 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.600
 situations divide opinions the 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.460
 punishments that are asked for what is 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.770
 propitiate and carry out the mistreatment 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.440
 animal particularly to domestic 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.150
 or pet municipal authorities ask 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.040
 that is included in the penal code this 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.200
 behavior because currently only 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.060
 considers administrative offense without 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.130
 However, activists in favor of 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.230
 animals consider that it must first 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.210
 ensure the application of the 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.450
 sanctions and existing because currently 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.940
 they are not carried out we believe that 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.790
 they are conducts that must be sanctioned 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.190
 if the most effective is that it is typified that 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.560
 is typified then but the point is that 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.520
 we have regulations from the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.530
 2006 Mexicalli and the truth is not no 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.660
 It has effectively applied to regulation 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.580
 right now all these behaviors a lot 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.500
 people do not know it but they are behaviors that 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.600
 are sanctionable the problem is that 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.970
 is applied effectively then yes we go 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.870
 to typify animal abuse so that 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.340
 again the rule does not apply 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.410
 well, we better stay like 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.930
 we are and we invest in that this norm 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.850
 if it is carried out it is not currently 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.970
 consider only as a lack 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.410
 administrative that can be done 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.380
 deserving any conduct prohibited to 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.270
 fines with warning fine of 3 a 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.670
 50 minimum wages and arrest 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.770
 administrative for up to 36 hours a 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.930
 pet especially dog ​​that has been 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.730
 subjected to severe abuse is difficult 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.440
 to integrate it so that it can be 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.080
 adopted have confidence in beings 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.880
 human beings despite this organizations 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.490
 of civil society carry out this work 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.920
 and above all they promote the culture of 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.430
 adoption among Mexicans we 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.610
 we evaluate each case 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.980
 there are cases in which the animal 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.780
 It is severely mistreated and what 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.120
 better are animals that do not even 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.950
 they leave they do not approach they do not let themselves handle 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.560
 because maybe they have not had contact 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.240
 human or were very mistreated and those 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.350
 cases we can not intervene 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.330
 we now have a serious lack 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.800
 that is that we have an ethologist the 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.020
 ethologists are the specialists in 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.880
 canine behavior that not only 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.300
 we can help in those cases in 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.250
 where good in certain cases there is no 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.780
 coach that supports us there is another 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.730
 person who has knowledge of 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.100
 theology without becoming ethologists who 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.350
 It also helps us and depends on the degree of 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.840
 abuse and disposition now yes 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.970
 of the animal is the time it entails 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.390
 there are animals that we have had 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:48.700
 one year and that barely a year begin to 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.700
 approaching to let yourself caress a little
