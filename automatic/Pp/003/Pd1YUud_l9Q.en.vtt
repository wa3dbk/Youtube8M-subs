doesn't<00:02:48.090> come<00:02:48.240> with<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.600> transmitter<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:50.400> I'm

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
doesn't come with the transmitter so I'm

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.500 
doesn't come with the transmitter so I'm
not<00:02:51.840> gonna<00:02:51.990> do<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> flying<00:02:52.860> demo<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.730> here

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
not gonna do a flying demo in here

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.620 
not gonna do a flying demo in here
because<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.140> little<00:02:55.260> too<00:02:55.470> small<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:56.820> could

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630

can<00:03:05.520> see<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.880> little<00:03:06.240> bitty<00:03:06.830> blades<00:03:07.830> here

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
can see the little bitty blades here

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.160 
can see the little bitty blades here
they<00:03:09.410> pivot<00:03:10.440> that's<00:03:10.920> if<00:03:11.460> you<00:03:11.790> crash<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.990> won't

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
they pivot that's if you crash you won't

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.670 
they pivot that's if you crash you won't
do<00:03:13.620> as<00:03:13.770> much<00:03:13.920> damage<00:03:14.630> I've<00:03:15.630> crashed<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.290> before

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
do as much damage I've crashed it before

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.800 
do as much damage I've crashed it before
and<00:03:16.950> it's<00:03:17.070> pretty<00:03:17.310> durable<00:03:17.580> I've<00:03:18.390> had<00:03:18.690> to

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
and it's pretty durable I've had to

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.949 
and it's pretty durable I've had to
replace<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.350> canopy<00:03:19.830> once<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:21.330> landing<00:03:21.720> gear

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
replace the canopy once the landing gear

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.120 
replace the canopy once the landing gear
I've<00:03:22.230> replaced<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:23.690> blades<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:25.110> for<00:03:25.650> place<00:03:25.860> but

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
I've replaced the blades I for place but

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.830 
I've replaced the blades I for place but
that's<00:03:26.250> just<00:03:26.489> because<00:03:26.640> I'm<00:03:26.970> super<00:03:27.360> anal<00:03:27.570> about

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
that's just because I'm super anal about

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.260 
that's just because I'm super anal about
them<00:03:28.140> being<00:03:29.010> all<00:03:29.100> scratched<00:03:29.489> up<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.910> stuff<00:03:30.090> I

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
them being all scratched up and stuff I

this one's single rotor it's fixed pitch

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.170 
this one's single rotor it's fixed pitch
it's<00:03:54.900> gonna<00:03:55.080> have<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.040> lot<00:03:56.250> higher<00:03:56.520> head<00:03:56.790> speed

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
it's gonna have a lot higher head speed

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.300 
it's gonna have a lot higher head speed
it's<00:03:57.989> gonna<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.980> lot<00:03:59.280> more<00:04:00.020> agility<00:04:01.020> you

it's gonna have a lot more agility you

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.180 
it's gonna have a lot more agility you
can<00:04:02.510> do<00:04:04.550> pirouettes<00:04:05.550> really<00:04:06.239> fast<00:04:06.510> with<00:04:06.780> this

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
can do pirouettes really fast with this

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.810 
can do pirouettes really fast with this
you<00:04:08.190> can<00:04:08.430> take<00:04:08.760> off<00:04:09.150> really<00:04:09.390> fast<00:04:10.190> you<00:04:11.190> can<00:04:11.400> fly

you can take off really fast you can fly

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.259 
you can take off really fast you can fly
forward<00:04:12.239> really<00:04:12.360> fast<00:04:13.010> it's<00:04:14.010> really<00:04:14.610> agile

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
forward really fast it's really agile

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.470 
forward really fast it's really agile
and<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:17.519> got<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.760> be<00:04:17.850> careful<00:04:18.269> when<00:04:18.390> you're

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
and you got to be careful when you're

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.670 
and you got to be careful when you're
flying<00:04:18.750> outside<00:04:19.019> because<00:04:19.739> if<00:04:20.669> you're<00:04:21.680> you

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
flying outside because if you're you

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.040 
flying outside because if you're you
know<00:04:22.710> if<00:04:23.039> you're<00:04:23.070> if<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.610> have<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:23.820> hovering

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
know if you're if you have it hovering

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.089 
know if you're if you have it hovering
and<00:04:25.139> then<00:04:25.319> if<00:04:25.470> you're<00:04:25.590> wanting<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.860> fly

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
and then if you're wanting to fly

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.189 
and then if you're wanting to fly
forward<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.759> then<00:04:27.030> when<00:04:27.270> pushes<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.870> it's

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
forward and then when pushes it it's

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.379 
forward and then when pushes it it's
just<00:04:28.319> gonna<00:04:28.530> it's<00:04:29.009> just<00:04:29.250> one<00:04:29.520> of<00:04:29.550> good<00:04:29.759> gonna

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
just gonna it's just one of good gonna

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.100 
just gonna it's just one of good gonna
go<00:04:30.539> down<00:04:30.889> so<00:04:31.889> it's<00:04:32.610> kind<00:04:33.090> of<00:04:33.180> tricky<00:04:33.539> I'm

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
go down so it's kind of tricky I'm

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.600 
go down so it's kind of tricky I'm
working<00:04:34.500> on<00:04:34.560> flying<00:04:34.889> outside

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
working on flying outside

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.100 
working on flying outside
I<00:04:35.639> don't<00:04:35.940> really<00:04:36.090> fly<00:04:36.210> outside<00:04:36.659> that<00:04:36.900> much

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
I don't really fly outside that much

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.100 
I don't really fly outside that much
because<00:04:37.379> that's<00:04:37.500> where<00:04:38.129> I've<00:04:38.819> broken<00:04:39.300> most<00:04:39.930> of

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
because that's where I've broken most of

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.659 
because that's where I've broken most of
my<00:04:40.229> parts<00:04:40.729> so<00:04:41.729> I<00:04:42.300> think<00:04:42.509> I<00:04:43.440> should<00:04:43.949> just<00:04:44.250> pretty

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
my parts so I think I should just pretty

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.100 
my parts so I think I should just pretty
much<00:04:44.789> fly<00:04:45.030> inside<00:04:45.330> because<00:04:45.659> this<00:04:45.810> thing<00:04:45.960> only

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
much fly inside because this thing only

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.279 
much fly inside because this thing only
weighs<00:04:46.379> an<00:04:46.620> ounce<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.509> this<00:04:48.509> helicopter<00:04:49.050> is

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
weighs an ounce and this helicopter is

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.860 
weighs an ounce and this helicopter is
only<00:04:49.500> like<00:04:49.650> seven<00:04:50.550> inches<00:04:50.669> long<00:04:51.060> as<00:04:51.599> you<00:04:51.750> can

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
only like seven inches long as you can

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.110 
only like seven inches long as you can
see<00:04:51.990> it<00:04:52.080> fits<00:04:52.319> in<00:04:52.440> my<00:04:52.530> hand<00:04:52.680> pretty<00:04:52.949> good<00:04:53.159> it's

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.520 
a pretty small helicopter I think it's
better<00:04:56.669> for<00:04:57.030> like<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.240> gymnasium<00:04:57.720> or<00:04:58.110> somewhere

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
better for like a gymnasium or somewhere

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.040 
better for like a gymnasium or somewhere
where<00:04:58.889> there's<00:04:59.159> no<00:04:59.220> wind<00:04:59.880> at<00:05:00.090> all<00:05:00.180> but<00:05:00.659> a<00:05:00.690> big

what you want to do first is plug in the
battery<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:43.199> the<00:05:43.319> MSR<00:05:45.919> see<00:05:47.180> that

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.220

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
this has a low battery so I'm not gonna

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.160 
this has a low battery so I'm not gonna
fly<00:06:26.180> it<00:06:26.240> now<00:06:26.740> that'll<00:06:27.740> be<00:06:27.830> in<00:06:27.890> the<00:06:27.920> next<00:06:27.980> video

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
fly it now that'll be in the next video

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.960 
fly it now that'll be in the next video
so<00:06:30.170> you<00:06:30.260> can<00:06:30.410> pretty<00:06:30.560> much<00:06:30.650> see<00:06:30.770> what<00:06:31.070> the<00:06:31.220> MSR

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
so you can pretty much see what the MSR

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.600 
so you can pretty much see what the MSR
does<00:06:32.590> that's<00:06:33.590> pretty<00:06:34.070> much<00:06:34.160> it<00:06:34.370> for<00:06:34.520> this

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
does that's pretty much it for this

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.960 
does that's pretty much it for this
video<00:06:34.820> thanks<00:06:35.510> for<00:06:35.630> watching
