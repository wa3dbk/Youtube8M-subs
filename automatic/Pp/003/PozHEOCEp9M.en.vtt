00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
have the Arenacross style a couple years

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.260 
have the Arenacross style a couple years
ago<00:02:15.370> they<00:02:15.520> tried<00:02:15.640> doing<00:02:15.879> like<00:02:16.060> full

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
ago they tried doing like full

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.520 
ago they tried doing like full
Supercross<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:16.959> there's<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.140> little<00:02:17.319> tough<00:02:17.500> to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
Supercross and there's a little tough to

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.890 
Supercross and there's a little tough to
do<00:02:18.340> like<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.550> full<00:02:18.760> Supercross<00:02:19.239> lap<00:02:19.450> time<00:02:19.690> and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
do like a full Supercross lap time and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.280 
do like a full Supercross lap time and
do<00:02:20.050> it

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
do it

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.630 
do it
two<00:02:20.590> or<00:02:20.709> three<00:02:20.739> tricks<00:02:21.159> so<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.519> is

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
two or three tricks so this is

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.640 
two or three tricks so this is
definitely<00:02:21.909> more<00:02:22.659> my<00:02:22.870> style<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.379> think<00:02:23.560> it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
definitely more my style and I think it

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:34.890 
definitely more my style and I think it
makes<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.099> better<00:02:24.250> for<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.670> racing

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.090 

switching<00:02:35.900> over<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.110> 450<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.740> awesome

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
switching over to the 450 is awesome

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.040 
switching over to the 450 is awesome
it's<00:02:37.310> uh<00:02:37.370> it's<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.420> little<00:02:38.630> bit<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.900> learning

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
it's uh it's a little bit of a learning

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.930 
it's uh it's a little bit of a learning
curve<00:02:39.230> but<00:02:39.830> it's<00:02:40.070> not<00:02:40.250> as<00:02:40.370> bad<00:02:40.490> as<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.730> thought<00:02:40.880> I

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
curve but it's not as bad as I thought I

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.280 
curve but it's not as bad as I thought I
was<00:02:41.150> kind<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.420> nervous<00:02:41.540> because<00:02:41.960> I<00:02:42.140> actually

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
was kind of nervous because I actually

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.500 
was kind of nervous because I actually
was<00:02:42.830> in<00:02:42.950> India<00:02:43.220> all<00:02:43.610> last<00:02:43.970> month<00:02:44.240> so<00:02:44.450> I

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
fine-tuning everything just polishing up

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.540 
fine-tuning everything just polishing up
my<00:02:57.080> tricks<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.500> little<00:02:57.710> bit<00:02:57.860> but<00:02:58.100> when<00:02:58.310> I'm<00:02:58.400> on

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
my tricks a little bit but when I'm on

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.520 
my tricks a little bit but when I'm on
the<00:02:58.670> track<00:02:58.910> it's<00:02:59.210> it's<00:02:59.900> making<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.320> track

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
the track it's it's making the track

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.870 
the track it's it's making the track
more<00:03:00.770> fun<00:03:00.950> because<00:03:01.100> I'm<00:03:01.220> not<00:03:01.340> having<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:01.700> try

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
more fun because I'm not having to try

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.880 
more fun because I'm not having to try
so<00:03:02.090> hard<00:03:02.120> it's<00:03:02.840> more<00:03:03.140> my<00:03:03.290> style<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.710> was

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
so hard it's more my style so that was

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.290 
so hard it's more my style so that was
never<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.130> gnarly<00:03:04.550> like<00:03:04.700> clutch<00:03:04.970> out<00:03:05.150> of<00:03:05.240> the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
never a gnarly like clutch out of the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
turn guy was always like real smooth

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.930 
turn guy was always like real smooth
just<00:03:07.040> kind<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.280> roll<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.490> throttle<00:03:07.850> and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
just kind of roll the throttle and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.140 
just kind of roll the throttle and
that's<00:03:08.180> exactly<00:03:08.600> how<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.750> 450<00:03:09.260> power<00:03:09.440> is

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
that's exactly how the 450 power is

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.820 
that's exactly how the 450 power is
having<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.210> mechanic<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:11.810> definitely<00:03:12.470> crucial
