00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
battlefield 3 thing I was playing with

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.830 
battlefield 3 thing I was playing with
my<00:00:58.219> subscribers<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.699> couple<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.180> games<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
my subscribers and a couple of games I

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.080 
my subscribers and a couple of games I
think<00:01:01.199> got<00:01:01.440> two<00:01:01.800> maybe<00:01:02.070> three<00:01:02.340> days<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
think got two maybe three days going I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.299 
think got two maybe three days going I
was<00:01:03.180> talking<00:01:03.629> about<00:01:03.899> what<00:01:04.379> kind<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> game<00:01:04.979> play

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
was talking about what kind of game play

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.500 
was talking about what kind of game play
that<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:06.000> watching<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:07.939> my<00:01:08.939> personal

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
that they like watching I my personal

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.010 
that they like watching I my personal
opinion<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.200> think<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> attacking<00:01:11.700> side

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
opinion I think that the attacking side

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.590 
opinion I think that the attacking side
is<00:01:13.020> much<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.710> interesting<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.520> watch<00:01:14.700> than

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
is much more interesting to watch than

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.560 
is much more interesting to watch than
the<00:01:15.780> defending<00:01:16.320> side<00:01:16.790> when<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.970> are<00:01:18.210> when

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the defending side when you are when

you're<00:01:18.659> playing<00:01:18.930> rush<00:01:19.369> now<00:01:20.369> when<00:01:21.180> you're

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
defending this smart thing to do

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.219
