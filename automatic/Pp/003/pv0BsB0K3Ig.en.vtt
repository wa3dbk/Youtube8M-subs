00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.120
 very personal 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:14.780
 now I 'm passing on to you as 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:20.699
 is that a thinning cut is made 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:25.350
 See here you see the ring and it has 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.269
 this white part on top around the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.669
 ring 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.850
 only that we use to own the 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:39.930
 mortar or glue cement glues as 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.620
 want us to pass on the edge where 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.860
 go to the grill 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.890
 There you put the Greek on the spot. 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.470
 here I have done one hand since 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.560
 took two pieces you put 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:06.310
 the local grid 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:14.020
 is important to note here identify 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.020
 in the correct position did realize here 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.370
 the piece has the cut 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:26.729
 a good result 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:30.550
 You'll get a 52 51 Iraqi porcelain tile 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:35.500
 as I have two pieces here but you see 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:55.270
 I have already put it here. 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:59.229
 grid in the right place and now I will put that 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.830
 the piece in place is important to place 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.830
 right 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.970
 Ready the cold has to stay too. 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.570
 we will never person when you cut no 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.570
 gives the difference 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:30.740
 I hope it's more popular below 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:48.860
 I realize that the mark has become the mark 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:51.440
 then we will not cut 100% 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.540
 service 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.540
 A hug and see you next
