honestly<00:00:01.979> I've<00:00:02.340> never<00:00:02.399> seen<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.179> question<00:00:03.840> that

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
honestly I've never seen a question that

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.410 
honestly I've never seen a question that
asked<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.470> student<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:05.009> draw<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.580> border<00:00:06.089> for

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
asked a student to draw a border for

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.470 
asked a student to draw a border for
diagram<00:00:07.049> for<00:00:07.740> an<00:00:07.830> element<00:00:08.160> beyond<00:00:08.940> number

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
diagram for an element beyond number

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.230 
diagram for an element beyond number
twenty<00:00:09.990> which<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.410> calcium<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.610> reason<00:00:12.090> is

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
twenty which is calcium the reason is

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.690 
twenty which is calcium the reason is
that<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.570> gets<00:00:12.780> kind<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.200> complicated<00:00:13.559> as<00:00:14.130> you

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
that it gets kind of complicated as you

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.880 
that it gets kind of complicated as you
progress<00:00:14.910> through<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.420> periodic<00:00:15.990> table<00:00:16.350> I'm

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
progress through the periodic table I'm

progress through the periodic table I'm
going<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.190> show<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.460> here<00:00:17.730> how<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.000> could<00:00:18.449> do

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
going to show you here how you could do

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.439 
going to show you here how you could do
it<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.380> case<00:00:19.410> someone<00:00:19.859> gets<00:00:20.039> asked<00:00:20.670> or<00:00:20.820> if

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
it just in case someone gets asked or if

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.779 
it just in case someone gets asked or if
you're<00:00:21.689> just<00:00:21.840> curious<00:00:22.279> we're<00:00:23.279> going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.670> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
you're just curious we're going to do it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.349 
you're just curious we're going to do it
for<00:00:23.880> number<00:00:24.119> 32<00:00:24.750> which<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.350> germanium<00:00:26.300> now<00:00:27.300> you

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
for number 32 which is germanium now you

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.210 
for number 32 which is germanium now you
always<00:00:27.869> start<00:00:28.170> bore<00:00:28.470> whether<00:00:28.650> for<00:00:28.890> diagrams

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
always start bore whether for diagrams

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.950 
always start bore whether for diagrams
the<00:00:29.460> same<00:00:29.699> way<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> number<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.449> protons

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the same way with the number of protons

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.670 
the same way with the number of protons
in<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:32.130> center<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.600> number<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.989> neutrons

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
in the center and the number of neutrons

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.700 
in the center and the number of neutrons
in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.640> center<00:00:36.110> I'm<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> assume<00:00:37.649> that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
in the center I'm going to assume that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.310 
in the center I'm going to assume that
this<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:37.980> about<00:00:38.280> 73<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.180> will<00:00:39.300> use<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> isotope

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
this is about 73 or will use the isotope

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.940 
this is about 73 or will use the isotope
that<00:00:40.500> has<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.920> tock<00:00:41.610> mass<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.180> 73<00:00:42.840> which<00:00:43.649> means

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
that has a tock mass of 73 which means

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.049 
that has a tock mass of 73 which means
we<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.460> 41<00:00:45.559> neutrons<00:00:48.469> all<00:00:49.469> right<00:00:50.030> take<00:00:51.030> a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
we have 41 neutrons all right take a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.170 
we have 41 neutrons all right take a
look<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
look at what I have here this is a

chart<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.600> tell<00:01:09.869> us<00:01:09.900> how<00:01:10.890> many

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
chart is going to tell us how many

electrons<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.119> put<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.570> each<00:01:12.840> shell<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:14.330> we

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
electrons to put in each shell as we

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.109 
electrons to put in each shell as we
progress<00:01:15.600> through<00:01:16.820> what<00:01:17.820> we're<00:01:17.939> actually

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
progress through what we're actually

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.899 
progress through what we're actually
going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> start<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.890> lowest<00:01:20.400> level

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
going to do is start in the lowest level

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.719 
going to do is start in the lowest level
electron<00:01:21.450> orbital<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> 1s<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:24.020> put<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.170> two

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
electron orbital the 1s and put in two

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.850 
electron orbital the 1s and put in two
electrons<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.150> we've<00:01:27.689> draw<00:01:27.930> our<00:01:28.080> first<00:01:28.110> shell

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
electrons so we've draw our first shell

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.789 
electrons so we've draw our first shell
you<00:01:29.490> put<00:01:29.700> two<00:01:29.970> electrons<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:30.990> first

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
you put two electrons in that first

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.109 
you put two electrons in that first
orbital<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.390> S<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:34.079> stands<00:01:35.040> for<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.790> shape

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
orbital the S here stands for the shape

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.859 
orbital the S here stands for the shape
which<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.159> spherical<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.850> orbital<00:01:39.299> but

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
which is spherical of the orbital but

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.690 
which is spherical of the orbital but
the<00:01:40.020> important<00:01:40.470> thing<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.799> all<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.549> S

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the important thing is that all the S

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.359 
the important thing is that all the S
orbitals<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.479> only<00:01:42.659> handle<00:01:43.259> two<00:01:43.590> electrons

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
orbitals can only handle two electrons

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.719 
orbitals can only handle two electrons
so<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:45.329> put<00:01:45.570> two<00:01:46.079> electrons<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.460> first

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
so we put two electrons in the first

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.640 
so we put two electrons in the first
shell

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
shell

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.080 
shell
then<00:01:50.420> we<00:01:51.420> put<00:01:51.720> two<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.770> second<00:01:53.220> shell<00:01:54.920> one

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
then we put two in the second shell one

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:04.900 
then we put two in the second shell one
two<00:01:58.430> then<00:01:59.430> we<00:01:59.970> put<00:02:00.270> six<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.910> second<00:02:03.420> shell

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
two then we put six in the second shell

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.950 
two then we put six in the second shell
one<00:02:05.910> two<00:02:06.980> three<00:02:07.980> four<00:02:08.869> five<00:02:10.010> six

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
one two three four five six

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.800 
one two three four five six
what<00:02:12.960> I'm<00:02:13.110> doing<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.790> progressively<00:02:14.810> drawing

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
what I'm doing is progressively drawing

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.890 
what I'm doing is progressively drawing
diagonal<00:02:16.500> lines<00:02:16.710> through<00:02:17.250> my<00:02:17.430> chart<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.270> it's

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
diagonal lines through my chart and it's

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.230 
diagonal lines through my chart and it's
going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.230> tell<00:02:19.470> us<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.620> order<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.430> which<00:02:20.850> we

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
going to tell us the order in which we

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.310 
going to tell us the order in which we
put<00:02:21.480> electrons<00:02:22.080> into<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.680> atom<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.330> 2<00:02:24.960> into

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
put electrons into the atom so 2 into

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.060 
put electrons into the atom so 2 into
the<00:02:25.950> first<00:02:26.220> 2<00:02:26.700> into<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> second<00:02:27.450> 6<00:02:28.320> into<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
the first 2 into the second 6 into the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.530 
the first 2 into the second 6 into the
second<00:02:29.580> 2<00:02:30.510> into<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.260> third<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.090> need

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
second 2 into the third so I need

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
another line here 1 2 now I need to add

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:47.210 
another line here 1 2 now I need to add
another<00:02:38.790> 6<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.660> my<00:02:39.870> third<00:02:40.230> 1<00:02:41.130> 2<00:02:41.990> 3<00:02:42.990> 4<00:02:43.970> 5<00:02:44.990> 6<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.410> I

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
another 6 to my third 1 2 3 4 5 6 and I

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.240 
another 6 to my third 1 2 3 4 5 6 and I
need<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.550> add<00:02:47.670> my<00:02:47.970> next<00:02:48.030> two<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.800> fourth

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
need to add my next two to the fourth

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.300 
need to add my next two to the fourth
shell

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.890 

now<00:02:55.880> I've<00:02:56.209> written<00:02:56.540> 20<00:02:57.170> electrons<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:58.100> far<00:02:58.400> and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
now I've written 20 electrons so far and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.449 
now I've written 20 electrons so far and
in<00:02:59.900> most<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.620> high<00:03:00.800> school<00:03:01.160> when<00:03:01.310> you're

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
in most of high school when you're

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.130 
in most of high school when you're
drawing<00:03:01.700> board<00:03:02.000> with<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.270> for<00:03:02.420> diagrams<00:03:02.600> this

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
drawing board with it for diagrams this

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.040 
drawing board with it for diagrams this
is<00:03:03.260> as<00:03:03.440> far<00:03:03.709> as<00:03:03.740> you<00:03:03.890> would<00:03:04.100> go<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:05.540> reason

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
is as far as you would go and the reason

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.309 
is as far as you would go and the reason
is<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:07.069> next<00:03:07.610> shell<00:03:08.270> you<00:03:08.600> put<00:03:08.840> electrons

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
is that the next shell you put electrons

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.479 
is that the next shell you put electrons
into<00:03:09.770> line<00:03:10.310> line<00:03:10.610> line<00:03:10.819> line<00:03:11.240> is<00:03:11.950> now<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.010> can

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
into line line line line is now you can

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.790 
into line line line line is now you can
put<00:03:13.670> up<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:13.880> ten<00:03:14.540> back<00:03:15.319> in<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.220> third<00:03:16.550> shell

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
put up to ten back in the third shell

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.559 
put up to ten back in the third shell
two<00:03:18.800> electrons<00:03:19.430> go<00:03:19.640> into<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.910> fourth<00:03:20.239> shell

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
two electrons go into the fourth shell

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.160 
two electrons go into the fourth shell
before<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.430> put<00:03:22.670> any<00:03:22.910> into<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.870> third

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
before you can put any into the third

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.979 
before you can put any into the third
shell<00:03:24.560> it's<00:03:24.860> a<00:03:24.890> little<00:03:25.160> weird<00:03:25.370> but<00:03:26.209> according

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
shell it's a little weird but according

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.990 
shell it's a little weird but according
to<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.380> order<00:03:27.769> of<00:03:27.800> filling<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.489> I<00:03:28.519> have<00:03:28.760> down

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
to the order of filling that I have down

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.250 
to the order of filling that I have down
here<00:03:29.030> that's<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.720> way<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:29.930> is

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
here that's the way it is

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.930 
here that's the way it is
so<00:03:30.650> I'm<00:03:30.739> putting<00:03:30.980> ten<00:03:31.459> in<00:03:31.790> my<00:03:32.239> third<00:03:32.600> shell<00:03:32.989> now

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
so I'm putting ten in my third shell now

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:42.479 
so I'm putting ten in my third shell now
one<00:03:34.940> two<00:03:35.890> three<00:03:36.890> four<00:03:38.290> five<00:03:39.340> six<00:03:40.340> seven<00:03:41.300> eight

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
one two three four five six seven eight

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.370 
one two three four five six seven eight
nine<00:03:43.489> ten<00:03:44.420> Austrian<00:03:45.350> out<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.560> space<00:03:45.830> so<00:03:47.140> I<00:03:48.140> have

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
nine ten Austrian out of space so I have

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.199 
nine ten Austrian out of space so I have
thirty<00:03:48.769> electrons<00:03:49.400> now<00:03:49.670> if<00:03:49.880> you've<00:03:50.060> been

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
thirty electrons now if you've been

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.259 
thirty electrons now if you've been
counting<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.319> only<00:03:51.500> need<00:03:51.739> two<00:03:52.040> more<00:03:52.269> they

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
counting and I only need two more they

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.620 
counting and I only need two more they
happen<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:53.810> go<00:03:54.080> in<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.860> fourth<00:03:55.370> shell<00:03:56.230> one<00:03:57.550> two

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
happen to go in the fourth shell one two

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.620 
happen to go in the fourth shell one two
now<00:03:59.630> I<00:03:59.660> spread<00:04:00.170> them<00:04:00.350> out<00:04:00.500> because<00:04:00.769> peas<00:04:01.730> can

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
now I spread them out because peas can

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.440 
now I spread them out because peas can
handle<00:04:03.019> six<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.860> so<00:04:04.280> those<00:04:04.459> two<00:04:04.700> electrons

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
handle six and so those two electrons

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.190 
handle six and so those two electrons
aren't<00:04:05.690> automatically<00:04:06.260> paired<00:04:07.000> all<00:04:08.000> right<00:04:08.269> 32

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
aren't automatically paired all right 32

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.180 
aren't automatically paired all right 32
electrons<00:04:10.480> 32<00:04:11.480> protons<00:04:12.049> and<00:04:12.910> 41<00:04:13.910> neutrons

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
electrons 32 protons and 41 neutrons

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.550 
electrons 32 protons and 41 neutrons

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
natok number greater than 20 is that you

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.320 
natok number greater than 20 is that you
have<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.620> follow<00:04:21.859> this<00:04:22.190> order<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.729> filling<00:04:23.150> and

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
have to follow this order of filling and

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.710 
have to follow this order of filling and
put<00:04:23.930> two<00:04:24.140> in<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.320> first<00:04:24.620> two<00:04:25.190> in<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:26.240> second

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
put two in the first two in the second

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.920 
six more in the third two in the fourth
and<00:04:34.010> then<00:04:34.280> come<00:04:34.580> back<00:04:34.610> down<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.510> third

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
and then come back down to the third

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.240 
and then come back down to the third
shell<00:04:36.320> put<00:04:37.039> ten<00:04:37.400> in<00:04:37.610> there<00:04:37.820> then<00:04:38.590> six<00:04:39.590> more<00:04:39.979> in

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250

the fourth

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.219 
the fourth
then<00:04:41.570> two<00:04:42.160> into<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.280> fifth<00:04:43.750> before<00:04:44.750> you<00:04:45.080> go

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
then two into the fifth before you go

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.230 
then two into the fifth before you go
back<00:04:45.470> to<00:04:45.770> your<00:04:45.950> fourth<00:04:46.190> shell<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:46.729> add<00:04:46.880> some

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
back to your fourth shell and add some

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.900 
back to your fourth shell and add some
there<00:04:47.479> it<00:04:47.780> gets<00:04:48.289> really<00:04:48.530> complicated<00:04:48.910> but

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
there it gets really complicated but

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.870 
there it gets really complicated but
this<00:04:50.450> is<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.840> way<00:04:51.050> that<00:04:51.289> we<00:04:51.410> fill<00:04:51.880> electron

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
this is the way that we fill electron

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.969 
this is the way that we fill electron
orbitals<00:04:53.360> with<00:04:53.780> atoms<00:04:54.260> from<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.710> lowest

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
orbitals with atoms from the lowest

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.740 
orbitals with atoms from the lowest
energy<00:04:55.340> up

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.930
