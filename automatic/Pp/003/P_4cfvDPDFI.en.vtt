00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.860
 in today's tutorial we are going to make a 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.259
 furniture as you see is a piece of furniture 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.789
 we could say auxiliary because what 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.700
 we can use both in a bedroom 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.370
 like in a living room finally has 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.220
 many possibilities because it has three 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.600
 that is to say it is very useful and you will see 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.039
 what a beautiful thing we are going to go 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.140
 doing step by step 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.609
 we are going to make this piece of furniture what 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.189
 What we are going to do first is give you a 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.290
 walnut color we are going to do it like that because 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.480
 for our purposes good is 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.730
 necessary but we really could 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.739
 make even one with this same color 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.899
 which is precious by simply giving it a 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.430
 varnish later in the end but in short 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.239
 we are going to have a walnut color 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.769
 so it's from a set like the one 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.500
 we wish for that what we are going 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.079
 to use is a solvent dye of 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.449
 the brand chopo what good we are going to give 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.670
 simply with a bristle brush 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.519
 strong so that it can be introduced well 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.170
 in the bar the dye in all the 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.259
 structure of the wood and so we 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.700
 will be completely changed color 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.070
 good as you see and the first change is 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.890
 Well, huge because you see that is 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.720
 beautiful is a very nice walnut color 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.759
 Well, we are going to take advantage of it because 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.590
 is going to stay like this and now we will see step 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.750
 step by step how are we going to continue with our 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.430
 giving furniture by adding a little more 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.350
 decor 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.810
 well then once we have chosen the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.820
 paper that we found more appropriate 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.950
 What we do is cut out these flowers 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.320
 As you can see, they are large, so 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.090
 we do not have to do much cutting either 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.620
 we're just cutting out all the 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.740
 silhouette as you see what to do now mary 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.990
 that's it and then with all these roses and 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.030
 roberson magnolias really we have 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.980
 trimmed so what we will do is go 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.830
 making a composition at our table 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.070
 Then what Mary does is give a 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.470
 American hand painting is ccoo 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.560
 a chalky finishing paint or chalk 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.840
 and this is what is going to leave us with a base 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.820
 a gray color that we will see later how 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.400
 we are going to work to give us a 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.200
 final result this type of painting what 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.570
 good thing you have is that you do not need 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.340
 primer spread very well is very 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.290
 creamy and then it's very nice 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.080
 extend it extends with much 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.600
 ease and apart so much spreads 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.250
 with which really as you see the boat 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.710
 that has good emery will be left over 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.320
 We are going to use a lot as a 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.690
 third because it covers very well and I already 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.670
 I say and with one hand we will see very 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.680
 well extended that is the best thing that it has 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.380
 that extends very easily you see 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.630
 is covering the entire surface is not going to 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.130
 need a second hand and also not 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.410
 it leaves a trace because it extends like 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.480
 we have said very easily 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.690
 well then after giving the gray color 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.620
 what I'm going to tell you is the color color 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.140
 number 27 of American cork here is 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.570
 a color that is called yesterday so what 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.210
 that we now go to give another color in 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.190
 this case is the color 02 which is the color 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.680
 lace or entel of the same house 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.660
 american color and let's give it a 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.700
 hand to the whole front 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.520
 this is how you remember it extends very 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.740
 well as you can see even on top of 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.450
 another color and once it's dry already 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.030
 below we are going to tell you how 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.280
 we follow once the color is applied 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.470
 white what we do is with a lato a 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.050
 Brass or copper brush in this case 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.270
 of brass we 're going to go from left to 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.300
 right for example that is to say in one 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.000
 stripe that is to create these stripes that 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.850
 we see that he is creating creating this 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.250
 is and so let's proceed with all the 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.510
 fronts of all the drawers just like 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.730
 we have proceeded with the drawers 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.770
 proceed now with the top 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.260
 that as you remember we had painted 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.900
 also the same gray color and now 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.640
 let's give it this color 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.040
 with which we are going to finish the surface 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.900
 good surfaces larger than this 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.250
 what we do is that we do not do it 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.409
 once but we're doing it for 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.739
 chunks is to say once we already see that 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:03.200
 is this is mary happens this is so that 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.030
 we stayed perfectly well defined 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.030
 the scratching we are doing 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.300
 well now let's move on as 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.160
 we have said a sandpaper this cue for you see 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.110
 those small groups that have been left 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.810
 pass the brush this time that syndicate 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.540
 Mary, we're going to take this away 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.340
 with the help of limestone in this way 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.930
 we will also leave the entire surface well 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.420
 burnished this but keeping that streak 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.030
 that pickling like you've done this time 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.550
 with the brass brush, well, now 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.980
 what we have done is cut a series 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.380
 of flowers as we said these 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.610
 magnolias that we had seen before 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.800
 rice paper we've gone 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.000
 trimming and we have also cut a 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.860
 background that came in one of the papers 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.990
 what you see is like a kind of lace 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.850
 and we have simply overlapped to 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.860
 go creating the image that we want to end 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.440
 once we know exactly how 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.410
 we want our design with a glue 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.110
 which is called decoupage in mate also 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.940
 of the American decor house what 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.730
 we do is go hitting each one of these 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.550
 papers with giving a little adhesive on 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.740
 the table and then putting on the 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.020
 paper and surely then we will pass 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.960
 bring a little bit of it for the part 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.380
 top of the paper 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.389
 to finish doing good because this is 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.910
 The final result of our furniture 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.759
 As you can see, this is a detail of the lid 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.430
 and the song is a little bit good 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.169
 I know perfectly how it has been 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.990
 stripping the songs are very well 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.630
 gray below then good through 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.330
 of the rice paper can be seen also 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.639
 all the scratching we have done this is 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.360
 beige we've been gluing all the flowers 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:48.930
 all the paper that we had said this is 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.419
 so it looks very good and then we see see 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.250
 in the drawers you see where you can see 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.520
 perfectly scratched under the 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.840
 flowers and even some petals have 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.150
 been a little bit bigger of all the 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.389
 we have left turning around so that 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:07.680
 be more integrated into the good piece of furniture 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:09.389
 and as you see this is going to be left 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.460
 what we have done in the shooters the 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.979
 we have also had the same color 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.889
 walnut and then we have given him painting 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.810
 white a little bit above what is 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.789
 called dry brush is to say simply 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.610
 giving it a bit of white hue to 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:26.639
 that would not be so dark you can see the drawer 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.160
 central is also very very beautiful and 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.289
 this way the furniture is left as 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.020
 you can observe let's see it now from 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:37.770
 a slightly more integral form from 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.770
 far this is good and this aspect so 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.050
 fabulous is the one that stays in our 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.270
 furniture this week that as we said 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.120
 you can put it well then then and 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.550
 ticos want us to say that 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.949
 this also give in a room as in 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.949
 a bedroom 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.870
 It has been a beautiful job that 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.490
 Any questions as long as you have 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.870
 on social networks or on the web 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.870
 we are here to help you
