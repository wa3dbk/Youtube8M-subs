00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.990 
with aurorus today I think it looks so
badass<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.399> actually<00:02:02.520> have<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> move

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
badass and it can actually have a move

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.670 
badass and it can actually have a move
called<00:02:03.180> freeze-dry<00:02:03.780> which<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.110> an<00:02:04.229> ice<00:02:04.380> type

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680

called freeze-dry which is an ice type
moves<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.280> apparently<00:02:05.729> freezes<00:02:06.270> your

moves that apparently freezes your

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.180 
moves that apparently freezes your

effective on water types mm-hmm so that

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.339

just like a move that just freezes you

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.119 
just like a move that just freezes you

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.979 
back really quick on freeze dry it could
very<00:03:43.139> well<00:03:43.199> be<00:03:43.530> like<00:03:43.769> skulled<00:03:44.159> like<00:03:45.150> yes<00:03:45.690> it

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
very well be like skulled like yes it

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.319 
very well be like skulled like yes it
says<00:03:46.169> on<00:03:46.349> serebii<00:03:46.919> it<00:03:47.159> says<00:03:47.579> that<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.849> freezes

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
says on serebii it says that it freezes

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.589 
says on serebii it says that it freezes
but<00:03:48.810> maybe<00:03:48.989> it's<00:03:49.169> just<00:03:49.229> a<00:03:49.379> chance<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.889> freeze

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
but maybe it's just a chance to freeze

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.119 
but maybe it's just a chance to freeze
so<00:03:51.599> that's<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.169> good<00:03:52.229> point<00:03:52.530> that's<00:03:52.919> a<00:03:53.010> good

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
so that's a good point that's a good

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.259 
so that's a good point that's a good
point<00:03:53.310> though<00:03:53.489> that's<00:03:53.519> a<00:03:53.760> good<00:03:53.790> point<00:03:53.940> it

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
point though that's a good point it

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.149 
point though that's a good point it
could<00:03:54.419> be<00:03:54.569> just<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.870> chance<00:03:55.139> to<00:03:55.290> freeze<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.979> I

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
could be just a chance to freeze and I

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.649 
could be just a chance to freeze and I
would<00:03:56.340> honestly<00:03:56.699> like<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.239> better<00:03:57.419> than

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
would honestly like that better than

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.119 
would honestly like that better than
just<00:03:58.019> automatic<00:03:58.470> freeze<00:03:58.709> i<00:03:58.859> think<00:03:59.010> that's

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
just automatic freeze i think that's

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.800 
just automatic freeze i think that's
little<00:03:59.400> p<00:03:59.579> i<00:03:59.609> think<00:03:59.909> they're<00:04:00.030> making<00:04:00.389> a<00:04:00.449> rawrus

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
little p i think they're making a rawrus

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.539 
little p i think they're making a rawrus
a<00:04:00.900> little<00:04:01.139> Opie<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.069> think<00:04:02.280> they're<00:04:02.370> doing

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
a little Opie and I think they're doing

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.219 
a little Opie and I think they're doing
that<00:04:02.790> just<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.269> give<00:04:03.419> it<00:04:03.449> a<00:04:03.540> chance<00:04:03.750> against

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:04.229 
that just to give it a chance against

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.740 
that just to give it a chance against
tyrantrum<00:04:04.849> because<00:04:05.849> this<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.239> where<00:04:06.359> Kristen

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
tyrantrum because this is where Kristen

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.189 
tyrantrum because this is where Kristen
and<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:06.930> differ<00:04:07.199> again<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:08.359> see<00:04:09.359> tyrantrum<00:04:09.870> as

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
and I differ again I see tyrantrum as

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.899 
and I differ again I see tyrantrum as
being<00:04:10.470> like<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.949> straight<00:04:11.220> attacker<00:04:11.609> and

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
being like the straight attacker and

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.729 
being like the straight attacker and
aurorus<00:04:12.569> is<00:04:12.659> gonna<00:04:12.840> be<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.049> bulky<00:04:13.379> one<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.680> I

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
aurorus is gonna be the bulky one and I

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.879 
aurorus is gonna be the bulky one and I
think<00:04:14.069> tyrantrum<00:04:14.459> gonna<00:04:14.790> be<00:04:14.909> fast<00:04:15.150> as<00:04:15.419> hell

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
think tyrantrum gonna be fast as hell

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.129 
think tyrantrum gonna be fast as hell
and<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:17.639> only<00:04:17.759> thing<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.329> I<00:04:18.630> really

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
and the only thing that I really

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.839 
and the only thing that I really
disagree<00:04:19.620> with<00:04:19.949> is<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.280> think<00:04:20.400> he's<00:04:20.639> gonna<00:04:20.759> be

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
disagree with is I think he's gonna be

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.730 
disagree with is I think he's gonna be
slow<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.509> course<00:04:21.539> I<00:04:21.959> think<00:04:22.139> aurorus<00:04:22.560> is

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
slow of course I think aurorus is

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.950 
slow of course I think aurorus is
probably<00:04:23.010> gonna<00:04:23.159> be<00:04:23.219> slower<00:04:23.669> and<00:04:24.029> obviously

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
probably gonna be slower and obviously

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.390 
probably gonna be slower and obviously
he's<00:04:25.200> gonna<00:04:25.380> be<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.590> bulky<00:04:26.010> one<00:04:26.159> in<00:04:26.279> my

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
he's gonna be the bulky one in my

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.379 
he's gonna be the bulky one in my
opinion<00:04:26.669> like<00:04:26.940> nap

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
opinion like nap

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.659 
opinion like nap
just<00:04:27.629> said<00:04:27.840> but<00:04:28.499> I<00:04:28.560> don't<00:04:28.770> think<00:04:29.009> tyrantrum<00:04:29.460> is

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
just said but I don't think tyrantrum is

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.330 
just said but I don't think tyrantrum is
going<00:04:29.789> to<00:04:29.849> be<00:04:29.909> fast<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.509> think<00:04:31.319> that<00:04:31.650> tyrantrum

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
going to be fast I think that tyrantrum

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.040 
going to be fast I think that tyrantrum
he<00:04:32.699> may<00:04:32.789> not<00:04:32.939> be<00:04:33.090> like<00:04:33.270> super<00:04:33.569> super<00:04:33.719> speedy

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
he may not be like super super speedy

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.920 
he may not be like super super speedy
but<00:04:34.229> I<00:04:34.469> think<00:04:34.710> he'll<00:04:34.889> have<00:04:35.099> like<00:04:35.340> a<00:04:35.930> common

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
but I think he'll have like a common

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.749 
but I think he'll have like a common
speed<00:04:37.289> or<00:04:37.529> neutral<00:04:38.099> speed<00:04:38.310> or<00:04:38.460> whatever<00:04:38.669> the

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
speed or neutral speed or whatever the

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.399 
speed or neutral speed or whatever the
fuck<00:04:38.909> you<00:04:39.029> want<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.180> call<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.419> like<00:04:39.629> in<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:40.379> 80s

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409 
fuck you want to call it like in the 80s

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.230 
fuck you want to call it like in the 80s
to<00:04:40.889> 90<00:04:41.189> somewhere<00:04:41.639> around<00:04:41.729> there<00:04:42.029> i<00:04:42.060> don't

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
to 90 somewhere around there i don't

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.019 
to 90 somewhere around there i don't
think<00:04:42.389> it's<00:04:42.509> gonna<00:04:42.840> be<00:04:43.020> down<00:04:43.199> in<00:04:43.319> the<00:04:43.349> 60s<00:04:43.800> i

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:44.029 
think it's gonna be down in the 60s i

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:47.050 
think it's gonna be down in the 60s i
think<00:04:45.029> that<00:04:45.060> could<00:04:45.300> be<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.449> roars<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:46.080> speed

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
think that could be a roars to speed

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.450 
think that could be a roars to speed
yeah<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.509> know<00:04:48.599> even<00:04:48.960> if<00:04:49.379> aurorus<00:04:49.979> is<00:04:50.159> really

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
yeah you know even if aurorus is really

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.089 
yeah you know even if aurorus is really
slow<00:04:50.699> I<00:04:50.939> really<00:04:51.539> hope<00:04:51.840> that<00:04:52.469> he's<00:04:52.740> able<00:04:52.770> to

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
slow I really hope that he's able to

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.320 
slow I really hope that he's able to
take<00:04:53.249> hits<00:04:53.490> because<00:04:53.759> he's<00:04:53.939> gonna<00:04:54.090> need<00:04:54.270> to

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
take hits because he's gonna need to

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.179 
take hits because he's gonna need to
take<00:04:54.449> a<00:04:54.629> hit<00:04:54.900> especially<00:04:55.110> against<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.800> fighting

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:56.189 
take a hit especially against a fighting

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:58.640 
take a hit especially against a fighting
type<00:04:56.340> move<00:04:56.400> ouch<00:04:57.090> yep<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.289> that's<00:04:58.349> another

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
type move ouch yep and that's another

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.320 
type move ouch yep and that's another
thing<00:04:58.770> just<00:04:59.249> based<00:04:59.430> off<00:04:59.639> of<00:04:59.699> their<00:04:59.969> designs

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
thing just based off of their designs

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.050 
thing just based off of their designs
and<00:05:00.539> whatnot<00:05:00.810> I<00:05:00.960> can<00:05:01.199> see<00:05:01.759> like<00:05:02.759> we<00:05:02.879> said<00:05:03.000> a

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
and whatnot I can see like we said a

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.050 
and whatnot I can see like we said a
horse<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.449> going<00:05:03.569> to<00:05:03.629> be<00:05:03.689> defensive<00:05:03.990> i<00:05:04.319> can<00:05:04.469> see

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
horse is going to be defensive i can see

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.029 
horse is going to be defensive i can see
tyrantrum<00:05:06.060> just<00:05:06.479> being<00:05:06.659> pure<00:05:06.960> attack<00:05:07.349> attack

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
tyrantrum just being pure attack attack

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.769 
tyrantrum just being pure attack attack
attack<00:05:08.069> attack<00:05:08.430> he's<00:05:08.879> I'm<00:05:09.270> guessing<00:05:09.659> his

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
attack attack he's I'm guessing his

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:10.999 
attack attack he's I'm guessing his
typing<00:05:10.080> didn't<00:05:10.319> change<00:05:10.500> like<00:05:10.680> we<00:05:10.710> say<00:05:10.860> when<00:05:10.979> I

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
typing didn't change like we say when I

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.469 
typing didn't change like we say when I
have<00:05:11.129> any<00:05:11.250> information<00:05:11.430> on<00:05:11.879> them<00:05:12.090> outside<00:05:12.360> of

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
have any information on them outside of

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.659 
have any information on them outside of
that<00:05:12.599> but<00:05:13.500> I'm<00:05:13.560> guessing<00:05:13.740> if<00:05:14.129> we<00:05:14.310> just<00:05:14.460> go<00:05:14.580> off

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
that but I'm guessing if we just go off

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
there's also a little bit of additional

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.010 
there's also a little bit of additional
tag<00:05:35.699> along<00:05:35.939> information<00:05:36.180> whatever<00:05:36.750> you<00:05:36.900> want

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
to call it I'm apparently now when you

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.689 
to call it I'm apparently now when you
capture<00:05:39.689> Pokemon<00:05:40.310> you<00:05:41.310> will<00:05:41.430> still<00:05:41.610> get

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
capture Pokemon you will still get

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.909 
capture Pokemon you will still get
experience<00:05:42.289> mm-hmm<00:05:43.289> and<00:05:43.849> I<00:05:44.849> think<00:05:44.909> that's

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
experience mm-hmm and I think that's

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.860 
experience mm-hmm and I think that's
cool<00:05:46.919> I<00:05:47.279> guess<00:05:47.729> I<00:05:48.270> don't<00:05:48.479> really<00:05:48.629> see<00:05:48.719> a

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
cool I guess I don't really see a

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.689 
cool I guess I don't really see a
problem<00:05:49.050> with<00:05:49.289> it<00:05:49.409> but<00:05:49.860> there's<00:05:50.550> not<00:05:50.669> a

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
problem with it but there's not a

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.249 
problem with it but there's not a
downside<00:05:51.180> to<00:05:51.210> I<00:05:51.449> mean<00:05:51.689> it<00:05:51.810> does<00:05:51.930> really<00:05:52.110> make

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
downside to I mean it does really make

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.980 
downside to I mean it does really make
much<00:05:52.439> sense<00:05:52.469> to<00:05:53.069> me<00:05:53.729> it<00:05:53.969> makes<00:05:54.210> sense<00:05:54.479> because

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
much sense to me it makes sense because

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.990 
much sense to me it makes sense because
it's<00:05:55.710> just<00:05:55.830> a<00:05:56.069> little<00:05:56.189> bit<00:05:56.370> more<00:05:56.520> of<00:05:56.669> like<00:05:56.849> an

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
it's just a little bit more of like an

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.909 
it's just a little bit more of like an
incentive<00:05:57.449> to<00:05:57.479> capture<00:05:58.139> Pokemon<00:05:58.349> and<00:05:58.770> fill<00:05:58.860> up

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
would faint it maybe I could see like a

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.760 
would faint it maybe I could see like a
quarter<00:06:09.259> experience<00:06:10.259> from<00:06:10.409> capturing<00:06:10.710> a

this<00:07:06.360> isn't<00:07:06.600> related<00:07:07.500> to<00:07:07.830> the<00:07:08.010> changing<00:07:08.550> rooms

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
this isn't related to the changing rooms

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.160 
this isn't related to the changing rooms
or<00:07:08.910> whatever<00:07:09.240> we're<00:07:09.390> going<00:07:09.510> to<00:07:09.600> have<00:07:09.840> to

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.170 
or whatever we're going to have to

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.600 
or whatever we're going to have to
change<00:07:10.320> our<00:07:10.470> outfits<00:07:10.800> but<00:07:10.950> I<00:07:11.010> hope<00:07:11.340> that<00:07:11.520> we

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610 
change our outfits but I hope that we

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.390 
change our outfits but I hope that we
either<00:07:11.670> see<00:07:11.940> DLC<00:07:12.480> or<00:07:12.510> unlock<00:07:13.500> things<00:07:13.770> as<00:07:14.130> we

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 
either see DLC or unlock things as we

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.210 
either see DLC or unlock things as we
play<00:07:14.640> through<00:07:14.850> the<00:07:14.940> game<00:07:14.970> like<00:07:15.360> outfits<00:07:15.930> or

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.220 
play through the game like outfits or

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.230 
play through the game like outfits or
accessories<00:07:17.220> so<00:07:17.460> hopefully<00:07:17.760> it'll<00:07:17.910> work<00:07:17.970> like

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
accessories so hopefully it'll work like

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.230

that<00:07:19.040> hopefully<00:07:20.040> but<00:07:20.700> like<00:07:20.850> we<00:07:20.970> said<00:07:21.000> earlier
