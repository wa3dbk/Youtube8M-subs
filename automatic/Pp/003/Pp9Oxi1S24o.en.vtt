00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Ah 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.279
 A talented singer, Yoon Ha and a great birthday 2 Nation Style 50 from Toronto 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.480
 We showed a special stage. 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:30.660
 If possible, the last weekend Melaka Tourism Swansea audience Cultural Caravan 10 2 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.369
 Enthusiastic stage of warriors An anthology of Korean wave car bombing applauded and enthusiastically 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.350
 Cheered writes 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:42.149
 They live in places where they can see the stage. 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.449
 On the lawn, there is no layer, and my dad , 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.739
 I also visited the Guan Dan stage. 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:54.870
 The first stage that was held at the end of the day was two Shane's. 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:01:00.239
 On this day, Shane pitched the piano and gave a sweet voice to the butterfly effect of Shin Seung-hoon's mentor. 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:05.010
 I clicked and gave a story about the storage in his album 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:10.710
 The cafÃ©s clapped early and applaud 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:15.659
 I sent him a 50-degree suit and he signed a copy of his wish. 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.390
 Shane , along with Yoon Ah, gives six wonderful songs, 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.410
 I ran into a different stage. 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:27.150
 The last stage is our rising singer. 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:31.730
 It 's a bit more than a stand-alone interview with Ulvi 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.730
 I told you I was going to show you something on stage . 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:44.580
 Still, music can communicate without any nationality regardless of race. 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:49.470
 It's a little burdensome because I think I need to show you something. 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:54.539
 Yoona added that it was the last order and a little uneasy. 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.509
 Deoraguyo came an awful lot, so I put the kick to the last final stage 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:01.470
 When I have to do it, I have some anxiety about the unit. 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:05.399
 1000000 Unlike this reason We followed my return from the audience 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:09.119
 I went to the front of the stage and cheered it out enthusiastically. 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:14.940
 Yoona's energy from a small body spout 4 n 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:20.910
 Unlike're in the audience, I say to downstream neighbors shouting encore 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:24.900
 I gave it to the painters and multi-viewers to perform in a wonderful stage. 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.560
 Oh eojjeom viewers so again I come to you today to show 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.030
 Thank you for so I like to move forward with the wheel load and numerous South Korea 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.140
 I'd look pretty outrageous for the challenge of informing the Korean artist 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.320
 I wish 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:43.080
 Multi- b penalty is packing 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.970
 The flat octopus and the stage where the plate goes beyond that frame and the finished gust over the whole of Canada 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.440
 It is raising. 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.440
 Multi- glacier correction 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.959
