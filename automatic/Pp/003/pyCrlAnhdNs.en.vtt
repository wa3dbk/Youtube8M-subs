00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.720
 assassin against morfling who 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.150
 will be stronger 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.400
 super late light with great skate 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.829

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.290
 kerrigan girov this you will know completely 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.600
 Soon you can look at the rules 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.330
 description and clicking on the button in order to 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.769
 listen about them in the pilot release time 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.140
 take a look at the subject and selected 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.940
 Morph participants decided that for 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.890
 order to defeat the templark is necessary 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.049
 quickly shoot down and looking and while not 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.720
 ogresti with these terrible peepers and in this 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:55.699
 manta and butterfly will help him 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.199
 decided to strengthen her already 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.180
 good minus enemy armor 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.760
 let's see what happens 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.799
 more efficient and so the first round of marfu already 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.540
 I can't wait to start fighting templark I 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.490
 loaded shield marv used wave 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.320
 start to beat on the bar creates an illusion 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.540
 decomposed manta knocked off her shield 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.890
 starting to fight immediately adaptive strike 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.510
 templarka trying to cut and she 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.770
 too much meat in tumblr kites 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.049
 malakhov she uses inviz but 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.369
 misses with inviza and morph takes 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.500
 her round number 2 you can immediately 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.300
 rolled on templarki creates a bunch 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.770
 illusions again begins to peck us 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.940
 a couple of notes are finally starting 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.980
 fall on it he use when 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.220
 tempo adaptive strike templar sags 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.920
 and go to inviz. and dies a lot 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.950
 illusions unexpected victory marfa do 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.780
 deep light of the gang is not just a win 20 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.850
 extremely unexpected outcome for me personally 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.740
 and I'm not sure if the template can 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.350
 do something in the next fights because it 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.720
 morph is one of the strongest kerry most 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.310
 real chinese hero time 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.409
 see what 's new bought 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.090
 Templark members realized that so 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.790
 continue can't play against 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.400
 Martha the media themselves is unreal but she is a dream 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.710
 my cherishing arrived brilliantly bought 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.570
 MKB on Cupid by default Taras Kaido 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.729
 mine at our maximum survival rate and 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.259
 damage by pumping marfu directly not 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.269
 eager to fight he uses your mind 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.769
 templarku use three more tiles 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.810
 lay Samantha begins to peck 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.670
 us a couple quickly sags but he you 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.890
 already on the floor hepe begins to pump 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.290
 templarka worth again goes to Invest 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.019
 finishes marfa but she herself dies from 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.849
 illusions templar already runs to hang 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.469
 people more food at wave 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.069
 dragon begins to use replicas 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.930
 than for some reason does not use manta 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.599
 he squander his flu 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.200
 uses mantui die morph just 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.299
 gave himself that nonsense but 21 from templar 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.219
 points first round was incredible kill 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.909
 you don't see each other often 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.730
 round two 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.920
 God knows what happened there but morph 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.079
 Stupidly surrendered to templarki and sends 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.000
 to watch the third part what will buy 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.129
 imagine the participants for the third part of the duel 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.139
 you can buy satanic and templar 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.139
 selling talismans and virgin buy more 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.909
 Daedalus and halberd plugged q not the most 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.310
 honest choice as for me but to do 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.469
 nothing we will watch you can bear it 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.599
 sound bar makes wave use 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.159
 replicas are still decomposed manta his here 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.049
 same shut up he starts to shoot down 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.780
 refraction already left on php started 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.639
 roll call do demolish hp ok 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.280
 it makes the son a visa 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:19.730
 there is too little demage for marfa and 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.250
 there is not enough damage to score templar 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.530
 the impudent mug is already running by march so mort 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.480
 roll starts the fight immediately 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.730
 sums visa sick butt so straight 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.699
 decomposed morph bunch of illusions how painful 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.540
 squander templar and finish it 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:38.849
 adaptive to construction sites and so fight that 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.579
 drags all morph rolled used 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.400
 illusions created replicas still starts to beat 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.470
 ok so squander fight flat 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.659
 meanwhile uses refraction shut up 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.409
 at the right moment pass with a basin 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:54.870
 I plugged the marfa and killed him in short i 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.540
 I think that plugging marfa under sata nickname 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.280
 it was n't fair but nevertheless in the game you 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.489
 you won't tell the enemy something like 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.799
 hey boy you got kuni there buy 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.909
 Yes, and BK, too, do not need better at all 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.489
 not buying anything 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.709
 and on the base of stand so you can say 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.900
 almost honest victory templarki harsh 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.299
 I had a duel, I hope, quite interesting 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.180
