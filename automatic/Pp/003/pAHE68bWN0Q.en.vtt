00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
can we solve problems for my to target

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.760 
can we solve problems for my to target
we<00:00:33.719> saw<00:00:33.840> him<00:00:33.989> probably<00:00:34.140> especially<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.620> saw

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
we saw him probably especially I saw

oh yes I saw that but she only had to

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.940 
oh yes I saw that but she only had to
worry<00:00:38.879> about<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.500> she's<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:40.620> stressed

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
worry about that she's not stressed

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.560 
worry about that she's not stressed
about<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.430> take<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> stress<00:00:41.969> off<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.270> her

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
about that I take the stress off of her

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.850 
about that I take the stress off of her
I'm<00:00:42.719> gonna<00:00:42.899> handle<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.440> scene<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.710> gotta

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
I'm gonna handle that scene you gotta

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.990 
I'm gonna handle that scene you gotta
worry<00:00:44.070> about<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.460> ice<00:00:44.579> when<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.820> feel<00:00:44.969> most

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
worry about that ice when I feel most

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.420 
worry about that ice when I feel most
like<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.360> man<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.559> boys<00:00:46.770> tend<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.160> create

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
like a man so you boys tend to create

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.729 
like a man so you boys tend to create
problems<00:00:48.200> we're<00:00:49.200> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.469> into<00:00:49.649> this

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
problems we're going to get into this

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.110 
problems we're going to get into this
next<00:00:49.980> week<00:00:50.070> ice<00:00:50.129> when<00:00:50.280> they<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.579> give<00:00:51.090> you

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
next week ice when they just give you

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.430 
next week ice when they just give you
all<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> practice<00:00:51.840> that's<00:00:52.050> another<00:00:52.289> word

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
all the practice that's another word

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.000 
all the practice that's another word
y'all<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.860> write<00:00:53.039> down<00:00:53.190> preface<00:00:54.890> just<00:00:55.890> think

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
y'all can write down preface just think

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.970 
y'all can write down preface just think
about<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.250> an<00:00:56.340> introduction<00:00:56.789> kind<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.149> plane

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
about like an introduction kind of plane

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:09.380 
about like an introduction kind of plane
so<00:00:58.980> create<00:00:59.870> creates<00:01:01.609> problem<00:01:04.549> men<00:01:06.140> solves<00:01:08.390> men

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
so create creates problem men solves men

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.630 
so create creates problem men solves men
we<00:01:09.540> solve<00:01:09.840> problems<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.619> then<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.400> solve

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
we solve problems and then we solve

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.490 
we solve problems and then we solve
problems<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.299> that's<00:01:12.659> what<00:01:12.869> makes<00:01:13.110> us<00:01:13.290> feel

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
problems that that's what makes us feel

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.840 
problems that that's what makes us feel
like<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> man<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.549> something<00:01:14.790> needs

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
like a man so if something needs

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.010 
like a man so if something needs
something's<00:01:15.180> broken<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.600> house<00:01:15.720> that's<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
something's broken in the house that's a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.719 
something's broken in the house that's a
problem<00:01:16.259> okay<00:01:16.830> go<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.220> hammer<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:17.610> I'm

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
problem okay go get a hammer in here I'm

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.240 
problem okay go get a hammer in here I'm
going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.939> solve<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.470> if<00:01:19.470> my<00:01:19.950> wife<00:01:20.100> is

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
going to solve that if my wife is

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.590 
going to solve that if my wife is
unhappy<00:01:20.640> that's<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.880> problem<00:01:21.119> okay<00:01:21.360> let<00:01:21.540> me

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
unhappy that's a problem okay let me

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.730 
unhappy that's a problem okay let me
figure<00:01:21.750> out<00:01:21.840> what's<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> solution<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.590> that

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
figure out what's the solution to that

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.070 
figure out what's the solution to that
to<00:01:22.920> make<00:01:23.070> her<00:01:23.159> happy<00:01:23.509> if<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.689> children<00:01:24.990> need

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
to make her happy if the children need

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.450 
to make her happy if the children need
something<00:01:25.409> that's<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.619> problem<00:01:25.860> okay<00:01:26.070> what's

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
something that's a problem okay what's

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.640 
something that's a problem okay what's
the<00:01:26.520> solution<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.180> always<00:01:27.990> trying<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the solution to that always trying to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.380 
the solution to that always trying to
develop<00:01:28.860> solutions<00:01:29.130> boys<00:01:29.610> tend<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
develop solutions boys tend not to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.399 
develop solutions boys tend not to
develop<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:30.900> they<00:01:31.020> seem<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.200> cause
