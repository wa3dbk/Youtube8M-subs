00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
back on this because it's again one of

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.430 
back on this because it's again one of
this<00:04:19.979> it's<00:04:20.449> the<00:04:21.449> fact<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.900> maps<00:04:22.139> really

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
this it's the fact that the maps really

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.430 
this it's the fact that the maps really
small<00:04:22.710> but<00:04:22.860> because<00:04:23.220> on<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:23.940> such<00:04:24.659> a<00:04:24.810> small<00:04:25.139> map

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
small but because on a such a small map

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.560 
small but because on a such a small map
as<00:04:25.770> well<00:04:25.830> you've<00:04:26.220> got<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:26.699> you've<00:04:27.060> got<00:04:27.090> to

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
as well you've got to you've got to

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.480 
as well you've got to you've got to
check<00:04:27.720> your<00:04:27.870> back<00:04:28.020> anyway<00:04:28.500> because<00:04:28.680> people<00:04:29.340> go

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
check your back anyway because people go

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.189 
check your back anyway because people go
for<00:04:29.699> the<00:04:29.820> ballistic<00:04:30.360> knives<00:04:30.539> into<00:04:30.780> your<00:04:31.020> back

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
for the ballistic knives into your back

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.180

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
and knife to the back because there's

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.580 
and knife to the back because there's
some<00:04:36.440> challenges<00:04:37.440> for<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:37.949> stuff<00:04:39.289> but<00:04:40.289> the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
some challenges for it and stuff but the

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.930 
some challenges for it and stuff but the
fact<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:40.860> it's<00:04:41.039> on<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.159> small<00:04:41.460> map<00:04:41.610> really

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
fact that it's on a small map really

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.240 
fact that it's on a small map really
doesn't<00:04:42.360> help

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.320 

so<00:04:46.250> yeah<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.570> game<00:04:47.990> is<00:04:48.310> cutting<00:04:49.310> its<00:04:49.490> last<00:04:49.790> 40

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
so yeah the game is cutting its last 40

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.070
