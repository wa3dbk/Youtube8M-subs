00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.360
 theme of the book is welcome 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.759
 and have a nice evening to you today 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.680
 second part of the program as already 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.900
 promised 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.210
 Although it is about the upper body today 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.760
 start herewith the date videos 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 So with the shoulder share the me 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.510
 just pull to the side and the whole 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.519
 isometric just shown today 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.080
 that whole can be completed 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.270
 is really just an example of that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.510
 programs easy to show how 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.890
 I really achieve a flexibility 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.550
 both in the movement apparatus of the shoulder 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.890
 in the fuselage in the back share and really 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.750
 a complete program 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.879
 we have just seen one hold 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.280
 Movements should be here as one hand 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.739
 20 seconds are respected even if 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.170
 it is not exemplary now 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.649
 demonstrated in the short time 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.510
 should that really be achieved 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.890
 this is a trapezium share of the can 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.970
 So dance really the descending 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.060
 share just really depression so 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.830
 really push down 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.350
 Poor ones are really close after 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.840
 stay down stretched and press that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.049
 whole again then for the rear 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.110
 share for the latinos again 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.299
 that means one hand 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.240
 is abut the opposite arm 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.689
 shows the head so the current 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.210
 page is stretched and important it is 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.579
 this real proper movement 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:40.229
 initiate and then keep going there 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:41.970
 light reflex you notice there and 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.579
 yes important maybe again 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.259
 here at all in the adult 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.700
 single nor a proper movement 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.649
 to reach the school 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.350
 really be stretched regularly 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.409
 that does not mean one to two times the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.240
 three times the minimum would be four 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.729
 up to five times a week of course 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.920
 Of course you wear the super 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.869
 other portals why or where is because 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.390
 Of course every focus is on us 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.700
 strength sports who fixates on it 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.989
 to build muscle 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.590
 perhaps briefly here now 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.299
 for the biceps bach 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.510
 have stretched important here 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:20.390
 thumb will also turn to palm 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.459
 pointing ajar and then I use 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.980
 now just the bottom as a counterpart 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.220
 then where I press against it similar 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.730
 shares accordingly on the other 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.400
 side I stretch over only then the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.290
 thumb reached there with it too 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.840
 at the same time an extension in the wrist 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.230
 if one or the other problems there 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.180
 has just at short just the short 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.819
 Wrinkles do not get there properly 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.730
 Accordingly, the movement is very good 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.419
 helped those over years to suffer 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.340
 Neat and now we have to 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.629
 should clarify again after the 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.599
 go for a drink or really am 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.220
 weekend where i leave for training 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:05.450
 both have advantages and disadvantages quite completely 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.939
 clearly must have died here so the tripod 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.379
 factual that simply has the meaning 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.139
 I really do the training 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.180
 immediately the attraction because the 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.879
 Musculature is a disadvantage 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.379
 in principle, always at the that 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.780
 So muscle blockage really is one 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.849
 blood circulation temporarily not 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.829
 can take place in that the muscle 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.349
 so stretched is so in the sense that 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.510
 has neat power so gets stretched 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.459
 that really is a circulation of the blood 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.859
 in the muscat apparatus itself for the 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.409
 short-term the phase not 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.329
 is guaranteed 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.260
 yes and there are of course now they are 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.019
 disadvantage 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.090
 Everyone has to find out for themselves what it is 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.069
 better of course at the training fall 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.389
 wear is of course the optimum but 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.250
 Of course I do that regularly now 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.560
 where should I not only two three 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.030
 training breaks but must do that 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.010
 Of course, then after the training 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.750
 make and so it brings 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.159
 in principle not the whole, above all 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.220
 It is enough to make it easy 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.370
 Warming up neat way into neat 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.190
 movement and otherwise 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.849
 then after that again for 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.010
 The back 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.959
 maybe to the exercise program for 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.229
 the back means that will back 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.549
 stretched is stretched toward the front 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.280
 and then in the movement again the 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.840
 finger step by step finger for finger 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.790
 pull forward so that really the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:31.360
 reflex also initiated is still 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.220
 times the one-sided contraction stocks 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.169
 and only we have moved apart 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.910
 by looking at the opposite 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.310
 go side and stretches forward 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.760
 the same for the belly portion 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.500
 that is, if that's what the whole thing did 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.000
 simply the hyperextension of the back 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.010
 go and so that the hyperextension 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.900
 starting from the hip at the same time 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.639
 important here perhaps again 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.630
 shoulder blades would have pulled backwards 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.949
 Full stretch arms will be 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.479
 possibly describes that I can now 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.310
 in that sense, I would not have the 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.169
 palm continue to accept forward 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.050
 to stay in the conversation and now again 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.880
 a light relaxation exercise for the 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.599
 back share because of course that 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:17.349
 difficult thing is what is it 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:19.120
 really what is the pain and that is 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.770
 really the pain I still too 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.750
 overcome 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:26.080
 this shows the experience the longer you are 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.789
 the whole thing makes you more enduring 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.080
 achieved by that of course the 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.729
 could overcome pain that is you 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.440
 can feel the pain longer and 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.050
 and could keep going in the 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.150
 go Rhine if you do with any 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.599
 training is achieved like that 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.470
 Build up your power progressively 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.720
 increase achieved 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.630
 then you have fulfilled the meaning of it and 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.130
 I should do it regularly 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.750
 broken again after something else 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.520
 other 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.940
 then you have the sense and purpose of 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.410
 to reach the full 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.780
 at least to keep the course of the movement when 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.099
 I still have to optimize 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.470
 now we just oral impact 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.419
 seen that both sides are parallel 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.070
 have been stretched and now the whole 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.289
 one-sided we are here in functional 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.189
 area there i have a text band 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.479
 namely to help 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:15.150
 and that's it 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:18.150
 as far as if asking did you 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.219
 the whole filed tends it shares it 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.740
 especially and of course in the comments 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:23.339
 if question exist or really 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.909
 note 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:25.909
 see you 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.680
 around
