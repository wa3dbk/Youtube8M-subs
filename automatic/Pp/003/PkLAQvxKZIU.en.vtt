00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.259
 enrique has information also in 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.839
 I live to share with us 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.210
 that's how we do not know what happens with the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.580
 economy but in the economy the whiting 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.830
 they also say go to a dog cross 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.780
 sausage with cool but not manuel and we 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.640
 will tell from salaverry what is 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.120
 happening with this animal and I know it looks 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.010
 so splendid manuel 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.110
 very good morning, what you are 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.840
 watching on screen is not a chip either 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.240
 is a Pekingese is the supercuy is a club 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.220
 and that has been modified by 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.780
 Peruvian scientists to produce the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.310
 animal that is seeing this extension if 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.020
 compared with which they have here 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.760
 on the right this is the normal queens 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.620
 that you can that you sell in 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.530
 every day in a market in a 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.020
 farm and the one on the other side is the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.670
 cuit peruano is a super kubica has been 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.470
 modified by the same scientists 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.360
 Peruvians and so they do not know 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.879
 respect we are here with the engineer 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.010
 Liliana Chauca is already representative here 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.629
 of the national institute of innovation 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.550
 Agrarian Ministry of Agriculture 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.860
 to tell us about the benefits of 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.930
 this super cool because it's not big anymore 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.269
 for the pure ones is because it has 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.830
 benefits that he will share with us and how 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.350
 this welcome good morning 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.110
 really here I have come a bit to 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.060
 show the work line of a project 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.340
 who has a long time is 50 years old 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.250
 within the ministry of agriculture and 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.130
 the comparison that we can see is that 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.740
 the animal that is on my right has 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.200
 been selected 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.759
 for many generations to have a 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.520
 precocious animal this was one kilo 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.470
 at 56 days and these animals that is not 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.439
 without genetic improvement they reach the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.020
 160 days there is more meat with this animal and 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.390
 in shorter time then 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.580
 the other advantage is the performance 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.399
 housing the housing performance of the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.189
 animal improved 73% and performance 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.659
 of an animal's carcass without improvement 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.789
 56% to try that entity a bit 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.459
 our customers this has been 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.130
 genetically altered to represent 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:02.080
 improvements in both power and it's not 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.289
 that is the son this is not the son this one 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.069
 is the normal queen and this is the supercuy 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.259
 aesthetic and you need some kind of 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.239
 special feeding if this danish is 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.819
 in this so that they know that he is an adult is 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.849
 This is a pregnant female 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.939
 if the animals have been selected 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.109
 for a characteristic that is weight 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.819
 they have to receive a better 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:25.239
 feeding is true as herbivore 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.030
 commensal and he is given a ration that for 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.730
 the reproductive part is 17 percent 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.040
 of protein but for animals in 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.469
 growth so that they reach the kilo in 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.659
 the 42 days of release receive a 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.519
 serving with 18% protein now to 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.129
 companions we not only have a super 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.900
 We have fashionable guinea pigs because they 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.310
 I say this because it's leave those bodies 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.019
 please for that design caxito accompany me 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.659
 so you can show me on camera come 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.340
 this animal that is here this is not 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.680
 is that he has done a laceado is not 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.239
 who have a latest fashion hairstyle is a 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.799
 cuy is a guinea pig 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.269
 but also altered to be 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.120
 pet to see if Mr. Hyacinth us 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.699
 can show this animal on camera 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.139
 in many people they raise guinea pigs like 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:06.819
 pets and they did not know much 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:11.380
 our customers tell us about it 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.540
 please this gentleman or engineer 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.340
 It is an animal that you can 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.020
 see is more ornamental or is within the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.730
 genetic baggage that is scattered in 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.460
 our country we have this animal that is 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.110
 the long-haired one this is very quoted 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.890
 like as a pet 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.080
 but its characteristics in 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.930
 production of meat are not worth anything but 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.880
 beauty that he has within the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.950
 classifications is considered as a 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.980
 type 3 animal by long hair but 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.090
 it is also referred to as a genotype 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.180
 Peruvian 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.890
 well then you know these are this 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.870
 is an animal that is raised as 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.110
 good pet and also the meat that is 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.430
 very very rich in proteins and there are several 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.100
 There are several types of preparations 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.040
 we have what lasagna is can 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.850
 see we have the sofa 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.130
 we have taco here and we have rolled 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.300
 from Cuba we have crispy here so 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.430

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.380
 the chef specialized in cuyes paola 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.340
 palaces how is how rich is the 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.739
 meat and guinea pig meat is delicious is 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.699
 nutritious 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.979
 their meat if they are well-nurtured caretakers is 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.650
 spectacular and low fat is not for 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.180
 why we encourage you to do 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.400
 different the different types of 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.380
 preparation that we have here 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.080
 the feat of kwh and have 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.650
 we already have one in the vein of cv and where 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.660
 we have shown previously and we have 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.970
 traced and good we have done all the 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.980
 process similar to a lasagna and we have 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.230
 added arandino serrano cheese 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.330
 to give it a flavor and give it a 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.910
 characteristic flavor of the Andes' no 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.350
 there is a great variety of kwh and something there 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.770
 to highlight and I want the engineer 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.870
 accompany me is that due to the 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.960
 findings or let's say to studies with 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.100
 this super cool Japanese scientists 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.020
 we are so interested and broad 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.670
 information to Peru to be sent 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.580
 how to do your detriment 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.200
 and well really the request has come 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.690
 by the Ministry of Agriculture 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.220
 this project depends on the ministry of 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.220
 agriculture and here he 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.989
 Mr. Minister 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:28.779
 with Manuel and has been the one who has taken 

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:31.819
 contact and his interest is to continue 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:34.159
 doing the research for the country 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:36.259
 because it's benefiting the rural area and 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:39.979
 also for the requests that are 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:42.349
 taking the other other countries because 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.629
 not only is Japan now but also what 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.429
 has asked haiti through the fao and 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.579
 all this is channeled and I believe that 

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:51.529
 that the agriculture ministry should 

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:53.569
 be proud and I do know because I've 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:57.139
 conversed with him 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:59.479
 benitez that really is a job 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.439
 long is supported by agriculture is 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.689
 bearing fruit 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:05.360
 then those are the impressions is 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:07.399
 super cool Peruvian gives the time in the 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.080
 world even draws attention in the 

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:12.529
 good foreign with this variety of 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.229
 dishes I craved mates I give them 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:18.050
 go forward studies there is happy 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.929
 manuel those little animals dating 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.529
 pets and then the cymbals is the 

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:23.529
 life cycle 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:29.509
 precisely good I told you that my 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:31.999
 daughter does not have sofia pet left 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:34.449
 greet her sophie the kisses challenge the 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:34.449
 metals 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.629
 also in which it is then this one is 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.909
 perfect for pets I wanted to ask 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.909
 briefly if as is the domestication 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:54.199
 it would be interesting but impressive 

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:55.969
 clear that there to pass to the chaufa then good 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:58.099
 at least but you who complained about the 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:59.110
 of the little meat the cuy good here no longer 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:04.060
 you have to take out 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:09.520
 to jump good is wonderful with flour 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:11.020
 of corn to present and do for their 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.480
 crops who like the quiz 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:16.240
 great to those of us who have no other way out 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.990
 and what has left has made it clear in 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.990
 clear your posture
