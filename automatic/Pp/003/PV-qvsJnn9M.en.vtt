I thought maybe it was just like it

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.459 
I thought maybe it was just like it
wasn't<00:00:54.329> cost-effective<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:55.320> weren't

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
wasn't cost-effective like they weren't

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.689 
wasn't cost-effective like they weren't
getting<00:00:55.770> enough<00:00:55.860> out<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> or<00:00:56.579> something

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
getting enough out of it or something

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.889 
getting enough out of it or something
like<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.329> was<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.570> well<00:00:57.660> that's

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
like that and I was like well that's

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.479 
like that and I was like well that's
fair<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.590> reason<00:00:58.920> that's<00:00:59.070> totally

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
fair that's the reason that's totally

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.130 
fair that's the reason that's totally
fair<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.699> get<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> not<00:01:00.510> saying<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
fair I get it not saying that the
