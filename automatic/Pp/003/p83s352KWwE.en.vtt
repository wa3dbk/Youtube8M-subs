00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.300
Boy, can you tell me where we're going?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.200
Come on. Spit it out.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.300
I want to know what our exact destination is.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.900
As far as I know, Iceland.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.598
They say we're going to a treasure island.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We want to know where it is!

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.050
I'm sorry, but I don't know.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Even though we're just hired seamen

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.594
we want to see the island's
location on the map, too.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.800
Do you understand?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.300
The captain is to blame. I'm sure.

00:00:40.717 --> 00:00:43.017
He has told the boy not to
talk about it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He's a tyrant.

00:00:55.862 --> 00:00:58.762
Now tell us or you'll be back up there.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.300
What's this? Let me go!

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.500
My Flint just wants to tell you to stop.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.815
How about it, boatswain?
What were you talking about?

00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:14.242
About nothing.

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.729
It wasn't important.

00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:19.724
Good. Then act with more care from now on.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.646
The heat is demanding enough already.

00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:26.031
Alright. Let's go back to rest.

00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:31.007
Thank you.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.200
I told you not to run around the ship.

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:37.669
The atmosphere is always
strained on days like this.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.002
Yes, but...

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:41.331
Is the heat getting to you?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.000
Then you can come with me.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.574
Where then?

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.819
Don't bring a fish that's too big!

00:01:53.261 --> 00:01:55.461
Yes, a whale would be too big!

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.872
Maybe we won't get anything.
Then we'll have nothing to eat.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.127
You can leave like this?

00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:10.105
As a cook, I can gather any
foodstuff I want.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.800
As long as the ship isn't held back.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.500
Have you been fishing before?

00:02:17.553 --> 00:02:20.753
No, it's the first time,
but I'm already having fun.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.400
Oh, we can't see our ship anymore.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.380
Shouldn't we stay closer?
We need to be able to get back.

00:02:27.672 --> 00:02:29.872
It's all up to luck.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.781
What do you mean?

00:02:32.373 --> 00:02:34.073
That was just a joke.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.663
Don't worry. Flint will find the way back.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.693
He knows the course better
than my old compass.

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.219
Good. Then I don't have to worry.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.412
Do you think the fish are asleep?
They must be tired, too.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.462
Flint may know something.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.600
Attention! Mackerels!

00:03:04.992 --> 00:03:07.192
A whole swarm!

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:09.945
Hear that? Mackerels!

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.830
Keep watch at the bow.
Something might happen.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.400
Now hold on steady.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.834
There is a swarm of mackerels.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.263
Hold on! If you don't, all is lost!

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.494
I know!

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:17.386
When I was young and worked
at a banana store,

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.970
I arm-wrestled with a big,
coloured man.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.910
He had to be taller than two metres,
and was the Hercules of the docks.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.138
We had many on-lookers, and all
wanted to place bets.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.000
Who do you think won?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.611
You, Silver!

00:04:37.858 --> 00:04:41.758
The battle lasted to midnight
and wasn't over in the morning.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.880
We were so stuck that everyone
thought we'd break our fingers.

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:51.025
We should have ended it with a tie.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.263
And did you?

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:56.276
Are you insane? A man is never
happy with a tie.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.400
Now it's in the final moments.

00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:11.141
Look out!

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:15.914
Give me the other harpoon!

00:05:16.155 --> 00:05:17.155
Here!

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.750
Cool! We got it!

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:55.233
We got it!

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:24.799
We got something! Come to deck!

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.746
That's odd. There's nobody on deck.

00:06:37.983 --> 00:06:40.583
Strange. Even the look-out isn't there.
