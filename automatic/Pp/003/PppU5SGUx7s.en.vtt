00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:04.290
 scheduled on the agenda we learn to make a real breath of fresh air 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.390
 so too much time behind my volume is for now the Charentais 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.969
 percent and warm since the blues 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.119
 so note too she calls super v 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.819
 so it's good for the panthers 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:16.560
 so as his name 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.660
 for them what is particularly expensive let's 32 euros 72 kilos which they 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.259
 are really good 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.839
 I am not disappointed because he is running away 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.480
 erding which also evokes the idea no armed 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.429
 and the fact that the strongest 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.610
 but that's like for example to buy it 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.920
 gold for the controversial paternal 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.540
 all are inside 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.080
 in the gard the copper 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.710
 in addition to occupying the premises 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.500
 e 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 for developers have manhandled by year 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.280
 at the same time cut in four 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.500
 by cutting off four ears two parts are going to work 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 a party with a ring 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.520
 tomorrow a party 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.610
 even with a ring 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.370
 he's gone you're smiling 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.110
 or then bank carpet 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.400
 but in color 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.490
 but we know what to do too 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.790
 we are in the process of supporting 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.790
 was it according to these encounters 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.080
 in low prices 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 to fix it 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.770
 one and a half meters 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.270
 gold you can put a stone 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.540
 only three on each side 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.440
 so if america live and submit it to one in sweden 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.670
 he is very good 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.570
 poet of Scotch 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.880
 bp will be the red thread 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.640
 and then between friends you then 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.510
 you're not talking about making it more what drillers 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.140
 thomas figure reuters 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.480
 in fact the balance sheet 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.090
 with his father paul chablo here 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.270
 we can then say something is that they have all found two 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.020
 types of paternal diodes 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.560
 he had peaked towards 1 with the light heavyweights 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.560
 percent people prefer light ones
