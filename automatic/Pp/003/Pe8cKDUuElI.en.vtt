00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.350
 hello friends so today I 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.929
 will just show you 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.639
 how to tie small balloons 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.870
 like this I do not know when you 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.770
 call that I call it balloons 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.529
 fries or balloons on 13 small 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.210
 balloons that inflate 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.980
 often when we laugh we do not arrive 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.710
 to tie them with the fingers because 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.170
 they are really very long and that's the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.470
 brothel with that we can attach them with 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.820
 a rigid straw or a small piece of 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 dough andrÃ© gide me I do it with a 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.620
 straw sponge bob like the bar and the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.350
 young men the projects already this is 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.670
 for kids this video good I'm going 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.670
 start inflating the balloon 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.410
 so that's when you see there we can 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:08.220
 pass the right but if we want 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:10.560
 overall here we have trouble passing 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.390
 the right to do a finger trick and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.820
 catch the balloon so this account and we 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.840
 take the straw we come squarely to 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:24.150
 the taste of the straw we make a tour of the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.560
 balloon and we pass a balloon bottom 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:32.610
 and we go back to the straw hole 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.100
 I do not know if you see we do a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:41.500
 turn we go below and we come back 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.660
 in the hole of the ball Homsys 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:51.830
 actually in the straw hole that 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:53.690
 I was good here and here we need 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.730
 that we are really straw stuff have 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:03.230
 drag what we do we do 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.770
 to slide without balloon here or so 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.420
 simply 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:15.440
 Normally we remove the straw 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:19.280
 how can you applaud 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.950
 how does he see it is well done but 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.020
 he often goes to work when he arrives 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.100
 we manage to put it right in the middle 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.140
 we do once it's a little 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.360
 better one can always loosen one's 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.760
 flying but then again he got more 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.760
 towards that side it will be very 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.550
 difficult of the decade of soaring does not 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:43.130
 can try to shoot light he stands 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.690
 will not defend good but as you see 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.540
 it's very simple with a little straw 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.760
 rigid because there is the hole one does a 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.770
 turn we go under the balloon we come back 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.739
 in the hole and we take good that we 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.870
 hold on top we pull the straw 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.489
 automatically it is done but 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.010
 I hope we can help you 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.170
 to make birthdays or holidays 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.320
 to inform you before telling him to 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.320
 all
