and an even back and forth motion to

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.590 
and an even back and forth motion to
create<00:01:07.470> some<00:01:08.130> interesting<00:01:09.090> textural

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
create some interesting textural

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.340 
create some interesting textural
background<00:01:11.420> one<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.600> most<00:01:12.780> common

background one of the most common

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.649 
background one of the most common
mistakes<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.549> bounce<00:01:14.850> up<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.210> down<00:01:15.420> with

light area the even pressure provides a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.249
