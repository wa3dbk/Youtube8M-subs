00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.560
 hello very good I'm colinvers here 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.290
 we are in a new video of a hack 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.290
 for me craft of 1.8 point x that I 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.420
 I mean ax, I mean, they're going to 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.010
 that will be able to work on servers 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.839
 of the 1.8 point 1 point 2.3.4 worth and 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.710
 well I'll leave it under the description 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:24.230
 I'll leave it for fear or for half asks and 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.749
 Well, once downloaded, it will come out 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.489
 this file you put here in the 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.109
 same desktop and double- click on it 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.909
 Once inside here you find this 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.879
 folder is worth opening if you find 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:36.710
 the hard point and the j point are that they are 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.920
 because the two types of file are worth 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.940
 minecraft data good as a 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.390
 time here we give windows + ere and here 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.640
 we put app percent 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.190
 today 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.410
 once being here inside we are going to 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:00.120
 point and here we go to 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.220
 the version and here in version 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.690
 directly we put the hardware of 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.910
 I mean the folder on the bus 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.240
 and once being here, it will already be 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.930
 installed we closed this and we're going 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.930
 to the market 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.210
 for once opened 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.490
 I had it here prepared we give it to 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.530
 buses version equals the launcher that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.200
 you have premium vouchers for not 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.570
 premium does not matter is the launcher is 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.170
 absolutely the same you just have to have 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.780
 this of choosing to choose version is worth and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.369
 it will be real that course because we give it there 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.460
 It will be in any version by 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.030
 example 1.7 point 2 I like it and we give it 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.970
 to the ceip profile and then once here 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.020
 we give the play and then it is either 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.119
 the bar will be filled will load things and 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.450
 until they will come in now see you in 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.450
 the manga 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.110
 ok we are already in the game and as you can see 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.930
 the interface has changed what is in progress 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.479
 of title and good since it is 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.690
 installed I will tell you with what key you 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.080
 reactive and all that is worth I put myself in the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.080
 world 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.500
 to see is activated with the alt it is valid 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.960
 right next to the right of the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.660
 space when the spacebar to the 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.720
 right then you give it there and as you will see 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.970
 So this menu does not come with all the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.290
 little things and then the typical 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.329
 movement 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.290
 in motion, you get all this 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:41.500
 blog motion listing that is auto 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:46.349
 build and here it puts you then 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.349
 options for example a pillar 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.170
 where you put a block is not going to 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.630
 build a shell 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.850
 very useful to make you because a house 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.010
 anything is worth 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:04.460
 for example you can also do more 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.460
 things a wall to make a wall 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.560
 Pressed bugs are not going to stop 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.800
 to be here a house a house but something 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.320
 similar 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.140
 and well here is the car smells like 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.319
 combat that is quite 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.209
 valued by people plant and notebook 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.069
 look back auto car tree 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.160
 armor teams when they break you and 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.410
 you have another one in the author inventory and 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.630
 respawn photos responds without giving 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.940
 corresponding the robot can be 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.100
 Automatically the sword or wayne bot 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.670
 what do you give or is the arrow going 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.270
 directly to the uncle 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.790
 line world or the invisible invisibility 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.940
 which is not recommended because it is not 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.090
 work that the aura that makes the 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.090
 inegi 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.540
 where is football 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.450
 the pub then is quite interesting already 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.020
 I showed it in another hack in the resident 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:13.030
 from 1.7 point 4 if I'm not wrong 1.5 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:16.180
 point 10 good as you will see here 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.780
 about these are so plants to give 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.780
 sell and give away 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.830
 and well then this is football 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.150
 there was also the wine wood that good 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:35.020
 as you see as you see then you already mark it you see 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.720
 mark nearest 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.300
 and when you do not have the top it's late 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:46.569
 what do you give and dance 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:50.210
 you see it there and the cow and well then well 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:52.909
 render anti bleu en cheste is to see 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.150
 the cocktails if you fear to see the items 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:58.940
 through the walls is to see 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.159
 Players animals through 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.730
 wall no forgiveness player is for through 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:04.960
 of the wall 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.360
 for players through the wall 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.660
 sorry as it is for animals 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.770
 monsters and all and well then up 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.140
