00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.400
 Do you remember when I said that? 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.849

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.420

 tell the story of this card at night 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.660
 but I could not tell the story of the card 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.880
 because pt and loved made a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.000
 very big and my facebook was 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.840
 blocked and censored the history of this 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.360
 card is the following to my grandmother. 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.750
 a vegetative state a coma during 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.260
 many years and my childhood was in 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.670
 stores of surgical materials and 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.800
 hospitals and in the final moments when 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.340
 My grandmother was about to die. 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.710
 she was admitted to hospital evaldo foz 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.370
 she was in the uti and there were several 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.969
 people in uti I could not go up because 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.470
 there is a limit of people there does not have 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.020
 that would probably be the last time 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.560
 that I would have my grandmother free 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.049

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.130

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.400
 For me, right? 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.610

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.509

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.680

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.720
 It was right 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.710
 even when it was not politically 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.360

 little card that changed my 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.510
 personality 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.720

 Leftist coming up to the boy is 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.540
 Only you hit harder. 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.770

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.620
