00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
10 rebounds in that competition and I

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.979 
10 rebounds in that competition and I
will<00:00:47.309> fight<00:00:47.520> against<00:00:47.820> some<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.629> outstanding

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
will fight against some so outstanding

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.590 
will fight against some so outstanding
player<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.739> think<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.980> made<00:00:50.250> him<00:00:50.600> feel

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
player so I think that made him feel

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.360 
player so I think that made him feel
good<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.199> gave<00:00:52.440> him<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.800> cup<00:00:52.980> certain

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
good and gave him a cup certain

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.090 
good and gave him a cup certain
confidence<00:00:53.910> level<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.379> again<00:00:55.890> he's

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
confidence level also and again he's

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.040 
confidence level also and again he's
only<00:00:56.280> 22<00:00:56.850> years<00:00:56.969> old<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.660> very<00:00:57.899> good

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
only 22 years old so I was a very good

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.770 
only 22 years old so I was a very good
experience<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.710> him<00:00:59.120> to<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.239> able<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.539> score

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
next year got off the snow started 30

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.530 
next year got off the snow started 30
and<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:52.470> he<00:01:52.770> was<00:01:52.860> involved<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.400> a<00:01:53.490> trade<00:01:53.820> went

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and then he was involved in a trade went

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.330 
and then he was involved in a trade went
to<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> Lakers<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.440> he<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:55.950> couldn't<00:01:56.130> get

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
to the Lakers and he just couldn't get

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.520 
to the Lakers and he just couldn't get
the<00:01:56.400> minutes<00:01:56.850> he<00:01:57.000> wanted<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.510> but<00:01:58.200> he's<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the minutes he wanted to but he's a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.470 
the minutes he wanted to but he's a
proven<00:01:58.890> scorer<00:01:59.400> he's<00:02:00.030> an<00:02:00.210> outstanding

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
proven scorer he's an outstanding

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.160 
proven scorer he's an outstanding
shooter<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.310> an<00:02:02.460> opportunity<00:02:03.210> him<00:02:03.570> here

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
shooter and is an opportunity him here

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.950 
shooter and is an opportunity him here
for<00:02:04.620> him<00:02:04.800> if<00:02:05.370> he<00:02:05.640> earns<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:06.120> to<00:02:06.570> get<00:02:06.750> some

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
for him if he earns it to get some

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.510 
for him if he earns it to get some
significant<00:02:07.620> minutes<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.130> think<00:02:08.369> that's

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
significant minutes and I think that's

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.550 
significant minutes and I think that's
what<00:02:08.760> he<00:02:08.880> was<00:02:09.030> looking<00:02:09.210> for<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.320> again

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
what he was looking for but it's again

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.100 
what he was looking for but it's again
about<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.830> competition<00:02:11.640> players<00:02:12.630> have<00:02:12.960> an

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
about the competition players have an

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.100 
about the competition players have an
opportunity<00:02:13.550> there<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.610> there<00:02:15.570> are<00:02:15.720> minutes

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
opportunity there is there are minutes

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.020 
opportunity there is there are minutes
they're<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.560> small<00:02:16.860> forward<00:02:17.310> position<00:02:17.340> if

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
they're that small forward position if

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.120 
they're that small forward position if
he<00:02:18.240> earns<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.500> think<00:02:19.560> that's<00:02:19.920> one<00:02:20.100> of

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
he earns it and I think that's one of

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.250 
he earns it and I think that's one of
the<00:02:20.250> reasons<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.820> he<00:02:21.120> like<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.540> situation

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
the reasons that he like this situation

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.470 
the reasons that he like this situation
is<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.500> he<00:02:23.100> want<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.820> get<00:02:24.000> back<00:02:24.180> out<00:02:24.420> there

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
is that he want to get back out there

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.000 
is that he want to get back out there
and<00:02:24.750> want<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.110> get<00:02:25.230> on<00:02:25.350> Kourtney<00:02:25.709> wanted<00:02:25.920> to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and want to get on Kourtney wanted to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.010 
and want to get on Kourtney wanted to
get<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.160> situation<00:02:26.910> where<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.300> earn<00:02:27.480> some

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
get a situation where you can earn some

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.050 
get a situation where you can earn some
minutes<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.560> mean<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.130> followed<00:02:29.520> this<00:02:29.640> career

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
obviously very closely and what he can

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.310 
obviously very closely and what he can
do<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:34.170> very<00:02:34.560> good<00:02:34.680> shooter<00:02:35.250> good<00:02:36.209> score<00:02:36.570> and

time you have

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
little bit of time the obvious is

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.920 
little bit of time the obvious is
exploring<00:02:54.470> other<00:02:54.890> options<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:56.600> he<00:02:56.720> might
