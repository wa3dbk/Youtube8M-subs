sure<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.510> they're<00:01:12.630> using<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.080> trebuchet

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.649 
sure that they're using that trebuchet
it<00:01:14.010> looks<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.460> both<00:01:14.670> teams<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:15.180> trying<00:01:15.450> to

it looks like both teams are trying to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.060 
it looks like both teams are trying to
stop<00:01:16.020> each<00:01:16.229> other<00:01:16.439> from<00:01:16.650> using<00:01:16.950> that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
stop each other from using that

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.530 
stop each other from using that
trebuchet<00:01:18.950> yeah<00:01:19.950> exactly<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> think<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
trebuchet yeah exactly but I think the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.870 
trebuchet yeah exactly but I think the
big<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.380> big<00:01:22.409> story<00:01:22.979> here<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.520> fact<00:01:23.759> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
big the big story here is the fact that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.660 
big the big story here is the fact that
ArenaNet<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:24.750> able<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> take<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:26.159> center

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
ArenaNet was able to take that center

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.910 
ArenaNet was able to take that center
point<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.390> quickly<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.619> was<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
point so quickly and that was as a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.190 
point so quickly and that was as a
result<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.729> using<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.299> trebuchet<00:01:30.900> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
result of using that trebuchet and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.260 
result of using that trebuchet and
