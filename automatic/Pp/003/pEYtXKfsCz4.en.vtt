00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.280
 useful it is not to lari it totally 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.110

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.089

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:05.700
 very fast do take oatmeal 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:09.790
 so much this gave prescription flour sugar 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.520
 all this rice we take two eggs we need 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.450
 separate the yolk from the protein we need 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.650
 only protein 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.790
 this yolk we remove the whites pour into 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.520
 our porridge and pinch of salt is just 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.470
 a little salt and now it's all 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.500
 need to mix to make it 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.960

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.580
 his own our cookie 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.670
 only food was prepared for him 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.010
 so go here you can add something else 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.280
 anything and 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.650
 raisins and dried apricots and chocolate that you want 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.390
 but what do you mean it will all be 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.280
 increase its caloricity so if 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.140

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.600
