 inner world begins to crumble and 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.590
 the inhabitants of the head have to urgently save 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.140
 Riley came up with this story pit doc 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.650
 monster corporation director and screenwriter 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.689
 valley 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.040
 that she pushed him to the idea 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.720
 puzzles he told us in an interview 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.820
 I think if I had no children I 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.369
 would never have shot this movie 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.189
 the idea of â€‹â€‹the puzzle was born from observation 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.799
 out of my soul and was 11 when she started 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.140
 to transform from a cheerful kid to such 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.570
 I became an indifferent teenager 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.250
 I wonder what's going on in her head I 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.890
 began to study books about human 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.979
 Emotions and something became clear to me 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.930
 rylee much like my daughter she 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.840
 same naughty loves to dress up and 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.479
 admire herself a mirror she also plays 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.290
 which is generally very cool and I tried 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.050
 make riley as realistic as possible 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.300
 but as the first day of school 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.920
 after all 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.190
 will come down never wondered looking at 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.980
 man what's in his head too 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:03.590
 noticed when making a film doctor 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.310
 studied the books of psychologists about human 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.560
 emotions 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.720
 probably someone seems that the film with 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.180
 such a foundation is too complicated for children 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.150
 but actually everything is very simple and 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.610
 understandable puzzle plot consists of 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.770
 two closely related lines 1 she 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.440
 the main thing tells about the events in the world 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.959
 emotions that govern the life of a girl 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.360
 second line shows how events 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.060
 inside the head affect the behavior of riley 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.830
 in the real world, by chance, joy and 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.260
 sorrow is far from the center 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.840
 control girl and must return 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.910
 going through all the childish subconscious 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.220
 and in the meantime because joy 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.910
 Riley disappeared constantly quarreling with 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.830
 parents 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.050
 she quits playing hockey wants 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.690
 run away from the house remaining feelings 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.239
 trying to help and but can not because 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.300
 girls need positive emotions 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.350
 we have made your joy the only one 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.420
 positive emotions 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.640
 to force her and really 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.010
 plowing it alone pushes riley 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.470
 forward the rest is essentially pull it 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.660
 back it is joy that makes riley 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.820
 try new things getting to know 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.910
 new people and risk a fear 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.890
 constantly chevy new food not sure what 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.840
 it's worth trying so joy 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.840
 getting more interesting and paradise 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.989
 can i quietly swear my way 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.989
 the puzzle is reminiscent of old 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.239
 episode head of germane in him too emotions 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.519
 ruled the main character but pit docter 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.440
 went much further and showed 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.720
 inner world of a girl like a huge 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.400
 fantasy universe in it is 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.099
 balloon memories 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.500
 stained the color of a particular emotion and 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.090
 islands are individuals that determine what 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.280
 for a man the main thing 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.590
 dreams girls are filmed on the magic 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.049
 film studios wandering memory corridors 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.879
 forgotten imaginary friend and unnecessary 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.019
 memories fall into the black abyss 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.349
 oblivion 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.480
 it all looks very bright and unusual in 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.799
 Riley's head has islands defining 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.480
 identity and what islands are in your head 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.239
 of course i have a cartoon island 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.209
 he is very big think family island yet 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.870
 these two islands are sometimes more at war 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.789
 leadership 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.760
 I think I should still have 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.979
 island of sweet cookies and chocolates in chapters 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.560
 adults have so much to do 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:30.599
 Islands should be a lot of mountaineering 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.400
 bikes and so on you didn't get sick 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:35.349
 sir and rolls his eyes okay 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.669
 fist force on the table 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:42.070
 I would like not only not well 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.349
 turned out and characters are people in the usual 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.539
 the world are drawn realistic and the inhabitants 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.940
 head resembles funny toon 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.070
 the look of each emotion is based on 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.979
 some thing for joy then 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.370
 star for sadness and tear for anger 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:00.280
 burning brick for cabbage aversion 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.190
 broccoli and fear is like a naked 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.830
 nerve all heroes get their minute 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.320
 fame best jokes fell to anger 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.270
 and fear but in the center of the plot is still 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.970
 relationship of two opposites 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.580
 joy and sorrow that will 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.710
 learn and understand each other through these 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.770
 heroines creators are trying to convey to 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.199
 us a simple truth man can not live 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.570
 constant joy the brightest 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:29.160
 happy moments of our life would be 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.140
 impossible if not to experience sorrow 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.810
 adult heroes feeling look 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.750
 the same and similar to the owner why 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.170
 urala every emotion looks different 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.570
 and I, we wanted Riley's inner world 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.280
 was rich and diverse there is and 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.740
 adult men and women 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.830
 we made the heroes different so that they 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.800
 Were funnier more interesting but in head 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.870
 mom and dad we are transported for a while 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.920
 it is important that the viewer understands instantly 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.230
 where are we 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.990
 so all the emotions in the head of the father wears 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.770
 mustache and all mom's feeling her glasses 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.250
 hairstyle 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:08.090
 it's just for the sake of clarity of humor 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.090
 paternal nerves of the name 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:17.330
 fire so march into the room the enemy is running 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:20.750

 Ramadan two Diallo slag catastrophe 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.199
 and as far as Riley's parents look like you 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:29.810
 and your wife kind of seems to me 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.669
 I remember the scene behind the ear conversation all 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.009
 seems to be talking about trifles but you 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:36.919
 heads we see what happens at the very 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:37.669
 business happens to me more often than 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.030

 that the wife speaks to me I answer well myself 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.860
 thinking about something else
