00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.090 

let's<00:00:00.269> take<00:00:00.450> a<00:00:00.480> look<00:00:00.750> at<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.230> types<00:00:01.500> of<00:00:01.800> flash

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
let's take a look at the types of flash

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.210 
let's take a look at the types of flash
metering<00:00:02.939> how<00:00:03.510> they<00:00:03.659> work<00:00:03.870> and<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.110> they<00:00:05.069> are

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
metering how they work and how they are

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.200 
metering how they work and how they are
different<00:00:05.670> than<00:00:06.029> non<00:00:06.330> metered<00:00:06.779> flash<00:00:08.210> let's

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
different than non metered flash let's

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.910 
different than non metered flash let's
pretend<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.110> picture<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.590> water

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
pretend that this picture of water

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.490 
pretend that this picture of water
represents<00:00:11.910> your<00:00:12.030> speed<00:00:12.389> light<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.200> water

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
represents your speed light in the water

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.240
