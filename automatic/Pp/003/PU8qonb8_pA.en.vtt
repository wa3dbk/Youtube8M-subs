00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.380
 originated in ancient times when 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.410
 people began to tame animals and birds 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.660
 the first vets were shepherds not 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.899
 by chance the very name of the province 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.450
 comes from the Latin word 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.940
 veterinary medicine which means 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.100
