00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.280
 today I will propose another application basic recipe the pastry a large 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.300
 a great classic that is pasta 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.630
 for bigne or however also called in French patachou 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.509
 then for the puff pastry 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:25.239
 1080 grams of whole eggs 700 35 grams of water 665 grams of butter 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.239
 105 grams of whole fresh milk 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.820
 700 grams of 0 0 flour is a pinch of salt we put in a saucepan 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.990
 the water 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.960
 let's start warm up 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.050
 strong flame very large saucepan as you can see because leffe andreo 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.850
 pages geralt ingredients 2 i love to shoot like energy here never need nice 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.470
 space to mix 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.010
 the cold imgur wall andrea 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.940
 of fridge 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.620
 it is cut into small pieces so that these pieces can melt 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.970
 in hot water 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.370
 if I put the block of butter on the ground in the water so I could also 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.360
 to put it all over it surely melts in butter over time because 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.710
 the water gets hot but something may happen that maybe during 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.540
 the boiling of the water then the livaja boiling water but not 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.869
 we still have April 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.650
 and melted butter and this is a 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.680
 in small quotation marks a little problem in the sense that we should be able to arrive 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.590
 adam and the boiling query and the completely melted butter inside 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.670
 if this does not happen then it should happen that maybe water 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.090
 it boils before the butter has melted 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.640
 let's move the saucepan away from the flame 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.630
 and mix with the spoon until you get to completely melt 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.530
 bureau a pinch of being inside while I prepare myself by sifting through the la 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.470
 gruel 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.670
 let's break the eggs 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.670
 the eggs 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.620
 they must be it is not important that they are ambient temperature of the fridge 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.820
 the important thing is that they are m20 eggs tempested because otherwise 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.530
 we risk having the wrong dough here is that liquid book bubbles 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.169
 I prepare to make me prepare with the ready hand with the spoon 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:15.289
 the boiling liquid aspect that flies very well important 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.679
 that is not to the flour if the liquid does not want very well 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:20.279
 then 2 seconds 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.279
 We are beginning to boil 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.539
 perfect 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:29.439
 now all at once the flour is all to one body is 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.709
 hermes co 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.369
 kone the spoon 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.709
 in this way 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.889
 and we see that the dough now will tend to give itself up 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:42.009
 that's why you see the pot is important that it is capacious because 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.340
 now I have to mix 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.979
 energy bill 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:49.369
 in each they are not formed because they get fat inside therefore they do not 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.309
 will form lumps of flour 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:55.290
 but you make her love has been in one stroke not inverting otherwise you will 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:59.269
 that case of you could form some gurus here at this point towards 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.129
 the compound inside 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.719
 let's pass the machine 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.199
 It's the first thing we think 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.739
 the milk 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.739
 pen liam a little butter this way 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.269
 we take some kitchen paper again and go to remove the excess butter 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.000
 of having just baked the pan 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.119
 we defend the dough we put saltafoss chat 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:27.849
 with a smooth nozzle 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.169
 as always the nozzle 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.169
 I'll show you a knife you can cut after Brenham 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.700
 we tend to cut it after putting the nozzles so that I can cut the 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:40.869
 right point 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:42.149
 that I want 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:43.649
 at this point 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:47.659
 let's shape the dough we always keep little dough for the hand 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.689
 and we do this job 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.089
 side by side holding 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:58.739
 this pantyhose we have very well so i will be going very adagio model capiate 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.929
 let's keep the side nozzle club 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.639
 and let podiam pick up a little blast going upwards to detach it 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.289
 mass 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:08.439
 lateral 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.930
 a little tap we don't work from the top in this way ok because we can't 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.809
 let the shapes adjust the nozzle to rest on the baking sheet 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:16.719
 who gives us 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.650
 an ease of control 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.620
 we can better control sac a posh we can also make shapes 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.509
 long this is the classic bigne 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.330
 we can also do the claires that made in this way long then classic 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.330
 verdini alla francese is called cosino 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.550
 let's put the sugar 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.580
 these the sugar in the grains on the edge of the pan we make jump with the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.659
 hand this way 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.599
 end comes from the bottom of the pan 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.069
 reached the bottom of the pan press the bowl cross into it 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.210
 sugar in the toilet 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.909
 in this way 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.099
 let's fall into the toilet and we all end up with the cream puffs 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.290
 interrelated this and system to do first because of course they are not 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.250
 not just to make the fans better first because if of course I have to 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.729
 put product here I would not have attacked in this way 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.900
 220 degrees in the oven so we throw it in the oven 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.589
 we cook them 220 degrees in the oven for about 10 minutes 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:17.650
 via manin pm someone with the cream for ya nour with the nozzle itself 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.199
 my name is the nozzle to drill in this way 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.009
 we finish filling 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.009
 ny let's take a few examples of fineco 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.270
 so I stop for a second and start whipping cream 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.150
 that I wanted to give an example also of a slaughter of cream so it will take 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.150
 a moment because the cream mountains 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.279
 edisu caro 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.279
 to the always cold shiena so the cream fits better 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.719
 and let's jump 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.039
 continue to get up from mine 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.249
 we list then lower 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:00.969
 with dark sugar 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.419
 dodo proposes that you buy already done 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.620
 we simply have to heat it microwaves 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.939
 I love you covers women that melt 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:13.619
 the mini filled with so much fairy tale and are gouging douglas so I go to 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:17.029
 take away all the defects that we have give flat 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:22.520
 meanwhile I also prepare the others by cutting them 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.369
 these are the ones with the grain 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:26.729
 let's see how to cut 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.589
 the part above 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.990
 in this way 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.990
 festival to be filled with cream 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.270
 from the open side and this was whipped cream 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.949
 the vinjay, instead, is a classic with cream ahahah vat 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.949
 heat the microwave melting sugar 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:49.369
 in this way 

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:50.759
 and then the part 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:52.009
 over it 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:53.699
 sivag the stay like this 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.270
 we live 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.270
 icastico believe the press 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:08.759
 so here is the little hole we created 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:10.599
 women 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:13.599
 ville 

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:17.829
 check mail fill the puffs is completely closed to the sugar 

00:07:17.829 --> 00:07:19.419
 melting 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.630
 pallet festival is called chantilly bay classico chantilly 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.839
 the one found in the pastry shops 

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:28.839
 the one with the whipped cream over the cream I always put the cream on 

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:32.249
 part below because it makes it heavier below and therefore I will avoid 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:35.430
 overturn 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.139
 echo the classic this surely I'm connecting because in the 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:41.089
 pastry shops are often seen 

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:44.719
 the hair we cut anywhere upside down 

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:48.309
 if you wish, you can also sprinkle with icing sugar from citera 

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:50.929
 island to say that all these wines made this way 

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:56.100
 you can safely put them in the freezer and prepare them in advance 

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.090
 in 5 minutes taken out of the freezer will then be ready 5 minutes 

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.230
 they are more than enough
