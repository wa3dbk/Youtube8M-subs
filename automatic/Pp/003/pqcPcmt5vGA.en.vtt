 stop prohibited or was 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.219
 I parked in the parking wheel 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.110
 pleasure for the right to be on this 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:48.750
 the special place is understandably not free 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:52.309
 the first day of every hour costs 20 2-3 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.670

 full of those who are not even interested 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.170
 where did their iron friend go 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.970
 most machines and not having marketable 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.439
 kind of but there are decent car 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.290
 I wonder what card 10 machine 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.950
 located on this car park taken from 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.170
 leasing the owner owes the bank a bank not 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.030
 in a hurry to buy the car does not want 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.729
 pay a fine here for example this

 volkswagen sharan when got here was 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.400
 bright blue but standing here 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.740
 a few months was just gray 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.659
 machine guided by the rules 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.270
 cabinet cars owners 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.520
 which they are not bought may be 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.020
 parked three months after which 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.350
 must be recycled 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.090
 but in fact many are worth a year and 2 and 3 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.630
 here one car is worth 2000 8 years given 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.719
 the moment you are on this car 12 shokhin show 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.869
 the fruit does not rise hand send under 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.090
 press expensive car 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.670
 according to the rules of the enterprise has no right 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.620
 sell a car or put it on 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.970
 auction 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.090
 cars linger and for quite 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.549
 a banal reason for the year of rigas from xx we 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.409
 can pass for recycling to a private company 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.099
 with which the contract is concluded 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:30.769
 but no more than 70 cars they are accepted 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.400
 under the press as scrap metal on average 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.290
 out and lats 70 for the car we saw 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.349
 here is a Cossack and a Lada 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.160
 there are minivans and once even spent the night 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:47.180
 limousine was also thrown interfered 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.739
 refuel refueling at 100 euro to 100 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.690
 We pour in our parking lot on it 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.359
 the athlete on ours was in the penalty 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.420
 Parking curiosity and a certain car owner 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.579
 paid for an old opel that amount 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.430
 which far exceeds the cost 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.129
 I thought that the car itself was a friend 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.890
 although metal can not be thrown 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.430
 or on a gentle Spartak Lukashevich first
