00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
How are such fine patterns painted?
Seems like it needs to be painted with a single hair..

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.360
It takes a long time. It's a very
detail oriented work

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.000
What is your name?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.800
Me? Aleksander

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.739
Aleksander Albertovich Kornilov,
And I am Denis Aleksandrovich

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:20.199
Anna Aleksandrovna

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.989
- And what is your name?
- I am Tatiana Ivanovna Kornilova
- Nice to meet you

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.960
Your family has been artisans for how  
many generations?

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.419
This is already third generation

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.659
Denis already has a little one

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.310
- He has just turned 7 months.
- And he'll also be an artist?

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.350
Or it's not clear yet?

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.560
His wife is also an artist.
They went to school together

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.910
- Does every family in Palekh is artists? 
- More than half of people in Palekh are artists. 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.550
Many are now out of town making wall paintings in churches, all over the country...   

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.870
Magadan, Vladivostok, Samara is been painted, Naberezhnye Chelny, Nizhny Novgorod... 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.990
Here I started working on this

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.190
You make here these type of scratches... a sketch...

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:23.770
Then you paint over the scatch with a brush and white paint... brushes are very fine

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.610
I see

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.320
We bind these brushes by ourselves

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.720
- Oh really?
- Yes

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.000
After that you work over the whole piece, cover it with lacquer and paint with gold. Laborous work.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.100
Painting jewelry boxes differs from paiting icons. With the box the gold is put on the lacquer layer.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.180
With the icon gold is put directly on paint

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.680
What kind of paint do you use?

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.730
Paint? Our paint... tempera. On egg emulsion.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:07.730
Powder paint - we blem it with egg emulsion. Our traditional technique.  

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.380
- Which means that the paint is natural?
- Yes. The pigment is natural.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.659
Of course there is synthetic pigment, but it becomes obvious - it comes out very soon... especially the red colour, sienna 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:34.570
After the painting is done, all the details are worked through, the item is covered by lacquer and drained in a furnace. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.700
After our item is drained, we polish it with pumice so that lacquer doesn't shine. We wipe it off.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:50.000
Then we paint it with gold. After it's finished, we polish with wolf's tooth or agate. 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.500
That way the gold gets shine and looks good. 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.800
The whole item should be polished like this.  

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.100
- It this a real wolf's tooth?
- Yes.
- Such a big tush!

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.100
There were hunting... Put it on the table... 
We had somewhere the whole jaw. 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.100
Yes, it out punched out of wolf on purpose

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.100
Jewelry boxes, are they gone into past?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.100
I don't paint jewelry boxes as for now. I only paint icons and murals in churches. 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.100
Why gone? On the contrary, it is coming back now.  

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.800
Still the demand for jewelry boxes is not too big. Mural paintings and icons are in demand now. Icons are behind murals, though.
