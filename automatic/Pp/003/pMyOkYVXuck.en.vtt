00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
factoring so we suggest doing this a few

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
now to take the iPad out of the case you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.469 
now to take the iPad out of the case you
start<00:01:21.509> with<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:22.799> corner<00:01:23.330> then<00:01:24.330> the

start with the right corner then the
left<00:01:24.689> corner<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:26.159> off<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.580> all<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.299> our

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
left corner and off you go all of our

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.240 
left corner and off you go all of our
cases<00:01:27.869> come<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.560> really<00:01:28.890> cool

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
cases come with this really cool

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.980 
cases come with this really cool
magnetic<00:01:29.820> latch<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.960> keeps<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> cover<00:01:34.590> closed

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
magnetic latch it keeps the cover closed

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.590 
magnetic latch it keeps the cover closed
pretty<00:01:36.990> much<00:01:37.140> no<00:01:37.259> matter<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:38.600> it's

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
pretty much no matter what you do it's

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.190 
pretty much no matter what you do it's
also<00:01:39.840> used<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.820> get<00:01:41.820> some<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.750> positions

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
also used to get some of the positions

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.560 
also used to get some of the positions
that<00:01:43.320> our<00:01:43.560> case<00:01:43.799> offers<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.850> mates<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
that our case offers it mates with the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.770 
that our case offers it mates with the
magnets<00:01:45.990> back<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:50.450> get<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> low

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
magnets back here and now get a low

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.249 
magnets back here and now get a low
position<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:54.229> little<00:01:55.229> higher

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
position a little higher

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.600 
position a little higher
flip<00:01:57.799> it<00:01:57.920> around<00:01:59.740> even<00:02:00.740> higher<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:03.610> higher

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
flip it around even higher and higher

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.219 
flip it around even higher and higher
still<00:02:06.340> all<00:02:07.340> of<00:02:07.399> our<00:02:07.729> cases<00:02:07.969> have<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.420> variation

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
still all of our cases have a variation

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.630 
still all of our cases have a variation
of<00:02:09.410> this<00:02:10.009> latching<00:02:10.580> system<00:02:10.789> here's<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.569> mini

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.270 

and<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.319> can<00:02:18.470> see<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.739> works<00:02:18.950> pretty<00:02:19.160> much

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
and as you can see it works pretty much

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.460 
and as you can see it works pretty much
the<00:02:19.580> same<00:02:19.760> we<00:02:20.390> also<00:02:20.540> have<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.750> number<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:21.019> micro

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
the same we also have a number of micro

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.979 
the same we also have a number of micro
adjustable<00:02:21.980> viewing<00:02:22.580> positions<00:02:24.190> for<00:02:25.190> example

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
adjustable viewing positions for example

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.460 
adjustable viewing positions for example
this<00:02:26.989> goes<00:02:27.799> from<00:02:28.370> low<00:02:29.239> viewing<00:02:29.569> position<00:02:30.019> all

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
this goes from low viewing position all

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.020 
this goes from low viewing position all
the<00:02:30.680> way<00:02:30.769> up<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.040> almost<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.489> high<00:02:31.700> viewing

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
the way up to almost the high viewing
