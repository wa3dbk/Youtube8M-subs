 maybe yes of some of the races of the 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.270
 saga zelda we find 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.559
 you know that the ilian have powers that 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.450
 allows them to send telepathic messages 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.750

 telepathic messages at the beginning of 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.360
 super game nintendo zelda also 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.400
 contact with link through these 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.820
 powers and plains to go to 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.940
 rescue it you imagine if you do not 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:10.000
 they had these powers and they would have had 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.000
 to cross I do not know what I have whatsapp 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.140
 You know that there are two different kinds of 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.810
 races now a lot of people get confused and 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.030
 think that there is only one type of area the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.959
 which evolved and became 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.030
 evil but this is not so are the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.940
 sea ​​areas that are what we find 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.970
 in ocarina of time to the most by the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.489
 princess et cetera and they are good they are 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.010
 Hospitallers do not hurt you without 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.590
 But there are also river areas 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.769
 that appear in the sky of nes alen to 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.690
 the past nissan walking etcetera this 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.060
 it will only be that our face as soon as we 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.099
 see are two kinds of effects 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.099
 different but of the same race 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.180
 and you know that the unemployed to the race 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.270
 aquatic appearing skyward sword were going 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.099
 to be now at first though 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.370
 while doing the designs of some 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:56.099
 now more older primitives are 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.620
 they realized that they were practically 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.010
 creating a completely new breed already 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.860
 that did not have much similarity with 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.860
 the now normal ones and that's when they created 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.590
 the unemployed you would have 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.600
 preferred the unemployed or those now in 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.390
 esquel watson such that he had been 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.980
 very good to see ones now I do not know a little 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.980
 oldest in this game 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.020
 you knew that there are races that are evolutions 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.900
 of others for example the call of the 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.890
 wind waker are an evolution of 2 kokiri 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.510
 and they are and an evolution of the now 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.790
 due to the great flood the wind waker 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.190
 some races had to adapt 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.950
 to be able to survive as the 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.200
 venerable tree of color q2 long ago 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.830
 time they were human but life in the 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.210
 sea was transforming them along 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.960
 countless generations 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.000
 also mcquarrie mails and are 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.430
 reincarnations fridaires frido and the 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.160
 artist who were an old kokiri and 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.190
 an old area in the east of metal and 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.790
 for example we can see the symbol of 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.790
 the now 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.900
 you know that they are cocker and they leave 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:14.019
 forest supposedly dies if I say 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.150
 supposedly because but you finish 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:19.419
 ocarina of time are installed in the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.579
 credits and suddenly but but what 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.250
 you do there but but what do 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.729
 coquitos not so quietly what 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.729
 you are going to die 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.379
 and nothing else but these are the five 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:38.349
 versions I can tell you about 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:40.419
 the races that are in the zelda saga if 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.180
 you know some more that you have not named no 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.550
 hesitate to put it in the comments we 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.499
 we see in the next video here in the 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.189
 temple of time that the triforza os 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:50.189
 accompany
