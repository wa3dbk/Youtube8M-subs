00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
we have to be very careful how much air

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.230 
we have to be very careful how much air
we<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.840> put<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.260> because<00:01:10.820> right<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> end

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
we you put in because right to the end

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.450 
we you put in because right to the end
on<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.600> one<00:01:14.479> too<00:01:15.950> otherwise<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.189> end<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.430> with

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
on this one too otherwise we end up with

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.090 
on this one too otherwise we end up with
not<00:01:17.790> enough<00:01:17.820> lunar<00:01:18.450> way<00:01:18.659> too<00:01:18.720> much<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.380> we've

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
not enough lunar way too much so we've

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.249 
not enough lunar way too much so we've
got<00:01:20.280> about<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.790> much<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.420> we'll<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.689> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
got about that much and we'll see that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.350 
got about that much and we'll see that
that<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.950> might<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.340> work<00:01:23.400> totally<00:01:24.119> but

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
that this might not work totally but

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.969 
that this might not work totally but
we'll<00:01:24.570> give<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.619> we're<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
we'll give it a go so we're going to the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.350 
we'll give it a go so we're going to the
beat<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:27.330> then<00:01:27.750> ankle<00:01:28.549> there<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
complicated here you can let go of this

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.580 
complicated here you can let go of this
or<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.520> keep<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.259> keep<00:01:55.439> the
