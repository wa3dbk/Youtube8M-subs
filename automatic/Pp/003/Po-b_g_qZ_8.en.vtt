00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
buildings but I think morrow is kind of

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.350 
buildings but I think morrow is kind of
realizing<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.820> he's<00:02:00.000> going<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.329> to

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
as well taking a look at that zone a

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.210 
as well taking a look at that zone a
guitar<00:04:42.940> for<00:04:42.970> just<00:04:43.300> a<00:04:43.360> second<00:04:43.830> but<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:45.070> not

quite<00:04:45.400> sure<00:04:45.430> why<00:04:45.760> he's<00:04:46.000> moving<00:04:46.360> out<00:04:46.420> as<00:04:46.630> this

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
quite sure why he's moving out as this

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.510 
quite sure why he's moving out as this
is<00:04:47.080> not<00:04:47.320> going<00:04:47.530> to<00:04:47.590> be<00:04:47.710> anywhere<00:04:48.010> near<00:04:48.220> enough

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
is not going to be anywhere near enough

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.250 
is not going to be anywhere near enough
yeah<00:04:49.150> those<00:04:49.300> roaches<00:04:49.540> going<00:04:49.900> to<00:04:49.990> be<00:04:50.050> able<00:04:50.110> to

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
yeah those roaches going to be able to

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.810 
yeah those roaches going to be able to
take<00:04:50.380> out<00:04:50.530> those<00:04:50.650> stores<00:04:50.950> fairly<00:04:51.370> easily<00:04:51.520> so

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
take out those stores fairly easily so

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.430 
take out those stores fairly easily so
Damien<00:04:52.180> basically<00:04:52.570> throwing<00:04:52.870> away<00:04:53.110> four

Damien basically throwing away four

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.620 
Damien basically throwing away four
colors<00:04:53.770> right<00:04:53.920> there<00:04:54.130> those<00:04:54.580> SUVs<00:04:54.820> despite

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
colors right there those SUVs despite

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.570 
colors right there those SUVs despite
repairing<00:04:56.140> are<00:04:56.260> not<00:04:56.500> going<00:04:56.950> to<00:04:57.130> be<00:04:57.250> able<00:04:57.280> to

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
repairing are not going to be able to

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.210 
repairing are not going to be able to
save<00:04:57.880> them<00:04:58.140> and<00:04:59.140> yeah<00:04:59.470> those<00:04:59.650> stores<00:04:59.920> going

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
save them and yeah those stores going

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.640 
save them and yeah those stores going
down<00:05:00.370> very<00:05:00.790> easily<00:05:00.910> looks<00:05:01.780> like<00:05:01.930> this<00:05:02.080> game<00:05:02.350> is

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
down very easily looks like this game is

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.230 
down very easily looks like this game is
going<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:02.980> be<00:05:03.040> going<00:05:03.400> in<00:05:03.490> Marlo's<00:05:03.820> favor<00:05:04.060> in

zerg<00:05:23.740> to<00:05:23.920> change<00:05:24.190> their<00:05:24.400> tech<00:05:24.670> on<00:05:25.300> a<00:05:25.360> dime

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
zerg to change their tech on a dime

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.990 
zerg to change their tech on a dime
looks<00:05:26.770> like<00:05:26.920> he<00:05:27.040> does<00:05:27.220> have<00:05:27.460> some<00:05:27.610> investors

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
looks like he does have some investors

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.450 
looks like he does have some investors
coming<00:05:28.210> out<00:05:28.360> now<00:05:28.570> with<00:05:29.140> neural<00:05:29.950> parasite<00:05:30.130> I

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
coming out now with neural parasite I

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.450 
coming out now with neural parasite I
believe<00:05:30.850> has<00:05:31.150> already<00:05:31.480> been<00:05:31.780> researched<00:05:32.460> no

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
believe has already been researched no

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.020 
believe has already been researched no
not<00:05:33.670> quite<00:05:33.790> yet<00:05:34.350> so<00:05:35.350> looks<00:05:35.710> like<00:05:35.770> he<00:05:36.310> is<00:05:36.610> not

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
not quite yet so looks like he is not

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.060 
not quite yet so looks like he is not
going<00:05:37.180> to<00:05:37.270> i<00:05:37.360> read<00:05:37.720> that<00:05:37.750> he<00:05:38.020> does<00:05:38.230> enjoy<00:05:38.440> no

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
going to i read that he does enjoy no

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.260 
going to i read that he does enjoy no
never<00:05:39.250> mind<00:05:39.370> he<00:05:39.520> does<00:05:39.670> have<00:05:39.850> neural<00:05:40.120> parasite

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
never mind he does have neural parasite

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.120 
never mind he does have neural parasite
it<00:05:40.960> just<00:05:41.140> was<00:05:41.260> enough<00:05:41.500> energy<00:05:41.650> on<00:05:41.950> that

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
it just was enough energy on that

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.550 
it just was enough energy on that
particular<00:05:42.250> investor<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:43.060> use<00:05:43.270> that<00:05:43.480> so<00:05:44.290> yeah

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
particular investor to use that so yeah

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.190 
particular investor to use that so yeah
planning<00:05:45.130> on<00:05:45.190> neural<00:05:45.490> parasite<00:05:45.700> enters<00:05:46.210> as<00:05:47.050> it

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
planning on neural parasite enters as it

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.750 
planning on neural parasite enters as it
looks<00:05:47.320> like<00:05:47.470> Damien<00:05:47.830> is<00:05:47.950> not<00:05:48.130> changing<00:05:48.580> his

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
looks like Damien is not changing his

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.280 
looks like Damien is not changing his
tech<00:05:49.090> really<00:05:49.300> that<00:05:49.450> much<00:05:49.630> although<00:05:49.810> we<00:05:50.020> do<00:05:50.140> see

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
tech really that much although we do see

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.720 
tech really that much although we do see
some<00:05:50.470> Marauders<00:05:50.830> coming<00:05:51.100> out<00:05:51.190> now<00:05:51.310> Marauders

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
some Marauders coming out now Marauders

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.730 
some Marauders coming out now Marauders
of<00:05:51.880> course<00:05:52.090> pretty<00:05:52.930> good<00:05:53.080> against<00:05:53.290> roaches

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
of course pretty good against roaches

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.190 
of course pretty good against roaches
and<00:05:53.920> larger<00:05:54.250> numbers<00:05:55.740> so<00:05:57.330> Damien<00:05:58.330> with<00:05:58.930> the

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
and larger numbers so Damien with the

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.400 
and larger numbers so Damien with the
thorn<00:05:59.890> Marauder<00:06:00.220> combo<00:06:00.730> bring<00:06:01.330> out<00:06:01.420> his<00:06:01.540> third

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
thorn Marauder combo bring out his third

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.960 
thorn Marauder combo bring out his third
base<00:06:02.650> now<00:06:02.890> looks<00:06:03.130> like<00:06:03.190> he<00:06:03.370> is<00:06:03.400> probably<00:06:03.700> going

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
base now looks like he is probably going

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.460 
base now looks like he is probably going
to<00:06:04.090> take<00:06:04.330> that<00:06:04.540> island<00:06:04.900> as<00:06:05.020> he's<00:06:05.170> not<00:06:05.320> going<00:06:05.440> to

ahead<00:06:55.850> so<00:06:56.270> I<00:06:56.300> think<00:06:56.390> this<00:06:56.690> game<00:06:56.840> is<00:06:56.900> going<00:06:57.200> to

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.290 
ahead so I think this game is going to

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.590 
ahead so I think this game is going to
be<00:06:57.380> over<00:06:57.710> fairly<00:06:58.040> shortly<00:06:58.580> here<00:06:58.880> pretty<00:06:59.510> much

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600 
be over fairly shortly here pretty much

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.930 
be over fairly shortly here pretty much
as<00:06:59.840> soon<00:06:59.870> as<00:07:00.170> morrow<00:07:00.410> moves<00:07:00.830> in<00:07:00.980> he<00:07:01.130> can<00:07:01.340> end

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
as soon as morrow moves in he can end

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.130 
as soon as morrow moves in he can end
the<00:07:02.540> game<00:07:02.690> and<00:07:04.030> yeah<00:07:05.030> so<00:07:05.480> not<00:07:05.690> a<00:07:05.720> whole<00:07:06.020> lot

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.140
