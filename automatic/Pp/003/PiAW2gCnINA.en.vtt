really want to do here is there's going
to<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.280> some<00:01:53.490> pins<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.299> you're<00:01:54.450> going

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
to be some pins in here and you're going

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.749 
to be some pins in here and you're going
to<00:01:54.630> want<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> make<00:01:54.990> sure<00:01:55.020> these<00:01:55.259> pins<00:01:55.590> align<00:01:56.070> so

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
to want to make sure these pins align so

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.740 
to want to make sure these pins align so
I'm<00:01:56.850> going<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.000> get<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.180> up<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.360> once<00:01:57.659> again

I'm going to get this up here once again
and<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.469> there's<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.740> pen<00:01:58.979> alignment

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and you can see there's a pen alignment

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.370 
and you can see there's a pen alignment
right<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.729> here<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.149> memory<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.049> once<00:02:01.259> you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
right in here for the memory so once you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.109 
right in here for the memory so once you
align<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> pins<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.100> at<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.250> memory<00:02:02.579> you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
align the pins up at the memory you

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.060 
align the pins up at the memory you
insert<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.540> memory<00:02:03.780> gently<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.469> then<00:02:04.500> just

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
insert the memory gently and then just

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.319 
insert the memory gently and then just
close<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.369> down<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.969> I'm<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.180> go<00:02:06.270> ahead

have<00:02:38.370> both<00:02:38.549> sticks<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.879> memory<00:02:38.939> now

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
have both sticks of memory now

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.020 
have both sticks of memory now
completely<00:02:39.599> in<00:02:40.489> make<00:02:41.489> sure<00:02:41.519> they're<00:02:41.730> nice<00:02:41.819> and

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
so now I have both new sets of the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.300 
so now I have both new sets of the
Kingston<00:02:51.480> memory<00:02:51.810> installed<00:02:52.290> i'm<00:02:53.040> going<00:02:53.129> to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
Kingston memory installed i'm going to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.830 
Kingston memory installed i'm going to
go<00:02:53.370> ahead<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.670> flip<00:02:53.819> it<00:02:53.940> around<00:02:54.060> put<00:02:54.810> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840

there we go nice firm thing i'm going to

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.539 
there we go nice firm thing i'm going to
flip<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.099> around<00:03:05.220> again<00:03:05.579> feed<00:03:05.760> bags<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:08.430> we'll

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
flip it around again feed bags and we'll

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.599 
flip it around again feed bags and we'll
go<00:03:08.639> ahead<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.819> turn<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:11.430> if

running<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.870> as<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.470> guys<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:22.829> see<00:03:22.889> this<00:03:23.579> was

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
running so as you guys can see this was

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.839 
running so as you guys can see this was
very<00:03:23.970> easy<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.629> change<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.319> memory<00:03:25.709> out

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
very easy to change the memory out

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.039 
very easy to change the memory out
inside<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:27.000> system<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.449> will<00:03:27.510> now<00:03:27.629> boot<00:03:27.870> up

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
inside the system it will now boot up

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.839 
inside the system it will now boot up
and<00:03:28.319> i'll<00:03:28.769> go<00:03:28.949> ahead<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.220> run<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.459> couple<00:03:29.669> of

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
and i'll go ahead and run a couple of

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.280 
and i'll go ahead and run a couple of
Windows<00:03:30.000> tests<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.599> we'll<00:03:30.659> get<00:03:30.780> those<00:03:30.959> scores

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
Windows tests and we'll get those scores

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.199 
Windows tests and we'll get those scores
up<00:03:31.440> for<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.709> guys<00:03:31.889> as<00:03:32.069> well<00:03:32.220> currently<00:03:32.849> before

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
up for you guys as well currently before

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.819 
up for you guys as well currently before
I<00:03:33.419> install<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:33.959> memory<00:03:34.109> with<00:03:34.379> my<00:03:34.560> previous

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
I install the memory with my previous

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.309 
I install the memory with my previous
stuff<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.430> was<00:03:36.000> getting<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.389> score<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.810> six<00:03:37.079> point

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
stuff I was getting a score of six point

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.589 
stuff I was getting a score of six point
nine<00:03:37.409> on<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:38.040> windows<00:03:38.430> maybe<00:03:39.150> it'll<00:03:39.299> go<00:03:39.449> up<00:03:39.480> a

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
nine on the windows maybe it'll go up a

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.300 
nine on the windows maybe it'll go up a
little<00:03:39.690> bit<00:03:39.900> more<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.620> main<00:03:40.889> thing<00:03:40.919> with

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
little bit more the main thing with

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.159 
little bit more the main thing with
faster<00:03:41.819> memory<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.329> faster<00:03:42.690> times<00:03:42.930> you're

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
faster memory and faster times you're

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.149 
faster memory and faster times you're
doing<00:03:43.409> it<00:03:43.500> up<00:03:43.590> where<00:03:43.739> you're<00:03:43.919> going<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.099> be

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
doing it up where you're going to be

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.860 
doing it up where you're going to be
able<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.340> access<00:03:44.609> your<00:03:44.790> programs<00:03:45.209> faster<00:03:45.690> and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
able to access your programs faster and

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.390 
able to access your programs faster and
boot<00:03:46.079> up<00:03:46.169> a<00:03:46.260> little<00:03:46.470> quicker<00:03:46.680> you're<00:03:47.250> not

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
boot up a little quicker you're not

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.189 
boot up a little quicker you're not
going<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.609> see<00:03:47.790> any<00:03:47.940> extremely<00:03:48.659> radical

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
going to see any extremely radical

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.750 
going to see any extremely radical
differences<00:03:50.099> unless<00:03:50.340> you're<00:03:50.489> going<00:03:50.609> from

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
differences unless you're going from

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.490 
differences unless you're going from
like<00:03:50.909> a<00:03:50.940> two<00:03:51.180> gigabyte<00:03:51.629> to<00:03:51.870> an<00:03:51.959> eight<00:03:52.079> gigabyte

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
like a two gigabyte to an eight gigabyte

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.259 
like a two gigabyte to an eight gigabyte
kit<00:03:52.769> then<00:03:53.099> you'll<00:03:53.280> see<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.459> lot<00:03:53.639> of<00:03:53.699> performance

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
kit then you'll see a lot of performance

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.879 
kit then you'll see a lot of performance
differences<00:03:54.780> but<00:03:55.290> if<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.530> have<00:03:55.739> eight

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
differences but if you have eight

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.170 
differences but if you have eight
gigabytes<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.430> just<00:03:56.699> upgrade<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
gigabytes you just upgrade to a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.219 
gigabytes you just upgrade to a
different<00:03:57.510> set<00:03:57.599> of<00:03:57.690> eight<00:03:57.780> gigabyte<00:03:58.109> memory

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
different set of eight gigabyte memory

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.110 
different set of eight gigabyte memory
like<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:58.709> it's<00:03:58.949> just<00:03:59.220> going<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.609> be<00:03:59.699> much

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
like this it's just going to be much

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.869 
like this it's just going to be much
faster<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:01.530> here<00:04:01.680> we<00:04:01.769> go<00:04:01.799> we've<00:04:02.489> booted<00:04:02.790> up

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
faster so here we go we've booted up

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.670 
faster so here we go we've booted up
completely<00:04:03.269> into<00:04:03.540> windows<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.290> this

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
completely into windows so this

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.800 
completely into windows so this
installation<00:04:05.069> was<00:04:05.430> success<00:04:05.909> there<00:04:06.510> you<00:04:06.629> go

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
installation was success there you go

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.390 
installation was success there you go
that's<00:04:07.260> all<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.620> need<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.829> know<00:04:07.979> on<00:04:08.159> how<00:04:08.190> to

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
that's all you need to know on how to

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.899 
that's all you need to know on how to
install<00:04:08.819> memory<00:04:09.479> into<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.079> pc<00:04:10.620> notebook<00:04:11.040> thanks

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
install memory into a pc notebook thanks
