owner told me couple people have dug
this<00:02:17.660> spot<00:02:17.960> over<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.350> years<00:02:18.640> but<00:02:19.640> most<00:02:20.090> of

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
this spot over the years but most of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.270 
this spot over the years but most of
stuff<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.600> find<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:20.990> pretty<00:02:21.140> deep<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.620> know<00:02:21.770> six

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
stuff I find is pretty deep you know six

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.330 
stuff I find is pretty deep you know six
inches<00:02:22.550> or<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:24.200> they<00:02:24.650> miss<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.040> deeper

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
inches or so so they miss the deeper

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.890 
inches or so so they miss the deeper
targets<00:02:25.730> now<00:02:25.880> I'm<00:02:26.030> only<00:02:26.210> using<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.630> small

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
targets now I'm only using the small

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.350 
targets now I'm only using the small
coil<00:02:27.200> on<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.040> 80<00:02:28.280> Pro<00:02:28.640> here<00:02:28.880> but<00:02:29.060> it's<00:02:29.180> still

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
coil on the 80 Pro here but it's still

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.670 
coil on the 80 Pro here but it's still
getting<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.810> depth<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.770> need<00:02:32.350> also<00:02:33.350> there's

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
getting the depth I need also there's

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.300 
getting the depth I need also there's
some<00:02:33.860> cool<00:02:34.220> looking<00:02:34.400> holes<00:02:35.390> over<00:02:35.600> here<00:02:36.310> they

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
some cool looking holes over here they

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.940 
some cool looking holes over here they
look<00:02:37.520> like<00:02:37.670> mine<00:02:37.910> shafts<00:02:38.650> then<00:02:39.650> what<00:02:39.830> the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
look like mine shafts then what the

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.830 
look like mine shafts then what the
hell're<00:02:40.480> seam<00:02:41.480> right<00:02:41.600> there<00:02:43.660> one<00:02:44.660> right<00:02:44.810> there

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
hell're seam right there one right there

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.800 
hell're seam right there one right there
and<00:02:45.140> there's<00:02:45.500> one<00:02:45.560> over<00:02:45.890> there<00:02:46.850> it's<00:02:47.570> hard<00:02:47.690> to

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
and there's one over there it's hard to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.740 
and there's one over there it's hard to
see<00:02:47.930> if<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.110> camera<00:02:48.320> but<00:02:49.330> maybe<00:02:50.330> where<00:02:50.570> big
