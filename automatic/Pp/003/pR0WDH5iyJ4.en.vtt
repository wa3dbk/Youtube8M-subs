a recession we hear that language all

that<00:00:46.140> really<00:00:46.380> means<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.040> I<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.309> thought<00:00:47.430> I'd

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
that really means so I just thought I'd

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.540 
that really means so I just thought I'd
talk<00:00:47.820> about<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> few<00:00:48.720> minutes

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
talk about it for a few minutes

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.069 
talk about it for a few minutes
traditionally<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> recession<00:00:51.300> had<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.540> lot<00:00:51.809> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
traditionally a recession had a lot to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.490 
traditionally a recession had a lot to
do<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.440> business<00:00:52.730> inventories<00:00:54.500> basically

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
do with business inventories basically

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.319 
do with business inventories basically
what<00:00:55.680> would<00:00:55.800> happen<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.370> companies<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.210> were

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
what would happen is companies that were

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.990 
what would happen is companies that were
manufacturers<00:00:58.260> would<00:00:58.590> manufacture<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> lot<00:00:59.790> of

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
manufacturers would manufacture a lot of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.540 
manufacturers would manufacture a lot of
cars<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.930> televisions<00:01:01.680> or<00:01:01.890> whatever<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.370> was

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
cars or televisions or whatever it was

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.910 
cars or televisions or whatever it was
and<00:01:02.879> they<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> point<00:01:04.259> where<00:01:04.530> they<00:01:04.680> had

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and they get to the point where they had

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
and they get to the point where they had
more<00:01:05.280> cars<00:01:05.759> or<00:01:06.060> televisions<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.050> there

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
more cars or televisions and then there

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800 
more cars or televisions and then there
were<00:01:07.320> people<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.950> buy<00:01:08.190> them<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.789> so<00:01:09.570> what

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
were people to buy them and so what

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.749 
were people to buy them and so what
would<00:01:09.930> happen<00:01:10.410> is<00:01:10.710> they'd<00:01:11.009> cut<00:01:11.250> back<00:01:11.490> on

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
would happen is they'd cut back on

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.880 
would happen is they'd cut back on
workers<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> factory<00:01:13.320> they<00:01:13.470> slowed<00:01:13.710> down

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
workers in the factory they slowed down

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.460 
workers in the factory they slowed down
their<00:01:14.100> production<00:01:14.670> lines<00:01:14.910> the<00:01:15.840> prices<00:01:16.320> on

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
their production lines the prices on

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.249 
their production lines the prices on
those<00:01:16.680> items<00:01:16.890> would<00:01:17.250> fall<00:01:18.050> consumers<00:01:19.050> would

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
those items would fall consumers would

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.710 
those items would fall consumers would
start<00:01:19.560> buying<00:01:19.890> them<00:01:20.190> again<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.270> created

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
start buying them again and it created

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.620 
start buying them again and it created
sort<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.319> a<00:01:22.440> cycle<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.280> cycle<00:01:23.910> just

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
sort of a cycle and that cycle just

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.210 
sort of a cycle and that cycle just
happened<00:01:25.080> every<00:01:25.410> three<00:01:25.709> or<00:01:25.740> four<00:01:25.860> or<00:01:26.190> five

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
happened every three or four or five

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.240 
happened every three or four or five
years<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.000> economy<00:01:27.569> now<00:01:28.229> what's<00:01:28.709> happened

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
years in the economy now what's happened

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.419 
years in the economy now what's happened
today<00:01:29.429> is<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.660> people<00:01:31.500> who<00:01:31.679> build<00:01:32.009> things

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
today is that people who build things

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.880 
today is that people who build things
people<00:01:32.849> in<00:01:33.149> business<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.259> much<00:01:34.619> better

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
people in business have a much better

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.790 
people in business have a much better
handle<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.700> supply<00:01:36.149> and<00:01:36.179> demand<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.560> don't

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
handle on supply and demand so we don't

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.520 
handle on supply and demand so we don't
get<00:01:38.009> those<00:01:38.300> inventory<00:01:39.300> type<00:01:39.630> recessions<00:01:40.349> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
get those inventory type recessions the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.770 
get those inventory type recessions the
way<00:01:40.679> we<00:01:40.860> used<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.580> actually<00:01:42.209> there<00:01:42.690> have

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
way we used to and actually there have

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.389 
way we used to and actually there have
been<00:01:42.869> periods<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.470> time<00:01:43.740> over<00:01:44.069> the<00:01:44.190> last

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
been periods of time over the last

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.370 
been periods of time over the last
several<00:01:44.729> decades<00:01:45.030> where<00:01:45.599> we've<00:01:45.780> gone<00:01:46.020> eight

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
several decades where we've gone eight

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.690 
several decades where we've gone eight
ten<00:01:46.800> years<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.819> an<00:01:48.690> upswing<00:01:49.410> without<00:01:50.039> a<00:01:50.069> severe

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
ten years of an upswing without a severe

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.410 
ten years of an upswing without a severe
recession<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.039> not<00:01:53.369> basically<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
recession so so it's not basically the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.290 
recession so so it's not basically the
same<00:01:54.690> causes<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> used<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.580> but<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
same causes that it used to be but the

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.870 
same causes that it used to be but the
interesting<00:01:57.750> thing<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.470> is<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:59.280> they<00:01:59.700> are

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
interesting thing is is that they are

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.990 
interesting thing is is that they are
still<00:02:00.259> cyclical<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.500> mean<00:02:02.130> when<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.399> talk<00:02:02.429> about

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
still cyclical I mean when we talk about

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.910 
still cyclical I mean when we talk about
a<00:02:03.030> recession<00:02:03.569> we're<00:02:04.110> basically<00:02:04.530> talking

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
a recession we're basically talking

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.639 
a recession we're basically talking
about<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.489> ebbs<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.239> flows<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.989> the<00:02:07.200> business

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
about the ebbs and flows of the business

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.040 
about the ebbs and flows of the business
cycle<00:02:07.920> there<00:02:08.729> are<00:02:08.849> periods<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.420> time<00:02:09.690> where

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
cycle there are periods of time where

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.979 
cycle there are periods of time where
businesses<00:02:10.649> make<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> lot<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.400> money<00:02:11.989> consumers

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
businesses make a lot of money consumers

there<00:02:17.790> are<00:02:17.880> periods<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.390> times<00:02:18.660> when<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.140> all

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
there are periods of times when that all

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.030 
there are periods of times when that all
slows<00:02:19.620> down<00:02:20.010> okay<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.599> slowdown<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.739> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
slows down okay and that slowdown is the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.399 
slows down okay and that slowdown is the
recession<00:02:23.700> oK<00:02:24.269> we've<00:02:24.480> obviously<00:02:24.780> we've<00:02:25.379> been

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
recession oK we've obviously we've been

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.110 
recession oK we've obviously we've been
in<00:02:25.739> one

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
in one

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.509 
in one
over<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.360> last<00:02:26.540> several<00:02:26.900> years<00:02:27.340> we've<00:02:28.340> been

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
over the last several years we've been

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.930 
over the last several years we've been
on<00:02:28.670> kind<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.180> slow<00:02:29.510> recovery<00:02:29.810> since<00:02:30.819> kind<00:02:31.819> of

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
on kind of a slow recovery since kind of

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.270 
on kind of a slow recovery since kind of
edgy<00:02:32.629> right<00:02:32.840> now<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.319> hear<00:02:33.650> people<00:02:33.830> say<00:02:34.250> well

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
edgy right now you hear people say well

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.020 
edgy right now you hear people say well
we<00:02:34.670> may<00:02:34.819> go<00:02:35.000> into<00:02:35.299> a<00:02:35.330> double-dip<00:02:36.110> recession

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
we may go into a double-dip recession

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.059 
we may go into a double-dip recession
probably<00:02:38.030> not<00:02:38.239> likely<00:02:38.629> but<00:02:39.019> it's<00:02:39.530> part<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:39.950> the

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
probably not likely but it's part of the

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.500 
probably not likely but it's part of the
discussion<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:40.849> I<00:02:40.879> think<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.360> it's

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
discussion so I think that it's

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.259 
discussion so I think that it's
important<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.019> pay<00:02:42.230> attention<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:43.030> here's<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
important to pay attention to here's the

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.610 
important to pay attention to here's the
lesson<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.810> want<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.170> share<00:02:45.379> with<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:47.120> even

recessions<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.920> recoveries<00:02:49.790> are<00:02:50.290> more

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
recessions and recoveries are more

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.680 
recessions and recoveries are more
powerful<00:02:51.650> in<00:02:52.220> some<00:02:52.640> sectors<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.569> economy

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
powerful in some sectors of the economy

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.369 
powerful in some sectors of the economy
than<00:02:54.319> others<00:02:55.150> okay<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:56.209> when<00:02:56.659> you<00:02:56.810> hear<00:02:57.170> this

I mean to give you some examples we know

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.250 
I mean to give you some examples we know
that<00:03:06.829> housing<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.459> very<00:03:07.730> cyclical<00:03:08.180> people<00:03:09.049> buy

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
that housing is very cyclical people buy

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.099 
that housing is very cyclical people buy
houses<00:03:09.620> during<00:03:10.489> certain<00:03:10.940> certain<00:03:11.629> periods<00:03:11.989> of

houses during certain certain periods of
time<00:03:12.349> and<00:03:12.680> then<00:03:13.129> that<00:03:13.720> purchasing<00:03:14.720> kind<00:03:14.989> of

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
time and then that purchasing kind of

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.380 
time and then that purchasing kind of
slows<00:03:15.470> during<00:03:16.069> other<00:03:16.220> periods<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.879> time

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
slows during other periods of time

same thing with cars the same thing with
consumer<00:03:20.569> goods<00:03:20.840> I<00:03:21.650> mean<00:03:22.010> those<00:03:22.159> those<00:03:22.430> things

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
are very cyclical there are great boom

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.670 
are very cyclical there are great boom
times<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.030> then<00:03:26.120> there<00:03:26.269> are<00:03:26.329> slow<00:03:26.599> times<00:03:26.870> but

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
times and then there are slow times but

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.589 
times and then there are slow times but
there<00:03:27.859> are<00:03:27.950> other<00:03:28.129> products<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.000> are<00:03:29.209> less

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
there are other products that are less

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.360 
there are other products that are less
cyclical<00:03:30.530> like<00:03:31.480> medicines<00:03:32.480> at<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.870> drugstore

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
cyclical like medicines at the drugstore

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.599 
cyclical like medicines at the drugstore
okay

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
okay

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.819 
okay
people<00:03:34.970> need<00:03:35.269> medicine<00:03:35.900> whether<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.530> the

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
people need medicine whether the the

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.860 
people need medicine whether the the
economy<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.489> really<00:03:37.819> good<00:03:38.030> or<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.299> economy<00:03:38.780> is

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
economy is really good or the economy is

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.050 
economy is really good or the economy is
bad<00:03:39.109> people<00:03:39.500> need<00:03:39.680> groceries<00:03:40.069> whether<00:03:40.880> the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
bad people need groceries whether the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.379 
bad people need groceries whether the
economy<00:03:41.419> is<00:03:41.720> good<00:03:42.079> or<00:03:42.319> the<00:03:42.410> economy<00:03:42.919> is<00:03:43.010> bad

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
economy is good or the economy is bad

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.390 
economy is good or the economy is bad
people<00:03:44.389> need<00:03:44.540> gasoline<00:03:44.870> whether<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:46.040> economy

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
people need gasoline whether the economy

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.629 
people need gasoline whether the economy
is<00:03:46.730> good<00:03:47.120> or<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.419> economy<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:48.109> bad<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.040> people

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
is good or the economy is bad so people

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.819 
is good or the economy is bad so people
who<00:03:49.940> work<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.480> those<00:03:50.690> type<00:03:51.049> of<00:03:51.079> sectors

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
who work in those type of sectors

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.129 
who work in those type of sectors
probably<00:03:52.489> suffer<00:03:53.030> less<00:03:53.269> than<00:03:53.660> people<00:03:54.019> who

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
probably suffer less than people who

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.319 
probably suffer less than people who
sell<00:03:54.410> real<00:03:54.650> estate<00:03:54.680> or<00:03:55.190> cars<00:03:55.519> for<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:55.940> living

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
sell real estate or cars for a living

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.089 
sell real estate or cars for a living

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
we have a severe recession like we did

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.110 
we have a severe recession like we did
in<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:08.989> last<00:04:09.230> two<00:04:09.470> or<00:04:09.500> three<00:04:09.620> years<00:04:10.120> obviously

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
in the last two or three years obviously

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.199

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
today all that talk on television or the

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.460 
today all that talk on television or the
articles<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.360> read<00:04:32.570> and<00:04:32.780> all<00:04:32.870> those<00:04:33.050> kinds<00:04:33.410> of

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
articles you read and all those kinds of

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.649 
articles you read and all those kinds of
things<00:04:33.680> are<00:04:33.889> very<00:04:33.949> important<00:04:34.849> from<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.270> large

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:35.659 
things are very important from a large

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:37.670 
things are very important from a large
national<00:04:36.530> standpoint

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
national standpoint

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.800 
national standpoint
but<00:04:37.949> they're<00:04:38.100> probably<00:04:38.310> less<00:04:38.910> important<00:04:39.630> in

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
but they're probably less important in

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.890 
but they're probably less important in
your<00:04:40.020> own<00:04:40.289> personal<00:04:41.100> situation<00:04:41.630> okay

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
so you need to evaluate that discussion

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.080 
so you need to evaluate that discussion
obviously<00:04:45.930> if<00:04:46.650> you<00:04:46.830> sell<00:04:47.100> cars<00:04:47.400> for<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.789> living

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
obviously if you sell cars for a living

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.450 
obviously if you sell cars for a living
or<00:04:48.240> sell<00:04:48.449> houses<00:04:48.720> for<00:04:49.259> a<00:04:49.320> living<00:04:49.350> those<00:04:50.130> things

during<00:04:56.100> certain<00:04:56.370> periods<00:04:56.759> of<00:04:57.150> time<00:04:57.449> chances

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
during certain periods of time chances

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.350 
during certain periods of time chances
are<00:04:58.320> good<00:04:58.500> that<00:04:58.560> happens<00:04:59.340> during<00:04:59.610> recessions

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360
