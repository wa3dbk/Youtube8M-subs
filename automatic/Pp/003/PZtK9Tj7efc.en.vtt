00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
microwave oven but one place where they

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.290 
microwave oven but one place where they
can<00:00:10.650> be<00:00:10.769> disappointing<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.849> that's<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
can be disappointing and that's in the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.450 
can be disappointing and that's in the
sink<00:00:12.599> when<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.019> lift<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> plug<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
sink when you lift the plug and the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.710 
sink when you lift the plug and the
water<00:00:14.759> discharges<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:16.379> slowly<00:00:16.940> well<00:00:17.940> can<00:00:18.600> it

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
water discharges so slowly well can it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.429 
water discharges so slowly well can it
be<00:00:18.869> improved<00:00:21.949> yes<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.220> think<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.480> but<00:00:25.199> first

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
be improved yes I think it can but first

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.109 
be improved yes I think it can but first
let's<00:00:25.769> check<00:00:25.859> one<00:00:26.220> or<00:00:26.340> two<00:00:26.490> points<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.060> a

flexi I know but it's got ridges on the
inside<00:00:43.860> which<00:00:44.370> slowed<00:00:45.030> down<00:00:45.270> water<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.079> trap

things<00:00:47.010> as<00:00:47.190> well<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> better<00:00:48.629> example

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
things as well this is a better example

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.920 
things as well this is a better example
it's<00:00:49.710> smooth<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.370> inside<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.690> many

you<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:59.040> board<00:01:59.369> over<00:01:59.700> here<00:01:59.729> what<00:02:00.479> i<00:02:00.509> mean

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you on this board over here what i mean

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.230 
you on this board over here what i mean
by<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.079> beginning<00:02:01.680> which<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> sink<00:02:02.880> where

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
by the beginning which is the sink where

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.750 
by the beginning which is the sink where
it<00:02:03.360> all<00:02:03.479> starts<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.409> runs<00:02:04.619> away

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.930 

right<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.930> the<00:02:09.020> far<00:02:09.260> end<00:02:09.530> where<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.190> discharges

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
right to the far end where it discharges

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.660 
right to the far end where it discharges
out<00:02:11.330> into<00:02:11.930> your<00:02:12.080> waste<00:02:12.320> tank<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.980> at<00:02:13.580> the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
out into your waste tank and at the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.550 
out into your waste tank and at the
discharge<00:02:14.240> end<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.690> can<00:02:14.840> always<00:02:15.080> buy<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.320> bit

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
discharge end you can always buy a bit

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.240 
discharge end you can always buy a bit
of<00:02:15.680> old<00:02:15.800> car<00:02:16.220> hose<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:17.120> make<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.510> connection

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
of old car hose to make the connection

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.060 
of old car hose to make the connection
so<00:02:19.250> we<00:02:19.430> buy<00:02:19.610> this<00:02:20.200> let<00:02:21.200> us<00:02:21.440> just<00:02:21.680> go<00:02:21.770> through

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
so we buy this let us just go through

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.280 
so we buy this let us just go through
the<00:02:22.130> processing<00:02:22.820> we<00:02:23.510> can<00:02:23.690> cut<00:02:23.960> it<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.260> length

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
the processing we can cut it to length

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.250 
the processing we can cut it to length
with<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.040> hacksaw<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.880> started<00:02:26.660> with<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:26.990> piece

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
with a hacksaw I started with this piece

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.190 
with a hacksaw I started with this piece
just<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.800> get<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.040> all<00:02:28.220> rolling<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.300> once

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
just to get it all rolling and once

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.260 
just to get it all rolling and once
you've<00:02:30.380> got<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.710> rough<00:02:30.890> bits<00:02:31.160> there<00:02:31.460> you<00:02:32.090> can

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
you've got the rough bits there you can

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.450 
you've got the rough bits there you can
get<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> file<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.350> can<00:02:33.380> smooth<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.100> ends

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
get a file and you can smooth the ends

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.480 
get a file and you can smooth the ends
and<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.700> can<00:02:34.910> smooth<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.420> inside<00:02:36.190> no<00:02:37.190> less

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
and you can smooth the inside no less

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.550 
and you can smooth the inside no less
important<00:02:38.150> though<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.750> take<00:02:39.170> off<00:02:39.380> the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
important though is to take off the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.430 
important though is to take off the
shine<00:02:39.890> with<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.430> bit<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.910> abrasive<00:02:41.750> paper<00:02:41.990> and

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
shine with a bit of abrasive paper and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.070 
shine with a bit of abrasive paper and
similarly<00:02:43.340> on<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.820> inside<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.570> couplings

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
similarly on the inside of the couplings

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.670 
similarly on the inside of the couplings
take<00:02:45.710> off<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.100> shine<00:02:46.400> here<00:02:47.030> too<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.780> having

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
take off the shine here too and having

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.340 
take off the shine here too and having
got<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:48.950> all<00:02:49.100> checked<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.390> yes<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:50.720> can<00:02:50.930> see<00:02:51.170> it

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
got it all checked and yes we can see it

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.560 
got it all checked and yes we can see it
interlocks<00:02:51.760> we've<00:02:52.760> got<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.060> measured<00:02:53.420> up

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
interlocks we've got it measured up

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.290 
interlocks we've got it measured up
pre-cut<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:55.070> use<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:55.580> kind<00:02:55.910> of<00:02:56.120> adhesive

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300

back and forth a couple of times and

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.650 
back and forth a couple of times and
then<00:03:15.709> you'll<00:03:15.920> leave<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.400> for<00:03:16.610> 24<00:03:17.120> hours<00:03:17.150> before

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660

here<00:03:20.959> we<00:03:21.170> are<00:03:21.350> at<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.860> sink<00:03:22.190> end<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.700> fitted

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
here we are at the sink end I fitted

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.960 
here we are at the sink end I fitted
these<00:03:23.930> under<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.440> sink<00:03:24.739> mounted<00:03:25.489> them<00:03:25.640> firmly

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
these under the sink mounted them firmly

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.300 
these under the sink mounted them firmly
and<00:03:26.360> then<00:03:26.900> when<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.200> goes<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.590> corner<00:03:28.040> round

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
and then when it goes the corner round

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.310 
and then when it goes the corner round
the<00:03:28.459> corner<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:29.060> want<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.540> just<00:03:29.660> check<00:03:30.080> that

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
the corner I want to just check that

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.130 
the corner I want to just check that
there's<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.620> slight<00:03:31.100> slope<00:03:31.610> on<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.420> for

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
there's a slight slope on that and for

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
the rest of the whole system there's a

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.960 
the rest of the whole system there's a
continuing<00:03:36.050> slope<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.709> if<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.370> can't<00:03:37.700> get

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
continuing slope and if you can't get

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.460 
continuing slope and if you can't get
all<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.360> way<00:03:38.480> through<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.900> cupboards<00:03:39.140> at

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
all the way through the cupboards at

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.070 
all the way through the cupboards at
least<00:03:39.739> if<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.130> improve<00:03:40.489> some<00:03:40.940> of<00:03:40.970> it<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.330> link

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
least if you improve some of it and link

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.009 
least if you improve some of it and link
it<00:03:42.260> back<00:03:42.440> up<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.860> flexible<00:03:43.400> hose<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:44.510> will<00:03:44.780> get

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
it back up to flexible hose you will get

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.400 
it back up to flexible hose you will get
water<00:03:45.380> whistling<00:03:46.280> out<00:03:46.430> of<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:46.760> sink<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.410> jolly

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
water whistling out of that sink a jolly

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.160 
water whistling out of that sink a jolly
sight<00:03:48.739> quicker
