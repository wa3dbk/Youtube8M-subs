but<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.160> problem<00:02:42.490> now<00:02:42.520> is<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.090> there's<00:02:43.510> a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
but the problem now is that there's a

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.090 
but the problem now is that there's a
head<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.020> valve<00:02:44.230> cover<00:02:44.500> where<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.800> master

cylinder used to be the best solution we

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.600 
cylinder used to be the best solution we
could<00:02:47.590> come<00:02:47.740> up<00:02:47.770> with<00:02:47.890> was<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.340> move<00:02:48.459> the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
could come up with was to move the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.460 
could come up with was to move the
master<00:02:48.970> cylinder<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.330> hydraboost<00:02:49.780> unit<00:02:50.110> over

master cylinder and hydraboost unit over
to<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.709> side<00:02:50.950> but<00:02:51.880> we<00:02:52.000> wanted<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.270> keep<00:02:52.360> the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
to the side but we wanted to keep the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.910 
to the side but we wanted to keep the
pedals<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.050> correct<00:02:53.350> position<00:02:53.770> in<00:02:53.830> the

pedals in the correct position in the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.680 
pedals in the correct position in the
car<00:02:54.130> so<00:02:54.550> it'll<00:02:54.640> be<00:02:54.730> functional<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.390> still<00:02:55.600> be

car so it'll be functional and still be
fun<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.930> drive<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:57.520> what<00:02:57.640> we<00:02:57.730> ended<00:02:57.910> up<00:02:58.000> doing

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
fun to drive so what we ended up doing

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.170 
fun to drive so what we ended up doing
was<00:02:58.630> designing<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.230> system<00:02:59.650> that<00:03:00.130> used<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.880> shaft

was designing a system that used a shaft

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.140 
was designing a system that used a shaft
to<00:03:01.870> move<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.500> pedal<00:03:02.800> motion<00:03:03.160> over<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:04.030> the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
to move the pedal motion over to the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.170 
to move the pedal motion over to the
left<00:03:04.390> about<00:03:04.660> six<00:03:04.989> inches<00:03:05.970> once<00:03:06.970> we<00:03:07.090> had

master cylinder under the dash so the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.080 
master cylinder under the dash so the
first<00:03:38.500> thing<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:38.769> did<00:03:38.980> once<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:39.820> had<00:03:39.970> everything

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
first thing I did once I had everything

thing<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:58.780> did<00:03:58.930> was<00:03:59.049> make<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.470> two<00:03:59.620> brackets

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
thing I did was make the two brackets

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.729 
thing I did was make the two brackets
which<00:04:00.730> I<00:04:00.820> wanted<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.090> be<00:04:01.150> fairly<00:04:01.420> identical<00:04:02.140> to

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
which I wanted to be fairly identical to

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.340 
which I wanted to be fairly identical to
mount<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.160> shaft<00:04:03.430> between<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.600> original

during<00:04:12.080> this<00:04:12.140> process<00:04:12.350> I<00:04:12.710> used<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.160> 5/8<00:04:13.820> wooden

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
during this process I used a 5/8 wooden

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.080 
during this process I used a 5/8 wooden
dowel<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:15.230> mock<00:04:15.890> up<00:04:16.130> in<00:04:16.340> place<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.820> shaft
