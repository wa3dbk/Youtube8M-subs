video so if anyone else has that same

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.459 
video so if anyone else has that same
idea<00:00:52.949> they<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.820> not<00:00:54.210> buy<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:55.260> this

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
idea they can not buy this because this

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.260 
idea they can not buy this because this
is<00:00:55.559> not<00:00:55.710> very<00:00:55.949> good<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.460> don't<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
is not very good I don't know if the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.939 
is not very good I don't know if the
other<00:00:57.420> boys<00:00:57.690> will<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.899> better<00:00:58.170> because<00:00:58.440> they

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
other boys will be better because they

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.000 
other boys will be better because they
have<00:00:59.219> probably<00:01:00.090> different<00:01:00.590> Monaco's<00:01:01.590> doing

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
have probably different Monaco's doing

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.429

little<00:01:02.280> stories<00:01:02.670> there's<00:01:02.850> five<00:01:03.090> volumes<00:01:03.510> but

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
little stories there's five volumes but

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.800 
little stories there's five volumes but
this<00:01:04.680> first<00:01:04.890> one<00:01:05.070> was<00:01:05.430> nothing<00:01:05.970> special<00:01:06.450> was

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
this first one was nothing special was

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.469 
this first one was nothing special was
actually<00:01:07.320> pretty<00:01:07.979> terrible<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.229> mean<00:01:11.479> these

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
actually pretty terrible I mean these

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.560 
actually pretty terrible I mean these
stories<00:01:13.020> are<00:01:13.260> not<00:01:13.290> entertaining<00:01:14.280> at<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
stories are not entertaining at all the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.020 
stories are not entertaining at all the
first<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.080> probably<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.560> best<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.310> then

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
first one is probably the best and then

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.490 
first one is probably the best and then
the<00:01:18.180> rest<00:01:18.420> were<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.960> garbage

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the rest were just garbage

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.499 
the rest were just garbage
I<00:01:20.900> mean<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.500> not<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:23.850> tell<00:01:24.060> how<00:01:24.420> much

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
I mean it's not you can tell how much

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.370 
I mean it's not you can tell how much
different<00:01:24.780> people<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.170> worthless

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
different people that are worthless

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.910 
different people that are worthless
different<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.799> mean<00:01:26.210> yeah<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.799> idea<00:01:28.799> was

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
different I mean yeah that idea was

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.819 
different I mean yeah that idea was
pretty<00:01:29.130> cool<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.470> they<00:01:31.470> don't<00:01:31.619> even

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
pretty cool but it's so they don't even

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.640 
pretty cool but it's so they don't even
try<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.189> making<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:34.049> entertaining

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
try it making it really entertaining

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.350 
try it making it really entertaining
it's<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:35.040> very<00:01:35.310> good<00:01:35.520> at<00:01:35.759> all<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:37.820> yeah<00:01:39.590> it's

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
it's not very good at all and yeah it's

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.670 
it's not very good at all and yeah it's
very<00:01:42.360> uninteresting<00:01:43.140> there's<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.439> lot<00:01:43.590> of

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
very uninteresting there's a lot of

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.929 
very uninteresting there's a lot of
parts<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.340> actually<00:01:44.579> feel<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.820> I

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
parts in this that actually feel like I

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.749 
parts in this that actually feel like I
showed<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
showed you

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.580 
showed you
even<00:01:47.759> though<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.149> supposed<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.780> shown<00:01:49.409> in

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
even though this supposed to be shown in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.620 
even though this supposed to be shown in
four<00:01:49.860> boys<00:01:50.009> even<00:01:50.280> literally<00:01:50.759> says<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.450> boys

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
four boys even literally says for boys

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.940 
four boys even literally says for boys
like<00:01:51.869> all<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> spine<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:55.470> coverage

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
like all in the spine and the coverage

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.499 
like all in the spine and the coverage
yeah<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:57.950> yeah<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.159> think<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.579> problem<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.210> if

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
yeah so yeah I think the problem is if

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.060 
yeah so yeah I think the problem is if
you<00:02:00.570> look<00:02:00.630> at<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.930> names

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.660 

hopefully<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.310> see<00:02:05.490> that

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
hopefully you can see that

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.779 
hopefully you can see that
most<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.850> these<00:02:07.970> names<00:02:08.240> are<00:02:09.460> female<00:02:10.460> first

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
most of these names are female first

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.910 
most of these names are female first
names<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:13.220> they<00:02:13.370> are<00:02:13.490> mostly<00:02:14.090> females<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:15.470> draw

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
names so they are mostly females to draw

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.250 
names so they are mostly females to draw
manga<00:02:16.340> that's<00:02:17.150> supposed<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.450> be<00:02:17.510> for<00:02:17.750> boys<00:02:17.930> I

particular<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:35.270> yeah<00:02:35.630> I'm<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:36.620> making<00:02:37.010> this

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
particular so yeah I'm just making this

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.630 
particular so yeah I'm just making this
video<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.490> say<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.900> nothing<00:02:39.260> special

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
video to say this is nothing special

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.400 
video to say this is nothing special
it's<00:02:40.640> pretty<00:02:41.510> bad<00:02:41.900> actually<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:44.540> quite<00:02:44.900> bad

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
it's pretty bad actually it's quite bad

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.990 
it's pretty bad actually it's quite bad
so<00:02:46.480> yeah<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:48.220> wouldn't<00:02:49.220> get<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.400> first<00:02:49.610> one<00:02:49.820> if

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
so yeah I wouldn't get the first one if

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.670 
so yeah I wouldn't get the first one if
you<00:02:50.090> still<00:02:50.330> want<00:02:50.450> try<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.810> maybe<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.440> third

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
you still want try it maybe the third

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.740 
you still want try it maybe the third
fourth<00:02:52.040> or<00:02:52.190> fifth<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.670> second<00:02:52.940> one<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.239> crazy

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
fourth or fifth the second one is crazy

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.759 
fourth or fifth the second one is crazy
expensive<00:02:54.410> out<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> print<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:55.850> yeah<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:57.560> does

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
expensive out a print so yeah it does

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.150 
expensive out a print so yeah it does
have<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.010> cool<00:02:58.310> fold<00:02:58.820> out<00:02:59.860> illustration<00:03:00.860> so

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
have a cool fold out illustration so

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.910 
have a cool fold out illustration so
that's<00:03:01.340> something<00:03:04.900> but<00:03:05.900> yeah<00:03:06.140> that's<00:03:06.530> pretty

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
that's something but yeah that's pretty

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.720 
that's something but yeah that's pretty
much<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.220> only<00:03:07.280> good<00:03:07.730> thing<00:03:07.940> about<00:03:07.970> this<00:03:09.730> mm

there's like none which is kind of funny

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.550

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
because I that's pretty much the whole

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.789 
because I that's pretty much the whole
basis<00:03:28.310> for<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.840> whole<00:03:30.019> selling<00:03:30.440> point<00:03:30.709> for

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
basis for the whole selling point for

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.690 
basis for the whole selling point for
this<00:03:32.380> anyway<00:03:33.380> yeah<00:03:33.709> I<00:03:33.739> kind<00:03:34.310> of<00:03:34.340> just<00:03:34.459> want<00:03:34.640> to

they said this series was the only one

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.380 
they said this series was the only one
worth<00:03:47.570> buying<00:03:47.989> because<00:03:48.620> it's<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:50.060> know<00:03:50.180> it's

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
worth buying because it's you know it's

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.870 
worth buying because it's you know it's
just<00:03:50.450> like<00:03:50.630> random<00:03:51.079> stories<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:51.769> add<00:03:51.920> add

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
just like random stories that add add

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.420 
just like random stories that add add
add<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:53.420> story<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.840> coke<00:03:54.049> yes<00:03:54.290> but<00:03:54.620> it

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
add to the story of coke yes but it

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.500 
add to the story of coke yes but it
doesn't<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:57.140> far<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.440> guess<00:03:57.739> I'm<00:03:58.430> tempted<00:03:59.269> to

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
doesn't so far I guess I'm tempted to

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.020 
doesn't so far I guess I'm tempted to
get<00:03:59.690> the<00:04:00.079> volume<00:04:00.320> three<00:04:00.799> just<00:04:01.459> because<00:04:01.760> it's<00:04:01.940> a

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
get the volume three just because it's a

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.840 
get the volume three just because it's a
different<00:04:02.239> set<00:04:02.780> of<00:04:02.810> manga<00:04:03.470> cos<00:04:03.680> so<00:04:04.070> it'll

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
different set of manga cos so it'll

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.330 
different set of manga cos so it'll
probably<00:04:04.880> be<00:04:05.360> completely<00:04:05.840> different<00:04:06.340> not

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
probably be completely different not

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.000 
probably be completely different not
sure<00:04:07.610> but<00:04:07.910> volume<00:04:08.420> one<00:04:08.660> not<00:04:09.350> worth<00:04:09.620> buying<00:04:10.540> bad

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
sure but volume one not worth buying bad

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.400 
sure but volume one not worth buying bad
keep<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.220> in<00:04:13.340> mind

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
keep that in mind

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.620 
keep that in mind
peace<00:04:15.410> out
