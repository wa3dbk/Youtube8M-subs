00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
programmed to believe that we have to

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.589 
programmed to believe that we have to
manage<00:00:11.969> our<00:00:12.240> body<00:00:12.570> we<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.309> order<00:00:14.389> what<00:00:15.389> to

do we have to take charge of the body I
don't<00:00:19.350> believe<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.949> think<00:00:20.100> body<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
don't believe so I think body is a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
mistakes if you don't do it now let's

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.759 
mistakes if you don't do it now let's
make<00:00:29.849> an<00:00:30.029> example<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.599> quickly<00:00:30.960> run<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> run

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
make an example I quickly run a run

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.229 
make an example I quickly run a run
around<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.279> poke<00:00:32.579> everybody<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
around and poke everybody and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.930 
around and poke everybody and
everybody's<00:00:33.690> left<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:35.100> my<00:00:35.280> finger<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
everybody's left I with my finger and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.209 
everybody's left I with my finger and
we'll<00:00:36.450> see<00:00:36.750> which<00:00:36.989> eyelid<00:00:37.410> will<00:00:37.590> blink<00:00:37.860> left

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
we'll see which eyelid will blink left

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.470 
we'll see which eyelid will blink left
or<00:00:38.430> right<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.809> we'll<00:00:40.680> see<00:00:40.980> if<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:42.030> could<00:00:42.329> be

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
or right and we'll see if it could be

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.330 
or right and we'll see if it could be
possible<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.170> imagine<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.710> I'll<00:00:43.950> poke

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
possible can you imagine that I'll poke

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.880 
possible can you imagine that I'll poke
an<00:00:44.579> right<00:00:44.879> eye<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.780> left<00:00:45.899> eye<00:00:46.350> will<00:00:46.590> blink

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
an right eye and the left eye will blink

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.200 
an right eye and the left eye will blink
can<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:48.000> possibly<00:00:49.160> know<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.820> correct

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
can that be possibly know the correct

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.240 
can that be possibly know the correct
eyelid<00:00:51.870> will<00:00:52.110> blink<00:00:52.440> without<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.129> even

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
eyelid will blink without you even

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.400 
eyelid will blink without you even
thinking<00:00:53.399> about<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.300> how<00:00:54.809> does<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> body

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
thinking about this how does the body

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.950 
thinking about this how does the body
know<00:00:55.879> can<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.000> answer<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.300> question<00:00:57.449> how

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
know can you answer that question how

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
know can you answer that question how
does<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.230> body<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.760> knows<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
does the body know it knows that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.290 
does the body know it knows that
everything<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.170> needs<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.649> know<00:01:01.910> we<00:01:02.910> think

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
everything it needs to know we think

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.420 
everything it needs to know we think
that<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.439> something<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> body

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
that we have to do something to the body

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.740 
that we have to do something to the body
we<00:01:06.299> should<00:01:06.570> respect<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:09.060> lived<00:01:09.479> on

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
we should respect it it's it it lived on

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.990 
we should respect it it's it it lived on
this<00:01:09.960> planet<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:10.979> many<00:01:11.250> millions<00:01:11.549> of

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this planet for so many millions of

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.230 
this planet for so many millions of
years<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.900> knows<00:01:13.229> everything<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.070> best<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
years it knows everything the best the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
years it knows everything the best the
only<00:01:15.570> thing<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:15.960> could<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:16.530> can

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
only thing we could do is we can

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.219 
only thing we could do is we can
calculate<00:01:17.310> or<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.090> could<00:01:18.270> go<00:01:18.479> against<00:01:19.080> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
calculate or we could go against it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.210 
calculate or we could go against it
which<00:01:20.040> one<00:01:20.250> would<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:21.770> which<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:23.040> would

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
which one would you like which one would

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.219 
which one would you like which one would
you<00:01:23.280> choose<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.390> want<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> conquer<00:01:24.930> it

you choose do you want to conquer it

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770 
you choose do you want to conquer it
with<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.560> body<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
with your body so do it
