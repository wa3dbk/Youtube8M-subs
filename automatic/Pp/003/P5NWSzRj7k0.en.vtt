00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
this is is it's a doc for your two and a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.210 
this is is it's a doc for your two and a
half<00:00:19.260> inch<00:00:19.520> free-agent<00:00:20.520> disk<00:00:20.789> drive<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.220> what

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
half inch free-agent disk drive and what

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.429 
half inch free-agent disk drive and what
it<00:00:23.310> does<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.640> basically<00:00:23.910> turns<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.810> normal

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
it does is it basically turns a normal

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.800 
it does is it basically turns a normal
external<00:00:26.010> hard<00:00:26.189> drive<00:00:26.400> into<00:00:27.269> something

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
external hard drive into something

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.169 
external hard drive into something
resembling<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.740> pretty<00:00:29.220> close<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> network

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
resembling and pretty close to a network

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.410 
resembling and pretty close to a network
attached<00:00:30.539> storage<00:00:30.689> device<00:00:32.000> so<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.059> get<00:00:33.390> your

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
attached storage device so you get your

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.510 
attached storage device so you get your
drive<00:00:33.719> plug<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.500> then<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.190> connect<00:00:35.460> to

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
drive plug it in then you connect to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.990 
drive plug it in then you connect to
your<00:00:35.640> network<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:37.070> you<00:00:38.070> basically<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.700> an<00:00:38.820> S

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
your network and you basically have an S

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.990 
your network and you basically have an S
so<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:40.950> simple<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.850> it's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
so it's a it's really simple but it's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.760 
so it's a it's really simple but it's
actually<00:00:42.480> really<00:00:42.629> cool<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.200> we're<00:00:43.649> going

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
actually really cool and I we're going

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.619 
actually really cool and I we're going
to<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> full<00:00:44.040> review<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:45.030> already<00:00:45.180> read<00:00:45.480> the

to a full review and I already read the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.090 
to a full review and I already read the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
pogoplug but i do want to take a look at
the<00:00:47.219> hardware<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.489> saw<00:00:50.610> some<00:00:50.789> nice

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the hardware here so we saw some nice

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.569 
the hardware here so we saw some nice
new<00:00:51.390> packaging<00:00:54.140> logos<00:00:55.140> or<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> alien<00:00:56.340> type

and then over here we have the dock

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.330 
and then over here we have the dock
itself<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.579> really<00:01:35.579> basic<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:37.340> basically

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
itself it's a really basic and basically

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.319 
itself it's a really basic and basically
what<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:40.049> put<00:01:40.290> your<00:01:40.439> free<00:01:40.950> agent

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
what it is is you put your free agent

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.940 
what it is is you put your free agent
drive<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.659> you'll<00:01:42.990> need<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.200> free<00:01:43.619> agent

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
drive in here you'll need a free agent

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.340 
drive in here you'll need a free agent
go<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> portable<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> 2.5<00:01:46.170> inch

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
go which is a portable the 2.5 inch

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.980 
go which is a portable the 2.5 inch
drive<00:01:46.530> then<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> USB<00:01:48.420> connection

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
drive then you have a USB connection

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.109 
drive then you have a USB connection
here<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.560> long<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> little<00:01:50.130> reset<00:01:50.579> switch<00:01:50.880> on

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
here as long as a little reset switch on

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.219 
here as long as a little reset switch on
the<00:01:51.320> back<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.700> two<00:01:53.700> USB<00:01:54.000> slots<00:01:54.689> which<00:01:55.049> is

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
the back we have two USB slots which is

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.649 
the back we have two USB slots which is
is<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.500> hub<00:01:56.000> power<00:01:57.000> you're<00:01:57.360> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> need

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
is a hub power you're going to need

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.959 
is a hub power you're going to need
power<00:01:57.869> here<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:58.530> Ethernet<00:01:59.009> there's

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
power here and then Ethernet there's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.289 
power here and then Ethernet there's
some<00:02:00.329> cooling<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.090> that's<00:02:03.090> about<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
some cooling here and that's about it

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.490 
some cooling here and that's about it
this<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.509> actually<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.079> thing<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.439> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
this is actually this thing is like a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.280 
this is actually this thing is like a
mini<00:02:04.740> computer<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> little<00:02:06.509> Marvel<00:02:06.840> chip<00:02:07.140> in

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
mini computer as a little Marvel chip in

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.809 
mini computer as a little Marvel chip in
there<00:02:07.439> that's<00:02:07.829> how<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.009> does<00:02:08.190> all<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.459> work<00:02:09.500> so

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
there that's how it does all the work so

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.130 
there that's how it does all the work so
what<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.940> do<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.420> basically<00:02:12.569> plug<00:02:12.989> in

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
what you do is you basically plug in

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.630 
what you do is you basically plug in
your<00:02:13.230> go

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
your go

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.300 
your go
then<00:02:14.720> your<00:02:15.720> YouTube<00:02:16.050> refinements<00:02:16.500> grow<00:02:16.650> you

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
then your YouTube refinements grow you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.460 
then your YouTube refinements grow you
plug<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:18.200> ethernet<00:02:19.200> power<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.900> then<00:02:21.900> what<00:02:22.440> you

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
plug in ethernet power and then what you

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.970 
plug in ethernet power and then what you
could<00:02:22.709> do<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.190> access<00:02:24.180> your<00:02:24.690> drive<00:02:25.050> from

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
could do is access your drive from

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.800 
could do is access your drive from
anywhere<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:27.150> has<00:02:27.180> an<00:02:27.420> internet<00:02:27.720> connection

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
anywhere that has an internet connection

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.610 
anywhere that has an internet connection
using<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:29.489> pogoplug<00:02:29.910> service<00:02:30.660> now<00:02:31.230> seagate

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
using the pogoplug service now seagate

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.759 
using the pogoplug service now seagate
lights<00:02:31.920> licenses<00:02:32.819> service<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.019> could<00:02:34.470> use
