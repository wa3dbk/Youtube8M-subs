00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.230
 all hello with you in touch butt 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:12.030
 down and project healthy nation today i 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.730
 decided to teach you a video format lesson 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.160
 how is beer made so let's 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.900
 analyze the process 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.779
 this is the usual unit for the production of beer 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.910
 here we see that initially 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:29.730
 malt water is loaded 1 tank where 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.840
 malting occurs and so on 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.700
 made an attack undergoes filtering and 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.930
 it turns out wort originally to jesus 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.379
 for beer production 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.489
 tatyana what is the wort brewed to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.230
 certain home condition passes 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.879
 mean next tank where 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.660
 there is a lightening that is it 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.300
 just a sump where all the murk 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.469
 settles to the bottom and so on then 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.739
 it means it goes to the following tanks. 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.720
 where the fermentation process takes place that is 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:10.049
 here already added sugar yeast 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.750
 hops and other ingredients beer 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.450
 and further after the fermentation of beer and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.430
 maturation or filtration 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.970
 there for making light beer either 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.310
 for bottling 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.020
 we are now interested in the process 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.090
 fermentation but on it I would like 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.140
 stay in more detail that is 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.590
 fermentation 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.400
 this is a process that happens by 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.540
 microorganism yeast interactions with 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.299
 sugar yeast eat sugar and 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.159
 it turns out the output they have alcohol that is 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.369
 same as earthworm 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.220
 he i'm off the ground in order to advance 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.860
 further and accordingly where is this land 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.300
 Beats nowhere does she go through 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.580
 back hole back to the ground where already 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.600
 well it turns out recycled too 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.280
 the most yeast 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.430
 means and sugar and passes through 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.390
 and produces alcohol well, and as a side 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.710
 the effect is improved gas there is even 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.610
 certain special technological 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.280
 process 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.740
 invented in france in the province 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.120
 champagne and as you probably so on it 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.260
 about this production process 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.440
 champagne wine 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.830
 special sort of wine is loaded in the dark 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.940
 caves where it is kept for long 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.060
 time then mean this this 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.780
 the room in the cave is added dramatically 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.010
 bright bright light what happens 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.170
 microorganisms get scared naturally not 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.290
 all the dolls are sugar and that way 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.960
 Binary is happening so 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.240
 it turns out that champagne if you 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.920
 remember that well 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.910
 profits breathing creates such powerful 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.180
 the gases that the seams were pulling out the trail we 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.370
 all love to drink for the new year and holidays 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.800
 celebrating a celebration like this 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.640
 way of consuming 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.780
 excrements with gasses then when the beer has passed 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.510
 transfiguration but already coming out almost ready 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:18.220
 either there she goes to filter 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:21.290
 where these corpses are removed from it 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.580
 large poop and so on it turns out 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.970
 light beer at the outlet 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.060
 or it immediately poured into jars bottles 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.580
 with an inscription unfiltered 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.550
 unfiltered it means that's all 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.459
 these here the germs microorganisms their not 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.530
 poop gases and so on all of them 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.820
 are there 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.510
 many bio lovers like it 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.780
 unfiltered beer is just a pipe 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.350
 childhood and also beer is recruited fortress 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.540
 if you leave it on for a short time in 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.010
 dark place well and then Kiev after 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.799
 have developed fall already 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.670
 on store shelves in banks and 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.769
 bottled if you notice then all these 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.670
 banks will be they are not transparent either of 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.010
 dark glass 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.620
 so that the suns do not fall significantly 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.319
 and what is it for in order not to 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.480
 continued the process of decomposition of these 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.860
 organisms in the process and beer is still 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.049
 add hops 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.370
 which specifically give such 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.220
 specific bitterness 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.979
 in order to hide exactly this one 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.350
 smell and taste 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:30.050
 decomposition so hops play very 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.419
 big role in beer to many people 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.139
 like exactly that bitter smell and 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.389
 so on they do not even suspect that 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.010
 just to kill a cadaver 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.410
 smell 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.169
 Well, of course from stores it snik 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.990
 leaves for further consumption and here 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.169
 that very scary and like women and 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.110
 men and children and old people all drink 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:57.260
 beer the English he generally tied up two 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:01.610
 incompatible things are football sport and 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.550
 alcohol and the whole process itself 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.729
 on making beer I tell you which I 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.030
 I wanted to convey to you today all thanks to 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.030
 dating
