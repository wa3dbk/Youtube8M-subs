with another video review and this time

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.260 
with another video review and this time
I<00:00:04.740> have<00:00:04.859> Transformers<00:00:05.790> Dark<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.210> Moon

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
I have Transformers Dark of the Moon

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.950 
I have Transformers Dark of the Moon
Human<00:00:06.960> Alliance<00:00:07.049> Leadfoot<00:00:08.000> I<00:00:09.000> already<00:00:09.719> have

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
Human Alliance Leadfoot I already have

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.629 
Human Alliance Leadfoot I already have
them<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.200> robot<00:00:10.590> mode<00:00:10.620> I'm<00:00:11.130> not<00:00:11.370> going<00:00:11.580> to

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
them in robot mode I'm not going to

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.280 
them in robot mode I'm not going to
focus<00:00:11.790> on<00:00:12.120> transformation<00:00:12.870> because

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
focus on transformation because

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.390 
focus on transformation because
transforming<00:00:14.130> ham<00:00:14.309> was<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> pain<00:00:16.100> and<00:00:17.100> when<00:00:17.369> I

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
transforming ham was a pain and when I

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.400 
transforming ham was a pain and when I
finally<00:00:17.730> did<00:00:18.330> get<00:00:18.510> him<00:00:18.660> transformed<00:00:19.260> into

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
finally did get him transformed into

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.080 
finally did get him transformed into
robot<00:00:19.830> mode<00:00:20.100> he<00:00:20.880> looks<00:00:21.180> nothing<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:23.090> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
robot mode he looks nothing like the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.029 
robot mode he looks nothing like the
official<00:00:24.570> pictures<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:27.380> had<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.470> figure<00:00:28.859> out<00:00:29.010> a

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
official pictures I had to figure out a

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.730 
official pictures I had to figure out a
way<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.730> him<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.570> make<00:00:30.720> him<00:00:30.869> look<00:00:31.019> cool<00:00:31.260> robot

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
way for him to make him look cool robot

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.729 
way for him to make him look cool robot
mode<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.630> had<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.110> because<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
mode I had to do that because the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.049 
mode I had to do that because the
instructions<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:36.469> garbage<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:38.340> make<00:00:38.610> no

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
instructions are garbage they make no

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:39.740 
instructions are garbage they make no
sense

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
sense

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.840 
sense
you<00:00:40.230> start<00:00:40.559> off<00:00:40.680> okay<00:00:42.920> in<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.190> beginning<00:00:44.640> but

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
you start off okay in the beginning but

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.520 
you start off okay in the beginning but
right<00:00:45.090> when<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.840> torso<00:00:46.079> area

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
right when you get to the torso area

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.130 
right when you get to the torso area
it's<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.550> hard<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.270> make<00:00:48.420> sense<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.899> what's

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
it's just hard to make sense of what's

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.360 
it's just hard to make sense of what's
going<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:51.170> plus<00:00:52.170> even<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
going on there and plus even the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.670 
going on there and plus even the
finished<00:00:53.820> picture<00:00:54.980> looks<00:00:55.980> like<00:00:56.129> garbage

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
finished picture looks like garbage

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.900 
finished picture looks like garbage
it<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:59.219> looks<00:00:59.399> unfinished<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:01.020> who<00:01:01.649> knows

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
it just looks unfinished so who knows

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.039 
it just looks unfinished so who knows
what<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.030> were<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.420> forward<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.930> this

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
what they were going forward with this

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.870 
what they were going forward with this
figure<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:06.000> figured<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.810> way<00:01:07.880> that

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
figure so I just figured out a way that

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.429 
figure so I just figured out a way that
works<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.240> me

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
works for me

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.550 
works for me
I<00:01:10.790> have<00:01:11.790> no<00:01:12.180> idea<00:01:12.510> when<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> did<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.140> get<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> this

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
I have no idea when I did to get to this

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.980 
I have no idea when I did to get to this
point<00:01:14.810> but<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.110> looks<00:01:16.320> alright<00:01:17.900> didn't<00:01:18.900> like

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
point but it looks alright didn't like

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.539 
point but it looks alright didn't like
how<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.200> wheels<00:01:19.590> were<00:01:19.920> supposed<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.369> hang

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
how the wheels were supposed to hang

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.840 
how the wheels were supposed to hang
down<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> moved<00:01:21.750> them<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> side<00:01:22.850> what

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
down so I moved them to the side what

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.780 
down so I moved them to the side what
that<00:01:24.060> did<00:01:24.299> do<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:25.320> moved<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.400> doors

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that did do was moved the doors

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.200 
that did do was moved the doors
forward<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.689> little<00:01:27.840> bit<00:01:28.640> that<00:01:29.640> did<00:01:29.820> fill<00:01:30.060> in

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
forward a little bit that did fill in

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.450 
forward a little bit that did fill in
some<00:01:30.420> gaps<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> thought<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.650> was<00:01:31.799> cool<00:01:33.079> I

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
some gaps so I thought that was cool I

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.730 
some gaps so I thought that was cool I
think<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.579> lowered<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.869> shoulders<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> little

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
think I lowered the shoulders a little

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.060 
think I lowered the shoulders a little
bit

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
bit

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.670 
bit
so<00:01:39.030> those<00:01:39.180> arms<00:01:39.540> are<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.229> lower<00:01:40.439> position

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
so those arms are in a lower position

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.160 
so those arms are in a lower position
than<00:01:41.159> normal<00:01:44.390> which<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.479> think<00:01:45.720> makes<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:45.990> look

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
than normal which I think makes it look

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.980 
than normal which I think makes it look
a<00:01:46.200> little<00:01:46.409> bit<00:01:46.619> better<00:01:47.460> proportioned<00:01:50.990> have

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
a little bit better proportioned have

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.709 
a little bit better proportioned have
these<00:01:52.350> going<00:01:52.950> sideways<00:01:55.189> don't<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.450> gaps

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
these going sideways don't like the gaps

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.639 
these going sideways don't like the gaps
in<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.469> back<00:01:59.000> but<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.869> don't<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
in the back but I really don't like the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.740 
in the back but I really don't like the
gap

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.320 

halfway<00:02:05.380> through<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:06.160> waste<00:02:06.400> it<00:02:06.850> just<00:02:07.120> looks

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
halfway through the waste it just looks

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.770 
halfway through the waste it just looks
like<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:09.190> supposed<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.760> fold<00:02:10.000> in<00:02:10.270> more<00:02:10.510> but

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
like it's supposed to fold in more but

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.620 
like it's supposed to fold in more but
it<00:02:10.900> doesn't<00:02:11.290> I'm<00:02:11.620> not<00:02:12.280> sure<00:02:12.460> why<00:02:12.700> they

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
it doesn't I'm not sure why they

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.100 
it doesn't I'm not sure why they
couldn't<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.050> fold<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.800> more<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.720> piece

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
couldn't just fold it in more this piece

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.850 
couldn't just fold it in more this piece
tabs<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.400> nothing<00:02:19.290> if<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.440> lift<00:02:20.740> it<00:02:20.860> up<00:02:22.860> there's

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
tabs to nothing if I lift it up there's

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:31.620 
tabs to nothing if I lift it up there's
a<00:02:24.210> gap<00:02:25.210> and<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:26.560> tab<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:28.270> here<00:02:30.090> somewhere<00:02:31.090> and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
a gap and a tab in here somewhere and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.960 
a gap and a tab in here somewhere and
they're<00:02:32.500> supposed<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.950> connect<00:02:33.370> but<00:02:33.520> doesn't

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
they're supposed to connect but doesn't

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.460 
they're supposed to connect but doesn't
really<00:02:34.710> hold<00:02:35.710> together<00:02:36.900> what's<00:02:37.900> holding<00:02:38.350> it

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
really hold together what's holding it

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.730 
really hold together what's holding it
together<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:39.460> friction<00:02:42.960> by<00:02:43.960> this<00:02:44.020> joint<00:02:44.560> I

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
together is friction by this joint I

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.860 
together is friction by this joint I
think<00:02:48.420> so

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
think so

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.620 
think so
who<00:02:50.560> knows<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:52.030> not<00:02:52.180> sure<00:02:52.360> what's<00:02:52.570> supposed

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
who knows I'm not sure what's supposed

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.920 
who knows I'm not sure what's supposed
to<00:02:52.900> happen<00:02:52.990> with<00:02:53.350> this<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:53.890> just<00:02:54.130> keep<00:02:54.310> them

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
to happen with this so I just keep them

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.100 
to happen with this so I just keep them
facing<00:02:55.930> backwards<00:02:56.850> because<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:58.330> lowered<00:02:58.990> the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
facing backwards because I lowered the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.980 
facing backwards because I lowered the
shoulders<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.680> have<00:02:59.860> these<00:03:00.130> kind<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.990> going

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
shoulders I have these kind of going

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:09.949 
shoulders I have these kind of going
back<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> little<00:03:02.560> bit<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:08.440> was<00:03:08.620> just<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.980> pain

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
back a little bit so it was just a pain

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.550 
back a little bit so it was just a pain
transforming<00:03:10.959> it<00:03:11.110> into<00:03:11.920> robot<00:03:12.459> mode<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.780> do

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
transforming it into robot mode I do

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.920 
transforming it into robot mode I do
like<00:03:14.830> it<00:03:15.010> it's<00:03:15.850> just<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.390> transformation

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
like it it's just the transformation

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.699 
like it it's just the transformation
just<00:03:17.800> was<00:03:17.920> not<00:03:18.070> fun

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
just was not fun

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.570 
just was not fun
he<00:03:20.709> does<00:03:20.950> look<00:03:21.190> cool<00:03:21.400> with<00:03:22.170> Roadbuster

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
he does look cool with Roadbuster

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.920 
he does look cool with Roadbuster
so<00:03:24.580> if<00:03:24.760> they<00:03:24.910> make<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.120> topspin<00:03:25.750> I'll

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
so if they make a topspin I'll

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.979 
so if they make a topspin I'll
definitely<00:03:26.320> get<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.770> complete<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.989> but

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
definitely get that to complete it but

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.900 
definitely get that to complete it but
even<00:03:29.380> Roadbuster<00:03:29.920> was<00:03:30.310> kind<00:03:30.520> of<00:03:30.580> a<00:03:30.670> pain<00:03:30.880> to

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
even Roadbuster was kind of a pain to

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.900 
even Roadbuster was kind of a pain to
transform<00:03:31.510> into<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.810> robot<00:03:31.870> mode<00:03:32.489> so<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.519> doubt

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
transform into a robot mode so I doubt

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.120 
transform into a robot mode so I doubt
I'll<00:03:34.120> be<00:03:34.150> transforming<00:03:34.930> either<00:03:35.140> of<00:03:35.350> them<00:03:35.470> into

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
I'll be transforming either of them into

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.350 
I'll be transforming either of them into
car<00:03:36.370> mode<00:03:37.500> ever<00:03:38.500> again<00:03:41.970> but<00:03:42.970> they<00:03:43.060> do<00:03:43.180> look

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
car mode ever again but they do look

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.979 
car mode ever again but they do look
cool<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:44.590> good<00:03:45.070> net<00:03:47.190> just<00:03:48.690> be<00:03:49.690> we're

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
cool a good net just be we're

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.620 
cool a good net just be we're
transforming<00:03:50.709> him<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.310> try<00:03:51.519> to<00:03:51.550> find<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:52.030> way

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.420 

to<00:03:55.630> put<00:03:55.840> all<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.140> pieces<00:03:56.350> into<00:03:56.739> whatever

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
to put all the pieces into whatever

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.190 
to put all the pieces into whatever
configuration<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:58.480> like<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:01.060> doesn't<00:04:01.450> seem

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
configuration you like it doesn't seem

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.910 
configuration you like it doesn't seem
like<00:04:02.470> there's<00:04:03.450> one<00:04:04.450> official<00:04:05.170> way<00:04:05.350> of<00:04:05.530> doing

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
like there's one official way of doing

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.009 
like there's one official way of doing
it<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.790> pieces<00:04:07.360> just<00:04:07.510> kind<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:07.840> go

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
it and the pieces just kind of go

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.210 
it and the pieces just kind of go
anywhere<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:09.459> want<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.850> to

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.510 

just<00:04:13.060> good<00:04:13.870> luck<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:14.440> mean<00:04:15.040> that's<00:04:15.190> all<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.370> can

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
just good luck I mean that's all I can

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.990 
just good luck I mean that's all I can
say<00:04:15.670> I<00:04:17.160> have<00:04:18.160> all<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.610> Human<00:04:18.910> Alliance

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
say I have all the Human Alliance

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.810 
say I have all the Human Alliance
figures<00:04:19.570> -<00:04:19.840> sideswipe<00:04:20.650> he<00:04:21.100> just<00:04:21.579> look<00:04:21.700> like

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
figures - sideswipe he just look like

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.290 
figures - sideswipe he just look like
garbage<00:04:22.030> so<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.020> passed<00:04:23.350> on<00:04:23.560> him<00:04:26.550> but<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.760> do<00:04:27.940> plan

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
garbage so I passed on him but I do plan

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.950 
garbage so I passed on him but I do plan
on<00:04:28.360> getting<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:30.070> remaining<00:04:30.550> ones<00:04:30.960> with

on getting the remaining ones with

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.620 
on getting the remaining ones with
something<00:04:32.230> they're<00:04:32.380> not<00:04:32.500> garbage<00:04:32.970> but<00:04:33.970> again

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
something they're not garbage but again

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.760 
something they're not garbage but again
if<00:04:34.780> you're<00:04:34.900> getting<00:04:35.020> too<00:04:35.320> Human<00:04:35.710> Alliance

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
if you're getting too Human Alliance
