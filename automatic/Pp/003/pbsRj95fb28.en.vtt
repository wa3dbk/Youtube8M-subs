extracted so for example here you just
go<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.700> file<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.850> say<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
go to I file and say it's in this is the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.590

thing<00:01:43.649> where<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.790> put<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.000> texture<00:01:45.360> packs

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
thing where you put your texture packs

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.460 
thing where you put your texture packs
you<00:01:45.810> don't<00:01:45.990> need<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> go<00:01:46.290> knife<00:01:46.530> I'll<00:01:46.770> do<00:01:47.040> that

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
you don't need to go knife I'll do that

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.469 
you don't need to go knife I'll do that
let's<00:01:49.470> say<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.799> had<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> zip<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.820> don't<00:01:51.329> have<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
let's say you had a zip I don't have a

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.830 
let's say you had a zip I don't have a
zip<00:01:51.810> file<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:52.979> click<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.090> you'd

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
zip file you just click on it and you'd

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.740 
zip file you just click on it and you'd
say<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.259> archiver<00:01:55.770> said<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.939> extract<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
say on archiver said you extract it and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.289 
say on archiver said you extract it and
then<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.920> would<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.070> your<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.090> know

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
then you would have your you know

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.039 
then you would have your you know
texture<00:02:01.170> pack<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.340> do<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.610> first

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
texture pack you have to do that first

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.719 
texture pack you have to do that first
very<00:02:04.049> literally<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.680> touch<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.219> like<00:02:05.520> that

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
very literally just touch it like that

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.609 
very literally just touch it like that
but<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.119> would<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.360> sip<00:02:06.659> file<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.439> don't

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
but it would be a sip file and you don't

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.660 
but it would be a sip file and you don't
archive<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.129> yes<00:02:09.170> once<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.319> do<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:11.640> just

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
archive it yes once you do that you just

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.140 
archive it yes once you do that you just
