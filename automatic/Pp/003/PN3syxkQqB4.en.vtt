00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.639
 And there, folks, beauty rafael is not here.

 few days the girl with six days to 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.150
 Launching online and going home will take time. 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.130

 day 20 is that 21 do not know but even 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.870
 so I decide then you have to wait a 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.120
 little but really I'm waiting 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.160
 I hope this game is a play. 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.980
 and I'm out there nobody plate banfield text 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.629
 talks about why it is that both in 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.340
 first opened against the second open 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.780
 the game was very similar remembered 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.059
 much less than 3 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.129
 not only by mz 3 but also type a 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.170
 gameplay I remember was 3 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.260
 the entire movement mode 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.789
 bibliography of 13 leaves very happy for 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.829
 to have made 3 to 1 in an incredible game to 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.420
 if playing is still an incredible game 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.070
 But unfortunately we do not have there. 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.070
 both the servers how can I go 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.520
 for you with several maps but you but 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.420
 talca think our channel and not mgm 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.950
 there are many servers there rush with 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.189
 different maps with paints good I 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.780
 I say in a few and the Brazilian and many 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.750
 friends, gringos are getting there. 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.150
 people who have ping to the touch is not all 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.280
 country that the server is surrounded by 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.079
 there it goes then complicates a little there 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.509
 play a beautiful kick 3 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.869
 but the time went out alone there with 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.100
 150 ping for you to enjoy and was the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.619
 I did not having the server and to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.210
 play a little bit and this is my wait and 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.600
 overcame the online diary that hit a 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.189
 Good time really has been a long time. 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.950
 I do not play bf 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.740
 Let's say that as much will as I 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.720
 I played in the beta version of beans is open 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.770
 since who accompanied me there while 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.149
 I used to play those who have added 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.350
 Did you notice how much I played in the home? 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.990
 I played a lot of time open and I 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.640
 enjoy hell she was going over and 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.099
 many matches many the game 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.740
 simply mo fei while I was 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.080
 rolling that peta version 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.640
 to play it was very good still 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.440
 well, they do not just want proof as 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.350
 right around the time that he had nothing 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.890
 so it was very good, and I hope 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.950
 now that the final version of the game is already 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.250
 as good as it was beta 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.020
 because if it's good when it 's so good 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.730
 the goal is going to be a game that will 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.220
 bring a lot of commitment to you 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.010
 You'll make lots of tips there a lot. 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.080
 cool damn thing 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.820
 nothing better than my cool son 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.650
 need to play as you have seen I said 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.620
 that delay anyone play with a review 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.290
 Give the pet number 24 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.330
 besides solving bring this game play 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.580
 want to change the way the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.890
 that I do things then province 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.200
 will be one of the last to come out that 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.870
 It's what I say about it and I'm not going 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.260
 really bring e and play to see the end 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.850
 four days a review of the pets I 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.980
 I did not like the pet or anything 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.080
 kind you think you're are not legal 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.630
 What are we going to do this? 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.970
 there are a lot of people who think the game is perfect 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.080
 good if they think they are of opinion and 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.000
 The moment I say it is not 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.290
 perfect staff do not respect the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.990
 opinion that beautiful ends up 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.910
 finished off in the bag too much khan 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.650
 so I preferred neither to do gameplay 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.330
 talking about pet will survive pet 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.580
 and I just talked about some things 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.790
 cool stuff that I thought was put on the 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.520
 internet was the change of colors there 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.070
 from above miraÃ­ ads tal from vehicles 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.930
 That sort of thing, I thought it was cool. 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.910
 post but now you just reviewed it talking 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.370
 giving negative points and maybe not 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.200
 Talk because you know what the guy looks like. 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.590
 begins to be a fan boy that we are with 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.700
 Too much so I'm out of there and I'm going 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.100
 try to do the same thing number 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.870
 watch and find something that is 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.720
 Bad I will not say it's bad I'll 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.580
 always say that I 'm not even going to talk 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.590
 because sometimes people do not know 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.720
 opinion end up bothering me 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.910
 so I'd rather not talk, it would be better 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.950
 Do not even talk, just play and bring 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.620
 Tips for people there and I think I come 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.680
 more so than giving a review and 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.600
 said that something is bad and such 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.860
 the staff finishes filling the bag for this 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.220
 it's good 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.300
 As you know, I know I'm going to have to 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.190
 wait another day 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.590
 20 because it still has nine companies 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.419
 aggravated from the beta has a lot 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.830
 but actually, not even if I wanted to 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.930
 betting there will not be time to 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.639
 post all of them because I played like 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.220
 said jorge quite a lot I have a lot 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.009
 much shared sharing and these 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.069
 matches that have kept out should 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:50.069
 give at least 1 100 cent say of 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.960
 Recorded game is more or less that way 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:54.120
 I have you got an idea of when 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.270
 matches that I have there in my hd is 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.449
 very much match so I'll bring 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.009
 Some people even there until I can 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.770
 put my hands on the game and start 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.259
 to party to be able to talk about 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.060
 some things I've seen while I have not 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.729
 I'm playing while I'm alone. 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.740
 watching the staff play or something 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.710
 So, let's see how it goes. 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.110
 know this number field my predictions 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.060
 that I was perceiving the field I understand that 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.940
 they are serious about maps 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.879
 not working seriously in the game 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.949
 I believe that the game will really have a 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:32.190
 game mode cool game mode for se 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.810
 play will have a map well made have been 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.080
 of a well done leading well done 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.000
 even legal maps to play because only 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.039
 by the beards I saw legal tender 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.240
 so the maps there are interesting 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.849
 you may have a 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.490
 competitive beautiful cool kick and radio 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.500
 online and there is the game mode 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.870
 interesting for competitive as for 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.449
 example, a competition of the same size as 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.449
 profile by the end of three or even 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:00.000
 these new competitive and 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:02.270
 if I create in the game and I do not really have 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.919
 a lot of faith in competitive ways because 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.509
 certain competitive modes like this that 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.729
 they put it, I think the maps have to 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.219
 be made especially for them 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.949
 thinking of these modes there not only 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:16.770
 take a map session and cut it out and 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.990
 put like that competitive lap map 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.629
 competitive mode every way is prosek in the 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.120
 if the process that is map mode looks 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:27.419
 Calling think here in Brazil and 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.789
 way to rescue the hostages then let's go 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.590
 see I hope it's legal I hope 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:33.960
 is wrong that the maps are well 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.940
 made out and the game is a 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.130
 success and that we have many 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.020
 videos of hair the day online that you 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.070
 wait for this now 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.790
 A hug until the 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.790
 talking one
