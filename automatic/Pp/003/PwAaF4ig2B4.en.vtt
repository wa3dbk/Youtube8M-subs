from<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> brand<00:01:00.570> deliver<00:01:00.930> Island<00:01:01.500> which<00:01:01.710> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
from the brand deliver Island which is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.979 
from the brand deliver Island which is
like<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:03.090> reason<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.449> liked<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:03.930> much

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
like this the reason I liked it so much

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.469 
like this the reason I liked it so much
is<00:01:04.290> because<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.949> kind<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.280> dressy<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.299> it's

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
is because it's kind of dressy but it's

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.899 
is because it's kind of dressy but it's
simple<00:01:06.869> at<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> same<00:01:07.200> time<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.740> since<00:01:07.950> summer

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
simple at the same time and since summer

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
simple at the same time and since summer
is<00:01:09.150> rapidly<00:01:09.570> approaching<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.229> figured<00:01:10.560> this

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
is rapidly approaching I figured this

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.080 
is rapidly approaching I figured this
would<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.920> good<00:01:11.130> way<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.369> kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.729> dress<00:01:11.909> up

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
would be a good way to kind of dress up

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.210 
would be a good way to kind of dress up
a<00:01:12.210> bit<00:01:12.240> without<00:01:12.540> being<00:01:12.930> excruciating<00:01:13.890> me<00:01:13.979> hot

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
a bit without being excruciating me hot

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.399 
a bit without being excruciating me hot
and<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:15.030> fact<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.479> sleeve<00:01:15.780> roll<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:16.259> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and the fact that the sleeve roll up I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
and the fact that the sleeve roll up I
thought<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.770> was<00:01:16.860> pretty<00:01:16.979> cool<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.700> it's

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
white sparrow's flying around it I

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.370 
white sparrow's flying around it I
thought<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.090> was<00:03:00.239> pretty<00:03:00.420> cool<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
thought it was pretty cool that the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.080 
thought it was pretty cool that the
print<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.799> what<00:03:01.950> attacked<00:03:02.280> attracted<00:03:02.850> me<00:03:02.940> to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
print is what attacked attracted me to

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.250 
print is what attacked attracted me to
it<00:03:03.120> because<00:03:03.329> i<00:03:03.390> don't<00:03:03.570> own<00:03:03.660> anything<00:03:03.989> like

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
it because i don't own anything like

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.349 
it because i don't own anything like
this<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.799> i<00:03:04.829> thought<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.130> was<00:03:05.190> really<00:03:05.519> like<00:03:06.299> a

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
this so i thought it was really like a

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.390 
this so i thought it was really like a
breath<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.930> fresh<00:03:06.989> air<00:03:07.470> something<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.250> could

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
breath of fresh air something that could

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.920

metallic<00:03:38.620> color<00:03:38.830> ones<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:39.370> they're<00:03:39.820> kind<00:03:39.910> of

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
metallic color ones and they're kind of

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.180

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
hard to incorporate into many outfits so

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.130 
hard to incorporate into many outfits so
I<00:03:42.550> figured<00:03:43.270> since<00:03:43.450> you<00:03:43.570> know<00:03:43.690> these<00:03:43.840> are<00:03:43.900> all

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
I figured since you know these are all

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.600 
I figured since you know these are all
black<00:03:44.380> with<00:03:44.890> black<00:03:45.160> goes<00:03:45.370> with<00:03:45.400> everything

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
black with black goes with everything

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.300 
black with black goes with everything
that<00:03:46.450> will<00:03:46.540> be<00:03:46.660> easier<00:03:47.020> to<00:03:47.080> wear<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.530> feel<00:03:48.220> like

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
that will be easier to wear I feel like

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.890 
that will be easier to wear I feel like
I'm<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.790> lot<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.060> money<00:03:49.090> right<00:03:49.390> now<00:03:49.510> they<00:03:49.780> will

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
I'm a lot of money right now they will

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.110 
I'm a lot of money right now they will
match<00:03:50.260> perfectly<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:51.100> these<00:03:51.550> are<00:03:51.610> pretty<00:03:51.850> cool

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
match perfectly so these are pretty cool

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.320
