00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.750
 hello dear friends dear 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.359
 colleagues with you svetlana falcon 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.060
 you are on my channel and welcome i 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.660
 once already shot a master class 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.270
 I have one color gel varnish 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.610
 already told you you can go by 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.489
 link which I leave under the video and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.890
 watch this workshop I did on 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.789
 pens and you can see how this 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.789
 gel polish 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.969
 I have only one look on the handles 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.949
 color if I find a link to the Internet 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.500
 shop must also leave under 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.440
 video 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.850
 This is the trademark number of color and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.610
 Miguel 018 and I ordered only one 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.930
 because it didn't seem like it was that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.170
 are on site 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.750
 they almost resemble each other and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.619
 differ in some small and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.560
 nuances 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.290
 For the experiment, I took this one 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.850
 this gel polish also has two of these 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.140
 sprocket magnet 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.909
 and oblique lines there is another magnetic 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.920
 the system I bought it in another 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.310
 online store it is cheap 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.680
 here are three magnets and she 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.979
 more comfortable in the work you do not need 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.420
 will be hung to keep the magnet and you 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.030
 install client finger on 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.880
 special substrate and install 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.340
 magnet and keep it on the same 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.700
 distance about the same time 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.119
 for example i am reading up to 25 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.729
 then removing the magnet and fixing it in 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.070
 the lamp here on the samples I put two 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.070
 layer 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.450
 1 layer applied and listening and then 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.270
 the second layer my carried 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.580
 and applied magnetic system magnets 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.340
 is there any visible on camera that is 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.950
 small little red sparkles but they 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.740
 somehow barely barely noticeable and do not rush into 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.820
 eyes i have customers who love 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.090
 soft low-key colors and I suggested 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.970
 they are such a gel lacquer most 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.060
 of them immediately see the light talked about not 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.100
 Nanda what is he gray uninteresting but 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.380
 after i applied magnetic 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.989
 systems were all satisfied 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.080
 left saying just did not expect that 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.230
 such a beautiful effect will turn out and when 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.620
 came and again for the correction then every 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.100
 of them talked about that and acquaintances 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.580
 colleagues at work everyone noticed this 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.580
 unusual design and did a lot a lot 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.220
 compliments so i recommend you 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.160
 purchase at least one such color and 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.620
 try why am i right now 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.930
 fixated on this gel polish and 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.950
 now he talks on it first 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.430
 it dries in ice lamp and ultraviolet 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.190
 lamp 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.650
 he doesn't have enough stickiness even 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.720
 you can not overlap the finish but I'm still 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.120
 overlap he removed method 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.459
 dissolving well worn like on 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.950
 natural and artificial 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.850
 nails and now i want you 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.220
 demonstrate the effect of which can 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.160
 to say she invented herself nowhere 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.370
 looked well hope you like it 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.160
 You can diversify and offer more 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.920
 more interesting designs 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.380
 it is with this magnetic varnish with this 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.470
 You can get a magnetic varnish like this 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.900
 the effect in my opinion is global 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.200
 different from what I showed you 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.540
 Initially , such an effect 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.189
 here 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.859
 For example, I think many of you 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:05.010
 guess what you can use these 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.829
 designs how to wear them yourself 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.069
 and how the basics of pore design and how are they 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.260
 let's do the same with you 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.510
 do some of these leg. 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.130
 I will use gel polish trading 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.549
 brand formula pro 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.440
 number 206 you can use any 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.740
 gel polishes can use gel 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.919
 paint all you like land in the lamp 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.349
 2 minutes dried gel Polish it does not have 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.199
 residual stickiness but i still 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.509
 patrolman is ready to degrease 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.720
 can be wiped with alcohol 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:42.389
 determine the means for degreasing 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.300
 nails without acetone before applying 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:52.970
 gel varnish you mix it well 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.970
 now put a thin layer on the nail 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.450
 but carrying a magnetic gel polish and now 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:16.680
 apply magnet set magnet like 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:22.470
 can be lower and try not to move it out 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.980
 side to side I notice about 35 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.980
 seconds 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:32.810
 land in the lamp 2 minutes will perform another 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.990
 the sample with the help of such a bright 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.580
 neon color 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.090
 mozart house which is called and 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.300
 Neon green nail on the camera is not 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.720
 looks so bright like in life on 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.710
 In fact it is much brighter and on the street 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.830
 will be even brighter but nevertheless I will put 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:58.720
 2 thin layer applied a second color 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:03.740
 bright gel and now take off 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:08.810
 residual sticky don't let you scare 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:11.510
 the fact that I remove the stickiness is no 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:15.400
 way will not affect wearing 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:25.610
 leg . now do not carry a thin layer 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:27.860
 magnetic gel polish in this case like me 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.410
 already said i used green gel 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.060
 so dissolve this mega points not 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.870
 it will turn out to be necessary 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.990
 file down and so i recommend already on 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.100
 simulated 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:43.100
 nails cause such a design caused 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.100
 magnetic gel polish and now use 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.540
 I hold the magnet for about 35 seconds 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.540
 Magnet need foot . 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.520
 dry in the lamp for 2 minutes dried both feet 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.400
 . 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.400
 as the gel varnish residual moment 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.360
 stickiness and it can not overlap 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.690
 gel finish 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.020
 it's up to you the brighter 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.890
 will be the basis the brighter your 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.280
 nail 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:18.580
 and as I said this visa you can 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.580
 wear as yourself so 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.670
 use under the basis for the design of the 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.200
 on top you can now anything 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.570
 draw or are you kind of ark if you 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.120
 I liked this master class and it turned out 

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.490
