definitely a little heavier than a lot
of<00:00:47.070> shafts<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.940> I'd<00:00:48.360> rather<00:00:48.539> play<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:48.930> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.560 
of shafts but I'd rather play with a
heavy<00:00:49.170> shaft<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.820> won't<00:00:51.059> bend<00:00:51.360> or

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
heavy shaft then a that won't bend or

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.799 
heavy shaft then a that won't bend or

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
because this is probably used for the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.750 
because this is probably used for the
rest<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.570> my<00:01:12.689> life<00:01:13.159> so<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> way

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
rest of my life so I really like the way

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.390 
rest of my life so I really like the way
the<00:01:14.909> shaft<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.540> know<00:01:15.659> these<00:01:16.200> two<00:01:16.979> years<00:01:17.250> in

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the shaft is you know these two years in

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.480 
the shaft is you know these two years in
college<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:18.409> think<00:01:19.409> he's<00:01:19.710> made<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> through<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
college I think he's made it through and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.670 
college I think he's made it through and
that's<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.390> good<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.990> been<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.320> not

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
that's really good for not been and not

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
that's really good for not been and not
breaking<00:01:22.979> because<00:01:23.850> said<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.119> went<00:01:24.299> through<00:01:24.390> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
breaking because said I went through a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.810 
breaking because said I went through a
bunch<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.720> sticks<00:01:24.960> before<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.820> ruler

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
bunch of sticks before that so ruler

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.760 
bunch of sticks before that so ruler
like<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> Evo<00:01:28.170> Ti<00:01:28.350> so

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
like this and really like the Evo Ti so

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.399 
like this and really like the Evo Ti so
my<00:01:28.979> other<00:01:29.130> stick<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.850> exactly<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> same<00:01:30.810> I

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
my other stick is exactly the same I

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.630 
my other stick is exactly the same I
always<00:01:31.860> think<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.130> important<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.579> your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
always think it's important to have your

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.039 
always think it's important to have your
backups<00:01:33.090> taking<00:01:33.450> your<00:01:33.600> starter<00:01:33.840> stick

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
backups taking your starter stick

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.960

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
defensive shaft so if you like if you

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.569 
defensive shaft so if you like if you
like<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> light<00:02:55.200> chef<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:55.799> would<00:02:56.159> recommend

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
like a light chef and I would recommend

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.729 
like a light chef and I would recommend
it<00:02:56.700> but<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.900> know<00:02:57.989> light<00:02:58.200> was<00:02:58.349> never<00:02:58.530> really

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
it but you know light was never really

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.140 
it but you know light was never really
too<00:02:58.859> important<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> me<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.459> didn't<00:02:59.790> think<00:02:59.969> that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
too important to me I didn't think that

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.089 
too important to me I didn't think that
a<00:03:00.180> couple<00:03:00.870> ounces<00:03:01.079> would<00:03:01.469> it<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.799> know<00:03:01.889> make<00:03:02.069> a

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
a couple ounces would it you know make a

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.309 
a couple ounces would it you know make a
