00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.850 

wearing<00:03:58.980> visual<00:03:59.310> okay<00:03:59.580> is<00:04:00.510> not<00:04:00.780> my<00:04:01.050> thing<00:04:01.110> but

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
wearing visual okay is not my thing but

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.490 
wearing visual okay is not my thing but
I<00:04:01.920> really<00:04:02.220> like<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:03.360> sounds<00:04:04.349> like<00:04:04.470> a

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
I really like it it sounds like a

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.070 
I really like it it sounds like a
costume<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.190> me<00:04:05.310> but<00:04:05.610> it's<00:04:05.730> not<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.150> costume<00:04:06.840> and

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
costume to me but it's not a costume and

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.690 
costume to me but it's not a costume and
I<00:04:07.140> think<00:04:07.319> that's<00:04:07.500> an<00:04:07.620> important<00:04:08.129> point<00:04:08.489> to

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
I think that's an important point to

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.600 
I think that's an important point to
make<00:04:09.000> is<00:04:09.299> that<00:04:09.930> if<00:04:10.530> fashion<00:04:11.010> doesn't<00:04:11.370> reflect

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
make is that if fashion doesn't reflect

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.140 
make is that if fashion doesn't reflect
you<00:04:12.090> then<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:12.900> isn't<00:04:13.049> right<00:04:13.650> for<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:14.280> if<00:04:15.090> you

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
you then it isn't right for you if you

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.280 
you then it isn't right for you if you
don't<00:04:15.330> feel<00:04:15.450> comfortable<00:04:15.629> you<00:04:15.959> don't<00:04:16.109> feel

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
don't feel comfortable you don't feel

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.780 
don't feel comfortable you don't feel
like<00:04:16.380> it's<00:04:16.500> channeling<00:04:16.919> yourself<00:04:17.310> then<00:04:17.579> try

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
like it's channeling yourself then try

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.849 
like it's channeling yourself then try
something<00:04:17.850> different<00:04:18.290> visual<00:04:19.290> kei<00:04:19.440> differs

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
something different visual kei differs

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.250 
something different visual kei differs
from<00:04:20.070> Lolita<00:04:20.549> in<00:04:20.699> that<00:04:20.880> it's<00:04:21.150> really<00:04:21.479> heavily

from Lolita in that it's really heavily

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.070 
from Lolita in that it's really heavily

inspired by the music scene whereas Lea
is<00:04:25.320> kind<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.650> focused<00:04:25.979> around<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.310> community<00:04:26.760> I

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.700 
is kind of focused around a community I
think<00:04:26.940> that<00:04:27.300> visual<00:04:27.750> kei<00:04:27.900> artists<00:04:28.410> are<00:04:28.500> kind

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
think that visual kei artists are kind

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.650 
think that visual kei artists are kind
of<00:04:28.770> on<00:04:29.040> their<00:04:29.490> own<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:30.090> it's<00:04:30.180> rare<00:04:30.389> that<00:04:30.419> they

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
of on their own and it's rare that they

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.650 
of on their own and it's rare that they
find<00:04:30.900> another<00:04:31.580> visual<00:04:32.580> kei<00:04:32.789> person<00:04:33.300> at<00:04:33.479> least
