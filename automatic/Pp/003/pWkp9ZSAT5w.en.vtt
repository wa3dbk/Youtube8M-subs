it<00:00:18.300> much<00:00:18.539> advantage<00:00:18.900> from<00:00:19.199> technology<00:00:19.529> as

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
it much advantage from technology as

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
fishing that River are you can only fish

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.550 
fishing that River are you can only fish
upstream<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.119> must<00:01:12.299> only<00:01:12.570> use<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> dry<00:01:13.260> fly

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560

and<00:01:13.890> having<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.760> clear<00:01:15.030> floating<00:01:15.750> fly<00:01:16.020> line

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
and having a clear floating fly line

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.200 
and having a clear floating fly line
gives<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.619> an<00:01:16.710> advantage<00:01:16.970> because<00:01:17.970> it's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
gives you an advantage because it's

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.990

line<00:01:55.439> they're<00:01:55.770> ridged<00:01:56.189> which<00:01:57.000> is

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
line they're ridged which is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.359 
line they're ridged which is
longitudinal<00:01:58.020> grooves<00:01:58.320> going<00:01:58.770> down<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.159> line

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
longitudinal grooves going down the line

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.190 
longitudinal grooves going down the line
which<00:01:59.610> helps<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.180> line<00:02:00.329> slide<00:02:00.719> better<00:02:01.049> than

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
which helps the line slide better than

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.950 
which helps the line slide better than
the<00:02:01.290> guides<00:02:01.500> they're<00:02:02.189> also<00:02:02.549> looped<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the guides they're also looped so the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.929 
the guides they're also looped so the
front<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.409> line<00:02:04.469> has<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> nice<00:02:05.310> loop<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:05.909> it

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
front of this line has a nice loop on it

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.730 
front of this line has a nice loop on it
so<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.450> easily<00:02:06.630> change<00:02:06.869> your<00:02:07.380> leaders

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
so you can easily change your leaders

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.919 
so you can easily change your leaders
and<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.640> rear<00:02:08.910> loop<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.420> these<00:02:09.629> lines
