 on the subway victory work is boiling before the subway 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.299
 builders worth one of the most important 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.710
 tasks to cover the station after that 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.260
 will already take up the rails 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.719
 electrification cladding however works 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.490
 already done in debt finish building the metro 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.120
 planned by selling the stadium 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.010
 metalhead 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.810
 most of the funds are 400 million 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.529
 hryvnia should go exactly on 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.480
 subway 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.039
 however, the new stadium owner 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.400
 Sergey Kurchenko transferred to the budget 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.769
 areas only advance 97 million of them 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.480
 on the subway and even less than 37 million 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.579
 and they are already spent 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.260
 they have already mastered we already 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.250
 Looking forward to receiving the next 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.550
 tranche you urgently need we work 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.070
 do ahead of time to enrollment 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:51.210
 we need about 50 in December 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:54.239
 million hryvnia now we are finished from 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.640
 the work of those 37 million who suggested 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.370
 and we are already working 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.870
 builders to the customer will come out 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.850
 however, confidence that the new tranche 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.920
 metro builders will get no primary 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.720
 the amount has not been transferred to the budget 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.549
 reason for claims filed against 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.740
 regional council which requires to recognize 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.020
 deal invalid one of the plaintiffs 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.820
 Kharkov organization Kharkov 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.470
 regional assistance committee 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.900
 invalid of the Great Patriotic War 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.030
 other categories and groups and chair 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.280
 Vladimir told by phone attend 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.720
 that the reason for filing a claim was disagreement 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.460
 veterans with the fact that the communal 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.840
 the property of the community passed into the hands 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.670
 private owner 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.860
 however on camera to comment on your 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.420
 the position of the plaintiff refused until the court is not 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.460
 will begin consideration of the case 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.409
 Moreover clearly could not say in 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.600
 which court and which judge the dispute will be 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.790
 considered but the chairman of the regional council 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.890
 Sergey Chernov says and in Ki long 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.840
 taken into consideration moreover their 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.759
 the collateral is that the deal is on 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.710
 the moment is actually frozen 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.750
 to pay bills Kurchenko does not have 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.000
 rights while the dispute is dealt with in 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.460
 Kiev in the economic court and when will 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.640
 Decision unknown transfer 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.299
 while suspended there is a decision of a number 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.790
 to court 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.369
 we are 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:13.100
 in court proceedings 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.620
 I hope soon all the same we 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.350
 we can essentially consider these in the courts 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.560
 questions put this point and protect 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.020
 your position and give the opportunity 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.750
 realize this project this money 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.410
 definitely needed and 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.900
 and so would say but urgent are needed for 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.370
 completion of construction of 30 stations 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.790
 subway victory 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.400
 because the longer we build 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.920
 more expensive this construction costs 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.990
 analysts suspect the claim is disputed and 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.730
 the deal did not appear out of the blue and 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.350
 only because of righteous indignation 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.150
 Veterans of the more that she 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.830
 The organization of Vladimir Roma among 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.660
 similar veteran organizations 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.700
 respect is not enjoyed by colleagues 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.140
 social activists claim the committee consists 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.330
 from just a few people 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.190
 vigorous activity and no more 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.020
 known for his lawsuits against others 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.300
 organizations and the ability to move to 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.010
 a convenient political side is unlikely 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.230
 Experts believe it is veterans 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.950
 filed a lawsuit rather someone on their behalf 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.959
 to whom 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.209
 or do not want to pay for the transaction or not 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.190
 desire to get money on time is not uncommon 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.380
 says lawyer Anatoly Tarasenko lawsuit 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.690
 not sued for trial 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.190
 but only to use it to brake 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.030
 some process or divert attention 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.950
 such suits are very easy to call and semi 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.470
 army term false maneuver it 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.650
 When lawyer and makes action 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.690
 external incomprehensible to others goal 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.250
 who are known only by this lawyer 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:45.350
 show the direction of the main strike 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.769
 where he is not needed they undertake 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.880
 active actions submit documents 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:55.519
 create a stir around this 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.980
 directions though actually decide 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.480
 completely different issues when serving 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.430
 Sergey Kurchenko in the comment 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.350
 relatively judicial divide and not in a hurry 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.239
 and mayor of kharkov, gennady kernes, as if not 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.040
 notices funding problems and 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.610
 anxiety of his fellow member Sergei 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.320
 Chernov 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.910
 he is inspecting a new station with 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.079
 confidence that the work will continue 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.269
 and it will be commissioned on August 23, 2014 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.979
 moreover the mayor sold 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.530
 from talking about a deal with kurchenko as well 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.789
 held and are already building new plans for 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.740
 subway construction 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.500
 discusses with engineers how to carry 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.470
 technique for the Odessa main I once again 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.800
 say this funding but i'm sure 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.430
 volume that given those last 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.460
 the decision of the states that were 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.030
 signed including 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.639
 from the russian federation i think that we 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.560
 should focus only on one thing 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:53.380
 not only build a meter 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:56.410
 but also develop our transportation hub in in 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.569
 in this direction we can with the help and 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.250
 state support how 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.139
 Russian agreements will help 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.940
 construction of Kharkiv subway mayor 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.590
 did not specify however the workers throughout 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.750
 visibility inspired in honor of the visit 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.030
 to the mayor they even decorated the entrance 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.860
 to the station with posters of marina
