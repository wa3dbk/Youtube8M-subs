00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
across my right hand over first and then

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.479 
across my right hand over first and then
my<00:00:39.809> left<00:00:39.960> hand<00:00:40.200> over<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:42.989> then<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.010> would<00:00:44.219> carry

my left hand over and then I would carry
my<00:00:44.730> hoop<00:00:44.969> over<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.370> would

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
my hoop over like this and then I would

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:56.209 
my hoop over like this and then I would
just<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.270> again<00:00:53.870> but<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.260> basically<00:00:55.530> I

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
just do that again but so basically I

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.880 
just do that again but so basically I
would<00:00:56.760> do<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.360> I'm<00:00:58.020> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.500> get<00:00:58.620> stuck

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
would do this I'm going to get stuck

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.099 
would do this I'm going to get stuck
here<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.609> not<00:01:00.149> know<00:01:00.359> what<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:00.930> my

here and not know what to do with my
right<00:01:01.350> hand<00:01:02.000> because<00:01:03.000> no<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.329> really

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
right hand because no one really

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.050 
right hand because no one really
explains<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.369> say<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.850> you're<00:01:05.970> gonna

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
explains that they say that you're gonna

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.280 
explains that they say that you're gonna
cross<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.689> hand<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.830> hand<00:01:08.100> here

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
cross this hand here is this hand here

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.420 
cross this hand here is this hand here
your<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.470> arm<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.100> over<00:01:11.280> your

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
your right arm is going to be over your

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.100 
your right arm is going to be over your
left<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.000> left<00:01:12.330> starts<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.900> over

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
left and then left starts to be over

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.590 
left and then left starts to be over
right<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:14.280> was<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.670> really<00:01:14.790> confusing<00:01:15.299> for

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
right it was just really confusing for

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.960 
right it was just really confusing for
me<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> way<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.860> I'm<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.549> explain

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
me so the way that I'm going to explain

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.060 
me so the way that I'm going to explain
it<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.110> I'm<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
it it's not like that I'm going to

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.859 
it it's not like that I'm going to
explain<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.610> by<00:01:20.759> slowing<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.330> down<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
explain it by slowing it down and

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.890 
explain it by slowing it down and
showing<00:01:22.409> how<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.619> figured<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> out<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.630> cross

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
showing how I figured it out so I cross

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.950 
showing how I figured it out so I cross
my<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.409> hand<00:01:25.860> over<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:27.330> my<00:01:27.479> left<00:01:27.720> hand

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
my right hand over and then my left hand

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560 
my right hand over and then my left hand
over<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.710> then<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> let<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.490> spit<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.150> my<00:01:30.270> left

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
over and then I let it spit on my left

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.520 
over and then I let it spit on my left
thumb<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.240> then<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.659> expending

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
thumb like so and then I'm as expending

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.819 
thumb like so and then I'm as expending
of<00:01:34.680> my<00:01:34.829> thumb<00:01:35.130> I'm<00:01:35.600> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.780> cross<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.320> hand

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
of my thumb I'm going to cross this hand

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.520 
of my thumb I'm going to cross this hand
over<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.640> turn<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.020> bring<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:41.070> and

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
over and turn it and bring it out and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.039 
over and turn it and bring it out and
back<00:01:43.530> over<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.189> then<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:45.240> gonna<00:01:45.390> let<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.750> spin

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
back over and then I'm gonna let it spin

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.850 
back over and then I'm gonna let it spin
on<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.409> thumb<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.070> then<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.270> do<00:01:48.450> not

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
on this thumb and then as it's do not

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
on this thumb and then as it's do not
turn<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.070> hand<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.759> bring<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.780> over<00:01:52.880> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
turn this hand and bring it over and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.450 
turn this hand and bring it over and
cross<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.979> and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.840 

and<00:01:59.550> a<00:01:59.880> long<00:02:00.570> time<00:02:01.490> thanks

and<00:02:04.130> then<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.940> slowly<00:02:06.540> figure<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.290> you're

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
and then as you slowly figure out you're

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:20.930 
and then as you slowly figure out you're
crossing<00:02:08.100> your<00:02:08.670> arms<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.770> you're<00:02:10.770> carrying

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:39.470 

like<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.020> as<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:24.360> do<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.960> slowly

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.059 

you'll<00:02:40.050> eventually<00:02:41.510> get<00:02:42.510> into<00:02:42.920> speeding<00:02:43.920> it

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
you'll eventually get into speeding it

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.949 
you'll eventually get into speeding it
up<00:02:44.540> Wow

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
up Wow

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.530 
up Wow
feel<00:02:46.170> through<00:02:46.530> new<00:02:49.790> you'll<00:02:50.790> eventually<00:02:51.060> get

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
feel through new you'll eventually get

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.930 
feel through new you'll eventually get
into<00:02:51.720> speeding<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.410> up<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.860> start<00:02:53.340> off<00:02:53.520> slow

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
into speeding it up so I start off slow

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.860 
into speeding it up so I start off slow
and<00:02:55.970> figuring<00:02:56.970> out<00:02:57.150> how<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.170> spin<00:02:58.709> my<00:02:58.890> hands

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
and figuring out how to spin my hands

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.229 
and figuring out how to spin my hands
and<00:03:01.640> when<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.850> carry<00:03:03.120> my<00:03:03.330> groups<00:03:03.600> over<00:03:03.989> so
