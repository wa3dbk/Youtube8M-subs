context this was during a world war
where<00:02:35.840> we<00:02:35.870> were<00:02:36.049> worried<00:02:36.439> that<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:37.040> know<00:02:37.069> our

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
where we were worried that you know our

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
Japanese or by the Nazis so a little bit

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.119

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.809 
understandable like we'd had Pearl
Harbor<00:02:45.079> and<00:02:45.170> stuff<00:02:45.409> like<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.709> but<00:02:46.219> it's<00:02:46.549> just

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
Harbor and stuff like that but it's just

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.059 
Harbor and stuff like that but it's just
so<00:02:47.510> stereotypical<00:02:48.170> II<00:02:48.590> like<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.829> way<00:02:48.920> they

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
so stereotypical II like the way they

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.860 
so stereotypical II like the way they
portray<00:02:49.430> Japanese<00:02:49.879> faces<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.629> things<00:02:50.720> like

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
are supposed to accomplish but it was

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.270 
are supposed to accomplish but it was
supposed<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:54.079> sort<00:02:54.260> of<00:02:54.379> dehumanize<00:02:55.010> these

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280

right<00:02:57.799> and<00:02:58.069> I<00:02:58.700> mean<00:02:58.879> it's<00:02:59.569> interesting

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
right and I mean it's interesting

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.759 
right and I mean it's interesting
because<00:03:00.049> a<00:03:00.139> lot<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.470> Looney<00:03:00.709> Tunes

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
because a lot of the Looney Tunes

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.520 
because a lot of the Looney Tunes
characters<00:03:01.459> aren't<00:03:01.700> people<00:03:02.329> and<00:03:03.169> they're

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
often animals and so to have

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.929

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
I didn't hear that when he said that I

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.689 
I didn't hear that when he said that I
was<00:03:17.269> like<00:03:17.560> now<00:03:18.560> look<00:03:18.739> what<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.280> wonder<00:03:19.669> is

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
was like now look what I wonder is

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.430 
was like now look what I wonder is
though<00:03:20.090> is<00:03:20.329> that<00:03:20.659> obviously<00:03:21.139> these<00:03:21.229> are<00:03:21.379> a

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
though is that obviously these are a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.020 
though is that obviously these are a
long<00:03:21.739> time<00:03:22.010> ago<00:03:22.159> we're<00:03:22.280> talking<00:03:22.459> about<00:03:22.519> 70

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
long time ago we're talking about 70

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.869 
long time ago we're talking about 70
years<00:03:23.239> ago<00:03:23.299> here<00:03:23.750> if<00:03:23.989> a<00:03:24.409> massive<00:03:25.190> war<00:03:25.430> was<00:03:25.699> to

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
years ago here if a massive war was to

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.170 
years ago here if a massive war was to
break<00:03:26.090> out<00:03:26.359> would<00:03:26.989> cartoons<00:03:27.799> have<00:03:28.250> sort<00:03:29.090> of

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
break out would cartoons have sort of

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.589 
break out would cartoons have sort of
any<00:03:29.419> reference<00:03:30.169> to<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:30.709> it's<00:03:31.220> well<00:03:31.699> I<00:03:32.090> would

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
any reference to that it's well I would

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.390 
any reference to that it's well I would
say<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:32.959> yes<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.769> think<00:03:33.829> that<00:03:34.040> people<00:03:34.250> are<00:03:34.340> a

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
say that yes I think that people are a

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.119 
say that yes I think that people are a
lot<00:03:34.609> more<00:03:34.639> sensitive<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:35.930> right<00:03:36.590> now<00:03:36.620> and

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
lot more sensitive to that right now and

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.189 
lot more sensitive to that right now and
I<00:03:37.519> think<00:03:37.669> that<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.120> mindset<00:03:38.690> then<00:03:38.930> was<00:03:39.139> very

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
I think that the mindset then was very

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.050 
I think that the mindset then was very
different<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:40.010> these<00:03:40.129> cartoons<00:03:40.519> were<00:03:40.669> kind

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
different and these cartoons were kind

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.969 
different and these cartoons were kind
of<00:03:41.180> propaganda<00:03:42.079> and<00:03:43.389> which<00:03:44.389> is<00:03:44.540> not<00:03:44.859> you<00:03:45.859> know

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:45.979 
of propaganda and which is not you know

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.219 
of propaganda and which is not you know
as<00:03:46.159> common<00:03:46.760> I<00:03:46.940> feel<00:03:47.150> like<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.659> feel<00:03:47.989> like<00:03:48.049> it

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:48.229 
as common I feel like I feel like it

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:49.479 
as common I feel like I feel like it
would<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:48.709> would<00:03:48.859> definitely<00:03:49.010> implement

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
would it would definitely implement

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.619 
would it would definitely implement
itself<00:03:49.970> like<00:03:50.120> there<00:03:50.239> would<00:03:50.329> definitely<00:03:50.359> be

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
itself like there would definitely be

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:51.939 
itself like there would definitely be
references<00:03:51.109> and<00:03:51.229> stuff<00:03:51.349> like<00:03:51.440> that<00:03:51.620> just<00:03:51.829> as

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
cartoons now I mean I guess like Looney

Tunes<00:04:23.750> like<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.169> don't<00:04:24.289> think<00:04:24.409> adults<00:04:24.889> are

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
Tunes like I don't think adults are

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.500 
Tunes like I don't think adults are
watching<00:04:25.400> Looney<00:04:25.639> Tunes<00:04:25.849> but<00:04:25.969> back<00:04:26.120> then<00:04:26.360> they

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
watching Looney Tunes but back then they

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.850 
watching Looney Tunes but back then they
were<00:04:26.570> being<00:04:26.750> played<00:04:26.990> before<00:04:27.169> movies

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
were being played before movies

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.990 
were being played before movies
stuff<00:04:28.009> like<00:04:28.129> that<00:04:28.159> so<00:04:28.490> it's<00:04:28.610> alts<00:04:28.819> are<00:04:28.879> more

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
stuff like that so it's alts are more

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.760 
stuff like that so it's alts are more
