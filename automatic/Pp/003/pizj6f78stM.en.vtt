00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:15.120
 how to perform a hard reset on a 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:16.920
 microsoft lumia 535 below for 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.289
 enter in matter at what time 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.690
 we need to do a restoration of 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.850
 factory in a microsoft device 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.770
 simply when we did not forget the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.380
 password or simply the computer what 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.119
 we have very slow very blocked but 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.039
 usually goes through problems of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.970
 password that we need to do that 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.650
 recipe 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.050
 let's say conditions we must meet for 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.720
 able to perform this process first that 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.210
 the battery is charged at least 50% 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.840
 up to more than 50% and the other is to have a 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.190
 data cable like this we 're already going 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.449
 to show 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.670
 a data cable like this or 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.050
 charger that is the same the best thing that 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.360
 we have to do is turn off the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.360
 device we're going to turn it off 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.950
 let's turn it off and we'll comment 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.620
 some things like that first this 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.770
 team manages what is the keys of 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.530
 volume down 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.960
 or volume up and on if they are the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.840
 what do we need then what are we going to 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.429
 do first where it says here what 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.229
 it said every and letters of the margin of 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.530
 muzzle the cable connected with volume 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.470
 down is to say volume down first 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.990
 we take our cable 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.390
 and we connect it 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.659
 when we connect it with the key 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.790
 hold volume down your computer 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.890
 will learn 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.400
 and we are going to wait for a 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.400
 symbol 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.950
 we arrived a moment there appeared we can 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.330
 choose change can not leave post 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.520
 without any problem in that case it's not going to 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.590
 let go and we are going to follow this sequence 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.700
 says uploading monument of volume up 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.970
 we lower volume the vertices on and 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.470
 this is low color ready then with 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.500
 this the team starts to become a 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.179
 Factory formatting can totally 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.820
 take about 10 to 15 minutes 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.830
 then what we are going to do is pause 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.560
 the video for what 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.900
 or be much faster and agile with your 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.520
 formatting mode you can pray around 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.900
 what explains to them to take their time 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.820
 so that they have patience 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.810
 then we will be able to use the video 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.810
 to give you more agility 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.920
 Well, we're going around 40% 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.900
 we take about 34 minutes then we go 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.240
 to pause again 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.700
 for greater would speed past 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.130
 6 minutes is about to end the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.400
 restoration then patience by 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.400
 favor 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.130
 well already finished let's say the 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.220
 restoration let's start talking the 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.070
 operating system installation 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.290
 we select the country and the language that 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.760
 let's wish we give here next we give here 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.850
 also next here accept omit 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.990
 following 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.840
 recommended 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.880
 next and atta mills and login 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.450
 later now that I'm placing the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.520
 google mail classroom account in any 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.530
 of those who use let's go back to 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.450
 pause the video and have installed what 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.180
 which is the operating system remember that 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.340
 place that opens or expands the 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.590
 operating system and this installs 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.030
 You can take the real one too and about 5 or 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.920
 10 minutes depending on the speed 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.120
 of the voltage device then 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.120
 let's go back to pause 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.190
 well I've been here what is the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.470
 operating system we give to each 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.560
 next we danced here also 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.900
 next, the safest thing is that our 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.849
 type back and restarted goes no 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.660
 get scared the stone puts a reset 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.099
 Additional sometimes not but frighten us 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.709
 then we have to give our team 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.840
 restored from factory totally without 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.599
 No kind of information I hope that 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.160
