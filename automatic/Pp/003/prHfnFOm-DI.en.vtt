00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.870 
turn or two of the best votes in the
tournament<00:01:15.330> tagged<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.260> you<00:01:16.470> know

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
tournament tagged with you and you know

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.950 
tournament tagged with you and you know
you<00:01:17.880> got<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.030> consider<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.600> because<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
you got to consider that because the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.180 
you got to consider that because the
other<00:01:19.050> boats<00:01:19.290> seems<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.830> rest<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
other boats seems like the rest of the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.520 
other boats seems like the rest of the
fleet<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:21.360> know<00:01:21.479> drops<00:01:21.990> down<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> line<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
fleet is you know drops down the line a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.190 
fleet is you know drops down the line a
little<00:01:22.770> bit<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.630> know<00:01:24.720> with<00:01:24.869> tomorrow

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
little bit so you know with tomorrow

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.480 
little bit so you know with tomorrow
being<00:01:25.259> less<00:01:25.680> win<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.040> stuff<00:01:26.190> I<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.280> it'll

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
being less win and stuff I think it'll

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
being less win and stuff I think it'll
be<00:01:26.580> slower<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.479> fish<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.780> gonna<00:01:27.899> be

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
be slower you know the fish is gonna be

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.749 
be slower you know the fish is gonna be
more<00:01:28.200> pressure<00:01:28.830> on<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> fish<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.520> think<00:01:29.670> it'd

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
more pressure on the fish I think it'd

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.719 
more pressure on the fish I think it'd
be<00:01:29.820> less<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.180> bike<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.580> so

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
be less of a bike and you know so

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.190 
be less of a bike and you know so
probably<00:01:33.149> stick<00:01:33.390> near<00:01:33.630> them<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.080> know<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
probably stick near them you know and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.310 
probably stick near them you know and
