00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.039
When he went to take part
at an inventory - 

00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:06.039
according to the gospels 
Josef and Mary went to inventory. 

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:09.039
And there (according to the gospels)
Jesus was born.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:11.759
Where are the brothers of Jesus?

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.679
If they were born before him, 
they should be there 
to take also part in that inventory.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.639
Engaged Maria is with Josef,
another question is 
why they are not married,

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:23.879
while during [sylhpsh] they are 
engaged and very close to give birth,

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:28.239
and during birth she still is 
refered to as his spouse

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.000
There are hundrends of questions.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.679
Why did Jesus climbed to a high 
mountainto see earth's nations?

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:39.000
Can a man see earth's nations on a 
sphere such as the earth?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.879
And if it is a metaphor, why does 
he need to climb a mountain?

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.239
Why couldn't see the nations from 
the temple that he was on 
shortly before?

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.399
Another question:

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.559
Why the 3 evangelists mention 
the temptations of Jesus,

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.439
but John says:
The 1st day he met some apostles,

00:00:55.439 --> 00:01:03.119
the 2nd day he met some other apostles,
the 3rd day marriage took place in Cana.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:10.599
He starts his career without the disruption, 
between the 1st and the 3rd day, of the 40 days 
of the temptations. Do you understand?

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:22.399
I can continue with thousands of questions, 
like the young man with the sheet that I said earlier, 
the resurrection (recovery as I call it).

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:30.479
2 to 3 decades ago, 
the Old Testament was a divinely inspired text.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.479
Now that there are many that 
question the Old Testament

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.279
â€“I alone wrote 3 books critical to the old testament-

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:45.000
no one accepts the Old Testament as a divine text, 
or very few accept it, mainly because they are 
obedient to the dogma.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.759
Why? Because the Old Testament is full of 
unexplained abominations,

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.000
all of its heroes are militarized, 
its miracles are miracles of death and disease.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.919
Today, while coming here, I stopped at a 
mini market where we had a conversation.

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:08.119
1 out of 2 people reject with certainty 
the Old Testament, by relying solely 
to the New Testament.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.719
Lastly, the same thing will happen soon 
to the New Testament.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:19.319
It has been delayed simply because 
the Hellenic world and the Western world

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.199
in general is deeply christianised 
and those disputes were not known to the public.

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:25.439
Those that I mention were only a 
small sample of the questions

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.639
that are in my book that I showed you.
