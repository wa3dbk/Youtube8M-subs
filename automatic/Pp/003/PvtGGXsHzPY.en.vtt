00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.699
 for a new video a video this 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.180
 once on the board scores 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.250
 so how to create a car score 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:30.539
 your server or even on your mac 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:31.309
 solo i'm going to put the day back this is his 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.660
 merits 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.390
 then first of all the fact the objective 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.379
 so what you want it to count 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:47.100
 there is actually objective slash this 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:49.379
 goal scoreboard not objective add 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.260
 following you put your name you put 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.079
 the guy and you hand over again we're gonna 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.620
 see the types of suite the com cheap on 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.559
 a to z kunz is a dead storyteller 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.840
 simply the player who sticks is 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.270
 kiel counter two players only 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.510
 players is such that it knocks 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.330
 counts all the sons the players and the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 animals the amiable mix one has ide 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.670
 it's life just to see the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.590
 creative charcoal so it does not show but 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:26.070
 So here you go, so you can 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.280
 do it well with a block command you 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.360
 type slash body board goals and 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.610
 so 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.820
 it works very well but you can 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.049
 also do it on calabar case that's it 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.979
 simpler I do not find what you 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.780
 just have to type that you put yourself 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.060
 you press table according to m it takes 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.740
 weather you press table that's 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.840
 much faster so then we go 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.550
 create a graal score we will put the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:00.040
 headline then slash goal 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:04.690
 so we can and mail the name we go 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:10.869
 call him dead then we put the cheap 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:15.090
 we have cden hold we are still dead here we are 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.680
 a on z has not created a new goal 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.720
 and now you see it's not there 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.230
 finally we can not see it but it counts 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.870
 still go for the displayed you 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.270
 do this again bard lens sites 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.790
 display the place where you want the displayed 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.220
 and the un now that you come 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.620
 to enter then the elected one we have this bar 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.720
 it's a little painting that's going to be 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.660
 right or left of your screen it's me 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.600
 seems Thursday to the list is the lily that 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.670
 pressing table there is bellona 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.710
 it's below the name I know 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:54.690
 not see no but there is no they are 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:03:00.250
 so we're going to put it in the list 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:07.980
 the scor good goal is ten wounds 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:12.220
 of Christ and not the peace dead marc 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.810
 dead how to call him to death with a s 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:20.410
 excuse me here so here you see 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:25.450
 I have zero death they were task but 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:31.150
 put my spawn premium and I'm going to see the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:34.690
 pump knows he's here I'm here 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.300
 and there you see I have a death so I 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.600
 very simple enough to do that 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.580
 you can do it all where we go 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.800
 to make a small score board a little 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.489
 square board total it because I 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.080
 I'm alone I could not hesitate 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.420
 not present I could not do it with 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:59.620
 them to be once we're going to total 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:04.299
 who stays at coal goal and had 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:10.599
 total no we have to put there no then that 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:12.519
 is going to be it total that he has it there so 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:23.860
 you see nothing we will put it in the 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:28.540
 sidebar objective sites display 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.510
 how to call him he is a master 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:36.760
 it's the opposite , one for me 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:41.889
 this boat here it is so here it is necessary 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:47.610
 I'm going to kill a super it'll do everything 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:54.389
 fart a co if I write like that too 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:57.850
 no wonder it does not find it flat 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.970
 so here is the g1 he attached a 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.630
 second of keane and so on huh 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.389
 not you have to I can say the whole video 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.580
 after there are the players and there is there 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.050
 I put it bello name in May 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.289
 after that you can put it in 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:18.729
 table as you want 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:21.039
 so here it was again a small 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.450
 it's for rim or if you want 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:28.180
 really you goal slash is less 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:32.320
 there a vari move for example what we 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.150
 mosque varies here he died 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.449
 so there is still living room going to do 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:41.560
 such a slash corbard objective and even 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:46.949
 to the dead so here they are all 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.949
