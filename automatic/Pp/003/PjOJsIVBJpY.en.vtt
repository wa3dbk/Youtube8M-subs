a<00:02:30.430> little<00:02:31.430> bit<00:02:31.580> of<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.760> slow<00:02:32.239> us<00:02:32.360> down<00:02:32.390> here<00:02:32.629> and

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
a little bit of a slow us down here and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.790 
a little bit of a slow us down here and
take<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.290> easy

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.530 

see<00:02:37.800> now<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.250> hits<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.550> rev<00:02:38.730> limiter<00:02:39.150> that's<00:02:39.360> one

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
see now it hits a rev limiter that's one

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.930 
see now it hits a rev limiter that's one
thing<00:02:39.660> that's<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.930> little<00:02:40.319> bit<00:02:40.410> interesting<00:02:40.940> in

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
thing that's a little bit interesting in

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.760 
thing that's a little bit interesting in
automatic<00:02:42.540> mode<00:02:42.569> it<00:02:42.930> will<00:02:42.959> let<00:02:43.170> itself<00:02:43.500> hit

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
automatic mode it will let itself hit

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.010 
automatic mode it will let itself hit
the<00:02:43.890> rev<00:02:44.069> limiter<00:02:44.490> which<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.870> been<00:02:45.990> a

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
the rev limiter which is it's been a

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.640 
the rev limiter which is it's been a
while<00:02:46.230> since<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.590> drove<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.800> car<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.250> did<00:02:47.459> that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.319 

so<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.709> can<00:02:53.950> hear<00:02:54.099> that<00:02:54.159> it's<00:02:54.670> just<00:02:54.879> bouncing

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
so you can hear that it's just bouncing

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:09.330 
so you can hear that it's just bouncing
off<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.480> rev<00:02:55.750> limiter

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.679 

just<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.739> beautiful<00:03:33.920> sound<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:35.359> you<00:03:35.599> know

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:35.689 
just a beautiful sound and you know

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.270 
just a beautiful sound and you know
something<00:03:35.719> this<00:03:36.139> transmission<00:03:36.739> works<00:03:36.980> almost

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
something this transmission works almost

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.459 
something this transmission works almost
so<00:03:37.790> well<00:03:37.999> I<00:03:38.269> really<00:03:38.689> don't<00:03:38.719> miss<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:39.200> fact

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:39.469 
so well I really don't miss the fact

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.670 
so well I really don't miss the fact
that<00:03:39.829> this<00:03:40.519> doesn't<00:03:40.760> have<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.450> manual<00:03:41.900> option<00:03:42.230> I

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
that this doesn't have a manual option I

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.280 
that this doesn't have a manual option I
know<00:03:43.340> some<00:03:43.700> people<00:03:43.730> might<00:03:44.209> really<00:03:44.599> just<00:03:44.900> be

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
know some people might really just be

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.309 
know some people might really just be
upset<00:03:45.590> about<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:45.920> but<00:03:46.219> as<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.269> saw<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:47.840> just

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
upset about that but as you saw I just

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.899 
upset about that but as you saw I just
had<00:03:48.439> it<00:03:48.590> in<00:03:48.650> automatic<00:03:49.250> mode<00:03:49.280> i<00:03:49.459> wasn't<00:03:49.849> even

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
had it in automatic mode i wasn't even

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.089 
had it in automatic mode i wasn't even
shifting<00:03:50.480> manually<00:03:51.049> and<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.290> was<00:03:51.469> just<00:03:51.739> doing

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
shifting manually and it was just doing

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.979 
shifting manually and it was just doing
pretty<00:03:52.819> much<00:03:53.030> what<00:03:53.209> i<00:03:53.239> would<00:03:53.450> have<00:03:53.480> done<00:03:53.569> and

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
pretty much what i would have done and

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.500 
pretty much what i would have done and
so<00:03:54.409> if<00:03:55.400> you've<00:03:55.579> got<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.730> transmission<00:03:56.329> that's

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
so if you've got a transmission that's

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.289 
so if you've got a transmission that's
that<00:03:56.689> good<00:03:57.129> you<00:03:58.129> know<00:03:58.250> why<00:03:58.459> put<00:03:58.730> yourself<00:03:58.760> to
