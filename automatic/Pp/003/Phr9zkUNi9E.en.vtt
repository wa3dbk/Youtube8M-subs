00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
games in a row yeah it's gonna save you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.210 
games in a row yeah it's gonna save you
a<00:01:39.600> lot<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.930> time<00:01:40.350> instead<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.829> doing<00:01:41.040> five

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
a lot of time instead of doing five

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.620 
a lot of time instead of doing five
minutes<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.759> other<00:01:41.850> thing<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.299> when<00:01:42.509> your

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
minutes the other thing is when your

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.810 
minutes the other thing is when your
opponent<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.380> know<00:01:43.470> hits<00:01:43.860> resume<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.579> away

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
opponent you know hits resume right away

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.359 
opponent you know hits resume right away
you'll<00:01:45.750> run<00:01:45.899> across<00:01:46.020> some<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.590> those<00:01:46.710> guys<00:01:46.950> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
you'll run across some of those guys and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.760 
you'll run across some of those guys and
it<00:01:48.360> doesn't<00:01:48.750> give<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.930> time<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.380> set<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.560> your

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it doesn't give you time to set up your

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.190 
it doesn't give you time to set up your
depth<00:01:49.979> chart<00:01:50.220> all<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> way<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:52.020> know<00:01:52.140> you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
depth chart all the way you know you

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.679 
depth chart all the way you know you
won't<00:01:52.409> run<00:01:52.530> into<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.920> problem<00:01:53.299> also<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.390> can

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
won't run into that problem also you can

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.060 
won't run into that problem also you can
hit<00:01:54.840> resume<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.470> your<00:01:55.619> opponent<00:01:56.040> doesn't

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
hit resume and if your opponent doesn't

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.490 
hit resume and if your opponent doesn't
have<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> depth<00:01:56.700> chart<00:01:56.939> set<00:01:57.240> then<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.380> know

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
have the depth chart set then you know

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.770 
have the depth chart set then you know
that<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:58.829> benefit<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.820> give<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.420> maybe

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
that can benefit you and give you maybe

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.530 
that can benefit you and give you maybe
a<00:02:00.960> possible<00:02:01.469> personnel<00:02:01.950> advantage<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.850> then

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
a possible personnel advantage and then

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.940 
a possible personnel advantage and then
the<00:02:03.659> final<00:02:03.990> thing<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.530> know<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.799> just

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the final thing is you know it's just

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.520 
the final thing is you know it's just
easier<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.490> do<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.939> when<00:02:06.930> you're<00:02:07.049> not<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
easier to do it when you're not in the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.080 
easier to do it when you're not in the
game<00:02:07.680> because<00:02:08.160> for<00:02:08.399> some<00:02:08.580> reason<00:02:08.610> when<00:02:08.970> you're

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
game because for some reason when you're

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.910 
game because for some reason when you're
online<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.959> you're<00:02:10.050> actually<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> rank
