hey the origami master here and today we

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.210 
hey the origami master here and today we
are<00:00:03.449> going<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.750> be<00:00:03.929> learning<00:00:04.170> how<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.470> fold<00:00:04.859> an

do is get two square sheets of paper it

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.650 
do is get two square sheets of paper it
doesn't<00:00:22.529> matter<00:00:23.070> what<00:00:23.400> color<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.300> doesn't

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
doesn't matter what color and it doesn't

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.929 
doesn't matter what color and it doesn't
really<00:00:24.779> matter<00:00:25.019> what<00:00:25.350> size<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.640> square

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
really matter what size the square

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.169 
really matter what size the square
sheets<00:00:27.210> are<00:00:27.480> as<00:00:27.720> long<00:00:28.289> as<00:00:28.470> they're<00:00:28.650> square

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
sheets are as long as they're square

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.170 
sheets are as long as they're square
take<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.570> your<00:00:30.720> sheets<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.170> paper<00:00:31.349> and

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
take one of your sheets of paper and

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.819 
take one of your sheets of paper and
fold<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.360> diagonally<00:00:35.120> then<00:00:36.559> fold<00:00:37.559> it

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
fold it diagonally then fold it

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.270 
fold it diagonally then fold it
diagonally<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.390> opposite<00:00:39.840> direction

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
diagonally in the opposite direction

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.340 
diagonally in the opposite direction
like<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.530> fold<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.860> edges<00:00:44.570> into<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
like so and fold the edges into the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
like so and fold the edges into the
center<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.579> kind<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.210> X<00:00:48.510> or<00:00:49.110> cross<00:00:49.680> shape

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
center of that kind of X or cross shape

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.029 
center of that kind of X or cross shape
that<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.789> got<00:00:50.969> when<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.420> folded<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.289> corners

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
that you got when you folded the corners

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.470 
that you got when you folded the corners
diagon<00:00:53.610> there<00:00:54.890> now<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:57.000> should<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
diagon there now you should have a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.330 
diagon there now you should have a
crease<00:00:57.870> line<00:00:58.140> running<00:00:58.440> straight<00:00:59.039> through

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
crease line running straight through

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.110 
crease line running straight through
here<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.329> straight<00:01:01.109> through<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:01.949> just<00:01:02.910> like

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
here and straight through here just like

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.609 
here and straight through here just like
some<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.070> fold<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.519> edges<00:01:05.900> into<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.260> center

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
some and fold the edges into the center

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.359 
some and fold the edges into the center
crease<00:01:07.770> line<00:01:08.220> like<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.049> and<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.200> unfold<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
crease line like so and then unfold and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.929 
crease line like so and then unfold and
do<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> same<00:01:12.180> exact<00:01:12.659> thing<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> other

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
do the same exact thing for the other

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.940 
do the same exact thing for the other
two<00:01:14.939> sides<00:01:16.369> then<00:01:17.369> open<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.180> up<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.479> take<00:01:19.110> two

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
two sides then open it up and take two

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.359 
two sides then open it up and take two
of<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.250> flaps<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:21.509> pull<00:01:21.750> those<00:01:21.960> out<00:01:22.369> fold

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
of your flaps just pull those out fold

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.560 
of your flaps just pull those out fold
the<00:01:23.520> edges<00:01:24.420> back<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.520> I'll<00:01:26.970> actually

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the edges back in so and I'll actually

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.460 
the edges back in so and I'll actually
zoom<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.320> part<00:01:31.040> here<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.159> go<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
zoom in for this part here we go and

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.440 
zoom in for this part here we go and
you're<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.770> simply<00:01:35.670> want<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.270> take<00:01:37.310> edge

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
you're going to simply want to take edge

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.980 
you're going to simply want to take edge
fold<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.720> over<00:01:40.790> onto<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.240> crease<00:01:42.540> line<00:01:42.780> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
fold it over onto this crease line that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.090 
fold it over onto this crease line that
you<00:01:43.020> had<00:01:43.259> right<00:01:43.500> here<00:01:44.990> like<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
you had right here like so and do the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.280 
you had right here like so and do the
same<00:01:47.340> thing<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.210> edge<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> other

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
same thing for the edge with the other

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.999 
same thing for the edge with the other
side<00:01:49.939> like<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:52.340> then<00:01:53.360> fold<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:55.200> thing<00:01:55.710> over

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
side like so then fold this thing over

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.120 
side like so then fold this thing over
and<00:01:56.549> into<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> box<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.990> close<00:01:58.740> off<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and into the box like that close off the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.220 
and into the box like that close off the
edge<00:01:59.280> and<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.570> same<00:02:00.750> thing

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
edge and do the same thing

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.160 
edge and do the same thing
the<00:02:01.410> other<00:02:01.530> side<00:02:04.640> just<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.730> that<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.570> you're

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the other side just like that and you're

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.230 
the other side just like that and you're
actually<00:02:07.350> not<00:02:07.770> making<00:02:08.250> any<00:02:08.520> increases<00:02:08.910> in

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
actually not making any increases in

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.750 
actually not making any increases in
this<00:02:09.360> process<00:02:10.040> they're<00:02:11.040> all<00:02:11.220> creases<00:02:11.730> that

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
this process they're all creases that

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.240 
this process they're all creases that
you<00:02:12.000> previously<00:02:12.240> mate<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.050> there<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.220> have

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
you previously mate and there you have

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.080 
you previously mate and there you have
the<00:02:14.480> base<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.110> box<00:02:16.320> now<00:02:16.800> let's<00:02:17.400> make<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
the base of the box now let's make the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:27.700 
the base of the box now let's make the
lid<00:02:18.590> let<00:02:19.590> me<00:02:19.770> zoom<00:02:19.800> out<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:23.540> there<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.720> go

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.500 

okay<00:02:28.710> now<00:02:29.130> take<00:02:29.190> your<00:02:29.640> other<00:02:29.910> sheet<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.360> paper

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
okay now take your other sheet of paper

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.490 
okay now take your other sheet of paper
and<00:02:32.660> fold<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.930> diagonally<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.660> and

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
and fold it diagonally just like so and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500 
and fold it diagonally just like so and
then<00:02:37.920> fold<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.340> diagonally<00:02:38.490> in<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.360> other

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
then fold it diagonally in the other

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.600 
then fold it diagonally in the other
direction<00:02:41.150> then<00:02:42.380> again<00:02:43.380> fold<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.160> corners

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
direction then again fold the corners

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.200 
direction then again fold the corners
into<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.540> center<00:02:47.000> just<00:02:48.000> like<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:50.210> there's

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
into the center just like so and there's

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.540 
into the center just like so and there's
actually<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> difference<00:02:52.230> with<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:52.830> when

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
actually a difference with this one when

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.970 
actually a difference with this one when
you<00:02:53.730> fold<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.300> edges<00:02:54.510> into<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.620> central

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
you fold the edges into the central

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.070 
you fold the edges into the central
crease<00:02:56.130> line<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.820> want<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.270> leave<00:02:57.510> about<00:02:58.020> a

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
crease line you want to leave about a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.580 
crease line you want to leave about a
millimeter<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.830> space<00:02:59.340> between<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:00.810> edges

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
millimeter of space between the edges

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.449 
millimeter of space between the edges
and<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:02.160> center<00:03:02.460> crease<00:03:02.580> line<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:04.220> when<00:03:05.220> you

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
and the center crease line so when you

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.670 
and the center crease line so when you
fold<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.510> edges<00:03:06.870> into<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.230> center<00:03:07.560> crease

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
fold it the edges into the center crease

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.480 
fold it the edges into the center crease
line<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.310> want<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.730> leave<00:03:09.110> some<00:03:10.110> space<00:03:10.530> you

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
line you want to leave some space you

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.310 
line you want to leave some space you
want<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.760> leave<00:03:11.970> space<00:03:12.480> in<00:03:12.780> between<00:03:13.670> there

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
want to leave space in between there

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.770 
want to leave space in between there
this<00:03:16.320> is<00:03:16.680> because<00:03:16.950> if<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:17.760> do<00:03:18.000> not<00:03:18.180> do<00:03:18.510> this

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
this is because if you do not do this

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.610 
this is because if you do not do this
the<00:03:19.080> lid<00:03:19.320> will<00:03:19.770> not<00:03:20.010> fit<00:03:20.400> over<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.820> base<00:03:21.620> so

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
the lid will not fit over the base so

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.680 
the lid will not fit over the base so
you<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.130> leave<00:03:23.370> space<00:03:24.290> just<00:03:25.290> like<00:03:25.350> so<00:03:25.709> and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
you have to leave space just like so and

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.390 
you have to leave space just like so and
then<00:03:27.690> again<00:03:27.959> we're<00:03:28.470> doing<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.920> same<00:03:29.100> thing

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
then again we're doing the same thing

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.300 
then again we're doing the same thing
with<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.670> other<00:03:29.700> two<00:03:30.090> sides<00:03:30.410> again<00:03:31.410> making

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
with the other two sides again making

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.350 
with the other two sides again making
sure<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:33.239> leave<00:03:34.040> space<00:03:35.810> there<00:03:36.810> we<00:03:36.930> go<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:38.360> I

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
sure to leave space there we go and I

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.360 
sure to leave space there we go and I
will<00:03:40.050> zoom<00:03:40.080> in<00:03:40.709> again<00:03:41.550> and<00:03:43.010> we're<00:03:44.010> just<00:03:44.250> going

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
will zoom in again and we're just going

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.130 
will zoom in again and we're just going
to<00:03:44.580> do<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.880> same<00:03:44.910> thing<00:03:45.360> pull<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.780> two<00:03:45.959> edges

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
to do the same thing pull the two edges

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.690 
to do the same thing pull the two edges
out<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.800> fold<00:03:47.459> them<00:03:48.000> back<00:03:48.390> over<00:03:48.420> like<00:03:49.320> so<00:03:49.700> so

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
out and fold them back over like so so

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.979 
out and fold them back over like so so
that<00:03:50.850> you<00:03:51.000> have<00:03:51.150> something<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.690> looks<00:03:51.720> like

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
that you have something that looks like

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.220 
that you have something that looks like
this<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.709> don't<00:03:53.550> get<00:03:53.670> me<00:03:53.730> wrong<00:03:54.060> there<00:03:54.870> will

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
this and don't get me wrong there will

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.320 
this and don't get me wrong there will
be<00:03:55.440> space<00:03:55.800> in<00:03:56.100> between<00:03:56.250> there<00:03:56.670> because<00:03:57.060> you

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
be space in between there because you

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.350 
be space in between there because you
need<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:58.080> space<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.800> have<00:03:59.520> to<00:03:59.820> have<00:04:00.150> it

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
need that space you have to have it

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.840 
need that space you have to have it
otherwise<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.900> will<00:04:01.260> not<00:04:01.320> fit<00:04:01.709> over<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.190> over

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
otherwise it will not fit over the over

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.260 
otherwise it will not fit over the over
the<00:04:02.880> base<00:04:04.100> so<00:04:05.100> now<00:04:05.520> that<00:04:05.550> you<00:04:05.820> have<00:04:05.850> your<00:04:05.940> space

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
the base so now that you have your space

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.000 
the base so now that you have your space
oh<00:04:06.570> you're<00:04:07.140> just<00:04:07.230> going<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.560> do<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.770> same

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
oh you're just going to do the same

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.150 
oh you're just going to do the same
exact<00:04:08.430> thing<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:08.850> we<00:04:08.940> do

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
exact thing that we do

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.900 
exact thing that we do
previously<00:04:10.230> just<00:04:11.230> like<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:11.740> and<00:04:12.040> by<00:04:12.520> folding

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
previously just like that and by folding

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.650 
previously just like that and by folding
the<00:04:12.970> edges<00:04:13.150> over<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:14.430> folding<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:16.390> little

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
the edges over and folding that little

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.530 
the edges over and folding that little
flap<00:04:16.870> down<00:04:17.230> and<00:04:17.530> into<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:17.920> box<00:04:18.100> thus<00:04:19.030> sealing

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
flap down and into the box thus sealing

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.479 
flap down and into the box thus sealing
off<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.900> box<00:04:20.320> we're<00:04:20.709> just<00:04:20.890> doing<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.250> same

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
off the box we're just doing the same

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.420 
off the box we're just doing the same
exact<00:04:21.940> thing<00:04:22.180> that<00:04:22.360> we<00:04:22.480> did<00:04:22.630> earlier<00:04:26.430> doing

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
exact thing that we did earlier doing

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.070 
exact thing that we did earlier doing
the<00:04:27.550> same<00:04:27.850> exact<00:04:28.330> thing<00:04:28.600> that<00:04:28.630> we<00:04:28.930> did

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
the same exact thing that we did

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.930 
the same exact thing that we did
everything<00:04:34.920> and<00:04:35.920> we're<00:04:36.340> going<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.640> do<00:04:36.820> the

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
everything and we're going to do the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.800 
everything and we're going to do the
same<00:04:36.970> thing<00:04:37.390> again<00:04:39.090> again<00:04:40.090> we're<00:04:40.360> just<00:04:40.570> doing

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
same thing again again we're just doing

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.450 
same thing again again we're just doing
the<00:04:40.900> same<00:04:41.230> exact<00:04:41.680> thing<00:04:41.860> that<00:04:42.010> we<00:04:42.130> did<00:04:42.250> with

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
the same exact thing that we did with

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:51.480 
the same exact thing that we did with
the<00:04:42.490> base<00:04:44.790> just<00:04:45.790> like<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:50.590> sometimes

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
the base just like that and sometimes

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.280 
the base just like that and sometimes
you'll<00:04:51.790> have<00:04:51.940> to<00:04:52.270> do<00:04:52.450> that<00:04:52.720> make<00:04:53.530> it<00:04:53.710> nice<00:04:54.070> and

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
you'll have to do that make it nice and

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.100 
you'll have to do that make it nice and
straight<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:57.270> then<00:04:58.270> just<00:04:59.050> get<00:04:59.320> your<00:04:59.530> base<00:04:59.770> and

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
straight and then just get your base and

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.640 
straight and then just get your base and
put<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.620> lid<00:05:02.860> right<00:05:03.460> over<00:05:03.850> it<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:05.470> can

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
put the lid right over it and you can

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.860 
put the lid right over it and you can
put<00:05:05.890> whatever<00:05:06.100> you<00:05:06.340> want<00:05:06.490> to<00:05:06.940> in<00:05:07.150> this<00:05:07.330> you<00:05:07.690> can

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
put whatever you want to in this you can

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.360 
put whatever you want to in this you can
give<00:05:08.020> away<00:05:08.230> as<00:05:08.410> a<00:05:08.440> little<00:05:08.680> present<00:05:09.130> or
