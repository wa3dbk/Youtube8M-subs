filing<00:02:13.390> by<00:02:13.780> going<00:02:14.290> across<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:15.099> free<00:02:15.340> edge<00:02:15.489> in

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
filing by going across the free edge in

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.630 
filing by going across the free edge in
the<00:02:15.879> same<00:02:16.120> direction<00:02:16.569> that<00:02:17.170> will<00:02:17.980> prevent<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
the same direction that will prevent the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.300

for the base coat
a<00:02:25.390> lot<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.170> women<00:02:26.650> skip<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.430> step<00:02:27.670> which<00:02:27.940> I

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
a lot of women skip this step which I

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.050 
a lot of women skip this step which I

using dark polish it's really important

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.970 
using dark polish it's really important
to<00:02:34.480> protect<00:02:34.810> your<00:02:34.930> nails<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.470> they<00:02:35.769> don't

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
turn yellow so an important step with

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.160 
turn yellow so an important step with
every<00:02:38.620> part<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.190> your<00:02:39.489> polishing<00:02:40.269> process<00:02:40.659> is

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
every part of your polishing process is

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.729 
every part of your polishing process is
to<00:02:41.549> start<00:02:42.549> by<00:02:43.090> going<00:02:43.390> across<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:44.319> free<00:02:44.560> edge

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
to start by going across the free edge

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.339 
to start by going across the free edge
first<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> reason<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.599> go<00:02:46.750> across<00:02:47.049> the

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
first so the reason you go across the

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.589 
first so the reason you go across the
free<00:02:47.560> edge<00:02:47.739> is<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.280> prevent<00:02:48.640> water<00:02:49.420> damage

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
free edge is to prevent water damage

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.130
