I<00:00:36.940> just<00:00:37.440> sandblasted<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.469> chrome<00:00:38.950> off<00:00:39.160> of

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
I just sandblasted the chrome off of

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.090 
I just sandblasted the chrome off of
them<00:00:39.550> because<00:00:40.329> I<00:00:40.420> could<00:00:40.629> and<00:00:41.020> paint<00:00:41.920> it<00:00:42.010> in

the<00:00:45.550> thing<00:00:45.760> about<00:00:45.940> these<00:00:46.120> tires<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.809> wheels

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the thing about these tires and wheels

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.369 
the thing about these tires and wheels
when<00:00:48.160> you<00:00:48.250> do<00:00:48.430> this<00:00:48.579> combo<00:00:49.120> it<00:00:49.870> doesn't<00:00:50.230> seem

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
when you do this combo it doesn't seem

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.779 
when you do this combo it doesn't seem
like<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.649> wheels<00:00:50.860> and<00:00:51.160> tires<00:00:51.399> are<00:00:51.610> going<00:00:51.730> to

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
like the wheels and tires are going to

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.959 
like the wheels and tires are going to
mesh<00:00:51.969> upright<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:53.710> I<00:00:53.739> did<00:00:54.100> is<00:00:54.309> I<00:00:54.460> just<00:00:54.489> glued

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
mesh upright what I did is I just glued

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.410 
mesh upright what I did is I just glued
the<00:00:55.840> outside<00:00:56.379> bead<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:57.039> then<00:00:58.000> once<00:00:58.239> it<00:00:58.390> was

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
the outside bead and then once it was

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.220 
the outside bead and then once it was
good<00:00:58.719> and<00:00:58.809> dry<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.649> I<00:01:00.070> flipped<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:00.489> over<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
good and dry and I flipped it over to to

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.380 
good and dry and I flipped it over to to
do<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.469> inside<00:01:02.890> what<00:01:03.699> I<00:01:03.730> noticed<00:01:04.089> is<00:01:04.210> there's

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
do the inside what I noticed is there's

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.500 
do the inside what I noticed is there's
about<00:01:04.510> an<00:01:04.750> inch<00:01:04.989> gap<00:01:05.290> in<00:01:05.590> between<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.850> tire

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
about an inch gap in between the tire

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.170 
about an inch gap in between the tire
bead<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.439> wheel<00:01:08.590> itself<00:01:09.040> so<00:01:09.880> what<00:01:10.030> I<00:01:10.060> did

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
bead and the wheel itself so what I did

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.300 
bead and the wheel itself so what I did
is<00:01:10.540> I<00:01:10.659> just<00:01:10.689> set<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.260> on<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.409> roll<00:01:11.680> of<00:01:11.799> tape<00:01:12.040> that

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
is I just set it on a roll of tape that

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.499 
is I just set it on a roll of tape that
was<00:01:12.400> relatively<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.090> same<00:01:13.210> size<00:01:13.450> diameter<00:01:14.110> as

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
was relatively the same size diameter as

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.679 
was relatively the same size diameter as
the<00:01:16.509> wheel<00:01:16.750> and<00:01:17.080> was<00:01:17.470> able<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.740> push<00:01:18.009> it<00:01:18.159> down

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the wheel and was able to push it down

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.440 
the wheel and was able to push it down
enough<00:01:19.689> to<00:01:19.990> get<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.619> good<00:01:20.880> layer<00:01:21.880> of<00:01:21.909> glue<00:01:22.270> in

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
enough to get a good layer of glue in

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.859 
enough to get a good layer of glue in
there<00:01:22.630> some<00:01:22.960> CA<00:01:23.200> glue<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:24.479> worked<00:01:25.479> that<00:01:25.659> bead

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
there some CA glue and worked that bead

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.219 
there some CA glue and worked that bead
into<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.500> end<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.130> rim<00:01:27.540> okay<00:01:28.540> now<00:01:28.960> let's

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
into the end of the rim okay now let's

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.800 
into the end of the rim okay now let's
get<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.560> meat<00:01:29.799> and<00:01:29.829> potatoes<00:01:30.369> of<00:01:30.400> this

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
get to the meat and potatoes of this

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.840 
get to the meat and potatoes of this
take<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.840> look<00:01:32.049> under<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.350> hood<00:01:32.439> here<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.070> when

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
don't really need how do you wire a

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
motor to rotate backwards since these

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.880 
motor to rotate backwards since these
are<00:03:53.500> counter<00:03:53.800> rotating<00:03:54.900> motors<00:03:55.900> motor<00:03:56.680> that

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
are counter rotating motors motor that

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.720 
are counter rotating motors motor that

it's<00:03:58.300> very<00:03:58.720> simple<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.350> reverse<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.860> polarity

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
it's very simple to reverse the polarity

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.060 
it's very simple to reverse the polarity
of<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.550> motor<00:04:00.940> is<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.900> just<00:04:02.140> switch<00:04:02.380> two<00:04:02.800> of

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
of that motor is you just switch two of

cool<00:04:25.750> thing<00:04:25.960> that<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.200> found<00:04:26.440> out<00:04:26.650> about

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
cool thing that I found out about

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.730 
cool thing that I found out about
doing<00:04:28.120> this<00:04:28.270> setup<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:28.900> actually<00:04:29.050> did<00:04:29.380> this<00:04:29.530> set

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
doing this setup I actually did this set

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.470 
doing this setup I actually did this set
up<00:04:29.860> in<00:04:30.010> my<00:04:30.660> villain<00:04:31.660> is<00:04:32.820> when<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:33.970> have<00:04:34.210> these

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
up in my villain is when you have these

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.550 
up in my villain is when you have these
es<00:04:35.050> es<00:04:35.350> hooked<00:04:36.130> into<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.430> wine<00:04:36.669> harness<00:04:37.560> that's

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
es es hooked into a wine harness that's

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.930 
es es hooked into a wine harness that's
kind<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:38.919> hard<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.130> see<00:04:39.340> here

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
kind of hard to see here

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.710 
kind of hard to see here
why<00:04:40.450> harnesses<00:04:40.960> down<00:04:41.139> in<00:04:41.350> here<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:42.540> that<00:04:43.540> wire

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
why harnesses down in here and that wire

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.500 
why harnesses down in here and that wire
harness<00:04:44.230> the<00:04:45.160> single<00:04:45.520> end<00:04:45.730> just<00:04:46.060> goes<00:04:46.240> into

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
harness the single end just goes into

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.220 
harness the single end just goes into
your<00:04:46.600> receiver<00:04:46.930> box<00:04:47.230> into<00:04:48.160> your<00:04:48.190> channel<00:04:48.580> to

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
your receiver box into your channel to

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.230 
your receiver box into your channel to
it<00:04:50.260> everything<00:04:51.100> works<00:04:51.310> exactly<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.910> same<00:04:52.000> as

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
it everything works exactly the same as

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.310 
it everything works exactly the same as
a<00:04:52.450> single<00:04:52.870> motor

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
a single motor

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.580 
a single motor
you<00:04:53.800> just<00:04:54.070> have<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.450> to<00:04:55.450> ASCs<00:04:55.930> and<00:04:56.139> two<00:04:56.260> motors

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
you just have to to ASCs and two motors

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.220 
you just have to to ASCs and two motors
but<00:04:57.250> one<00:04:57.400> thing<00:04:57.520> I<00:04:57.639> found<00:04:57.790> out<00:04:58.000> when<00:04:58.210> you<00:04:58.419> hook

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
but one thing I found out when you hook

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.409 
but one thing I found out when you hook
the<00:04:59.440> two<00:04:59.620> up<00:04:59.800> together<00:04:59.979> the<00:05:00.430> two<00:05:00.580> ESC<00:05:01.150> is<00:05:01.180> up

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
the two up together the two ESC is up

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.500 
the two up together the two ESC is up
together<00:05:01.780> when<00:05:02.380> you<00:05:02.500> turn<00:05:02.740> one<00:05:03.040> on<00:05:03.510> through

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
together when you turn one on through

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.330 
together when you turn one on through
the<00:05:04.630> white<00:05:04.810> harness<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:05.440> into<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:05.710> receiver

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
the white harness and into the receiver

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.030 
the white harness and into the receiver
it<00:05:06.700> turns<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.210> other<00:05:07.330> ESC<00:05:07.930> on<00:05:07.960> -<00:05:08.380> so<00:05:08.770> you<00:05:08.830> don't

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
it turns the other ESC on - so you don't

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.680 
it turns the other ESC on - so you don't
have<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.250> worry<00:05:09.430> about<00:05:09.580> turning<00:05:09.910> both<00:05:10.300> of<00:05:10.510> them

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
have to worry about turning both of them

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.840 
have to worry about turning both of them
on<00:05:10.780> at<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:10.960> same<00:05:11.169> time<00:05:11.229> or<00:05:11.950> don't<00:05:12.639> need<00:05:12.760> to

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
on at the same time or don't need to

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.670 
on at the same time or don't need to
turn<00:05:13.060> one<00:05:13.240> on<00:05:13.270> before<00:05:13.600> the<00:05:13.900> other<00:05:14.110> or<00:05:14.410> anything

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
turn one on before the other or anything

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.530 
turn one on before the other or anything
like<00:05:14.889> that<00:05:14.950> you<00:05:15.340> turn<00:05:15.550> one<00:05:15.729> on<00:05:15.940> and<00:05:16.240> it<00:05:16.360> turns

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
like that you turn one on and it turns

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.120 
like that you turn one on and it turns
the<00:05:16.690> other<00:05:16.900> one<00:05:17.050> on<00:05:17.169> and<00:05:17.410> they're<00:05:17.560> ready<00:05:17.800> to<00:05:17.889> go

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
the other one on and they're ready to go

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.409 
the other one on and they're ready to go
and<00:05:18.400> that's<00:05:19.180> pretty<00:05:19.510> much<00:05:19.630> it<00:05:20.110> that's<00:05:21.419> that's

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
and that's pretty much it that's that's

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.840 
and that's pretty much it that's that's
how<00:05:22.570> I<00:05:22.600> did<00:05:22.900> it<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:23.350> really<00:05:24.310> like<00:05:24.460> it

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
how I did it I really like it

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.030 
how I did it I really like it
jlx<00:05:25.570> done<00:05:25.750> it<00:05:25.900> to<00:05:25.990> his<00:05:26.200> and<00:05:26.470> he<00:05:26.590> really<00:05:26.830> likes

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
jlx done it to his and he really likes

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.830 
jlx done it to his and he really likes
it<00:05:27.160> -<00:05:27.340> it<00:05:27.580> works<00:05:27.760> really<00:05:28.000> well<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.270> motors

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
it - it works really well the motors

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.620 
it - it works really well the motors
don't<00:05:29.110> get<00:05:29.290> hot<00:05:29.560> I<00:05:30.250> think<00:05:30.820> with<00:05:30.970> that<00:05:31.000> gearing

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
don't get hot I think with that gearing

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:41.510 
don't get hot I think with that gearing
the<00:05:32.220> 19<00:05:39.600> mm

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
the 19 mm

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.310 
the 19 mm
it<00:05:42.520> still<00:05:42.820> has<00:05:43.000> plenty<00:05:43.210> of<00:05:43.419> torque<00:05:43.720> you<00:05:44.110> get<00:05:44.200> it

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
it still has plenty of torque you get it

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.980 
it still has plenty of torque you get it
still<00:05:44.620> has<00:05:44.800> plenty<00:05:45.039> of<00:05:45.250> speed<00:05:45.520> I<00:05:45.850> really<00:05:46.810> like

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
still has plenty of speed I really like

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.890 
still has plenty of speed I really like
this<00:05:47.169> setup<00:05:47.410> it<00:05:47.680> works<00:05:47.860> good<00:05:48.300> I'll<00:05:49.300> show<00:05:49.630> you

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
this setup it works good I'll show you

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.080 
this setup it works good I'll show you
some<00:05:50.530> of<00:05:50.560> it<00:05:50.770> running<00:05:51.490> here<00:05:51.669> in<00:05:51.760> just<00:05:51.910> a<00:05:51.970> few

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
some of it running here in just a few
