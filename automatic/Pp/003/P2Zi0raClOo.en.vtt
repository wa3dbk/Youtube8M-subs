crazy speed one of the fastest cars in

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.200 
crazy speed one of the fastest cars in
the<00:00:57.239> game<00:00:57.539> at<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> moment<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.620> built<00:00:59.250> so

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the game at the moment that I built so

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.760 
the game at the moment that I built so
I'm<00:01:00.329> pretty<00:01:00.480> proud<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.989> tune<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.500> I

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
I'm pretty proud of this tune and I

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.870 
I'm pretty proud of this tune and I
spent<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.789> lot<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.180> time<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.870> especially

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
spent a lot of time in it especially

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.700 
spent a lot of time in it especially
especially<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> tire<00:01:06.750> pressure<00:01:07.110> because

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
especially on the tire pressure because

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.250 
especially on the tire pressure because
for<00:01:08.430> most<00:01:08.610> drag<00:01:09.060> builds<00:01:09.510> or<00:01:09.630> most<00:01:09.960> top-end

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
for most drag builds or most top-end

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.230 
for most drag builds or most top-end
speed<00:01:10.560> builds<00:01:11.189> tire<00:01:11.909> pressure<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.890> everything

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
speed builds tire pressure is everything

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.580 
speed builds tire pressure is everything
if<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.390> don't<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.659> your<00:01:15.780> tire<00:01:15.990> pressure<00:01:16.259> set

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
if you don't have your tire pressure set

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.179 
if you don't have your tire pressure set
correctly<00:01:17.689> man<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.960> could<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.650> lose<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
correctly man you could you can lose the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.210 
correctly man you could you can lose the
race<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.820> easily<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.509> tied<00:01:22.110> pressure<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.770> one

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
race so easily so tied pressure is one

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.609 
race so easily so tied pressure is one
of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> main<00:01:24.090> elements<00:01:24.750> when<00:01:25.470> you're

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
of the main elements when you're

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.249 
of the main elements when you're
building<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.280> top-end<00:01:26.850> speed<00:01:27.119> car<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> dry

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
building a top-end speed car or a dry

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.550 
building a top-end speed car or a dry
car<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> did<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.570> case<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.380> you

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
car so what I did in this case if you

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.240 
car so what I did in this case if you
can<00:01:31.710> follow<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.100> follow<00:01:32.520> along<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.180> actually

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
can follow on follow along I actually

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.800 
can follow on follow along I actually
put<00:01:35.250> drag<00:01:35.460> tires<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:36.000> here<00:01:36.210> mainly<00:01:36.659> because

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
put drag tires on here mainly because

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.859 
put drag tires on here mainly because
I'm<00:01:37.259> gonna<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.680> doing<00:01:37.850> straight

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
I'm gonna be doing straight

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.640 
I'm gonna be doing straight
straightaways<00:01:39.869> pretty<00:01:40.110> much<00:01:40.229> I'm<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.530> gonna

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
straightaways pretty much I'm not gonna

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.370 
straightaways pretty much I'm not gonna
be<00:01:40.860> doing<00:01:41.220> any<00:01:41.520> cornering<00:01:42.150> or<00:01:42.270> anything<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
be doing any cornering or anything so to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.980 
be doing any cornering or anything so to
get<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> fastest<00:01:44.430> launch<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> most<00:01:45.540> grip

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
get the fastest launch and the most grip

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.700 
get the fastest launch and the most grip
the<00:01:46.890> drag<00:01:47.100> tires<00:01:47.340> were<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.850> perfect<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.350> by

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the drag tires were just perfect and by

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.620 
the drag tires were just perfect and by
doing<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.090> make<00:01:51.270> sure<00:01:51.450> you're

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
doing that you have to make sure you're

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.030 
doing that you have to make sure you're
heating<00:01:51.869> up<00:01:52.049> your<00:01:52.229> tires<00:01:52.500> which<00:01:52.860> you'll<00:01:53.009> see

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
heating up your tires which you'll see

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.850 
heating up your tires which you'll see
in<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.399> few<00:01:53.430> moments<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.140> when

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
in a few moments that I do that when

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.560 
in a few moments that I do that when
you're<00:01:55.979> about<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.369> launch<00:01:56.579> which<00:01:57.090> really

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
you're about to launch which really

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.569 
you're about to launch which really
really<00:01:57.780> helps<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.320> get<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.950> good<00:01:59.159> launch<00:01:59.340> off

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
really helps you get a good launch off

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.450 
really helps you get a good launch off
your<00:01:59.790> start<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.140> well<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.950> can<00:02:02.130> see<00:02:02.310> by

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
your start and as well you can see by

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.340 
your start and as well you can see by
the<00:02:02.520> rim<00:02:02.850> size<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> front<00:02:04.020> rims

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
the rim size I have the front rims

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.800 
the rim size I have the front rims
really<00:02:04.829> really<00:02:05.070> big<00:02:05.310> right<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.210> back<00:02:06.509> rim

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
really really big right and the back rim

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.690 
really really big right and the back rim
is<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.320> small<00:02:07.649> well<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.489> is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
is really really small well that is

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.260 
is really really small well that is
because<00:02:09.170> my<00:02:10.170> psi<00:02:10.739> for<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> front<00:02:11.520> rims

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
because my psi for the front rims

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.660 
because my psi for the front rims
are<00:02:12.360> really<00:02:13.290> really<00:02:13.530> high<00:02:13.740> Ivan<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.220> think<00:02:14.550> it

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
are really really high Ivan I think it

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.390 
are really really high Ivan I think it
said<00:02:15.030> 35<00:02:15.840> psi<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.830> they're<00:02:17.010> really<00:02:17.190> really

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
said 35 psi so they're really really

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.850 
said 35 psi so they're really really
hard<00:02:17.520> right<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.330> then<00:02:18.960> I<00:02:19.050> have<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.290> back<00:02:19.530> ones

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
hard right and then I have the back ones

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.030 
hard right and then I have the back ones
really<00:02:20.400> soft<00:02:20.820> at<00:02:21.090> 15<00:02:21.480> psi<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.530> when<00:02:22.680> they<00:02:22.770> start

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
really soft at 15 psi so when they start

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.520 
really soft at 15 psi so when they start
to<00:02:23.160> heat<00:02:23.370> up<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:24.450> PSI<00:02:24.900> will<00:02:25.140> go<00:02:25.230> up<00:02:25.350> to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
to heat up the PSI will go up to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.160 
to heat up the PSI will go up to
probably<00:02:25.860> 30<00:02:26.400> psi<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.270> back<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
probably 30 psi in the back and the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
probably 30 psi in the back and the
front<00:02:28.290> tires<00:02:28.650> maybe<00:02:29.100> around<00:02:29.390> 45<00:02:30.390> 50<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
front tires maybe around 45 50 and the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.160 
front tires maybe around 45 50 and the
reason<00:02:32.430> why<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:32.550> did<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.820> was<00:02:33.210> because<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.960> want

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
reason why I did that was because I want

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.860 
reason why I did that was because I want
the<00:02:34.260> back<00:02:34.470> tires<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.970> get<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> good<00:02:36.330> grip<00:02:36.660> on

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
the back tires to to get a good grip on

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.770 
the back tires to to get a good grip on
the<00:02:37.020> ground<00:02:37.140> but<00:02:38.130> then<00:02:38.370> once<00:02:39.180> I'm<00:02:39.420> starting<00:02:39.690> to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
the ground but then once I'm starting to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.020 
the ground but then once I'm starting to
catch<00:02:39.960> some<00:02:40.170> speed<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.010> front<00:02:41.370> tires<00:02:41.610> being

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
catch some speed the front tires being

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.110 
catch some speed the front tires being
so<00:02:42.300> hard<00:02:42.660> yes<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:44.010> cornering<00:02:44.400> will<00:02:44.610> be<00:02:44.730> pretty

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
so hard yes the cornering will be pretty

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.850 
so hard yes the cornering will be pretty
bad<00:02:45.390> on<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.720> front<00:02:45.960> but<00:02:46.140> I'm<00:02:46.230> not<00:02:46.320> cornering

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
bad on the front but I'm not cornering

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.710 
bad on the front but I'm not cornering
right<00:02:47.010> I'm<00:02:47.130> just<00:02:47.280> going<00:02:47.430> straight<00:02:47.670> down<00:02:47.850> so

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
right I'm just going straight down so

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.720 
right I'm just going straight down so
having<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.230> nice<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.620> hard<00:02:49.800> will<00:02:50.070> just<00:02:50.250> make

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
having the nice and hard will just make

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.390 
having the nice and hard will just make
it<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:51.060> nice<00:02:51.300> smooth<00:02:52.020> straight<00:02:52.500> away<00:02:52.740> trying<00:02:53.340> to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
it a nice smooth straight away trying to

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.310 
it a nice smooth straight away trying to
get<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.640> fastest<00:02:54.030> speed<00:02:54.120> possible<00:02:54.240> which<00:02:55.200> I

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
get the fastest speed possible which I

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.410 
get the fastest speed possible which I
was<00:02:55.470> able<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.710> accomplish<00:02:56.280> here<00:02:56.460> getting<00:02:57.300> it

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
was able to accomplish here getting it

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.290 
was able to accomplish here getting it
to<00:02:57.540> 272<00:02:58.470> miles<00:02:58.980> per<00:02:59.280> hour<00:02:59.400> that's<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.850> crazy

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
to 272 miles per hour that's a crazy

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.530 
to 272 miles per hour that's a crazy
speed<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.440> yes<00:03:02.340> as<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.030> can<00:03:03.060> see<00:03:03.300> right<00:03:03.450> there

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
speed so yes as you can see right there

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.270 
speed so yes as you can see right there
the<00:03:03.750> two<00:03:03.960> in<00:03:04.020> says<00:03:04.380> two<00:03:04.680> hundred<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:04.950> seventy

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
the two in says two hundred and seventy

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.580 
the two in says two hundred and seventy
one<00:03:05.490> point<00:03:05.730> four<00:03:06.120> but<00:03:06.720> getting<00:03:06.930> on<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.290> track

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
one point four but getting on the track

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.520 
one point four but getting on the track
I<00:03:07.800> was<00:03:07.950> able<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.190> get<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.510> 272<00:03:09.510> miles<00:03:10.170> per

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
I was able to get it to 272 miles per

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.200 
I was able to get it to 272 miles per
hour<00:03:10.680> as<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.400> can<00:03:11.550> see<00:03:11.670> right<00:03:11.820> here<00:03:11.880> I'm

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
hour as you can see right here I'm

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.330 
hour as you can see right here I'm
warming<00:03:12.510> up<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.630> tires<00:03:12.770> but<00:03:13.770> it's<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.010> little

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
warming up the tires but it's a little

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.920 
warming up the tires but it's a little
bit<00:03:14.430> difficult<00:03:14.970> because<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.720> an

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
bit difficult because this is an

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.650 
bit difficult because this is an
all-wheel<00:03:16.140> drive<00:03:16.560> car<00:03:16.830> now<00:03:17.550> I<00:03:17.940> know<00:03:18.240> a<00:03:18.390> lot<00:03:18.540> of

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
all-wheel drive car now I know a lot of

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.860 
all-wheel drive car now I know a lot of
people<00:03:18.990> there's<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> big<00:03:19.620> controversy<00:03:20.100> over

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
people there's a big controversy over

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.910 
people there's a big controversy over
rear-wheel<00:03:21.870> drive<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.500> that's<00:03:22.590> what<00:03:22.830> you

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
rear-wheel drive and that's what you

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.290 
rear-wheel drive and that's what you
should<00:03:22.950> be<00:03:23.130> doing<00:03:23.220> when<00:03:23.640> you're<00:03:23.790> building

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
should be doing when you're building

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.040 
should be doing when you're building
these<00:03:24.450> type<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:25.020> cars<00:03:25.320> right<00:03:25.850> honestly<00:03:27.050> I

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
these type of cars right honestly I

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.630 
these type of cars right honestly I
don't<00:03:28.230> know<00:03:28.410> what<00:03:28.560> its<00:03:28.680> what's<00:03:29.340> been<00:03:29.490> up<00:03:29.610> with

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
don't know what its what's been up with

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.510 
don't know what its what's been up with
this<00:03:30.000> since<00:03:30.510> Forza<00:03:30.930> 4<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.470> for<00:03:31.980> some<00:03:32.160> reason

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
this since Forza 4 but for some reason

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.420 
this since Forza 4 but for some reason
whenever<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.850> use<00:03:33.090> all-wheel<00:03:33.690> drive<00:03:34.070> it's<00:03:35.070> been

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
whenever I use all-wheel drive it's been

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.270 
whenever I use all-wheel drive it's been
it's<00:03:35.820> been<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.090> tad<00:03:36.420> faster<00:03:36.860> that's<00:03:37.860> just<00:03:38.100> me

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
it's been a tad faster that's just me

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.949 
it's been a tad faster that's just me
though<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:38.640> if<00:03:38.790> rear-wheel<00:03:39.240> drive<00:03:39.270> works<00:03:39.720> for

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
though but if rear-wheel drive works for

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.990 
though but if rear-wheel drive works for
you<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.350> it's<00:03:40.650> making<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.310> go<00:03:41.490> really<00:03:41.700> fast
