anyways let's start off here quickly
with<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.910> class<00:00:18.210> setup<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.990> what<00:00:19.199> we're

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
with the class setup and what we're

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.920 
with the class setup and what we're
going<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.770> need<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.580> trick<00:00:20.789> shot<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.359> the

going to need for this trick shot so the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.750 
going to need for this trick shot so the
main<00:00:22.260> thing<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.619> you're<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.340> need<00:00:23.490> for

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
main thing that you're going to need for

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.040 
main thing that you're going to need for
this<00:00:23.910> trick<00:00:24.060> shot<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.510> some<00:00:24.720> sort<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
this trick shot is some sort of a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.320 
this trick shot is some sort of a
secondary<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.830> uses<00:00:26.189> select<00:00:26.580> fire<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.180> this

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
secondary that uses select fire in this

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.080 
secondary that uses select fire in this
case<00:00:27.390> I'm<00:00:27.810> using<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.230> mp7<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.279> you're<00:00:29.910> also

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
case I'm using the mp7 and you're also

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.269 
case I'm using the mp7 and you're also
going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.510> probably<00:00:30.779> want<00:00:31.080> shock<00:00:31.470> charges<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
going to probably want shock charges and

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.459 
going to probably want shock charges and
fast<00:00:32.550> hands<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.360> make<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.350> know

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
fast hands just to make it that you know

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.979 
fast hands just to make it that you know
you<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.770> hence<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> swap<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.870> obviously<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
you can hence the swap and obviously a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.510 
you can hence the swap and obviously a
sniper<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:37.710> other<00:00:37.860> than<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.160> that's<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
sniper but other than that that's the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.130 
sniper but other than that that's the
class<00:00:38.700> I'm<00:00:38.940> using<00:00:39.239> right<00:00:39.540> now<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.020> guys

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140

class I'm using right now but you guys
will<00:00:40.379> probably<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.890> know<00:00:40.980> change<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.460> up<00:00:41.579> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
will probably you know change that up a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.160 
will probably you know change that up a
little<00:00:41.760> bit<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.090> whatever<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.450> guys<00:00:42.660> like<00:00:42.960> so

you're going to press left on the d-pad

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.319 
you're going to press left on the d-pad
to<00:02:00.990> get<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.649> select<00:02:01.950> fire<00:02:02.159> animation<00:02:02.790> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
to get the select fire animation you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.620 
to get the select fire animation you
then<00:02:03.689> want<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> press<00:02:04.380> Y<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.430> then<00:02:06.210> you

then want to press Y and then you
probably<00:02:06.960> are<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.500> insta<00:02:08.069> swap<00:02:08.340> back<00:02:08.640> so

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
probably are going to insta swap back so

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.390 
probably are going to insta swap back so
it's<00:02:09.030> going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.450> left<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.319> d-pad<00:02:10.470> Y<00:02:11.009> so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it's going to be left on the d-pad Y so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.770 
it's going to be left on the d-pad Y so
that<00:02:11.430> will<00:02:11.640> put<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.940> into<00:02:12.060> your<00:02:12.180> sniper<00:02:12.480> and

this fairly quick so left on the d-pad

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.390 
this fairly quick so left on the d-pad
why<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.900> or<00:02:16.140> triangle<00:02:16.650> sorry<00:02:16.830> whatever<00:02:17.070> will

what console you're playing on so left

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.090 
what console you're playing on so left
on<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> d-pad<00:02:20.580> why<00:02:21.330> your<00:02:21.540> triangle<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.320> then

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
on the d-pad why your triangle and then

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.120 
on the d-pad why your triangle and then
you're<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.580> insta<00:02:24.240> swap<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.780> if<00:02:25.650> done

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
you're going to insta swap and if done

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.900 
you're going to insta swap and if done
correctly<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:27.270> should<00:02:28.050> get<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.700> know<00:02:29.790> an

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
correctly you should get you know an

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.730 
correctly you should get you know an
animation<00:02:30.360> where<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.780> does<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
animation where it does the the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.470 
animation where it does the the
select-fire<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.520> then<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.850> can<00:02:33.060> swap<00:02:33.330> so

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
select-fire and then the can swap so

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.270 
select-fire and then the can swap so
let's<00:02:33.660> see<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:33.870> can<00:02:33.960> do<00:02:34.020> this<00:02:34.110> here<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.470> left

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
let's see if we can do this here so left

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.570 
let's see if we can do this here so left
on<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.490> d-pad<00:02:35.640> why<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:37.070> unfortunately<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.160> did

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
on the d-pad why and unfortunately I did

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.770 
on the d-pad why and unfortunately I did
the<00:02:38.670> can<00:02:38.850> swap<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.150> little<00:02:39.180> bit<00:02:39.450> earlier<00:02:39.660> there

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
the can swap a little bit earlier there

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.940 
the can swap a little bit earlier there
so<00:02:39.900> I'll<00:02:39.990> try<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.230> again<00:02:40.350> here<00:02:40.650> for<00:02:40.830> you

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
so I'll try it again here for you

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.070 
so I'll try it again here for you
quickly<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> little<00:02:41.670> bit<00:02:41.760> hard<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.330> so

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
quickly it's a little bit hard to do so

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.390 
quickly it's a little bit hard to do so
again<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.410> want<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.590> shoot<00:02:43.770> out<00:02:43.860> all<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.160> left

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
again you want to shoot out all the left

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.980 
again you want to shoot out all the left
or<00:02:44.670> all<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.880> ammo<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:45.390> then<00:02:45.540> want<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.780> pick<00:02:45.900> up

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
or all the ammo you then want to pick up

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.090

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
showing you guys I do this select fire

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.600 
showing you guys I do this select fire
on<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.530> ground<00:03:04.800> now<00:03:05.010> if<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.190> guys<00:03:05.310> practice

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
on the ground now if you guys practice

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.670 
on the ground now if you guys practice
this<00:03:05.910> enough<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.450> will<00:03:06.630> be<00:03:06.780> able<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.350> get<00:03:07.500> good

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
this enough you will be able to get good

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.230 
this enough you will be able to get good
enough<00:03:07.890> probably<00:03:08.310> where<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.880> do<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.060> all

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
enough probably where you can do it all

enough probably where you can do it all
in<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.870> air<00:03:10.020> but<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.620> going<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.010> take<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.310> lot

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
in the air but it is going to take a lot

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.130 
in the air but it is going to take a lot
of<00:03:11.580> time<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.210> I<00:03:12.420> mean<00:03:12.630> if<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.810> could<00:03:12.930> pull<00:03:13.110> it

of time and I mean if you could pull it

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.360 
of time and I mean if you could pull it
off<00:03:13.290> though<00:03:13.470> would<00:03:13.560> be<00:03:13.680> pretty<00:03:13.860> sick<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:14.250> I'll

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
sort of just common sense right I mean

that's going to put your two your sniper
and<00:03:49.590> then<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.400> are<00:03:50.550> going<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.910> just<00:03:51.060> insta

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
and then you are going to just insta

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.270 
and then you are going to just insta
swap<00:03:51.660> into<00:03:52.140> your<00:03:52.290> can<00:03:52.500> swap<00:03:52.770> and<00:03:52.920> then<00:03:52.980> insta

swap into your can swap and then insta

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.030 
swap into your can swap and then insta
swap<00:03:53.489> out<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.820> so<00:03:53.940> left<00:03:54.090> on<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.270> d-pad<00:03:54.390> Y

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
swap out of it so left on the d-pad Y

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.770 
swap out of it so left on the d-pad Y
see<00:03:56.040> sometimes<00:03:56.520> it<00:03:56.730> doesn't<00:03:56.940> do<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.330> can<00:03:57.540> swap

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
see sometimes it doesn't do the can swap

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.030 
see sometimes it doesn't do the can swap
and<00:03:57.900> that's<00:03:58.020> what's<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.260> little<00:03:58.380> bit<00:03:58.560> strange<00:03:58.830> I

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
and that's what's a little bit strange I

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.770 
and that's what's a little bit strange I
think<00:03:59.580> you<00:03:59.640> have<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.850> do<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.060> really<00:04:00.150> fast<00:04:00.270> so

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
think you have to do it really fast so

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.660 
think you have to do it really fast so

of<00:04:02.730> challenging<00:04:03.270> for<00:04:03.390> me<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:03.660> know<00:04:03.780> talk

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
of challenging for me to you know talk

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.930 
of challenging for me to you know talk
about<00:04:04.410> this<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.070> then<00:04:05.160> end<00:04:05.430> up<00:04:05.580> doing<00:04:05.820> it

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
about this and then end up doing it

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.390 
about this and then end up doing it
really<00:04:06.060> fast<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:06.930> if<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.739> doesn't<00:04:07.920> work<00:04:08.100> but

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
really fast so if it doesn't work but

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.680 
really fast so if it doesn't work but
I'll<00:04:08.489> give<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.730> shot<00:04:08.790> here<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:09.360> see<00:04:09.480> if<00:04:09.570> we

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
I'll give it a shot here and see if we

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.670 
I'll give it a shot here and see if we
can<00:04:09.780> get<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:09.989> going<00:04:10.020> so<00:04:10.290> you're<00:04:10.350> just<00:04:10.440> going<00:04:10.590> to

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
can get it going so you're just going to

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.270 
can get it going so you're just going to
let<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:10.890> real<00:04:11.130> Oh<00:04:11.250> completely<00:04:12.800> left<00:04:13.800> on<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
let it real Oh completely left on the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.520 
let it real Oh completely left on the
d-pad<00:04:14.550> and<00:04:15.060> then<00:04:15.330> Y<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.930> then<00:04:16.020> hints<00:04:16.230> to<00:04:16.320> swap

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
d-pad and then Y and then hints to swap

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.970 
d-pad and then Y and then hints to swap
ins<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.799> swap<00:04:17.040> so<00:04:17.640> left<00:04:17.850> on<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.030> d-pad<00:04:18.150> Y<00:04:18.540> and

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
ins to swap so left on the d-pad Y and

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.260 
ins to swap so left on the d-pad Y and
as<00:04:19.980> you<00:04:20.130> can<00:04:20.250> see<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.609> did<00:04:20.790> do<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.000> instance

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
as you can see it did do the instance

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.880 
as you can see it did do the instance
wop<00:04:21.390> there<00:04:21.539> unfortunately<00:04:22.020> I<00:04:22.109> spent<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.710> little

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
wop there unfortunately I spent a little

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.140 
wop there unfortunately I spent a little
bit<00:04:22.979> too<00:04:23.100> much<00:04:23.220> time<00:04:23.430> on<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.700> ground<00:04:23.940> there

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
bit too much time on the ground there

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.450 
bit too much time on the ground there
but<00:04:24.570> basically<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.320> is<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.620> shot<00:04:26.039> so<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.340> is

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
but basically that is the shot so it is

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.870 
but basically that is the shot so it is
sort<00:04:26.669> of

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
sort of

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.670 
sort of
