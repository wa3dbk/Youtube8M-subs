 transitable and resistant to 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.689
 various chemical products indicated 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.160
 for the covering of floors that are 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.919
 submitted to the action of agents 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.719

 entered is not limited 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.980
 practical advice can be applied on

 Spatulas clean air components 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:03.720
 until you get your concrete humanity 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.120
 should avoid contamination of the

 separate components with the mixture of 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.490
 they 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.340
 Mix three parts of component a with 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.230
 a part of the time component stir 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.440
 with a clean spatula until the 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.900
 mix be total and uniform prepare 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.590
 only the amount of mixture to be 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.960
 will use leave to rest from 20 to 30 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.880
 minutes for the induction to take place 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.430
 of the reaction 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.380
 of the accuracy and uniformity of 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.390
 mix and respect the time of 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.210
 induction depends the properties
