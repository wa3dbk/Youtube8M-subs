rally<00:00:16.470> came<00:00:17.160> from<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.850> new<00:00:18.060> targeting<00:00:18.510> scheme

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
rally came from a new targeting scheme

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.710 
rally came from a new targeting scheme
that<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.080> developed<00:00:19.500> about<00:00:19.740> six<00:00:20.070> months<00:00:20.369> ago

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
that we developed about six months ago

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.179 
that we developed about six months ago
the<00:00:21.720> targeting<00:00:22.109> scheme<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.590> called<00:00:22.650> vector

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the targeting scheme is called vector

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.939 
the targeting scheme is called vector
entity<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:24.689> wave<00:00:24.869> vector<00:00:25.199> entity<00:00:25.529> works<00:00:25.710> is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
entity the wave vector entity works is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.160 
entity the wave vector entity works is
very<00:00:25.980> similar<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.609> vector<00:00:27.060> targeting<00:00:27.539> that's

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
very similar to vector targeting that's

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.570 
very similar to vector targeting that's
currently<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.680> our<00:00:28.740> game<00:00:28.920> right<00:00:29.160> now<00:00:29.189> with

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
currently in our game right now with

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.279 
currently in our game right now with
vector<00:00:29.910> targeting<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.449> click<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> location

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
vector targeting you click a location

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.069 
vector targeting you click a location
and<00:00:31.439> drag<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.040> then<00:00:32.189> release<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:33.079> target

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
and drag and then release to target

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.049 
and drag and then release to target
something<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.620> direction<00:00:34.800> with<00:00:35.700> vector

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
something in that direction with vector

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.819 
something in that direction with vector
entity<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.570> essentially<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> same<00:00:37.350> thing

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
entity it's essentially the same thing

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.910 
entity it's essentially the same thing
except<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.460> first<00:00:39.149> target<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.780> hero<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.320> then

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
except you first target a hero and then

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.229 
except you first target a hero and then
drag<00:00:41.129> from<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> hero<00:00:43.940> coming<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.149> an

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
drag from the hero coming up with an

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
drag from the hero coming up with an
ability<00:00:45.480> from<00:00:45.840> vector<00:00:46.200> entity<00:00:46.559> was<00:00:46.680> very<00:00:46.920> easy

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
ability from vector entity was very easy

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.430 
ability from vector entity was very easy
as<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.910> leads<00:00:48.059> directly<00:00:48.270> into<00:00:48.690> being<00:00:49.140> able<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
as it leads directly into being able to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.380 
as it leads directly into being able to
push<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> hero<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.370> direction<00:00:50.550> or<00:00:50.910> another

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
push a hero in one direction or another

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.720 
push a hero in one direction or another
now<00:00:51.960> rally<00:00:52.230> was<00:00:52.530> created<00:00:52.980> from<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
now rally was created from this as a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.439 
now rally was created from this as a
hero<00:00:54.090> who<00:00:54.149> compels<00:00:54.750> his<00:00:54.930> allies<00:00:55.289> into<00:00:55.500> battle

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
hero who compels his allies into battle

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.819 
hero who compels his allies into battle
now<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.690> had<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> theme<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.170> rally<00:00:58.530> which

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
now that we had the theme of rally which

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.650 
now that we had the theme of rally which
is<00:00:58.980> sort<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.370> battle<00:00:59.760> leader<00:00:59.940> compelling

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
is sort of a battle leader compelling

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.689 
is sort of a battle leader compelling
his<00:01:00.780> allies<00:01:01.079> into<00:01:01.260> battle<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:02.219> decided<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
his allies into battle we decided to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.119 
his allies into battle we decided to
base<00:01:02.850> his<00:01:03.030> abilities<00:01:03.449> around<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.260> that

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
base his abilities around that and that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.039 
base his abilities around that and that
point<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.519> gave<00:01:05.700> him<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.240> couple<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.659> auras

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
point we gave him a couple of auras

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.080 
point we gave him a couple of auras
making<00:01:07.650> his<00:01:07.799> allies<00:01:08.400> stronger<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.060> his

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
making his allies stronger in his

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.480 
making his allies stronger in his
enemies<00:01:09.510> weaker<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:10.350> well<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.799> being<00:01:11.070> able<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
enemies weaker as well as being able to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.429 
enemies weaker as well as being able to
buff<00:01:11.729> his<00:01:11.909> allies<00:01:12.210> movement<00:01:12.659> speed<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.140> reduce

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
buff his allies movement speed or reduce

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.320 
buff his allies movement speed or reduce
his<00:01:13.590> enemy's<00:01:13.920> movement<00:01:14.310> speed<00:01:14.549> which<00:01:15.030> kind<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
his enemy's movement speed which kind of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.730 
his enemy's movement speed which kind of
makes<00:01:15.479> him<00:01:15.659> want<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:16.020> into<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> fray<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
makes him want to get into the fray of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.370 
makes him want to get into the fray of
the<00:01:16.860> battle<00:01:17.600> for<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> ultimate<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.170> went<00:01:19.320> with

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the battle for the ultimate we went with

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.460 
the battle for the ultimate we went with
a<00:01:19.439> small<00:01:19.890> AoE<00:01:20.310> big<00:01:21.180> cleave<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.990> front<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.350> them

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
a small AoE big cleave in front of them

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.160 
a small AoE big cleave in front of them
and<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.520> would<00:01:23.729> incentivize<00:01:24.119> him<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.840> catch

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and this would incentivize him to catch

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.440 
and this would incentivize him to catch
people<00:01:25.619> with<00:01:25.770> his<00:01:25.920> compell<00:01:26.310> ability<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.939> then

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
people with his compell ability and then

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420 
people with his compell ability and then
try<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:28.110> or<00:01:28.140> two<00:01:28.259> enemies<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
try and get one or two enemies in it and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.780 
try and get one or two enemies in it and
do<00:01:29.850> massive<00:01:30.360> damage<00:01:30.390> too<00:01:31.369> so<00:01:32.369> once<00:01:32.520> rally

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
do massive damage too so once rally

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.640 
do massive damage too so once rally
entered<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> super<00:01:33.900> beta-testers<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.590> we

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
entered the super beta-testers and we

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.080 
entered the super beta-testers and we
started<00:01:34.920> watching<00:01:35.130> him<00:01:35.400> play<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.850> real

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
started watching him play a lot of real

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.319 
started watching him play a lot of real
games<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:37.350> realized<00:01:37.740> quickly<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.549> hero<00:01:39.119> had

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
games we realized quickly that hero had

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.010 
games we realized quickly that hero had
two<00:01:39.689> main<00:01:39.960> roles<00:01:40.369> he<00:01:41.369> had<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:42.020> ganking

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
two main roles he had the ganking

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.139 
two main roles he had the ganking
ability<00:01:43.439> which<00:01:43.770> he<00:01:44.070> compelled<00:01:44.490> himself<00:01:44.880> into

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
ability which he compelled himself into

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.899 
ability which he compelled himself into
a<00:01:45.180> fight<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:46.530> altered<00:01:47.280> them<00:01:47.430> doing<00:01:47.729> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
a fight and then altered them doing a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.149 
a fight and then altered them doing a
ton<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.090> damage<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.659> them<00:01:48.840> he<00:01:49.409> also<00:01:49.560> had<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
ton of damage to them he also had the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.700 
ton of damage to them he also had the
teamfight<00:01:50.520> aspect<00:01:51.240> which<00:01:51.689> was<00:01:51.899> his<00:01:52.259> auras<00:01:52.680> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
teamfight aspect which was his auras and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.359 
teamfight aspect which was his auras and
his<00:01:52.950> ally<00:01:53.100> buffs<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.790> debuffs<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.680> ended

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
his ally buffs and debuffs so we ended

his ally buffs and debuffs so we ended
up<00:01:56.460> deciding<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.939> he<00:01:57.060> needed<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.479> change<00:01:57.869> he

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
up deciding that he needed to change he

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200 
up deciding that he needed to change he
needed<00:01:58.469> only<00:01:58.649> one<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.250> those<00:01:59.369> roles<00:01:59.700> because

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
needed only one of those roles because

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.940 
needed only one of those roles because
he<00:02:00.329> can't<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.689> two<00:02:00.869> things<00:02:00.899> as<00:02:01.409> well<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.710> he<00:02:01.829> was

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
he can't do two things as well as he was

doing<00:02:02.130> rule<00:02:02.820> strong<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:04.079> way<00:02:04.200> our<00:02:04.320> design

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
doing rule strong the way our design

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.530 
doing rule strong the way our design
team<00:02:04.829> works<00:02:05.100> really<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.270> all

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
