 folder where we have installed the gta 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.490

 [Music] 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.110

 [Music] 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.479

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:30.410
 like a minute 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:32.990

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.830
 to change the name of the author eye not 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.680

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.819
 importance 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:53.810
