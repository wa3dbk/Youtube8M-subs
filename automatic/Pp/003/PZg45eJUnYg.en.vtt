up<00:03:41.519> once<00:03:41.790> there's<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.239> little<00:03:42.450> bit<00:03:42.570> of

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
up once there's a little bit of

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.740 
up once there's a little bit of
stitching<00:03:42.870> there<00:03:43.380> but<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.610> have<00:03:45.000> actually

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
stitching there but I have actually

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.570 
stitching there but I have actually
fallen<00:03:46.049> over<00:03:46.440> quite<00:03:46.650> hard<00:03:46.950> in<00:03:47.100> these<00:03:47.280> jeans

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
fallen over quite hard in these jeans

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.600 
fallen over quite hard in these jeans
and<00:03:47.790> on<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.750> knees<00:03:49.019> you<00:03:49.500> can<00:03:49.860> see<00:03:50.250> there<00:03:50.459> is<00:03:50.580> a

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
and on the knees you can see there is a

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.130 
and on the knees you can see there is a
little<00:03:50.880> bit<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.209> wear<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:51.720> they<00:03:51.870> didn't

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
little bit of wear but they didn't

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.320 
little bit of wear but they didn't
actually<00:03:52.560> rip<00:03:52.769> or<00:03:53.040> anything<00:03:53.430> which<00:03:53.670> was<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.000> was

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
actually rip or anything which was I was

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.259 
actually rip or anything which was I was
quite<00:03:54.510> impressed<00:03:54.930> with<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.610> then<00:03:56.610> when<00:03:57.120> you

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
quite impressed with that then when you

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.759 
quite impressed with that then when you
when<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.570> have<00:03:57.810> them<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.410> can<00:03:58.560> see<00:03:58.739> that

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
when I have them on you can see that

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.050 
when I have them on you can see that
like<00:03:59.130> there's<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.519> little<00:03:59.820> bit<00:04:00.000> of

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
like there's a little bit of

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.000 
like there's a little bit of
discoloration<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.170> like<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.380> little<00:04:01.590> bit<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:01.950> a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
discoloration and like a little bit of a

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.400 
discoloration and like a little bit of a
white<00:04:02.190> mark<00:04:02.519> on<00:04:02.790> them<00:04:03.000> but<00:04:03.150> nothing<00:04:03.360> that<00:04:03.540> over

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
white mark on them but nothing that over

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.740 
white mark on them but nothing that over
noticeable<00:04:05.130> skinniness<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.360> something<00:04:06.630> that

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
noticeable skinniness is something that

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.110 
noticeable skinniness is something that
which<00:04:06.959> is<00:04:07.200> pretty<00:04:07.650> comparable<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.880> price

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
which is pretty comparable to the price

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.710 
which is pretty comparable to the price
of<00:04:09.150> my<00:04:09.630> top<00:04:10.040> needs<00:04:11.040> in<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.400> skinny<00:04:12.030> jean<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.630> my

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
of my top needs in a skinny jean and my

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.069 
of my top needs in a skinny jean and my
top<00:04:12.989> two<00:04:13.200> concerns<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:14.130> found<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.450> you'll

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
top two concerns I found that and you'll

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.469 
top two concerns I found that and you'll
see<00:04:16.320> in<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.650> clips<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:17.280> don't<00:04:18.180> know<00:04:18.269> whether

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
see in the clips I don't know whether

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.349 
see in the clips I don't know whether
it's<00:04:18.750> because<00:04:19.370> they<00:04:20.370> need<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.669> be<00:04:20.820> washed<00:04:21.060> more

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
it's because they need to be washed more

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.969 
it's because they need to be washed more
and<00:04:21.660> they<00:04:21.750> get<00:04:21.930> tighter<00:04:22.200> when<00:04:22.470> they<00:04:22.620> do<00:04:22.680> wash

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
and they get tighter when they do wash

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.650 
and they get tighter when they do wash
because<00:04:23.220> jeans<00:04:23.610> shrink<00:04:24.000> but

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
because jeans shrink but

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.440 
because jeans shrink but
these<00:04:26.320> jeans<00:04:26.740> from<00:04:27.040> Topman<00:04:27.430> these<00:04:27.700> ones<00:04:28.060> are<00:04:28.390> a

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
these jeans from Topman these ones are a

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.830 
these jeans from Topman these ones are a
bit<00:04:28.840> more<00:04:29.290> skinny<00:04:30.030> than<00:04:31.030> these<00:04:31.270> ones<00:04:31.510> from

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
bit more skinny than these ones from

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.770 
bit more skinny than these ones from
Topman<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.890> I've<00:04:33.070> had<00:04:33.610> these<00:04:33.760> longer<00:04:34.240> so<00:04:34.450> I<00:04:34.480> am

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
Topman and I've had these longer so I am

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.670 
Topman and I've had these longer so I am
taking<00:04:35.260> it<00:04:35.380> is<00:04:35.640> because<00:04:36.640> of<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:38.320> amount<00:04:38.500> of

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
taking it is because of the amount of

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.440 
taking it is because of the amount of
washes<00:04:39.100> that<00:04:39.280> these<00:04:39.490> have<00:04:39.670> gone<00:04:39.820> through<00:04:40.180> but

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
washes that these have gone through but

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.290 
washes that these have gone through but
I<00:04:41.320> would<00:04:41.710> say<00:04:41.950> all<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.580> top<00:04:42.760> man<00:04:42.940> jeans

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
I would say all of the top man jeans

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.180 
I would say all of the top man jeans
maybe<00:04:43.720> it's<00:04:43.870> because<00:04:43.960> I've<00:04:44.140> got<00:04:44.350> small<00:04:44.680> ankles

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
maybe it's because I've got small ankles

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.000 
maybe it's because I've got small ankles
aren't<00:04:45.820> really<00:04:46.240> that<00:04:46.480> tight<00:04:46.990> at<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.290> bottom<00:04:47.320> I

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
aren't really that tight at the bottom I

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.220 
aren't really that tight at the bottom I
know<00:04:48.130> if<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.460> get<00:04:48.640> spray<00:04:48.940> skinnies<00:04:49.330> spray-on

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
know if you get spray skinnies spray-on

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.930 
know if you get spray skinnies spray-on
skinnies<00:04:50.680> I<00:04:50.710> have<00:04:51.130> got<00:04:51.310> those<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.790> they<00:04:51.910> are

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
skinnies I have got those and they are

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.300 
skinnies I have got those and they are
like<00:04:52.650> fight<00:04:53.650> jeggings

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
like fight jeggings

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.880 
like fight jeggings
but<00:04:54.820> these<00:04:54.970> aren't<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.710> skinning<00:04:56.710> at<00:04:56.800> the

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
but these aren't that skinning at the

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.100 
but these aren't that skinning at the
bottom<00:04:57.220> this<00:04:57.730> goes<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.150> same<00:04:58.330> with<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.870> jeans

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
bottom this goes the same with the jeans

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.010 
bottom this goes the same with the jeans
from<00:04:59.500> Primark<00:05:00.390> these<00:05:01.390> are<00:05:01.660> actually<00:05:01.930> really

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
from Primark these are actually really

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.600 
from Primark these are actually really
comfortable<00:05:02.260> they<00:05:02.650> are<00:05:02.680> quite<00:05:03.010> thin<00:05:03.280> as<00:05:03.430> well

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
comfortable they are quite thin as well

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.160 
comfortable they are quite thin as well
they're<00:05:03.820> not<00:05:03.880> as<00:05:04.030> thick<00:05:04.240> as<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.570> top<00:05:04.750> man<00:05:04.930> ones

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
they're not as thick as the top man ones

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.650 
they're not as thick as the top man ones
because<00:05:05.890> probably<00:05:06.190> they're<00:05:06.340> less<00:05:06.700> red<00:05:07.210> best

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
because probably they're less red best

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.370 
because probably they're less red best
quality<00:05:08.200> but<00:05:08.740> I<00:05:08.980> do<00:05:09.100> like<00:05:09.400> a<00:05:09.900> filler<00:05:10.900> Jean<00:05:11.200> in
