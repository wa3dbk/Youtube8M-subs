00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello very good as it goes all kids 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.940
 from here by igor and with a very good 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.859
 gameplay again from black ops 2 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.809
 playing on the map of yemen war 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.950
 terrestrial domain 1 this part the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.840
 truth is that it's a pretty game 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.670
 curious about the first round of domain 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.279
 I'm going to put this bit here that the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.760
 truth is that it is very very good and another 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.439
 more and this is a part that the truth is 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.970
 quite curious not by several aspects 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.580
 the first thing is that it is a game of more 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.769
 of 90 casualties in which I do in total 94 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.140
 17 and direct but small crap of 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.759
 not clear departure is that the thing is in 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 that the first round on this map 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.500
 it came out fatal literally or whatever it is 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.840
 the worst that there is in this world in the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.870
 first game in the first part of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.829
 the first round ended 24 15 and the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.210
 game ends 94 17 that is in this in 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.370
 this first round that by the way has 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.840
 long time the truth that they had me 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.489
 pretty warm of the opposing team 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 especially a couple of snipers and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.570
 well I 'm not that I did very well 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.399
 the truth then good to get 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.449
 only 24 casualties still that was the best 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.140
 from my team right now you are 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.369
 seeing here in the markers I was the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.500
 better in my team the best of the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.010
 game in the first 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.230
 but help us I'm going to pass now let's say 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.600
 to the second to the second round of 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.070
 domain because mother of mine the truth is 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.540
 that today this part had to have 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.370
 clipped I forgot but good 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.080
 it's six minutes and a video peak of 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.340
 every way and so I 've seen it 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.680
 little bit bijao is still the same 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.910
 party in case some distrustful that 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.979
 I feel there is some distrust of 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.420
 you that when I do likes you think 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.460
 that are not lines but that recorded the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.440
 comment later let's go I can you 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.330
 guarantee that if I do not start the game 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.420
 scott al charles here is to go today and 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.430
 never if the game does not start like this is 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.740
 because I'm doing a live is that I 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.119
 I spend my life doing the likes and many 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.410
 of you because you do not believe what I already 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.330
 you can start believing because really 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.380
 the reactions you hear when 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.060
 I put that is a direct comment 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.050
 because I never lie or that is what 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.270
 that's something that some of you 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.340
 you still have to understand that I am 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.289
 a very honest fighter and it's something of the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.509
 what I like to do today try 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.550
 do it never do that above all 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.140
 lie and - to you here on youtube 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.970
 so good as he is saying 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.069
 the first game is the first round 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.539
 24 15 in writing that means that 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.730
 the second round which is the one that you are 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.040
 watching now is a 70 2 what is 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.450
 much better of low gusts I have 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.670
 the vital sector where would the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.260
 swarm and here set I can not get to 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.640
 capture 0 because I see that they are 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.380
 returning to reappear thanks to the black 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.060
 projected bird if I had had a 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.650
 simple radar let me have sanz for 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.420
 today here I was shitting myself in milk 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.370
 code oysters that look everywhere 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.050
 and then he threw a lawn mower and climbs me 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.330
 a little the stairs to see if I can 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.010
 survive and good luckily I did not 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.989
 they managed to kill and I already have here my 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.940
 nice name that launched it and well no 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.170
 I had the dogs because this simple very 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.340
 old and I did not have them yet 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.220
 unlocked only had 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.390
 unlocked the swarm and I put it on 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.550
 be because it also helps a little 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.500
 although good to pull it from being and swarm 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.660
 at the same time that is what you are going to see me 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.760
 what are you going to see me do now 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.380
 Exactly what I wanted to say is not 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.900
 the best technique in the world not because 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.880
 good two things that attack from the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.709
 sky is not the best in my opinion 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.790
 because for that you have no swarm and a 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.410
 thing is that you have the swarm and then 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.910
 to throw is what to be but well I do not 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.230
 shot already a little finishing the swarm 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.510
 let say 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.379
 here pretty crouched here among these 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.370
 and indeed I had never noticed and 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.209
 this is a good thing to be that 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.129
 took advantage also with then another one what 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.540
 to be killed me three or so in 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.670
 hand the next swarm because I 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.220
 peeked through a window and he and a asshole 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.930
 it kills me but well still I think that 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.370
 it's a very good game it gives me also 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.250
 because the starting time of more than 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.870
 100 casualties I think that I have it I think that 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.360
 I only have two once in demolition that 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.010
 it is not very interesting the truth and 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.870
 the one that tells me with more than 100 casualties 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.790
 shotgun that if you want to see that gameplay 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.269
 then you will have it in the description of 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.400
 this video and I always stay with many 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.720
 times to ninety-odd or so is that 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.489
 It's pretty raging that those things happen to me 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.049
 things because you can not say I've 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.620
 made more than 100 low is that I did not tell you 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.599
 more than 90 and almost and good here you are going to see 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.269
 my fixed to the four kitchens and these 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.430
 that were there locked in the tower 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.140
 Watched from Yemen since tucked a 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.260
 missile through the window of mine I stayed 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.730
 good is what I tried and it came out like that 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.310
 that quite happy also for that 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.230
 country is the one that says good that missile that 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.129
 it's so multiple multiple that says 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.129
 and good 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.210
 this here in misfortune has two of 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.710
 four bounces on his back to that 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.210
 pig that there is my partner in the 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.130
 window here I want to pick it poked me 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.840
 through the window but there is one that is fair 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.940
 it catches me and here my character to a 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.350
 concrete for ahead my mother there is that 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.170
 see also how they move in this game 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.520
 it seems almost the movements of 13 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.520
 when the players 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.130
 He spent his life saying good because he is 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.510
 that when I get distracted from the subject 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.920
 I say good to change the subject already 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.330
 you have seen that he has a c4 again to 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.860
 the wall and thank goodness I did not exploit it 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.660
 which is from the danger that always 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.550
 I notice the vices that you have 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.990
 be careful with the c4 and here set the 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.310
 franco has this pig gives me a bullet 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.260
 and I'm worth putting it as it was loaded 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.880
 see where he is here is crouched and I 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.610
 I do not know how he killed me with a piba 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.380
 while I was shooting him with the mss 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.030
 the truth that good it is seen that it had 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.040
 a lot of pressure has not shot me 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.450
 while I just gave him shot by 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.370
 over my head I do not know what happens but 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.750
 well here I'm going to spend my last one 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.790
 of is in which I stay a few low 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.850
 of the swarm 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.920
 and nothing is for having commented on the 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.090
 I distracted a lot in the selector what 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.950
 which is the comment that sometimes 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.660
 maybe I was halfway through something because 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.770
 I start talking about something else that is what 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.390
 what happens to me sometimes when I'm 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.250
 commenting on a live involvement and I see 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.540
 some of the things that happen to me but 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.690
 so I hope that if it does not involve you 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.430
 enjoyed remembering that I always 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.930
 I enjoy as commenting videos for 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.430
 us and when I get videos with 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.660
 thousands of thousands of visits good with 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.520
 thousands of visits more than a thousand visits and 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.230
 peak the truth is that it took me a 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.360
 amazing surprise so nothing if 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.830
 you want to help me with this video and with 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.270
 than the rest and remember that always 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.760
 I only ask you a like that is a 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.960
 one click of the mouse and if you can you 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.390
 recommend to your friends friends 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.770
 etcetera then it would also be very very 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.020
 nice on your part since you tried 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.120
 get the best content and nothing better 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.140
 to finish the game with a good 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.030
 beating 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.320
 and a black bird and a companion that 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.550
 was when a group so in some 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.170
 Greetings to all I had in group
