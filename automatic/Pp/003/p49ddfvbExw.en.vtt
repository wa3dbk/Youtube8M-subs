figure however the leg joins a little

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.449 
figure however the leg joins a little
wobbly<00:03:23.989> as<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.410> can<00:03:24.560> tell<00:03:24.739> when<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:25.069> was<00:03:25.250> having

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
wobbly as you can tell when I was having

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.470 
wobbly as you can tell when I was having
some<00:03:25.640> trouble<00:03:25.940> transforming<00:03:26.269> him<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:28.480> the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
some trouble transforming him and the

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.470 
some trouble transforming him and the
arm<00:03:29.750> articulation<00:03:30.500> just<00:03:30.680> sucks<00:03:31.239> though<00:03:32.239> and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
arm articulation just sucks though and

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.420 
arm articulation just sucks though and
the<00:03:32.599> arms<00:03:33.019> move<00:03:33.110> up<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.590> down<00:03:33.650> like<00:03:33.860> so<00:03:34.129> but

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
the arms move up and down like so but

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.490 
the arms move up and down like so but
they<00:03:34.549> do<00:03:34.610> that<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.180> it<00:03:35.420> that's<00:03:36.080> how<00:03:36.200> far<00:03:36.410> they

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
they do that is it that's how far they

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.620 
they do that is it that's how far they
move<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:36.860> this<00:03:37.280> just<00:03:37.519> rotates<00:03:38.060> just<00:03:38.450> joint

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
move and this just rotates just joint

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.319 
move and this just rotates just joint
right<00:03:38.810> here<00:03:38.840> moves<00:03:39.440> left<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:40.010> I'll<00:03:40.310> rotate<00:03:40.910> it

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
right here moves left and I'll rotate it

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.000 
right here moves left and I'll rotate it
rotates<00:03:41.720> like<00:03:41.810> this<00:03:42.140> but<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.799> doesn't

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
rotates like this but it doesn't

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.210 
rotates like this but it doesn't
actually<00:03:43.069> move<00:03:43.370> this<00:03:43.579> way<00:03:44.290> just<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:46.069> arm

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
actually move this way just the arm

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.069 
actually move this way just the arm
articulation<00:03:46.910> is<00:03:47.060> just<00:03:47.239> not<00:03:47.360> good<00:03:47.540> even<00:03:47.900> for<00:03:48.049> a

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
articulation is just not good even for a

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.100 
articulation is just not good even for a
scout<00:03:48.290> class<00:03:48.410> figure<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:48.920> think<00:03:49.610> I've<00:03:49.730> seen

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
scout class figure I think I've seen

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.300 
scout class figure I think I've seen
figures<00:03:51.110> that<00:03:51.440> are<00:03:51.470> even<00:03:51.739> smaller<00:03:51.950> than<00:03:52.220> that

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
figures that are even smaller than that

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.509 
figures that are even smaller than that
guy<00:03:52.579> even<00:03:52.910> better<00:03:53.120> articulation<00:03:54.099> in<00:03:55.099> terms<00:03:55.400> of

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
guy even better articulation in terms of

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.930 
guy even better articulation in terms of
detail<00:03:55.940> it's<00:03:56.630> pretty<00:03:56.870> much<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.049> same<00:03:57.380> as<00:03:57.940> he

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
detail it's pretty much the same as he

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.750 
detail it's pretty much the same as he
had<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.510> same<00:03:59.870> amount<00:04:00.440> of<00:04:00.590> her<00:04:00.739> detail<00:04:01.400> he<00:04:01.610> had

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
had the same amount of her detail he had

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.080 
had the same amount of her detail he had
in<00:04:01.940> his<00:04:02.060> vehicle<00:04:02.780> mode<00:04:03.400> there<00:04:04.400> is<00:04:04.579> his<00:04:04.760> face

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
in his vehicle mode there is his face

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.120 
in his vehicle mode there is his face
are<00:04:05.329> his<00:04:05.569> face<00:04:05.750> is<00:04:05.900> pretty<00:04:06.019> nice<00:04:06.200> he<00:04:06.829> does<00:04:06.980> have

very nice and that's pretty much it of
course<00:04:22.370> his<00:04:22.700> feature<00:04:23.060> is<00:04:23.389> the<00:04:23.419> same<00:04:23.690> feature

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
course his feature is the same feature

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.150 
course his feature is the same feature
as<00:04:24.080> all<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.289> other<00:04:24.410> side<00:04:24.650> which<00:04:24.740> one<00:04:24.889> figures

like to cyber yeah like the cyber keys
detail<00:04:31.880> better<00:04:32.120> than<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.389> actual<00:04:32.570> figure<00:04:33.200> I

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
detail better than the actual figure I

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.760 
detail better than the actual figure I
mean<00:04:34.100> it<00:04:34.250> looks<00:04:34.610> pretty<00:04:34.820> nice<00:04:35.500> as<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.620> can

mean it looks pretty nice as you can
tell<00:04:36.830> what<00:04:37.820> is<00:04:37.970> this<00:04:38.120> feature<00:04:38.360> it<00:04:38.750> what's<00:04:39.139> this

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
tell what is this feature it what's this

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.350 
tell what is this feature it what's this
feature<00:04:39.530> I<00:04:39.650> mean<00:04:39.889> well<00:04:40.760> yeah<00:04:40.970> we<00:04:41.210> have<00:04:41.330> a

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
feature I mean well yeah we have a

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.279 
feature I mean well yeah we have a
missile<00:04:41.780> right<00:04:41.930> here<00:04:42.320> if<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.789> can<00:04:44.300> put<00:04:45.050> two

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
missile right here if you can put two

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.140 
missile right here if you can put two
and<00:04:45.440> two<00:04:45.500> together<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:46.190> missile<00:04:46.490> goes<00:04:46.729> right

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
and two together the missile goes right

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.640 
and two together the missile goes right
in<00:04:47.270> his<00:04:47.330> chest<00:04:48.220> like<00:04:49.220> some<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:51.110> when<00:04:51.500> he's<00:04:51.620> a

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
in his chest like some and when he's a

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.050 
in his chest like some and when he's a
robot<00:04:51.889> mode<00:04:52.130> it's<00:04:52.280> better<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.580> just<00:04:52.729> leave<00:04:52.970> it

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
robot mode it's better to just leave it

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.550 
robot mode it's better to just leave it
in<00:04:53.150> there<00:04:53.270> rather<00:04:53.479> than<00:04:53.599> just<00:04:53.810> keep<00:04:54.139> on<00:04:54.289> firing

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
in there rather than just keep on firing

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.500 
in there rather than just keep on firing
it<00:04:54.830> so<00:04:55.729> we<00:04:55.820> go<00:04:55.940> over<00:04:56.000> here<00:04:56.180> in<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.330> back<00:04:56.479> we

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
it so we go over here in the back we

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.779 
it so we go over here in the back we
have<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:57.099> piece<00:04:58.099> right<00:04:58.280> here<00:04:58.310> sticking<00:04:58.639> out

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
have the piece right here sticking out

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.550 
have the piece right here sticking out
that<00:04:58.940> causes<00:04:59.210> some<00:04:59.360> problems<00:04:59.479> for<00:04:59.810> display

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
that causes some problems for display

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.029 
that causes some problems for display
purposes<00:05:01.450> anyway<00:05:02.450> we<00:05:02.599> take<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.990> key<00:05:03.470> here<00:05:03.860> and

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
purposes anyway we take the key here and

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.910 
purposes anyway we take the key here and
we<00:05:04.580> flit<00:05:04.849> fit<00:05:05.630> it<00:05:05.750> into<00:05:06.020> that<00:05:06.260> slot

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
we flit fit it into that slot

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:15.290 
we flit fit it into that slot
and<00:05:08.520> what<00:05:08.940> we<00:05:09.090> get<00:05:09.420> is<00:05:10.130> on<00:05:13.790> should<00:05:14.790> I<00:05:14.820> lost<00:05:15.120> it

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
and what we get is on should I lost it

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.450 
and what we get is on should I lost it
anyway<00:05:15.960> yes<00:05:16.290> you<00:05:16.710> press<00:05:16.920> the<00:05:17.010> key<00:05:17.160> inside

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
anyway yes you press the key inside

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.870 
anyway yes you press the key inside
fires<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.300> missile<00:05:18.830> I'm<00:05:19.830> gonna<00:05:20.400> go<00:05:20.490> get<00:05:20.670> that

cons a bad articulation the leg
articulation<00:06:20.270> is<00:06:20.360> fine<00:06:20.630> but<00:06:21.229> as<00:06:21.350> for<00:06:21.560> the<00:06:21.650> arms

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160

I<00:06:22.430> don't<00:06:23.150> know<00:06:23.270> how<00:06:23.690> this<00:06:23.930> counts<00:06:24.320> as

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
I don't know how this counts as

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.430 
I don't know how this counts as
articulation<00:06:25.039> it<00:06:25.220> could<00:06:25.520> just<00:06:25.699> rotate<00:06:26.440> like

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
articulation it could just rotate like

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.100 
articulation it could just rotate like
so<00:06:27.830> and<00:06:28.520> it<00:06:28.669> could<00:06:28.789> just<00:06:28.940> move<00:06:29.090> the<00:06:29.330> elbow<00:06:29.900> up

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
problematic cyber key when I put it in

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.550 
problematic cyber key when I put it in
of<00:06:49.729> course<00:06:50.210> it<00:06:50.330> shoots<00:06:50.539> the<00:06:50.690> missile<00:06:50.930> out<00:06:51.020> but

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
of course it shoots the missile out but

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.159 
of course it shoots the missile out but
it<00:06:51.680> is<00:06:51.860> a<00:06:52.190> pain<00:06:53.060> in<00:06:53.150> the<00:06:53.180> ass<00:06:53.360> to<00:06:53.389> take<00:06:53.780> this<00:06:53.930> key

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
it is a pain in the ass to take this key

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.050 
it is a pain in the ass to take this key
out<00:06:54.289> it<00:06:54.949> sometimes<00:06:55.310> gets<00:06:55.400> stuck<00:06:55.520> in<00:06:55.729> a<00:06:55.880> sense

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
out it sometimes gets stuck in a sense

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.450 
out it sometimes gets stuck in a sense
of<00:06:56.120> think<00:06:56.330> I'm<00:06:56.449> going<00:06:56.570> to<00:06:56.660> break<00:06:56.780> it<00:06:57.039> so<00:06:58.039> I<00:06:58.250> just

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
of think I'm going to break it so I just

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.010 
of think I'm going to break it so I just
leave<00:06:58.639> it<00:06:58.729> outside<00:06:58.849> and<00:06:59.530> that<00:07:00.530> is<00:07:00.710> it<00:07:00.860> for<00:07:01.070> cons

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
leave it outside and that is it for cons

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:08.170 
leave it outside and that is it for cons
so<00:07:03.020> i<00:07:03.440> give<00:07:03.860> this<00:07:04.010> vehicle<00:07:04.520> mode<00:07:04.669> a<00:07:05.500> 7.5<00:07:07.180> which

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
so i give this vehicle mode a 7.5 which

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.550 
so i give this vehicle mode a 7.5 which
is<00:07:08.419> a<00:07:08.659> see<00:07:10.599> however<00:07:11.599> i<00:07:11.630> give<00:07:11.900> his<00:07:12.050> robot<00:07:12.380> mode<00:07:12.409> a

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
is a see however i give his robot mode a

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.110 
is a see however i give his robot mode a
7.8<00:07:13.750> which<00:07:14.750> is<00:07:14.990> a<00:07:15.229> c-plus<00:07:15.970> passes<00:07:16.970> my

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
7.8 which is a c-plus passes my

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.680 
7.8 which is a c-plus passes my
standards<00:07:17.539> so<00:07:19.120> if<00:07:20.120> you<00:07:20.240> don't<00:07:20.419> have<00:07:20.539> this

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:20.690 
standards so if you don't have this

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.680 
standards so if you don't have this
