00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
way I use a random number generator to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.490 
way I use a random number generator to
choose<00:00:21.240> which<00:00:21.420> video<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.840> going<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.230> chosen

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
and then i use the random number

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.609 
and then i use the random number
generator<00:00:24.180> once<00:00:24.480> again<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.170> choose<00:00:25.380> one<00:00:25.590> of
