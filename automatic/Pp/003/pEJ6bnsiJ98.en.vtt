00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.280

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.110
 It should know where we went like 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.820
 we ran if we are obese 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.350
 if we are slim, how long have we been 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.910

 Of course you can say that we want to 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.080

 I have done such a sport no it 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.540
 is of course that your data on 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.250

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.640
 population in it 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.320
 this whole fitness data collection 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.600
