the<00:02:54.900> time<00:02:55.079> never<00:02:55.379> come<00:02:55.680> out<00:02:55.769> of<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.040> barrel

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.600 

trigger<00:03:01.049> doesn't<00:03:01.379> work

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.430 

I<00:03:03.670> don't<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.450> don't<00:03:04.690> even<00:03:04.960> know<00:03:05.140> why<00:03:05.290> they

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
I don't I don't even know why they
