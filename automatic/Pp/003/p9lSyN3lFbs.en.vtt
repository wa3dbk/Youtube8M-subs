what<00:01:33.770> they<00:01:33.920> did<00:01:34.159> with<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:34.609> is<00:01:34.939> they<00:01:35.119> kind<00:01:35.899> of

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
what they did with this is they kind of

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.749 
what they did with this is they kind of
coated<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.499> in<00:01:36.619> like<00:01:36.829> an<00:01:36.950> acrylic<00:01:37.189> solution

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759

coated it in like an acrylic solution
and<00:01:38.030> what<00:01:38.929> that<00:01:39.079> does<00:01:39.289> I'm<00:01:39.590> assuming<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.460> that

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
and what that does I'm assuming is that

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.059 
and what that does I'm assuming is that
keeps<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:41.840> stank<00:01:42.109> away<00:01:42.380> when<00:01:42.770> you're<00:01:42.950> using

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
keeps the stank away when you're using

keeps the stank away when you're using
it<00:01:43.219> for<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.399> long<00:01:43.579> time<00:01:43.609> because<00:01:44.030> if<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:44.659> guys

grind<00:02:06.109> so<00:02:06.319> it's<00:02:06.469> a<00:02:06.560> little<00:02:06.710> bit<00:02:06.889> sharper<00:02:07.100> or

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
grind so it's a little bit sharper or

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.600 
grind so it's a little bit sharper or
slice<00:02:08.390> ear<00:02:08.600> than<00:02:08.959> a<00:02:09.319> flat<00:02:09.950> ground<00:02:10.160> blade<00:02:10.429> or

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
slice ear than a flat ground blade or

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.660 
slice ear than a flat ground blade or
saber<00:02:10.850> grind<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:12.010> it's<00:02:13.010> also<00:02:13.190> pretty<00:02:13.430> heavy

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
saber grind and it's also pretty heavy

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.770 
saber grind and it's also pretty heavy
so<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:13.970> should<00:02:14.150> have<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.360> lot<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.569> energy

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
so it should have a lot of energy

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.690 
so it should have a lot of energy
putting<00:02:15.230> into<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.280> three<00:02:16.550> inch

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
putting into it this is a three inch

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.460 
putting into it this is a three inch
piece<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:16.940> cedar<00:02:17.180> like<00:02:17.870> most<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.260> my<00:02:18.319> videos

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
piece of cedar like most of my videos

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:45.760 
piece of cedar like most of my videos
are<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.180> let's<00:02:20.180> give<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.450> go

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.740 

even<00:02:46.770> though<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.130> pretty<00:02:47.370> heavy<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.360> it's

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
even though it's pretty heavy and it's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.150 
even though it's pretty heavy and it's
rather<00:02:48.900> sharp<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.410> cuts<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.680> paper<00:02:49.770> pretty

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
rather sharp it cuts the paper pretty

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.680 
rather sharp it cuts the paper pretty
well<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.550> would<00:02:50.790> say<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.120> probably<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.480> medium

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
well I would say it's probably a medium

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.809 
well I would say it's probably a medium
duty<00:02:52.700> chopper

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
duty chopper

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.339 
duty chopper
part<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.090> me<00:02:54.270> was<00:02:54.420> holding<00:02:54.750> back<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> little<00:02:55.140> bit

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
part of me was holding back a little bit

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.860 
part of me was holding back a little bit
because<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.310> handle<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.849> so<00:02:57.060> coarse<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.630> guess

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
because the handle is so coarse I guess

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.960 
because the handle is so coarse I guess
you<00:02:57.989> could<00:02:58.110> say<00:02:58.370> paracord<00:02:59.370> handles<00:02:59.700> for<00:02:59.850> me

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
you could say paracord handles for me

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.090 
you could say paracord handles for me
are<00:03:00.209> usually<00:03:00.569> not<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.750> problem<00:03:00.989> but<00:03:01.800> when<00:03:01.980> they

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
are usually not a problem but when they

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.949 
are usually not a problem but when they
put<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.430> acrylic<00:03:02.760> on<00:03:02.850> there<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.540> made<00:03:03.780> it

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
put the acrylic on there it made it

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.500 
put the acrylic on there it made it
quite<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.260> bit<00:03:04.640> harsher<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.670> guess<00:03:05.940> on<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.209> hands

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
quite a bit harsher I guess on the hands

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.170 
quite a bit harsher I guess on the hands
so<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.230> wasn't<00:03:07.500> able<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.890> put<00:03:08.400> my<00:03:08.580> full<00:03:08.880> weight

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
so I wasn't able to put my full weight

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.410 
so I wasn't able to put my full weight
in<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.870> chop<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:11.580> did<00:03:11.819> chop<00:03:12.090> through<00:03:12.300> it

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
in to chop but it did chop through it

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.690 
in to chop but it did chop through it
pretty<00:03:12.510> well<00:03:12.780> once<00:03:13.769> he<00:03:13.950> started<00:03:14.340> started

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
pretty well once he started started

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.970 
pretty well once he started started
going<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.420> went<00:03:15.660> pretty<00:03:15.840> good<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.650> fact<00:03:16.830> that

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
going it went pretty good the fact that

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.699 
going it went pretty good the fact that
it's<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.489> heavy<00:03:17.760> helps<00:03:18.450> out<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.630> lot<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.410> I

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
it's this heavy helps out a lot but I

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.340 
it's this heavy helps out a lot but I
would<00:03:20.250> definitely<00:03:20.780> reconsider<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.959> handle

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
would definitely reconsider the handle

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.070 
would definitely reconsider the handle
there's<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.590> different<00:03:22.890> version<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.400> g10<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.209> I

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
there's a different version in g10 and I

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.410 
there's a different version in g10 and I
think<00:03:25.319> that<00:03:25.440> might<00:03:25.620> be<00:03:25.650> better<00:03:25.920> for<00:03:26.420> non

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
think that might be better for non

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.300 
think that might be better for non
gloved<00:03:27.750> use<00:03:27.989> so<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.680> don't<00:03:28.920> usually<00:03:29.040> like<00:03:29.250> to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
gloved use so I don't usually like to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.970 
gloved use so I don't usually like to
use<00:03:29.610> gloves<00:03:29.790> when<00:03:29.970> I'm<00:03:30.150> working<00:03:30.510> with<00:03:30.980> wood

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
use gloves when I'm working with wood

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.800 
use gloves when I'm working with wood
and<00:03:32.190> knives<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.180> sort<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.420> thing<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:33.780> I

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
and knives and that sort of thing so I

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.080 
and knives and that sort of thing so I
can<00:03:33.870> really<00:03:34.200> get<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.280> good<00:03:35.400> feel<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:35.850> the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
can really get and a good feel on the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.240 
can really get and a good feel on the
knife<00:03:36.269> but<00:03:37.080> yeah<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:37.799> little<00:03:37.890> bit<00:03:38.130> rough

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
knife but yeah it's a little bit rough

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.789 
knife but yeah it's a little bit rough
for<00:03:38.280> my<00:03:38.430> hands<00:03:38.700> but<00:03:39.600> before<00:03:39.930> we<00:03:40.110> go<00:03:40.200> ahead<00:03:40.530> and

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
for my hands but before we go ahead and

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.520 
for my hands but before we go ahead and
baton<00:03:41.790> with<00:03:42.000> this<00:03:42.180> thing<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.660> wanted<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.319> see

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
baton with this thing I wanted to see

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.130 
baton with this thing I wanted to see
how<00:03:43.830> well<00:03:44.100> this<00:03:44.640> serrated<00:03:45.330> back<00:03:45.660> part<00:03:45.959> goes

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
how well this serrated back part goes

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.680 
how well this serrated back part goes
because<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:46.860> said<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.250> can<00:03:47.430> chop<00:03:48.120> through<00:03:48.420> or

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
because I said it can chop through or

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.569 
because I said it can chop through or
sawed<00:03:49.049> through<00:03:49.079> branches<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.340> sort<00:03:50.549> of

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
sawed through branches and that sort of

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.970 
sawed through branches and that sort of
things<00:03:50.790> let's<00:03:51.090> give<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.390> go<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:52.470> saw<00:03:52.680> back

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
things let's give it a go the saw back

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.590 
things let's give it a go the saw back
where<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.310> parser<00:03:53.790> ations<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.329> are<00:03:54.390> on<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
where the parser ations that are on the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.840 
where the parser ations that are on the
back<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.900> this<00:03:54.989> blade<00:03:55.200> are<00:03:55.500> not<00:03:56.430> meant<00:03:56.760> for

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
back of this blade are not meant for

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.750 
back of this blade are not meant for
cutting<00:03:57.690> wood<00:03:57.829> and<00:03:58.829> I<00:03:59.190> think<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.459> reason<00:03:59.730> for

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
cutting wood and I think the reason for

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.849 
cutting wood and I think the reason for
that<00:03:59.910> is<00:04:00.120> because<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.720> serrations<00:04:01.049> on<00:04:01.530> are

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
that is because the serrations on are

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.740 
that is because the serrations on are
straight<00:04:02.250> across<00:04:02.430> there's<00:04:02.820> no<00:04:03.060> slope<00:04:03.600> or

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
straight across there's no slope or

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.220 
straight across there's no slope or
anything<00:04:03.870> like<00:04:03.989> that

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
anything like that

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.830 
anything like that
so<00:04:04.739> once<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.400> has<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.850> initial<00:04:06.209> bite<00:04:06.359> which<00:04:06.690> it

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
so once it has the initial bite which it

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.140 
so once it has the initial bite which it
does<00:04:06.989> pretty<00:04:07.230> well<00:04:07.350> it<00:04:08.340> just<00:04:08.400> kind<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:08.850> glides

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
does pretty well it just kind of glides

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.479 
does pretty well it just kind of glides
over<00:04:09.359> it<00:04:09.600> like<00:04:09.989> an<00:04:10.170> ice<00:04:10.290> skate<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:10.799> there's<00:04:11.220> not

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
over it like an ice skate so there's not

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.640 
over it like an ice skate so there's not
much<00:04:11.549> for<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.299> uh<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:13.049> keep<00:04:13.230> on<00:04:13.410> progressing

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
much for it to uh to keep on progressing

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.670 
much for it to uh to keep on progressing
through<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.130> cut<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:15.030> now<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.420> have

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
through the cut so now that I have

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.229 
through the cut so now that I have
tested<00:04:16.680> out<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.070> back<00:04:17.250> serrations<00:04:17.789> on<00:04:18.000> some

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
tested out the back serrations on some

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.729 
tested out the back serrations on some
small<00:04:18.419> branches<00:04:18.840> figured<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.410> doesn't<00:04:19.560> really

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
small branches figured I doesn't really

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.560 
small branches figured I doesn't really
work<00:04:19.919> that<00:04:19.950> well<00:04:20.160> let's<00:04:20.729> see<00:04:20.880> how<00:04:21.030> well<00:04:21.269> this

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
work that well let's see how well this

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.800 
work that well let's see how well this
does<00:04:21.870> with<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.560> toning<00:04:23.090> there's<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.150> nice<00:04:24.390> flat

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
does with the toning there's a nice flat

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.630 
does with the toning there's a nice flat
edge<00:04:25.050> right<00:04:25.440> at<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.650> tip<00:04:25.830> where<00:04:26.280> most<00:04:26.520> people

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
edge right at the tip where most people

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.430 
edge right at the tip where most people
like<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:26.940> baton<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.539> that's<00:04:28.080> where<00:04:28.229> I'm<00:04:28.320> going

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
like to baton and that's where I'm going

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.560 
like to baton and that's where I'm going
to<00:04:28.530> be<00:04:28.590> smacking<00:04:29.010> today<00:04:29.250> with<00:04:29.910> my<00:04:30.120> handy<00:04:30.539> dandy

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
to be smacking today with my handy dandy

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.529 
to be smacking today with my handy dandy
baton<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.260> I<00:04:31.289> made<00:04:31.500> off-screen<00:04:32.400> this<00:04:33.360> is<00:04:33.479> a

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
baton that I made off-screen this is a

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.330 
baton that I made off-screen this is a
piece<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:33.720> cedar<00:04:33.990> it's<00:04:34.470> lightweight<00:04:35.010> but<00:04:35.220> it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
piece of cedar it's lightweight but it

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.760 
piece of cedar it's lightweight but it
is<00:04:35.370> long<00:04:35.970> so<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:36.720> can<00:04:36.900> put<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.050> lot<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.320> speed<00:04:37.530> into

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
is long so I can put a lot of speed into

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.470 
is long so I can put a lot of speed into
the<00:04:38.340> cutter

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
the cutter

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:51.990 
the cutter
let's<00:04:39.870> give<00:04:40.020> us<00:04:40.140> a<00:04:40.230> go

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.850 

so<00:04:52.510> this<00:04:52.660> knife<00:04:52.870> did<00:04:53.110> pretty<00:04:53.320> good<00:04:53.410> at

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
so this knife did pretty good at

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.560 
so this knife did pretty good at
splitting<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.640> batoning<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.210> that<00:04:55.300> sort<00:04:55.510> of

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
splitting and batoning and that sort of

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.420 
splitting and batoning and that sort of
thing<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:55.990> little<00:04:56.590> bit<00:04:56.680> thicker<00:04:56.860> than<00:04:56.950> what<00:04:57.310> I'm

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
thing a little bit thicker than what I'm

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.900 
thing a little bit thicker than what I'm
used<00:04:57.640> to

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
used to

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.970 
used to
as<00:04:58.150> far<00:04:58.420> as<00:04:58.450> good<00:04:58.780> splitters<00:04:59.140> go<00:04:59.290> so<00:04:59.590> it<00:04:59.860> does

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
as far as good splitters go so it does

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.370 
as far as good splitters go so it does
phenomenally<00:05:00.460> well<00:05:00.640> the<00:05:01.480> back<00:05:01.690> of<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:01.960> tip<00:05:02.170> is

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
phenomenally well the back of the tip is

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.770 
phenomenally well the back of the tip is
wide<00:05:03.250> enough<00:05:03.520> so<00:05:03.580> that<00:05:03.850> it<00:05:04.120> doesn't<00:05:04.390> bite<00:05:04.600> in

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
wide enough so that it doesn't bite in

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.810 
wide enough so that it doesn't bite in
too<00:05:05.020> much<00:05:05.230> onto<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.830> baton<00:05:06.100> so<00:05:06.610> you're<00:05:06.730> not

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
too much onto the baton so you're not

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.280 
too much onto the baton so you're not
going<00:05:06.940> to<00:05:07.000> be<00:05:07.120> switching<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.570> out<00:05:07.690> too<00:05:08.080> often

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
going to be switching it out too often

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.370 
going to be switching it out too often
so<00:05:09.190> let's<00:05:09.490> go<00:05:09.610> ahead<00:05:09.730> and<00:05:09.940> do<00:05:10.750> a<00:05:10.780> little<00:05:11.080> bit<00:05:11.230> of

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
so let's go ahead and do a little bit of

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:31.140 
so let's go ahead and do a little bit of
feather<00:05:12.100> sticking

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.480 

so<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:31.780> knife<00:05:31.960> did<00:05:32.139> pretty<00:05:32.320> good<00:05:32.440> in<00:05:33.160> the

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
so the knife did pretty good in the

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.520 
so the knife did pretty good in the
beginning<00:05:33.880> there<00:05:34.000> was<00:05:34.150> a<00:05:34.240> little<00:05:34.389> bit<00:05:34.630> of<00:05:34.810> some

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
beginning there was a little bit of some

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.470 
beginning there was a little bit of some
pickups<00:05:35.889> mainly<00:05:36.730> because<00:05:36.850> it<00:05:37.120> was<00:05:37.270> just

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
pickups mainly because it was just

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.170 
pickups mainly because it was just
starting<00:05:37.600> out<00:05:37.930> I<00:05:38.169> would<00:05:39.100> say<00:05:39.130> that<00:05:39.610> right<00:05:39.820> here

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
starting out I would say that right here

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.110 
starting out I would say that right here
next<00:05:40.510> to<00:05:40.660> the<00:05:41.380> end<00:05:41.590> of<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.830> blade<00:05:42.040> isn't<00:05:42.850> that

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
next to the end of the blade isn't that

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.900 
next to the end of the blade isn't that
great<00:05:43.389> for<00:05:43.600> carving<00:05:43.840> and<00:05:44.169> I<00:05:44.919> would<00:05:45.520> I<00:05:45.699> would

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
great for carving and I would I would

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.580 
great for carving and I would I would
say<00:05:46.120> that<00:05:46.419> to<00:05:46.900> make<00:05:47.020> this<00:05:47.169> a<00:05:47.229> little<00:05:47.410> more

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
say that to make this a little more

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.810 
say that to make this a little more
efficient<00:05:48.010> they<00:05:48.130> should<00:05:48.310> have<00:05:48.400> brought<00:05:48.490> this

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
efficient they should have brought this

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.969 
efficient they should have brought this
all<00:05:48.970> the<00:05:49.060> way<00:05:49.120> back<00:05:49.360> or<00:05:50.020> made<00:05:50.350> that<00:05:50.560> nice<00:05:50.770> and

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
all the way back or made that nice and

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.200 
all the way back or made that nice and
round<00:05:51.130> so<00:05:51.340> you<00:05:51.370> could<00:05:51.580> choke<00:05:51.760> up<00:05:51.940> on<00:05:52.060> it

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
round so you could choke up on it

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.939 
round so you could choke up on it
because<00:05:52.330> there's<00:05:53.139> just<00:05:53.199> a<00:05:53.380> little<00:05:53.530> bit<00:05:53.650> too

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
because there's just a little bit too

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.670 
because there's just a little bit too
much<00:05:54.070> leverage<00:05:54.370> when<00:05:55.120> it's<00:05:55.210> further<00:05:55.449> out<00:05:55.510> here

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
much leverage when it's further out here

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.469 
much leverage when it's further out here
so<00:05:56.680> all<00:05:57.250> in<00:05:57.460> all<00:05:57.550> I<00:05:57.610> think<00:05:57.729> this<00:05:58.060> is<00:05:58.210> a<00:05:58.240> pretty

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
so all in all I think this is a pretty

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.090 
so all in all I think this is a pretty
decent<00:05:58.660> knife<00:05:58.960> probably<00:05:59.650> not<00:05:59.770> one<00:05:59.919> of<00:05:59.949> my

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
decent knife probably not one of my

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.920 
decent knife probably not one of my
favorites<00:06:00.550> and<00:06:00.790> at<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.419> price<00:06:01.630> point<00:06:01.870> that

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
favorites and at the price point that

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.480 
favorites and at the price point that
it's<00:06:02.110> at<00:06:02.260> I<00:06:02.440> would<00:06:02.500> expect<00:06:02.919> a<00:06:03.100> little<00:06:03.280> bit

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
it's at I would expect a little bit

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.520 
it's at I would expect a little bit
better<00:06:03.639> design<00:06:03.970> at<00:06:04.570> least<00:06:04.810> in<00:06:04.930> terms<00:06:05.139> of<00:06:05.410> the

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
better design at least in terms of the

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.350 
better design at least in terms of the
serrations<00:06:05.860> slash<00:06:06.400> saw<00:06:06.760> teeth<00:06:07.000> in<00:06:07.120> the<00:06:07.210> back

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
serrations slash saw teeth in the back

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.950 
serrations slash saw teeth in the back
they<00:06:08.110> didn't<00:06:08.350> do<00:06:08.410> too<00:06:08.620> well<00:06:08.650> on<00:06:09.419> wood<00:06:10.419> not<00:06:10.720> sort

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
they didn't do too well on wood not sort

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.870 
they didn't do too well on wood not sort
of<00:06:10.990> thing<00:06:11.200> but<00:06:11.770> they<00:06:11.889> might<00:06:12.070> be<00:06:12.190> pretty<00:06:12.460> decent

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
of thing but they might be pretty decent

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.000 
of thing but they might be pretty decent
on<00:06:13.000> like<00:06:13.660> a<00:06:13.690> fuselage<00:06:14.200> of<00:06:14.350> a<00:06:14.380> plane<00:06:14.590> where<00:06:14.860> it's

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
on like a fuselage of a plane where it's

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.290 
on like a fuselage of a plane where it's
aluminum<00:06:15.910> is<00:06:16.030> sort<00:06:16.180> of<00:06:16.210> wood<00:06:16.560> but<00:06:17.639> it<00:06:18.639> chopped

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
aluminum is sort of wood but it chopped

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.150 
aluminum is sort of wood but it chopped
pretty<00:06:19.600> decently<00:06:19.960> despite<00:06:20.530> the<00:06:20.680> fact<00:06:20.889> that<00:06:21.130> I

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
pretty decently despite the fact that I

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.830 
pretty decently despite the fact that I
couldn't<00:06:21.490> put<00:06:21.760> my<00:06:21.820> full<00:06:22.150> weight<00:06:22.180> into<00:06:22.660> it

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
couldn't put my full weight into it

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.040 
couldn't put my full weight into it
for<00:06:23.380> a<00:06:23.410> hard<00:06:23.770> swing<00:06:24.039> because<00:06:24.450> the<00:06:25.450> handle<00:06:25.870> is<00:06:26.020> a

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
for a hard swing because the handle is a

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.900 
for a hard swing because the handle is a
little<00:06:26.320> bit<00:06:26.440> rough<00:06:26.560> on<00:06:26.680> my<00:06:26.800> hands<00:06:27.130> and<00:06:27.280> my

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
little bit rough on my hands and my

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.460 
little bit rough on my hands and my
hands<00:06:28.270> aren't<00:06:28.510> that<00:06:28.750> soft<00:06:29.050> they're<00:06:29.320> pretty

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
hands aren't that soft they're pretty

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.050 
hands aren't that soft they're pretty
tough<00:06:29.710> but<00:06:30.100> you<00:06:30.370> know<00:06:30.460> I<00:06:30.490> still<00:06:30.729> wasn't<00:06:30.910> able

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
tough but you know I still wasn't able

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.260 
tough but you know I still wasn't able
to<00:06:31.240> do<00:06:31.419> a<00:06:31.600> full<00:06:32.080> on<00:06:32.110> swing<00:06:32.940> carving<00:06:33.940> with<00:06:34.090> it

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
to do a full on swing carving with it

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.969 
to do a full on swing carving with it
was<00:06:34.389> pretty<00:06:34.600> decent<00:06:35.020> although<00:06:35.560> I<00:06:35.590> wish<00:06:35.830> they

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
was pretty decent although I wish they

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.620 
was pretty decent although I wish they
brought<00:06:36.160> the<00:06:36.310> blade<00:06:36.490> all<00:06:36.700> the<00:06:36.729> way<00:06:36.850> to<00:06:37.000> the

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
brought the blade all the way to the

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.020 
brought the blade all the way to the
handguard<00:06:38.050> so<00:06:38.620> that<00:06:38.830> you<00:06:38.950> could<00:06:39.130> really<00:06:39.580> work

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
handguard so that you could really work

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.150 
handguard so that you could really work
the<00:06:40.240> leverage<00:06:40.570> on<00:06:40.720> it<00:06:40.750> it<00:06:41.500> split<00:06:41.740> really<00:06:42.010> well

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
the leverage on it it split really well

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.120 
the leverage on it it split really well
it<00:06:42.580> chopped<00:06:43.060> pretty<00:06:43.360> decently<00:06:43.720> and<00:06:44.130> yeah

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
it chopped pretty decently and yeah

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.860 
it chopped pretty decently and yeah
overall<00:06:45.729> I<00:06:45.760> think<00:06:45.910> it's<00:06:46.150> a<00:06:46.270> previous<00:06:46.660> a<00:06:46.690> knife

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
overall I think it's a previous a knife

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.570 
overall I think it's a previous a knife
so<00:06:47.440> I<00:06:47.470> hope<00:06:47.650> you<00:06:47.770> guys<00:06:47.860> liked<00:06:48.070> the<00:06:48.160> review<00:06:48.280> let
