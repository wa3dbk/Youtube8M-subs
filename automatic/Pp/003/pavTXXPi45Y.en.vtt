00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:09.820 
grip the fibers and it means that you
can<00:01:08.659> use<00:01:08.750> again<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.229> again<00:01:09.439> instead<00:01:09.710> of

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
can use again and again instead of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.130 
can use again and again instead of
