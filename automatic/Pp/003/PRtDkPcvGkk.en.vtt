00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.630 
him and and go and they're plenty strong
or<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.380> double<00:02:01.680> them<00:02:01.740> up<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.340> then

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
or you can double them up like this then

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.010 
or you can double them up like this then
they're<00:02:02.850> double<00:02:03.390> plenty<00:02:04.110> strong<00:02:04.350> right<00:02:04.920> so

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
they're double plenty strong right so

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.509 
they're double plenty strong right so
you<00:02:07.020> know<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.530> screw<00:02:07.799> one<00:02:07.979> up<00:02:08.160> or<00:02:08.429> you

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
you know and if you screw one up or you

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.130 
you know and if you screw one up or you
get<00:02:08.640> welds<00:02:09.030> badder<00:02:09.299> on<00:02:09.570> it<00:02:09.720> or<00:02:09.810> something<00:02:10.079> like

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
get welds badder on it or something like

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.470 
get welds badder on it or something like
that<00:02:10.410> nobody<00:02:10.619> cares<00:02:11.009> about<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.850> let's<00:02:12.060> grab

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
that nobody cares about it so let's grab

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.410 
that nobody cares about it so let's grab
the<00:02:12.510> fixture<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:13.049> we'll<00:02:13.350> cut<00:02:13.530> one<00:02:13.709> and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
the fixture and we'll cut one and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.120 
the fixture and we'll cut one and
and<00:02:14.510> been<00:02:14.690> one<00:02:14.900> all<00:02:15.470> right<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.890> get<00:02:15.980> one

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
and been one all right so you get one

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.920 
and been one all right so you get one
mark<00:02:16.340> for<00:02:16.370> link<00:02:16.760> here<00:02:17.030> I'm<00:02:17.180> just<00:02:17.420> going<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.720> use

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
mark for link here I'm just going to use

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:28.449 
mark for link here I'm just going to use
some<00:02:18.099> some<00:02:19.099> bolt<00:02:19.370> cutters<00:02:19.459> here<00:02:27.459> something

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
some some bolt cutters here something

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.620 
some some bolt cutters here something
like<00:02:28.520> that<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:30.050> these<00:02:30.170> are<00:02:30.319> 16<00:02:30.770> inches<00:02:31.630> four

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
like that so these are 16 inches four

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.470 
like that so these are 16 inches four
hundred<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:32.989> ten<00:02:33.140> millimeters<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.069> now<00:02:34.730> you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
hundred and ten millimeters and now you

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.000 
hundred and ten millimeters and now you
know<00:02:35.569> before<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:35.959> get<00:02:36.110> carried<00:02:36.350> away<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.709> go

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
know before you get carried away and go

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.490 
know before you get carried away and go
and<00:02:37.190> bend<00:02:37.430> this<00:02:37.580> thing<00:02:37.640> be<00:02:38.300> sure<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:39.230> deep

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
and bend this thing be sure to to deep

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.650 
and bend this thing be sure to to deep
round<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.069> ends<00:02:40.340> real<00:02:40.519> nice<00:02:40.760> before<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.390> bend

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
round the ends real nice before you bend

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.390 
round the ends real nice before you bend
it<00:02:41.840> because<00:02:42.110> it's<00:02:42.319> really<00:02:42.500> hard<00:02:42.769> to<00:02:42.890> do<00:02:43.040> after

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
it because it's really hard to do after

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.820 
it because it's really hard to do after
it's<00:02:43.519> been<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.269> I'm<00:02:44.840> just<00:02:44.959> gonna<00:02:45.110> bust<00:02:45.650> them

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
it's been so I'm just gonna bust them

00:02:45.830 --> 00:03:36.490 
it's been so I'm just gonna bust them
off<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.340> belt<00:02:46.970> sander

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.580 

okay<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.560> here's<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.810> bending<00:03:39.810> jig<00:03:40.080> here's

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
okay so here's the bending jig here's

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.880 
okay so here's the bending jig here's
our<00:03:40.740> blank<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:43.050> little<00:03:43.320> loop<00:03:43.500> this

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
our blank and the little loop this

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.800 
our blank and the little loop this
catches<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.090> end<00:03:45.300> there

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
catches the end there

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.660 
catches the end there
okay<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.800> then<00:03:46.890> we're<00:03:47.010> just<00:03:47.040> gonna<00:03:47.250> pull<00:03:47.550> it

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
okay and then we're just gonna pull it

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.550 
okay and then we're just gonna pull it
around<00:03:47.910> there<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.840> we<00:03:48.990> want<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> bend<00:03:49.410> this

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
around there and we want to bend this

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.430 
around there and we want to bend this
cold<00:03:49.950> because<00:03:53.390> that<00:03:54.390> preserves<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.050> strength

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
cold because that preserves the strength

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.240 
cold because that preserves the strength
in<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:56.690> steel<00:03:57.690> fact<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.620> makes<00:03:58.800> you<00:03:59.160> know

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
in the steel fact that makes you know

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.950 
in the steel fact that makes you know
cold<00:03:59.580> bending<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.090> actually<00:04:00.450> work<00:04:00.600> hardens

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
cold bending and actually work hardens

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.510 
cold bending and actually work hardens
it<00:04:01.080> a<00:04:01.110> little<00:04:01.380> bit<00:04:01.530> more<00:04:01.740> even<00:04:03.050> and<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:05.370> may

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
it a little bit more even and you may

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.760 
it a little bit more even and you may
need<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.760> bending<00:04:06.210> need<00:04:06.530> depending<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:07.620> how

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
need a bending need depending on how

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.430 
need a bending need depending on how
short<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.250> make<00:04:08.460> these<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.110> it's<00:04:10.110> gonna<00:04:10.260> go

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
short you make these so it's gonna go

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.120 
short you make these so it's gonna go
ahead<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.620> Bend<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.100> by<00:04:11.430> hand<00:04:11.700> yeah<00:04:13.130> you

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
ahead and Bend this by hand yeah you

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.340 
ahead and Bend this by hand yeah you
know<00:04:14.220> what<00:04:14.400> that's<00:04:14.820> probably<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.660> crappy

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
know what that's probably a crappy

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.370 
know what that's probably a crappy
camera<00:04:16.590> angle<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.209> okay<00:04:18.209> let's<00:04:18.330> try<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.720> it's

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
camera angle a okay let's try that it's

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.780 
camera angle a okay let's try that it's
probably<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.770> little<00:04:19.860> bit<00:04:20.010> better<00:04:22.520> hook<00:04:23.520> it<00:04:23.670> in

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
probably a little bit better hook it in

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.180 
probably a little bit better hook it in
there<00:04:24.030> all<00:04:24.510> right<00:04:24.740> let<00:04:25.740> er<00:04:25.770> rip

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
there all right let er rip

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.050 
there all right let er rip
all<00:04:27.150> right<00:04:27.360> do<00:04:27.600> it<00:04:27.750> fairly<00:04:28.020> quickly<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:29.060> little

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
all right do it fairly quickly a little

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.250 
all right do it fairly quickly a little
bit<00:04:30.270> past<00:04:30.510> 180<00:04:31.130> okay<00:04:32.840> okay<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.730> then<00:04:36.260> making

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
bit past 180 okay okay and then making

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.670 
bit past 180 okay okay and then making
sure<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:38.510> either<00:04:39.510> going<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.020> right<00:04:40.140> way<00:04:40.200> we

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
sure that either going the right way we

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.470 
sure that either going the right way we
wanted<00:04:40.920> to<00:04:41.070> make<00:04:41.250> an<00:04:41.400> opposite<00:04:41.910> Bend<00:04:42.180> here

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
wanted to make an opposite Bend here

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.900 
wanted to make an opposite Bend here
like<00:04:43.140> that<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.710> then<00:04:44.220> we<00:04:44.310> want<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.580> get<00:04:44.730> this

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
like that and then we want to get this

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.620 
like that and then we want to get this
in<00:04:45.120> plane<00:04:45.450> this<00:04:45.720> way<00:04:45.960> here<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:47.160> this<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.510> know
