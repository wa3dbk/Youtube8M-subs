00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.750
 you understood it we are at home 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.640
 michelin to clermont ferrand michelin who 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.280
 provides tires to all teams 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.200
 of lmp1 and the tire occupies a place 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.470
 central with the new regulation 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.450
 because its width is going to be reduced objective 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.210
 of course save fuel 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.220
 when a fed day if it happens and yes 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.780
 welcome weaken that then there we are 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.300
 on a tire 2014 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.880
 here and there we have a tire of the year 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.120
 last one there is a big gap because 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.309
 than 5 cm to 5 cm so what is 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.960
 arrives with a tire that at five 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.489
 centimeters of me in width have the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.380
 same performance has the same 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.660
 handling is the goal 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.420
 in fact then it's not obvious since 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.490
 we have less of as on the ground now he 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.680
 will have to go through a new 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.290
 tire development find the way 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.090
 to give as much flu is as much 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.700
 of efficiency to the car then the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.230
 solution it goes by what is the good 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.240
 mix in the album what is it 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.820
 exactly the solution the engineer the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.330
 secret trail the secret is the good 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.400
 balanced 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.860
 he'll be able to play the engineer at 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.840
 able to play with the materials well 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.820
 sure the skeleton of the tire what we 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.690
 calls architecture the angles of 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.870
 tablecloths that we will use 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.820
 and then the shape of the 2 0 on that side 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.030
 but here it is more or less flat so 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.520
 this triangle between skeleton materials 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.920
 architecture and form that's what will 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.980
 extract the maximum performance from the 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.980
 car 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.750
 the lmp2 already have deposits that are 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.760
 less wide is what you are 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.590
 from the lmp2 model to work 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.200
 there currently or not actually in the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.850
 prototypes case lmp1 lmp2 it's like 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.229
 very different and even though 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.670
 dimensions become equivalent 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.160
 we left practically a leaf 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.780
 white these are the same tires that go 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.900
 go to all the stables or is it 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.120
 that you are tailor-made for 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.980
 toyota porsche or audi then at 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.890
 Michelin we have a very strong philosophy 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.780
 particular we will develop the tire 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.150
 for each vehicle 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.130
 ah yes by cons at the end of 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.260
 development each team will be able 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.390
 test the boyfriend and that's how it is 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.520
 which ensures that we actually we do 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.500
 not give a particular advantage to 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.180
 intimate or another you are the only ones 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.710
 manufacturers for lmp1 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.060
 how come you are 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.800
 are then actually what is 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.840
 important to know is that for the 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.670
 category lmp2 as for the lmp2 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.960
 Besides, it is open to all 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.190
 manufacturers all those who want 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.900
 come play they have right 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.970
 you do not have exclusivity not 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.920
 at all against today all 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.140
 the main stables trust 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.060
 michelin good and if it comes to the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.830
 course stone the goal of course for 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.390
 the crews will be spending the least amount of 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.060
 possible time in the stands 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.650
 an unknown this year fred with this 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.900
 dual hybrid system that's how the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.860
 tires will support this extra 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.750
 power 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.250
 we know that there is only one track of 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.250
 tires to change the four 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.720
 wheels after a full fuel or 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.700
 possible mechanical intervention 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.200
 the duration of pit stops 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.020
 can extend 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.450
 it is therefore essential to preserve 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.209
 longevity of the gones on several relays 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.130
 in mans we know we can not win 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.370
 the race in the stands but we can 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.370
 lose it 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.120
 are we still winning in 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.770
 longevity on a tire today a 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.810
 tire change was about 22 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.250
 penalty seconds and so in fact there 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.860
 will have to try to have a little that they 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.910
 be very fast very constant and 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.430
 they can do the most 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.760
 kilometers possible with that we have we go 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.749
 say 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.890
 the perfect match 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:02.120
 good next time we are interested in 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.219
 fuels but right now we're going 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.019
 test the latest Michelin tire 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:10.760
 these parties because viva fred at these 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:12.590
 parties that went all-in for departure and 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.180
 I feel treated for understood 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.290
 powerful that I really had between 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.290
 Tangier then to the floor
