 formed here and already at the entrance to 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.580
 Moscow itself but of course it is not 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.670

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.099
 village called chills and like that 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.720
 give a symbolic chill to the skin of this 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.520
 stories because most people 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.950
 it was not even the blow from the fact that he died 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.869
 several tons fell into the cabin 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.390

 who were not talking here and here they are 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:04.860
 we were told about how it was 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.479
 blood and meat screams is the first 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.660
 eyewitness memories general impressions 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.459
 shock and misunderstanding as bus passengers 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.440
 could be literally buried under 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.790
 several tons of rubble like this 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.890
 happened seen on the record with 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.760
 DVR oncoming machine here 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.190
 LiAZ bus 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.470
 Podolsk Moscow drives off from the stop 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.720
 it moves at low speed and here 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.720
 to him suddenly at great speed literally 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.269
 KAMAZ flies up to the top loaded with gravel and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.810
 here 's the voice impressions on the other 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.790
 parties 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.010
 says the driver of the car was driving 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.379
 right behind the bus he jumped on 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.530
 oncoming lane and on an opposite on such 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.010
 by speed 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.480
 how much speed was we 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.300
 very big 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.240
 if the bus pulled 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.270
 cut his speed was very big 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.370
 As I have already seen , how many points? 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.560
 squeezed the result of the bus literally 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.570
 breaks into two unequal parts and in 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.580
 the back half of Leo falls asleep 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.170
 several tons of rubble eyewitnesses say 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.440
 before show bus passengers 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.210
 their first aid was literally 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.760
 dig out my boy first 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.860
 somewhere no 3 all covered in blood was a boy 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.080
 but the whole was immediately carried 1 in an ambulance 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.700
 then got the girl bright let 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.080
 pigtailed too she is alive but years 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.870
 six or seven probably too 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.330
 bloodied legs smaller than little boy 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.040
 from the beginning of the shovels those could air fungus and 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.470
 when already shovels in corpses started before 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.630
 only with hands so hand in hand all these 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.990
 cops sometimes all these follow 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.100
 all washed in the bus was 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.350
 68 people terrible blows 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.330
 rockfall provoked by him led to 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.590
 to the fact that the number of victims grew fast 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.480
 rates 48 1214 finally 18 states 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.640
 some of the wounded who were taken to 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.650
 the hospital is severe that number 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.840
 the dead can rise soon and 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.550
 rescuers worked quickly helicopters 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.890
 for evacuating the wounded arrived for 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.750
 just a few minutes but what exactly 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.970
 led to so many victims 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.380
 celebrity driving a kamaz which 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.140
 most likely looking for the main culprit 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.660
 this disaster was a 46-year-old 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.910

 continued to ride this car by 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.650
 you can't call another 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.930
 and transported myself to talk about the reason then 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.020
