00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.710
 hello friends i thought to come back 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.250
 to the idea of a lavalier microphone check 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.109
 which connects to the gopro camera this 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.749
 You can make an adapter 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.900
 which connects the camera with the microphone and 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:30.239
 This conversation arose a couple of days ago with 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.850
 natasha cry she tried too leg out 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.980
 them keeps trying to use 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.130
 such a recording microphone 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.370
 less noise inside the car ie 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.910
 her car apparently even more noisy 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.820
 than mine 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.030
 and when I stand like this 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.360
 so quiet as you start to go there 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.880
 especially on the highway there are quite a few 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.220
 noise is the only thing that is my example 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:01.090
 microphone he 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.550
 mono runs on one track so i 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.690
 then when I mount means must 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.520
 this is left left ear left how to become 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.500
 left speaker 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.080
 let on both and on the left and on the right 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.200
 there is such a ponte stereo 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.120
 just so that those who do not have headphones 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.479
 it turned out that they had in one ear to hear 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.660
 the other is not for this need to say that 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.500
 Natalia bought such a microphone 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:32.680
 with an adapter for someone's armor camera there 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.320
 it is written that it is in stereo and mikrofonchik 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.820
 I have the microphone tip from her stereo here 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.770
 I can see the difference and I can not even 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.900
 imagine how this is 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.750
 microphone which is on the lapel yes then 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:51.040
 like one such eyelet sticks out of it 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.700
 how can it turn out to be stereo 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.240
 I do not guess but in fact I can 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.380
 to tell that 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.399
 box here I saw her writing on it 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.880
 saw and a microphone with a sterile tip 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:10.630
 also saw therefore not say anything 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.520
 but I can talk like Natalia 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.270
 I thought about changing my microphone 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.560
 and here you can really somehow you 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.660
 more like you say I 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.060
 I specifically write this plot here 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.880
 the plot is just a conversation short with that 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.790
 what if you say yes that's better 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.829
 less than normal noise 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.489
 I don't know the power of there, but less 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.689
 noise then I can gladly have this 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.480
 do that is and i absolutely not 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:44.950
 make it difficult to mount a track with 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.950
 one ear for 2 is a simple matter 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.950
 is happy
