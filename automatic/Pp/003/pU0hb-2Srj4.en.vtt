this flexible OLED prototype our team

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.330 
this flexible OLED prototype our team
was<00:00:49.289> able<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.559> make<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> high<00:00:50.070> resolution

here with this bended display we have

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.060 
here with this bended display we have
expanded<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.020> canvas<00:01:40.410> available<00:01:40.890> for

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
sides of the device so for example if I

00:01:47.340 --> 00:02:02.640 
sides of the device so for example if I
receive<00:01:47.670> an<00:01:47.729> important<00:01:48.270> message

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.560 

I<00:02:02.710> can<00:02:03.520> see<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.820> come<00:02:04.000> through<00:02:04.210> while<00:02:04.450> the
