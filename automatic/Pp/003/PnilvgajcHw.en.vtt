use<00:00:52.990> the<00:00:53.170> pry<00:00:54.060> sometimes<00:00:55.060> it<00:00:55.210> takes<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.540> little

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
use the pry sometimes it takes a little

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.030 
use the pry sometimes it takes a little
bit<00:00:55.870> of<00:00:55.960> work<00:00:56.080> to<00:00:58.080> get<00:00:59.080> this<00:00:59.350> point<00:00:59.710> you<00:00:59.830> can

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
bit of work to get this point you can

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.060 
bit of work to get this point you can
usually<00:01:00.990> pull<00:01:01.990> it<00:01:02.080> straight<00:01:02.200> hours<00:01:02.500> okay<00:01:02.890> now

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
usually pull it straight hours okay now

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.340 
usually pull it straight hours okay now
that<00:01:03.220> you've<00:01:03.370> removed<00:01:03.580> those<00:01:04.000> two<00:01:04.270> to<00:01:04.809> two

pieces holding it in just good rock this

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:15.300 
pieces holding it in just good rock this
back<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.140> forth<00:01:08.200> here<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.740> it<00:01:14.860> pops<00:01:15.070> out<00:01:15.280> just

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
back and forth here and it pops out just

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.240 
back and forth here and it pops out just
like<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:16.050> basically<00:01:17.050> this<00:01:17.740> piece<00:01:17.979> right

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
like that basically this piece right

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.490 
like that basically this piece right
here<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.760> this<00:01:19.030> one<00:01:19.270> down<00:01:19.390> here<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:20.170> insert

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
here and this one down here that insert

have<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.080> rock<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.380> back<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.560> forth<00:01:23.800> and<00:01:24.130> then

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
have to rock it back and forth and then

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.370 
have to rock it back and forth and then
pull<00:01:24.520> it<00:01:24.580> straight<00:01:24.640> out<00:01:24.880> now<00:01:25.810> replacing<00:01:26.320> the

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
pull it straight out now replacing the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.650 
pull it straight out now replacing the
boltons

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
boltons

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.090 
boltons
recently<00:01:28.660> straight<00:01:28.869> forward<00:01:29.229> this<00:01:29.710> would<00:01:29.979> be

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
recently straight forward this would be

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.640 
recently straight forward this would be
the<00:01:30.220> reverse<00:01:30.520> light<00:01:30.790> this<00:01:31.180> would<00:01:31.330> be<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:32.050> turn

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
the reverse light this would be the turn

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.760 
the reverse light this would be the turn
signal<00:01:33.070> right<00:01:33.550> here<00:01:34.410> let's<00:01:35.410> do<00:01:35.530> that<00:01:35.740> simply

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
signal right here let's do that simply

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.109 
signal right here let's do that simply
twist<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.700> pull<00:01:39.910> out<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.330> there's<00:01:40.810> your<00:01:40.990> bulb

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
for the for the reverse light do the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.550 
for the for the reverse light do the
same<00:01:46.060> thing<00:01:46.390> right<00:01:46.750> there<00:01:47.020> just<00:01:47.320> pull<00:01:47.530> that
