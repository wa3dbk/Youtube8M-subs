funny<00:00:23.730> now<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.720> thing<00:00:24.750> about<00:00:24.900> rock<00:00:25.230> crabs<00:00:25.500> is

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
funny now the thing about rock crabs is

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.259 
funny now the thing about rock crabs is
that<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> multi<00:00:26.279> combat<00:00:26.640> zone<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.060> see

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
that it's a multi combat zone so you see
