00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
all around it took me a little bit to

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.170

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.940 
get the stares right at first I had this
day<00:04:10.360> of<00:04:10.480> right<00:04:10.630> in<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.900> middle<00:04:11.080> and<00:04:11.350> then<00:04:11.500> they

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
day of right in the middle and then they

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.320 
day of right in the middle and then they
split<00:04:12.250> off<00:04:12.490> and<00:04:12.930> hit<00:04:13.930> me<00:04:14.110> upstairs<00:04:14.880> but<00:04:15.880> then

split off and hit me upstairs but then

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.849 
split off and hit me upstairs but then
it<00:04:16.930> didn't<00:04:17.320> work<00:04:17.440> out<00:04:17.650> so<00:04:18.070> I<00:04:19.500> figured<00:04:20.500> I'd<00:04:20.710> do

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
it didn't work out so I figured I'd do

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.060 
it didn't work out so I figured I'd do
three<00:04:21.220> wide<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.790> just<00:04:22.720> do<00:04:22.900> each<00:04:23.140> corner<00:04:23.620> over

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
three wide and just do each corner over

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.750 
three wide and just do each corner over
here<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.780> looks<00:04:25.810> pretty<00:04:26.230> good<00:04:26.730> yeah<00:04:27.730> i

think i might add some tables or a

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.310 
think i might add some tables or a
column<00:04:29.950> or<00:04:30.100> something<00:04:30.490> inside<00:04:31.060> Oh<00:04:31.320> almost
