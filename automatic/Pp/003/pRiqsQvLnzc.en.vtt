00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.470
 the team with which this case so that it is still there by the 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.690
 mobile phones and especially the new ways to get them out of 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.620
 standby mode of his review I feel that it is useless and all is well 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.170
 but me it was urgent to find a new system that's why this name 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.910
 because the touch screens are real sneaks 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.050
 of tissues why basketball when we are con we do not want her spouse by 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.360
 example see the look of these cash sms and his care knows they are 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.349
 still not except that on some police phones a trained to 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.520
 we have fingerprints if we did not wash our hands 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.940
 and on the screen the trace of the password or the code it takes for them composed 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.809
 on some phones do not have a shape so you have to type a word of 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.480
 pass the trace remains on the screen and so it's very easy for someone 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.540
 to get the information back so we had to find something else for that 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.600
 to avoid this problem short every password and it's rather annoying 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.010
 the final courses ended up with a v6 and a sport chassis to enter without them 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.040
 will be family-based and the messages in which cases 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.210
 to find the researchers are working on the new solutions including 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.120
 a 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.739
 with hits of small pictograms that move in all directions so we 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.629
 can leave trace good wearing the dirty fingers but it is to detour trace to 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.210
 the screen but it's not a problem since the elite the little ones 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.770
 pictograms move then there is to unlock the screen or go to 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.880
 standby mode but the idea is enough nokia that runs through this solution and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.430
 move his little icons like this and it's a password that we will do 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.100
 by positioning the title the aso on the titan the parisian kids random 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.210
 in the fighting 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.690
 but before losing again work on systems that use a 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.470
 wand as key a few favorites so when in addition the system manages and 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.920
 the software does not work anymore we need a physical system there 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.810
 the idea is to use a jump a ring 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.010
 with a sense and like 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.050
 for you expect as much the times of day by day medieval and one has 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.680
 has a real ring on his finger try balderton the exhausting skin on his 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.840
 cell phone screen serves as the key to a real gold wharf 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.800
 ring at little special because of touch drivers and we arrive like 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.440
 it can unlock his phone yesterday that the one with 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.110
 the team under the tag who can unlock funds and why not there 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.100
 biometrics fingerprints it's a movie that's thought that's what 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.200
 I say is exhausted before this phone by the afp soccer 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.700
 not very reliable and especially it's a problem when you want to pass 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.560
 an emergency call between the phone and very very quickly if we have to go through 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.020
 his finger many times to unlock women it works 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.020
