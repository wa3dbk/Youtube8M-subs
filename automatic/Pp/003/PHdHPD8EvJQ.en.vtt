00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
color now kind of scared because I think

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.950 
color now kind of scared because I think
it<00:00:54.809> might<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:54.989> too<00:00:55.410> light<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:55.739> me<00:00:56.719> but<00:00:57.719> let's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it might be too light for me but let's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:08.219 
it might be too light for me but let's
check<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> out

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.440 

I<00:01:08.259> don't<00:01:09.100> know<00:01:09.189> why<00:01:09.340> that<00:01:09.759> lipstick<00:01:10.090> on<00:01:10.240> like<00:01:10.420> a

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
I don't know why that lipstick on like a

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.139 
I don't know why that lipstick on like a
gorilla<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.600> are<00:01:14.640> definitely<00:01:15.640> doesn't

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
gorilla but are definitely doesn't

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.709 
gorilla but are definitely doesn't
change<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.450> color<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.719> my<00:01:16.840> teeth<00:01:17.079> that's<00:01:17.320> nice

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
change the color of my teeth that's nice

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.889 
change the color of my teeth that's nice
but<00:01:19.719> if<00:01:19.869> anything<00:01:20.289> I'd<00:01:20.409> probably<00:01:21.210> wear<00:01:22.210> a<00:01:22.600> lip

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
but if anything I'd probably wear a lip

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.230 
but if anything I'd probably wear a lip
liner<00:01:23.110> that's<00:01:23.409> a<00:01:23.560> little<00:01:23.740> bit<00:01:23.920> darker<00:01:24.310> or

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
liner that's a little bit darker or

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.600 
liner that's a little bit darker or
maybe<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.929> lip<00:01:26.439> gloss<00:01:26.470> that's<00:01:27.069> a<00:01:27.189> little<00:01:27.429> bit

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
maybe a lip gloss that's a little bit

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.450 
maybe a lip gloss that's a little bit
darker<00:01:28.270> that<00:01:28.299> will<00:01:28.569> make<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:29.250> appear<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.280> little

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
darker that will make it appear a little

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.380 
darker that will make it appear a little
bit<00:01:30.610> darker<00:01:32.670> because<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.909> is<00:01:34.030> on<00:01:34.149> the<00:01:34.240> light

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
bit darker because it is on the light

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.499 
bit darker because it is on the light
side<00:01:34.569> but<00:01:34.810> if<00:01:34.899> you<00:01:35.049> like<00:01:35.350> like<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.610> myth<00:01:37.000> or<00:01:39.509> Foe

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
side but if you like like a myth or Foe

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.260 
side but if you like like a myth or Foe
or<00:01:40.959> anything<00:01:41.229> like<00:01:41.500> that<00:01:41.560> as<00:01:42.490> far<00:01:42.819> as<00:01:42.849> MAC

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
or anything like that as far as MAC

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.059 
or anything like that as far as MAC
lipsticks<00:01:44.170> go<00:01:44.409> this<00:01:45.189> is<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.369> really<00:01:45.459> nice

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
lipsticks go this is a really nice

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.749 
lipsticks go this is a really nice
formula<00:01:48.069> too<00:01:48.250> because<00:01:48.729> it's<00:01:49.060> not<00:01:49.299> drying<00:01:49.720> I

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
formula too because it's not drying I

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.520 
formula too because it's not drying I
must<00:01:51.759> feel<00:01:51.909> like<00:01:52.030> there's<00:01:52.240> like<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.450> lip<00:01:53.259> balm

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
must feel like there's like a lip balm

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.800 
must feel like there's like a lip balm
in<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:53.950> mix<00:01:54.880> with<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.090> because<00:01:55.420> it's<00:01:55.539> really

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
in the mix with it because it's really

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.899 
in the mix with it because it's really
really<00:01:55.929> nice<00:01:56.319> and<00:01:56.560> creamy<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.640> doesn't

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
really nice and creamy and it doesn't

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.010 
really nice and creamy and it doesn't
feel<00:01:58.000> like<00:01:58.090> it's<00:01:58.270> gonna<00:01:58.390> dry<00:01:58.659> out<00:01:58.689> my<00:01:58.989> lips

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
feel like it's gonna dry out my lips

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.479 
feel like it's gonna dry out my lips
that's<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.709> bad<00:01:59.860> thing<00:02:00.039> about<00:02:00.069> most<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.270> Mac's

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
that's the bad thing about most of Mac's

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.740 
that's the bad thing about most of Mac's
formulas<00:02:03.489> or<00:02:03.700> lip<00:02:03.880> formulas<00:02:04.329> is<00:02:04.479> that<00:02:04.630> they're

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
formulas or lip formulas is that they're

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.710 
formulas or lip formulas is that they're
so<00:02:04.929> drying<00:02:05.259> or<00:02:05.500> so<00:02:05.649> sticky<00:02:06.069> and<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:07.060> don't<00:02:07.209> feel

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
so drying or so sticky and I don't feel

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.300 
so drying or so sticky and I don't feel
that<00:02:07.780> with<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:08.229> one<00:02:08.470> maybe<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:08.920> speak<00:02:09.099> it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
that with this one maybe it speak it

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.009 
that with this one maybe it speak it
says<00:02:09.519> it's<00:02:09.700> amplified<00:02:10.209> cream<00:02:10.539> maybe<00:02:10.780> that's

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
says it's amplified cream maybe that's
