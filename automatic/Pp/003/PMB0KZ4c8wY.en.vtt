00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.400
 huge hello to all today i want with 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.379
 you share your experiences and 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.539
 talk about gel polishes that can 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.640
 easy to use at home 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.529
 if you're interested, then surely 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.699
 stay with me and continue 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.920
 watch this video 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.260
 I think that the feet in instagram saw this 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.360
 manicure and with him I went through two weeks 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.119
 despite the fact that after this 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.590
 time varnish never broke off the nail 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.680
 the plate has grown strongly 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.960
 and it's time to change the cover first 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.829
 I will briefly show how I will remove the gel and 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.999
 then I'll show you how he put it on again 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.489
 I will use what is originally 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:47.949
 proposed set and for starters 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.280
 need to seal marigolds do 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.100
 it will need about 15 minutes 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.530
 using a cotton pad 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.839
 special agent and foil after 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.420
 how did 15-20 minutes go by 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.120
 separating gel polish from the nail plate with 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.010
 using an orange stick to do it 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:15.189
 need to be very careful not to hurt 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:17.259
 nail is a good need every time 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.090
 after we removed the gel polish on 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.549
 wear special regenerating 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.740
 butter by the way I want to note that I have it 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.399
 very fond now I use only 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.399
 superfluous 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.039
 we polish the nail plate and attach 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.429
 shape marigold if necessary 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.829
 unconditionally working on cuticles and the 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.079
 the main thing is not to overdo gel polish 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.030
 need to be applied strictly on the fat 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.360
 nail plate so take 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.640
 special degreaser and 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.890
 By the way, I really wanted to point out that everything 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.109
 means that a degreaser that means 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.959
 do not possess gel polish remover 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:01.509
 by some sharp irritating scent not 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.759
 there will be an acetone smell so obvious 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.459
 because there is a perfume here and 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.829
 this procedure is enough 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:16.870
 easily portable up to surrounding and 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:19.480
 actually for you i'm gel polish on 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.400
 Found in 2 it happens and in three layers in 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.150
 depending on color and not degree 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.640
 cover 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.370
 Specifically, this gel varnish I will wear 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.629
 two layers and each time a layer i will 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.910
 seal in the lamp 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.829
 I turn on a special automatic 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.030
 the timer is very convenient no need to follow 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.500
 for time, you just need just during 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.510
 push the lamp in and wait 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.609
 when the lamp turns off 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.760
 be sure to pay attention to 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:48.510
 that marigolds on thumbs I'm 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.700
 I seal it separately in the lamp because 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.920
 whole palm put them unrealistic 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.230
 will be tilted and gel polish 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.720
 will unevenly harden it 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.849
 definitely not looking very nice i 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.519
 always after any procedure love 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.260
 I apply cuticle oil again 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.769
 the same oil on our 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.799
 abundantly on the area of ​​the cuticle on the side 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.840
 rollers and wait for complete drying 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.480
 I want to say that I also use these varnishes 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.579
 I had time to make myself and a pedicure and I want 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.030
 say all my hopes come true 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.650
 I was very pleased and while my 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.930
 the collection unfortunately consists of only 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.120
 of four shades but surely she 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.769
 will be replenished but also at the end of it 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.630
 I would like a very brief video 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.120
 go over that set 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.879
 I appeared and tell about him to my 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.739
 a look of significant advantages and first plus 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.960
 it is of course the ratio of price and 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.570
 quality is what 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.330
 it is absolutely justifiable and the price is you 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.170
 get very good enough 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.170
 a complete set which by the way is absolutely not 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.240
 requires no further in our yes 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.640
 that is, everything is from cotton discs to 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.170
 funds required for withdrawal 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.420
 nail strengthening and so on and of course 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.940
 I would also like to note that you 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.220
 you make your own set you can 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.410

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.110

 You can create your own set with 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.800
