00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
to the right of it instead of looking

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.740 
to the right of it instead of looking
over<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.370> shoot<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.910> reverb

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
over it you can shoot that reverb
