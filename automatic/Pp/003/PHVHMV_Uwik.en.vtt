00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.160
 well it 's cold winter morning 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.500
 during the first days of July place 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.400
 to take their classic the chocolatadas 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.099
 indoor for a breakfast full of 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.130
 chocolat bears nutrients that according to 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.650
 groups needs daily when it goes 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.809
 happening because it 's with kiosk flipping 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.910
 by salazar and look what you discover 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.610
 that come that gasify Thursday is in 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.510
 the crew 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.690
 if the all the enemy goddesses of 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.230
 gallitos pepitos is in valid is the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.460
 of the first video reaction checking 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.830
 people the first time that the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.840
 convulsive but once bought 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.330
 package like two of these cookies and the 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.430
 rest of the real ones because because in the 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.430
 first time they were very cloying 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.290
 and I could not resist finishing the package 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.490
 I just could not and since then 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.229
 luck holds that sparks nuggets 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.090
 they are still his line of visits 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.180
 preferred as the nuggets were 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.960
 he always likes to like it 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.869
 but good, everyone came back 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.760
 and it's time to see if you really look for me 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.050
 or not because I think the first 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.540
 impression let go by the antagonism 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.790
 before these cookies so now 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.790
 let's try but first 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.870
 two 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.969
 and it is not for you 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.470
 ah 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.369
 washington that now yes open this 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.369
 package 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.989
 like the competition of six in 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.989
 what is known 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.879
 I see it exactly like the nugget 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.879
 Sparks a little 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.140
 the difference of the slab mass 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.379
 it's rich melts in your mouth but not in 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.379
 hand 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.140
 are the two cantes that die 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.850
 but then because they have to be 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.540
 addictive social 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.189
 if they are richer than those babies 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.189
 but it does not generate addiction 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.920
 I could eat one or two but not 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.660
 what the network of 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.260
 power of the pips six passes of the 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.570
 chocolate chocolate is everything and everything 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.460
 characterized precisely by being the 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:58.320
 I preferred chocolate before 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:01.200
 They were disco highlights this big appetite 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.190
 of carrying are fucked but basically 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.190
 this fashion 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.340
 but like all life peking and with the 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.410
 little ones the normal ones I say 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.240
 it is logical that I am addicted to 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.100
 nuggets in larger size the nuggets 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.510
 sparks and novels islands all time that 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.850
 I'm just trying it out so 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.110
 basically that change opinion this is 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.700
 made richer than pips without 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.960
 However, I will continue to consume 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.760
 pepito guys this leave as a logo 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.700
 because there's nothing else from the other world are 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.820
 Chocolate cookies the dough is if it is 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.470
 top the chocolate 'slightly 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.380
 different is a magic touch but less 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.050
 addictive I do not know why you projects 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.800
 paid for whistles to the todd and I do not know 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.390
 why they did so much publicity 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.850
 I guess because they were difficult to 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.490
 get generate crazy consumerism 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.750
 crazy crazy 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.750
 but the world 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.450
 try it yourself so that and 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.410
 a looping recording the take away the week 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.410
 of the sweetness bye
