metronome<00:01:08.070> practicing<00:01:09.070> technique<00:01:09.490> that<00:01:09.670> had

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
metronome practicing technique that had

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.940 
metronome practicing technique that had
a<00:01:09.820> profound<00:01:10.090> effect<00:01:10.690> on<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.650> way<00:01:11.740> that<00:01:11.920> I

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
a profound effect on the way that I

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.330 
a profound effect on the way that I

it's<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.360> ability<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.869> hear<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.259> metronome

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
it's the ability to hear the metronome

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.940 
it's the ability to hear the metronome
on<00:01:17.890> beats<00:01:18.460> two<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:18.820> four<00:01:19.200> playing<00:01:20.200> half<00:01:20.649> notes

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
on beats two and four playing half notes

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.920 
on beats two and four playing half notes
but<00:01:21.280> but<00:01:21.520> displacing<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.240> half<00:01:22.420> note<00:01:22.450> so<00:01:22.810> it's

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
but but displacing the half note so it's

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.690 
but but displacing the half note so it's
not<00:01:23.020> at<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.259> front<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.740> measure<00:01:23.979> it's<00:01:24.520> on

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
not at the front of the measure it's on

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.030 
not at the front of the measure it's on
beats<00:01:24.909> two<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.270> four<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:26.170> then<00:01:26.530> phrasing

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
beats two and four and then phrasing

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.850

eighth<00:01:27.250> notes<00:01:27.640> over<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.210> top<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.860> we

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
eighth notes over the top of that we

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.859 
eighth notes over the top of that we
demonstrate<00:01:32.399> so<00:01:33.399> this<00:01:33.729> were<00:01:33.910> our<00:01:34.119> count<00:01:34.630> this

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
demonstrate so this were our count this

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.969

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.130 

okay<00:02:00.460> most<00:02:00.789> folks<00:02:01.149> if<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:01.630> put<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.899> metronome

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
okay most folks if you put the metronome

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.950 
okay most folks if you put the metronome
here<00:02:02.469> would<00:02:02.619> probably<00:02:02.770> go<00:02:03.189> one<00:02:04.119> two<00:02:04.479> three

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
here would probably go one two three

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.150 
here would probably go one two three
four<00:02:05.320> 1234<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:07.180> think<00:02:07.329> this<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.570> really<00:02:07.719> common

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
four 1234 I think this is really common

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.190 
four 1234 I think this is really common
but<00:02:09.160> we're<00:02:09.340> trying<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.790> flip<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.149> around<00:02:10.269> so

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
but we're trying to flip it around so

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.069 
but we're trying to flip it around so
here's<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.590> counting<00:02:11.950> technique<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:13.239> core

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
here's the counting technique to core
