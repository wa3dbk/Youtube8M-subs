00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.650 

so<00:00:41.190> I'm<00:00:41.309> standing<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.059> park<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
so I'm standing here in the park and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.979 
so I'm standing here in the park and
we're<00:00:43.649> about<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> race<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.840> my

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
we're about to have a race so on my

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.950 
we're about to have a race so on my
right<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.500> got<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> shinobi<00:00:47.280> prototype<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.300> on

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
right I got the shinobi prototype and on

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.200 
right I got the shinobi prototype and on
my<00:00:49.110> left<00:00:49.379> an<00:00:49.590> electric<00:00:50.309> scooter<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.000> we're

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
my left an electric scooter and we're

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.459 
my left an electric scooter and we're
going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.539> which<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:51.899> handles<00:00:52.350> better

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
going to see which one handles better

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.910 
going to see which one handles better
and<00:00:52.860> which<00:00:53.370> one<00:00:53.550> performs<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.930> race<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
and which one performs in a race so the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.529 
and which one performs in a race so the
shinobi<00:00:56.160> bike<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> lot<00:00:56.850> lighter<00:00:57.149> than<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
shinobi bike is a lot lighter than the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.330 
shinobi bike is a lot lighter than the
scooter<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.800> provide<00:00:59.039> better

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
scooter and it's going to provide better

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.060 
scooter and it's going to provide better
handling<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.879> better<00:01:00.270> acceleration<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
handling and better acceleration the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.229 
handling and better acceleration the
main<00:01:02.280> difference<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.850> two<00:01:02.910> vehicles

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
main difference in the two vehicles

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.920 
main difference in the two vehicles
besides<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.170> weight<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.250> batteries

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
besides the weight is the batteries

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.179 
besides the weight is the batteries
shinobi<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:06.990> powered<00:01:07.229> by<00:01:07.260> poly<00:01:07.650> lithium

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
shinobi is powered by poly lithium

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.480 
shinobi is powered by poly lithium
battery<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:09.090> charged<00:01:09.600> differently<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
battery it's charged differently and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.880 
battery it's charged differently and
allows<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.520> much<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.479> acceleration<00:01:13.409> with

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
allows for much more acceleration with

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.580 
allows for much more acceleration with
its<00:01:14.010> high<00:01:14.189> amp<00:01:14.490> output<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> scooter<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
its high amp output so the scooter is

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.859 
its high amp output so the scooter is
powered<00:01:17.009> by<00:01:17.070> lead<00:01:17.460> acid<00:01:17.970> batteries<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
powered by lead acid batteries the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.530 
powered by lead acid batteries the
amperage<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> lot<00:01:19.680> lower<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.299> weight

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
amperage is a lot lower and the weight

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.420 
amperage is a lot lower and the weight
is<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> lot<00:01:22.080> heavier<00:01:22.470> meaning<00:01:23.340> your

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is a lot heavier meaning your

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.800 
is a lot heavier meaning your
acceleration<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.150> not<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:24.720> as

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
acceleration is not going to be as

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
acceleration is not going to be as
powerful<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:26.220> both<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.549> these<00:01:26.790> batteries

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
powerful so both of these batteries

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.569 
powerful so both of these batteries
power<00:01:27.570> brushless<00:01:28.080> motors<00:01:28.740> let's<00:01:29.189> take<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> look

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
power brushless motors let's take a look

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.219 
power brushless motors let's take a look
at<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> scooter<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.049> notice

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
at the scooter one and you can notice

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.649 
at the scooter one and you can notice
that<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.650> motor<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.070> housed<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.030> very<00:01:33.509> small

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
that the motor is housed on a very small

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.280 
that the motor is housed on a very small
wheel<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:35.579> comparison<00:01:36.360> let's<00:01:36.540> take<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> look<00:01:37.079> at

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
wheel in comparison let's take a look at

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.679 
wheel in comparison let's take a look at
the<00:01:37.560> shinobi<00:01:37.920> motor<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> wheel<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.540> see

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the shinobi motor and wheel you can see

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.490 
the shinobi motor and wheel you can see
that<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> size<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.710> much<00:01:41.340> greater<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.350> now

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that the size is much greater so now

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.649 
that the size is much greater so now
that<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.710> took<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.979> look<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.189> both<00:01:44.430> bikes<00:01:44.790> let's

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that we took a look at both bikes let's

00:01:45.659 --> 00:02:30.560 
that we took a look at both bikes let's
see<00:01:45.869> which<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.229> performs<00:01:46.500> better<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.549> race

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.570 

it's<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.810> lot<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.110> fun<00:02:32.410> but<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.160> doesn't<00:02:33.459> match

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
it's a lot of fun but it doesn't match

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.510 
it's a lot of fun but it doesn't match
up<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> shinobi
