00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.390 
traversal the idea is you're trying to
get<00:02:58.290> around<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> city<00:02:58.740> as<00:02:58.980> fast<00:02:59.190> as<00:02:59.370> possible

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
get around the city as fast as possible

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.460 
get around the city as fast as possible
but<00:03:00.300> you're<00:03:00.420> trying<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.840> stay<00:03:00.990> off<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.200> ground

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
but you're trying to stay off the ground

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.600 
but you're trying to stay off the ground
so<00:03:01.770> there's<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.010> fair<00:03:02.190> amount<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.400> kind<00:03:02.550> of

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
so there's a fair amount of kind of

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.310 
so there's a fair amount of kind of
freerunning<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.600> combined<00:03:04.050> with<00:03:04.140> this

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
freerunning but it's combined with this

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.660 
freerunning but it's combined with this
rail<00:03:04.560> system<00:03:05.010> that's<00:03:05.160> running<00:03:05.340> all<00:03:05.490> over<00:03:05.520> the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
rail system that's running all over the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.280 
rail system that's running all over the
city<00:03:05.940> which<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.240> can<00:03:06.390> grind<00:03:06.750> on<00:03:06.960> with<00:03:07.170> your

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
city which you can grind on with your

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.230 
city which you can grind on with your
shoes<00:03:07.530> or<00:03:08.010> hang<00:03:08.250> off<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.460> with<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.000> crowbar

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
shoes or hang off of with the crowbar

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.270 
shoes or hang off of with the crowbar
and<00:03:09.660> you're<00:03:10.530> kind<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.710> going<00:03:10.800> around<00:03:10.980> on<00:03:11.160> that

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
and you're kind of going around on that

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.310 
and you're kind of going around on that
and<00:03:11.490> you<00:03:12.240> get<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.480> move<00:03:12.570> pretty<00:03:12.780> fast<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.230> you

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
and you get to move pretty fast and you

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.510 
and you get to move pretty fast and you
can<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.560> can<00:03:13.710> be<00:03:13.830> shooting<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.100> guys<00:03:14.280> from

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
can you can be shooting the guys from

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.550 
can you can be shooting the guys from
the<00:03:14.580> inside<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.300> rails<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.750> uh<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:16.290> it's

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
the inside of the rails and uh it's it's

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.110 
the inside of the rails and uh it's it's
very<00:03:16.800> much<00:03:16.890> like<00:03:16.950> BioShock<00:03:17.489> Infinite<00:03:17.640> in<00:03:18.000> that

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
very much like BioShock Infinite in that

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.910 
very much like BioShock Infinite in that
sense<00:03:18.390> but<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:19.020> makes<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.410> whole<00:03:19.560> lot<00:03:19.590> more

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
sense but it makes a whole lot more

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.380 
sense but it makes a whole lot more
sense<00:03:20.220> than<00:03:20.370> bioshock<00:03:20.820> infinite<00:03:21.120> which

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
sense than bioshock infinite which

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.670 
sense than bioshock infinite which
always<00:03:21.750> kind<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:21.989> felt<00:03:22.170> like<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.410> should<00:03:22.590> have

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
always kind of felt like it should have

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.140 
always kind of felt like it should have
been<00:03:22.770> an<00:03:22.890> open-world<00:03:23.250> game<00:03:23.489> but<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.850> wasn't

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
been an open-world game but it wasn't

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
been an open-world game but it wasn't
you<00:03:24.300> know<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.540> here<00:03:24.690> you're<00:03:24.810> trying<00:03:25.020> to<00:03:25.080> get

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
you know and here you're trying to get

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.990 
you know and here you're trying to get

hopping around and shooting guys in the
face<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.860> start<00:03:32.100> building<00:03:32.280> up<00:03:32.550> your

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
face you start building up your

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.270 
face you start building up your
overcharge<00:03:33.300> meter<00:03:33.600> overdrive<00:03:34.380> meter<00:03:34.680> over

something meter when this meter is full

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.050 
something meter when this meter is full
it<00:03:37.230> then<00:03:37.470> unlocks<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:38.130> various<00:03:38.580> sort<00:03:38.970> of
