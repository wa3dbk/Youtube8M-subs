out<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.590> spot<00:03:15.799> we'll<00:03:16.130> see<00:03:16.280> how<00:03:16.340> long<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.609> takes

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
out the spot we'll see how long it takes

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.479 
out the spot we'll see how long it takes
me<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:16.910> push<00:03:17.239> out<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.510> spot<00:03:17.750> entirely<00:03:18.680> they

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
me to push out the spot entirely they

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.220 
me to push out the spot entirely they
see<00:03:19.549> here<00:03:19.970> there's<00:03:20.239> just<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.510> little<00:03:20.780> crevice

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
see here there's just a little crevice

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.349 
see here there's just a little crevice
and<00:03:21.410> I<00:03:21.530> have<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.769> very<00:03:22.130> strong<00:03:22.519> weapon<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.239> have

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
and I have a very strong weapon I have

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.120 
and I have a very strong weapon I have
probably<00:03:23.600> other<00:03:24.049> than<00:03:24.440> sniper<00:03:24.680> rifles

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
probably other than sniper rifles

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.559 
probably other than sniper rifles
probably<00:03:25.700> no<00:03:25.790> weapon<00:03:26.060> is<00:03:26.150> going<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.329> be<00:03:26.420> the

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
probably no weapon is going to be the

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.990 
probably no weapon is going to be the
m14<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.140> range<00:03:27.380> if<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:28.160> can<00:03:28.340> get<00:03:28.519> on<00:03:28.640> get<00:03:28.970> on

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
m14 of range if you can get on get on

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.610 
m14 of range if you can get on get on
target<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.510> get<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.630> good<00:03:29.810> shot<00:03:29.840> put<00:03:30.260> down<00:03:30.410> on

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
target and get a good shot put down on

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.190 
target and get a good shot put down on
somebody<00:03:31.239> as<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.390> see<00:03:32.540> our<00:03:32.630> edges<00:03:32.900> way<00:03:33.109> it

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
somebody as you see our edges way it

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.750 
somebody as you see our edges way it
works<00:03:33.410> you'll<00:03:33.620> hardly<00:03:33.799> ever<00:03:34.040> get<00:03:34.280> any<00:03:34.459> traffic

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
works you'll hardly ever get any traffic

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.199 
works you'll hardly ever get any traffic
to<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.180> left<00:03:36.340> but<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.459> only<00:03:37.579> the<00:03:37.850> only<00:03:37.880> thing

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
to the left but the only the only thing

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.490 
to the left but the only the only thing
yet<00:03:38.329> to<00:03:38.359> worry<00:03:38.569> about<00:03:38.690> this<00:03:38.930> is<00:03:39.170> your<00:03:39.350> middle

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
yet to worry about this is your middle

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.110 
yet to worry about this is your middle
breaking<00:03:40.040> in<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.250> middle<00:03:40.519> hardly<00:03:40.970> ever

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
breaking in the middle hardly ever

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.030 
breaking in the middle hardly ever
breaks<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.470> don't<00:03:42.620> have<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.829> really<00:03:42.950> worry

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
breaks so you don't have to really worry

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.620 
breaks so you don't have to really worry
about<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.609> so<00:03:43.730> what<00:03:43.910> I<00:03:43.940> would<00:03:44.060> do<00:03:44.269> is<00:03:44.389> you<00:03:44.569> have

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
about it so what I would do is you have

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.449 
about it so what I would do is you have
a<00:03:44.780> motion<00:03:45.019> sensor<00:03:45.319> out<00:03:45.560> those<00:03:45.769> emotions<00:03:46.160> are

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
a motion sensor out those emotions are

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.009 
a motion sensor out those emotions are
on<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:46.700> middle<00:03:46.970> or<00:03:47.420> just<00:03:47.540> like<00:03:47.630> so<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:47.810> threw

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
on the middle or just like so you threw

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.240 
on the middle or just like so you threw
it<00:03:48.109> up<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.410> wind<00:03:48.650> over<00:03:48.920> some<00:03:49.100> fucking

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
it up and that wind over some fucking

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.520 
it up and that wind over some fucking
reason<00:03:49.549> and<00:03:49.880> that<00:03:49.910> just<00:03:50.660> guards<00:03:51.049> me<00:03:51.200> from

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
reason and that just guards me from

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.170 
reason and that just guards me from
seeing<00:03:51.769> people<00:03:52.100> come<00:03:52.220> up<00:03:52.280> as<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.670> guy<00:03:52.790> earlier

seeing people come up as the guy earlier

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.030 
seeing people come up as the guy earlier
did<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.660> came<00:03:53.930> up<00:03:53.959> and<00:03:54.380> around<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:54.950> all

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
did that came up and around and all

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
did that came up and around and all
these<00:03:55.130> peoples<00:03:55.400> get<00:03:55.549> greeted<00:03:55.730> with<00:03:55.910> some

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
these peoples get greeted with some

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.110 
these peoples get greeted with some
Kimbo<00:03:56.660> FM<00:03:57.019> GS<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.920> I<00:03:58.310> finally<00:03:58.579> lose<00:03:58.880> a<00:03:58.910> gun

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
that would been enough to get any number

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.110 
that would been enough to get any number
of<00:04:03.859> kill<00:04:04.100> streaks<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:04.609> wanted<00:04:04.910> it<00:04:05.030> if

get flashed so right here I know so she

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.619 
get flashed so right here I know so she

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.029 
could still gonna be spawned on that
side<00:04:31.840> because<00:04:31.870> that's<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.740> side<00:04:32.919> of<00:04:32.949> the

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
whole idea of why I'm doing this and you

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.850 
whole idea of why I'm doing this and you
see<00:06:25.509> me<00:06:25.660> zooming<00:06:25.960> in<00:06:26.110> and<00:06:26.229> out<00:06:26.349> the<00:06:26.530> reason<00:06:26.800> i

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
see me zooming in and out the reason i

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.409 
see me zooming in and out the reason i
zoom<00:06:27.039> in<00:06:27.220> and<00:06:27.340> out<00:06:27.400> was<00:06:27.580> because<00:06:27.669> it<00:06:27.940> cancels

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
zoom in and out was because it cancels

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.680 
zoom in and out was because it cancels
sway<00:06:29.250> when<00:06:30.250> it<00:06:30.370> what<00:06:30.759> it<00:06:30.879> does<00:06:31.030> is<00:06:31.240> if<00:06:31.360> you<00:06:31.479> hold

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
sway when it what it does is if you hold

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.770

the hold the gun too long it starts to

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.939 
the hold the gun too long it starts to
progressively<00:06:34.780> sway<00:06:35.110> worse<00:06:35.379> and<00:06:35.620> worse<00:06:35.710> and

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
progressively sway worse and worse and

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.159 
progressively sway worse and worse and
worse<00:06:36.069> and<00:06:36.430> what<00:06:36.699> you<00:06:36.819> do<00:06:36.970> if<00:06:37.120> you<00:06:37.210> just<00:06:37.389> zoom

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
worse and what you do if you just zoom

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:39.510 
worse and what you do if you just zoom
it<00:06:38.319> in<00:06:38.409> and<00:06:38.620> out<00:06:38.710> every<00:06:38.889> now<00:06:39.099> and<00:06:39.250> then<00:06:39.340> it

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
it in and out every now and then it

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.550 
it in and out every now and then it
cancelled<00:06:40.030> the<00:06:40.090> sway<00:06:40.330> and<00:06:40.629> keeps<00:06:40.960> it<00:06:41.110> 100

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
cancelled the sway and keeps it 100
