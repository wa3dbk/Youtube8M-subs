00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.120 

I'm<00:00:03.899> taking<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.140> look<00:00:04.230> at<00:00:04.380> these<00:00:04.500> little<00:00:04.650> Canova

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
I'm taking a look at these little Canova

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.920 
I'm taking a look at these little Canova
stability<00:00:05.520> arms<00:00:05.790> they<00:00:06.000> are<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.420> low-cost

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
stability arms they are a low-cost

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.200 
stability arms they are a low-cost
option<00:00:07.230> for<00:00:07.710> adding<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.040> lot<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.460> strength<00:00:09.000> to

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
option for adding a lot of strength to

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.419 
option for adding a lot of strength to
your<00:00:09.719> slider<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.410> should<00:00:10.650> work<00:00:10.769> with<00:00:11.040> most

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
your slider this should work with most

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.860 
your slider this should work with most
sliders<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.150> know<00:00:12.210> basically<00:00:12.480> any<00:00:12.660> slider

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
sliders you know basically any slider

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.509 
sliders you know basically any slider
that<00:00:13.019> has<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> connection<00:00:13.620> here<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.950> any

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
that has a connection here and any

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.500 
that has a connection here and any
tripod<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.269> has<00:00:15.540> legs<00:00:16.130> so<00:00:17.150> basically<00:00:18.150> they

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
tripod that has legs so basically they

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.960 
tripod that has legs so basically they
connect<00:00:18.779> up<00:00:18.930> really<00:00:19.199> nice<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.529> easy<00:00:19.680> just

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
connect up really nice and easy just

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.310 
connect up really nice and easy just
like<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.480> then<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.810> don't<00:00:21.869> want<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.109> clamp

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
like that then you don't want to clamp

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.050 
like that then you don't want to clamp
this<00:00:22.500> too<00:00:22.740> hard<00:00:22.859> because<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.550> don't<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:23.939> know

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
this too hard because you don't you know

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.390 
this too hard because you don't you know
if<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.990> sort<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.830> fairly<00:00:26.039> thin

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
if you have a sort of a fairly thin

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.740 
if you have a sort of a fairly thin
tripod<00:00:26.820> leg<00:00:26.970> or<00:00:27.060> something<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:27.630> want

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
tripod leg or something you don't want

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.349 
tripod leg or something you don't want
to<00:00:27.810> crush<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.859> yeah<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.240> that

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to crush it but yeah just just so that

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.819 
to crush it but yeah just just so that
holds<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.929> then<00:00:32.630> this<00:00:33.630> piece<00:00:33.930> goes<00:00:34.500> over<00:00:34.950> him

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
holds and then this piece goes over him

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.190 
holds and then this piece goes over him
and<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.700> locks<00:00:38.940> there<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.600> then<00:00:40.079> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
and then that locks there and then that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.229 
and then that locks there and then that
gives<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.500> lot<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.190> strength<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.149> you

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
gives you a lot of strength so if you

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.970 
gives you a lot of strength so if you
have<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> stability<00:00:42.660> arm<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> slight<00:00:43.800> angle

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
have the stability arm at a slight angle

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.290 
have the stability arm at a slight angle
like<00:00:44.520> I've<00:00:44.670> got<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.850> right<00:00:45.000> here

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
like I've got it right here

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.700 
like I've got it right here
then<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> help<00:00:45.960> prevent<00:00:46.289> any

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
then it's going to help prevent any

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.130 
then it's going to help prevent any
twisting<00:00:47.640> motion<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.090> well<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.510> if<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> have

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
twisting motion as well and if you have

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.900 
twisting motion as well and if you have
it<00:00:49.260> more<00:00:49.410> straight<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.789> it's

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
it more straight like this then it's

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.400 
it more straight like this then it's
going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> prevent<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.780> know<00:00:51.870> sort<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.140> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
going to prevent you know sort of that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.350 
going to prevent you know sort of that
sort<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.680> motion<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.550> does<00:00:53.760> an<00:00:54.000> absolutely

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
sort of motion and it does an absolutely

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.260 
sort of motion and it does an absolutely
fantastic<00:00:55.050> job<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> good

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
fantastic job of that and for a good

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.599 
fantastic job of that and for a good
price<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.469> low<00:00:58.920> weight<00:00:59.280> because

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
price and for a low weight because

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
price and for a low weight because
before<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.629> I've<00:01:00.809> shown<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> previous<00:01:01.140> video

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
before as I've shown in a previous video

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.179 
before as I've shown in a previous video
I<00:01:01.800> was<00:01:02.039> using<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.899> Manfrotto<00:01:03.899> arm<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.100> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
I was using the Manfrotto arm so it's a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.450 
I was using the Manfrotto arm so it's a
big<00:01:05.549> expensive<00:01:06.270> heavy<00:01:06.960> thing<00:01:07.350> which<00:01:08.010> worked

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
big expensive heavy thing which worked

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.640 
big expensive heavy thing which worked
it<00:01:08.850> wasn't<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.420> quick<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> connect<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it wasn't as quick to connect it was a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.320 
it wasn't as quick to connect it was a
little<00:01:10.920> bit<00:01:11.010> more<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> hassle<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.700> carry<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
little bit more of a hassle to carry and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.420 
little bit more of a hassle to carry and
set<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.320> thing<00:01:13.530> much<00:01:14.070> quicker<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
set up so this thing much quicker and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.830 
set up so this thing much quicker and
easier<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.790> set<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.180> works<00:01:15.600> much<00:01:15.810> better

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
easier to set up and works much better

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.109 
easier to set up and works much better
much<00:01:16.170> lighter<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.890> cheaper<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.850> well<00:01:17.880> if

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
much lighter and cheaper as well if

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.310 
much lighter and cheaper as well if
you're<00:01:18.240> gonna<00:01:18.390> buy<00:01:18.689> these<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.080> you're<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
you're gonna buy these and you're on a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.620 
you're gonna buy these and you're on a
low<00:01:19.470> budget<00:01:19.610> one<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.759> these<00:01:20.909> will<00:01:21.150> make<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.330> big

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
low budget one of these will make a big

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.510 
low budget one of these will make a big
difference<00:01:21.659> two<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.650> them<00:01:22.860> will<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.189> even

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
difference two of them will be even

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.810 
difference two of them will be even
better

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
better

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.300 
better
but<00:01:24.030> one<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.750> enough<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.650> doesn't<00:01:26.280> just

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
but one is enough this doesn't just

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.640 
but one is enough this doesn't just
prevent<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.119> thing<00:01:27.180> from<00:01:27.360> squashing<00:01:28.049> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
prevent this thing from squashing it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.980 
prevent this thing from squashing it
also<00:01:28.799> prevents<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:29.610> extending<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.840> yeah

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
also prevents it from extending so yeah

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.260 
also prevents it from extending so yeah
you<00:01:31.049> can't<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.530> two<00:01:31.799> which<00:01:32.610> will<00:01:32.759> help<00:01:32.939> but

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you can't have two which will help but

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.899 
you can't have two which will help but
one<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.900> enough<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.829> give<00:01:34.979> strength<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.549> both

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
one is enough to give strength in both

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.730 
one is enough to give strength in both
directions<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:37.079> preventing<00:01:37.619> this

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
directions because it's preventing this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.350 
directions because it's preventing this
thing<00:01:37.920> from<00:01:38.100> pushing<00:01:38.400> upwards<00:01:38.729> let's<00:01:39.240> use

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
thing from pushing upwards let's use

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.440 
thing from pushing upwards let's use
both<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.689> these<00:01:39.780> now<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:41.150> really<00:01:42.150> put<00:01:42.299> some

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
both of these now and really put some
