decide<00:02:19.970> what<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.450> think<00:02:20.810> of<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.819> in<00:02:22.819> some<00:02:23.180> ways<00:02:23.390> I

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
decide what I think of it in some ways I

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.980 
decide what I think of it in some ways I
mean<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.930> just<00:02:24.050> depends<00:02:24.620> how<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.830> look<00:02:24.980> at<00:02:25.370> it

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
mean it just depends how you look at it

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.870 
mean it just depends how you look at it
it<00:02:26.170> just<00:02:26.440> looks<00:02:26.650> sort<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.160> different<00:02:27.610> every

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
it just looks sort of different every

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.920 
it just looks sort of different every
time<00:02:28.530> I'm<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.590> not<00:02:29.830> sure<00:02:29.890> but<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:31.540> guys<00:02:31.660> tell

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
time I'm just not sure but you guys tell

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.650 
time I'm just not sure but you guys tell
me<00:02:31.960> what<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.230> think<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.950> yeah<00:02:33.490> but<00:02:34.270> on<00:02:34.510> these

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
me what you think so yeah but on these

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.130 
me what you think so yeah but on these
shoulders<00:02:34.960> there<00:02:35.920> are<00:02:36.100> two<00:02:36.630> guns<00:02:37.630> here<00:02:37.930> now<00:02:38.110> I

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
shoulders there are two guns here now I

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.020 
shoulders there are two guns here now I
think<00:02:38.500> these<00:02:38.770> are<00:02:38.830> actually<00:02:39.280> not<00:02:39.460> official

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
think these are actually not official

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.990 
think these are actually not official
lego<00:02:40.300> pieces<00:02:40.480> don't<00:02:41.080> blame<00:02:41.260> me<00:02:41.320> there<00:02:41.590> um<00:02:42.130> but

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
lego pieces don't blame me there um but

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.990 
lego pieces don't blame me there um but
those<00:02:43.540> are<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:44.220> believe<00:02:45.220> they're<00:02:45.580> from<00:02:45.790> the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
those are I believe they're from the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.310 
those are I believe they're from the
Kobe<00:02:46.810> brick<00:02:47.680> brand<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.550> Kobe<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.540> hate<00:02:49.870> they're

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
Kobe brick brand and Kobe I hate they're

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.470 
Kobe brick brand and Kobe I hate they're
so<00:02:50.530> stupid<00:02:50.800> they<00:02:51.280> do<00:02:51.340> not<00:02:51.640> lock<00:02:51.850> together<00:02:52.030> and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
so stupid they do not lock together and

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.800 
so stupid they do not lock together and
they<00:02:52.690> stink<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:53.610> these<00:02:54.610> bricks<00:02:55.030> are<00:02:55.300> kind<00:02:55.780> of

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
they stink but these bricks are kind of

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.380 
they stink but these bricks are kind of
cool<00:02:55.960> so<00:02:56.590> those<00:02:57.490> are<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.670> only<00:02:57.850> things<00:02:58.210> I

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
cool so those are the only things I

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.810 
cool so those are the only things I
liked<00:02:58.660> in<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.080> theme<00:02:59.320> not<00:03:00.160> theme<00:03:00.400> but<00:03:00.610> in

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
liked in that theme not theme but in

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.530 
liked in that theme not theme but in
that<00:03:00.970> company<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:03.310> here<00:03:04.240> you<00:03:04.570> have<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:06.540> core

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
that company so here you have the core

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.540 
that company so here you have the core
there<00:03:08.170> i'm<00:03:08.500> not<00:03:08.650> sure<00:03:08.770> what<00:03:08.890> they<00:03:09.040> call<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.430> in

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
going to pop up a picture of the actual

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.420 
going to pop up a picture of the actual
robot<00:03:13.540> itself<00:03:14.110> from<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.470> movie<00:03:14.830> poster<00:03:15.250> right

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
robot itself from the movie poster right

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.970 
robot itself from the movie poster right
here<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:18.040> should<00:03:18.340> pop<00:03:18.460> up<00:03:18.520> there<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.920> say<00:03:20.920> you

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
here it should pop up there and say you

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.640 
here it should pop up there and say you
can<00:03:21.220> see<00:03:21.520> sort<00:03:22.270> of<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.480> similarities<00:03:22.900> in<00:03:23.440> the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
can see sort of the similarities in the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.240 
can see sort of the similarities in the
and<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:25.710> torso<00:03:26.710> and<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:28.440> little<00:03:29.440> core<00:03:29.860> there

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
and the torso and the little core there

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.750 
and the torso and the little core there
and<00:03:31.140> then<00:03:33.060> here<00:03:34.060> i<00:03:34.830> sort<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:35.980> at<00:03:36.280> first<00:03:36.520> it<00:03:36.670> was

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
and then here i sort of at first it was

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.790 
and then here i sort of at first it was
a<00:03:36.790> very<00:03:37.000> one-dimensional<00:03:37.390> mock<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.560> was

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
a very one-dimensional mock it was

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
a very one-dimensional mock it was
really<00:03:39.160> only<00:03:40.710> one<00:03:41.710> brick<00:03:41.980> across<00:03:42.250> but<00:03:42.610> i<00:03:42.640> had

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
really only one brick across but i had

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.270 
really only one brick across but i had
to<00:03:42.850> fatten<00:03:43.360> up<00:03:43.510> his<00:03:43.660> body<00:03:43.930> now<00:03:44.320> it's<00:03:44.530> two<00:03:45.100> or

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
to fatten up his body now it's two or

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.850 
to fatten up his body now it's two or
three<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:45.840> as<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:46.960> can<00:03:47.110> see<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.380> kind<00:03:47.500> of<00:03:47.620> goes

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
three and as you can see it kind of goes

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.440 
three and as you can see it kind of goes
inward<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:50.080> it<00:03:50.920> sort<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:52.120> sort<00:03:52.330> of<00:03:52.390> just

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
inward and it sort of it sort of just

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.520 
inward and it sort of it sort of just
scales<00:03:52.960> down<00:03:53.500> on<00:03:54.040> each<00:03:54.640> dimension<00:03:55.530> right

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
scales down on each dimension right

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:05.300 
scales down on each dimension right
there<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:01.120> that's<00:04:02.080> kind<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.320> cool<00:04:02.470> looking<00:04:02.770> and

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.650 

sorry<00:04:06.310> my<00:04:06.490> light<00:04:06.730> just<00:04:06.760> fell<00:04:07.150> over<00:04:07.180> but<00:04:07.630> that

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
sorry my light just fell over but that

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.480 
sorry my light just fell over but that
doesn't<00:04:07.990> matter<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:11.260> here<00:04:11.800> are<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.010> legs

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
doesn't matter and so here are the legs

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.460 
doesn't matter and so here are the legs
and<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:14.970> sort<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.150> kind<00:04:16.750> of<00:04:16.900> sort<00:04:17.109> of<00:04:17.260> copied

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
and I sort of kind of sort of copied

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.670 
and I sort of kind of sort of copied
them<00:04:17.890> off<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.820> Lex<00:04:19.180> Luthor<00:04:19.600> robot<00:04:20.049> legs<00:04:20.320> I

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
them off of the Lex Luthor robot legs I

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.240 
them off of the Lex Luthor robot legs I
use<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.250> basic<00:04:21.460> design<00:04:21.790> here<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:23.800> connects

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
use the basic design here that connects

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.220 
use the basic design here that connects
it<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.580> body<00:04:24.850> but<00:04:25.210> other<00:04:25.360> than<00:04:25.570> that<00:04:25.630> it's

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
it to the body but other than that it's

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.020 
it to the body but other than that it's
pretty<00:04:26.500> much<00:04:26.740> my<00:04:27.100> own<00:04:27.220> design<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:29.640> my<00:04:30.640> big

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
pretty much my own design and my big

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.880 
pretty much my own design and my big
deal<00:04:31.390> with<00:04:31.630> this<00:04:31.810> robot<00:04:32.170> is<00:04:32.230> that<00:04:32.500> it<00:04:32.590> looks<00:04:32.770> a

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
deal with this robot is that it looks a

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.340 
deal with this robot is that it looks a
little<00:04:33.040> too<00:04:33.280> bulky<00:04:33.580> in<00:04:33.970> my<00:04:34.479> lego<00:04:34.720> version<00:04:34.960> but

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
little too bulky in my lego version but

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.040 
little too bulky in my lego version but
I<00:04:36.090> really<00:04:37.090> couldn't<00:04:37.210> find<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.630> way<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.810> make<00:04:37.930> it

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
I really couldn't find a way to make it

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.390 
I really couldn't find a way to make it
less<00:04:38.290> bulky<00:04:38.770> with<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.010> pieces

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
less bulky with the pieces

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.120 
less bulky with the pieces
that<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:39.580> had<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.870> feet<00:04:41.169> can<00:04:43.500> Moo<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.530> little<00:04:44.979> bit

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
that I had the feet can Moo a little bit

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.340 
that I had the feet can Moo a little bit
and<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.790> studs<00:04:46.090> are<00:04:46.270> not<00:04:46.600> on<00:04:46.720> top<00:04:46.960> there<00:04:47.259> on

and the studs are not on top there on
the<00:04:47.440> bottom<00:04:47.910> so<00:04:48.910> it's<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.120> flip<00:04:49.330> two-piece<00:04:51.210> got

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
the bottom so it's a flip two-piece got

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.040 
the bottom so it's a flip two-piece got
some<00:04:52.509> slope<00:04:53.350> detail<00:04:53.979> there<00:04:54.250> and<00:04:54.520> then<00:04:55.210> the

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
some slope detail there and then the

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:03.450 
some slope detail there and then the
arms<00:04:56.440> here<00:04:56.919> can<00:04:58.560> move<00:04:59.560> around<00:05:02.070> i'll<00:05:03.070> try<00:05:03.400> to

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
arms here can move around i'll try to

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.180 
arms here can move around i'll try to
show<00:05:03.789> you<00:05:04.750> that<00:05:04.960> without<00:05:05.169> getting<00:05:05.350> a<00:05:05.770> light<00:05:06.009> in

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
the way there we go so they can move up

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.100 
the way there we go so they can move up
and<00:05:10.150> down<00:05:10.240> and<00:05:10.389> they're<00:05:10.870> connected<00:05:11.320> by<00:05:11.500> simple

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
and down and they're connected by simple

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
shoulders here and then these are

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.159 
shoulders here and then these are
supposed<00:05:31.090> to<00:05:31.240> be<00:05:31.330> hands<00:05:31.660> they<00:05:31.900> don't<00:05:32.080> look

good<00:05:34.270> when<00:05:34.510> they're<00:05:34.690> just<00:05:35.020> hanging<00:05:35.380> out<00:05:35.590> of

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
good when they're just hanging out of

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.600 
good when they're just hanging out of
the<00:05:35.740> sides<00:05:36.449> up<00:05:37.449> here<00:05:38.139> near<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:39.130> head<00:05:39.310> are

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
the sides up here near the head are

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.040 
the sides up here near the head are
sloped<00:05:40.380> shoulders<00:05:41.380> they're<00:05:43.680> like<00:05:44.680> that<00:05:44.889> and

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
sloped shoulders they're like that and

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.159 
sloped shoulders they're like that and
then<00:05:47.050> on<00:05:47.320> the<00:05:47.500> back<00:05:48.120> you<00:05:49.120> have<00:05:49.150> some<00:05:49.660> textured

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
then on the back you have some textured

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.580 
then on the back you have some textured
bricks<00:05:50.440> there<00:05:50.680> as<00:05:50.919> well<00:05:51.130> as<00:05:51.280> a<00:05:51.720> huge<00:05:52.720> jet<00:05:53.349> pack

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
bricks there as well as a huge jet pack

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.350 
bricks there as well as a huge jet pack
on<00:05:54.520> his<00:05:55.000> back<00:05:55.060> that<00:05:55.860> i<00:05:56.860> added<00:05:57.099> right<00:05:58.000> before<00:05:58.330> I

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
on his back that i added right before I

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.210 
on his back that i added right before I
thought<00:05:58.570> it<00:05:58.690> was<00:05:58.750> done<00:05:58.990> I<00:05:59.229> need<00:05:59.770> to<00:05:59.889> fill<00:06:00.099> in

thought it was done I need to fill in

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.649 
thought it was done I need to fill in
that<00:06:00.370> hole<00:06:00.430> though<00:06:00.849> that<00:06:01.090> does<00:06:01.270> not<00:06:01.389> look<00:06:01.599> very

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
that hole though that does not look very

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.000 
that hole though that does not look very
good<00:06:01.900> that's<00:06:02.680> just<00:06:02.860> strange<00:06:04.169> but<00:06:05.169> so<00:06:05.470> I<00:06:05.740> tried

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
good that's just strange but so I tried

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.469 
good that's just strange but so I tried
putting<00:06:06.190> fire<00:06:06.550> into<00:06:06.849> this<00:06:07.000> but<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.330> just

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
putting fire into this but it just

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.029 
putting fire into this but it just
didn't<00:06:07.750> work<00:06:07.900> I<00:06:08.199> couldn't<00:06:08.500> get<00:06:08.620> it<00:06:08.710> stick<00:06:09.010> in

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
didn't work I couldn't get it stick in

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:10.920 
didn't work I couldn't get it stick in
there<00:06:09.370> and<00:06:09.580> it<00:06:09.669> kept<00:06:09.909> falling<00:06:10.210> out<00:06:10.330> even<00:06:10.780> when

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
there and it kept falling out even when

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.149 
there and it kept falling out even when
i<00:06:10.990> put<00:06:11.199> a<00:06:11.229> connector<00:06:11.650> inside<00:06:12.960> but<00:06:13.960> so<00:06:14.830> it<00:06:14.979> still

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
i put a connector inside but so it still

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:16.710 
i put a connector inside but so it still
looks<00:06:15.340> kinda<00:06:15.610> nice<00:06:15.760> as<00:06:16.000> a<00:06:16.120> jet<00:06:16.330> pack<00:06:16.479> though

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
looks kinda nice as a jet pack though

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.159 
looks kinda nice as a jet pack though
and<00:06:16.990> then<00:06:17.590> these<00:06:17.860> bricks<00:06:18.310> here<00:06:18.669> i<00:06:18.729> had<00:06:19.150> to<00:06:19.449> put

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
and then these bricks here i had to put

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.080 
and then these bricks here i had to put
them<00:06:20.380> back<00:06:20.500> so<00:06:20.740> that<00:06:20.770> it<00:06:20.979> could<00:06:21.220> steady<00:06:21.610> him<00:06:21.880> so

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
them back so that it could steady him so

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.760 
them back so that it could steady him so
he<00:06:22.180> could<00:06:22.300> stand<00:06:22.630> up<00:06:22.810> on<00:06:22.960> his<00:06:23.080> own<00:06:23.260> and<00:06:23.590> not

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
he could stand up on his own and not

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.659 
he could stand up on his own and not
fall<00:06:24.190> forward<00:06:25.740> because<00:06:26.740> i<00:06:26.770> will<00:06:27.310> probably

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
fall forward because i will probably

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.100 
fall forward because i will probably
just<00:06:27.849> be<00:06:27.940> using<00:06:28.270> him<00:06:28.419> for<00:06:28.449> display<00:06:30.930> but<00:06:31.930> so

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
just be using him for display but so

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.020 
just be using him for display but so
yeah<00:06:32.320> that<00:06:32.650> is<00:06:32.800> the<00:06:32.830> civic<00:06:33.310> rim<00:06:33.460> robot<00:06:33.820> i'm

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
yeah that is the civic rim robot i'm

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.080 
yeah that is the civic rim robot i'm
planning<00:06:34.960> on<00:06:35.050> hopefully<00:06:35.409> making<00:06:35.949> a<00:06:36.220> gigantic
