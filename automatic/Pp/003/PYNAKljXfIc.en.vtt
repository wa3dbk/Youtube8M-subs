just anchoring out in the channel well
really<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.180> depends<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.989> conditions<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.219> this

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
really it depends on conditions and this

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.670 
really it depends on conditions and this

year for example in the spring the
conditions<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.219> perfect<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:39.899> water<00:00:40.079> temps

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410

up<00:00:40.530> around<00:00:40.710> 60<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.280> yeah

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
up around 60 and yeah

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.220 
up around 60 and yeah
well<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> fish<00:00:42.540> will<00:00:42.690> move<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.170> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
well the fish will move in and out of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.200 
well the fish will move in and out of
the<00:00:43.350> shallows<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> time<00:00:44.100> anyways<00:00:44.520> right

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the shallows all the time anyways right

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.029 
the shallows all the time anyways right
now<00:00:45.649> they're<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.190> dam<00:00:47.399> area<00:00:47.789> and

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
now they're up in that dam area and

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.799 
now they're up in that dam area and
water<00:00:50.039> water<00:00:50.340> levels<00:00:50.760> are<00:00:50.879> just<00:00:51.030> perfect<00:00:51.480> what

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
water water levels are just perfect what

we<00:00:51.899> can't<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.170> nice<00:00:52.379> fishing<00:00:52.739> anywhere<00:00:53.250> from

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
we can't see nice fishing anywhere from

we can't see nice fishing anywhere from
about<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.120> three<00:00:54.300> feet<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.629> water<00:00:54.770> you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
about one to three feet of water you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.959 
about one to three feet of water you
know<00:00:55.860> most<00:00:56.039> people<00:00:56.129> don't<00:00:56.370> even<00:00:56.520> think<00:00:56.850> of

know most people don't even think of

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.520 
know most people don't even think of
fishing<00:00:57.270> cats<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.899> shallow<00:00:59.329> normal<00:01:00.530> no

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
fishing cats in that shallow normal no

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.950 
fishing cats in that shallow normal no
it's<00:01:01.770> true<00:01:01.859> enough<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.340> come<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.000> back

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
well I probably use cut bait 90 over 95%

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.649 
well I probably use cut bait 90 over 95%
of<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> season<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.890> use<00:01:17.040> cut<00:01:17.280> beat<00:01:17.479> can't<00:01:18.479> argue

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
you know this this setup here has got a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.569 
you know this this setup here has got a

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
different than fishing main channels on

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.509 
different than fishing main channels on
that<00:04:18.080> but<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.709> reason<00:04:18.950> we<00:04:19.040> use<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.310> barrel

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
that but the reason we use the barrel

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.840 
that but the reason we use the barrel
swivel<00:04:19.700> here<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.989> acts<00:04:21.260> as<00:04:21.410> a<00:04:21.440> stop<00:04:21.769> we<00:04:22.520> do<00:04:22.669> have

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
swivel here it acts as a stop we do have

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.190 
swivel here it acts as a stop we do have
to<00:04:23.000> have<00:04:23.090> big<00:04:23.300> quirk<00:04:23.540> like<00:04:23.690> this<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:23.960> do<00:04:24.080> have

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
to have big quirk like this you do have

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.110 
to have big quirk like this you do have
to<00:04:24.320> have<00:04:24.440> some<00:04:24.680> light<00:04:24.860> on<00:04:24.979> there<00:04:25.160> with<00:04:25.729> be<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.060> a

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
to have some light on there with be it a

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.030 
to have some light on there with be it a
half<00:04:26.300> ounce<00:04:26.540> or<00:04:26.750> one<00:04:26.930> on<00:04:27.080> sled<00:04:27.410> doesn't<00:04:27.890> matter

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
half ounce or one on sled doesn't matter

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.570 
half ounce or one on sled doesn't matter
so<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.640> you<00:04:29.570> know<00:04:29.660> it<00:04:29.720> serves<00:04:30.100> as<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.130> swivel

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
so that you know it serves as a swivel

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.360 
so that you know it serves as a swivel
it<00:04:31.820> serves<00:04:32.090> to<00:04:32.780> prevent<00:04:33.050> twist<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:33.680> also<00:04:34.040> more

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
it serves to prevent twist and also more

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.460 
it serves to prevent twist and also more
importantly<00:04:34.820> is<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.060> fact<00:04:35.210> that<00:04:35.450> it<00:04:35.630> uses<00:04:36.229> as

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
importantly is the fact that it uses as

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.830 
importantly is the fact that it uses as
a<00:04:36.770> lead<00:04:37.040> stop<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:38.060> then<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.390> then<00:04:38.479> you've<00:04:38.660> got

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
a lead stop and then and then you've got

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.900 
a lead stop and then and then you've got
your<00:04:38.990> float<00:04:39.229> of<00:04:39.380> course<00:04:39.620> we've<00:04:39.830> got<00:04:39.979> a<00:04:40.010> beat<00:04:40.729> up

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
your float of course we've got a beat up

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.200 
your float of course we've got a beat up
and<00:04:41.090> here<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.330> assist<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:42.740> prevent<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.250> cuff

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
and here to assist to prevent the cuff

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.940 
and here to assist to prevent the cuff
from<00:04:44.360> moving<00:04:44.630> out<00:04:44.750> from<00:04:44.930> going<00:04:45.290> up<00:04:45.410> over<00:04:45.620> top
