hey<00:00:04.360> guys<00:00:04.540> how's<00:00:04.750> it<00:00:04.779> going<00:00:04.900> preparing<00:00:05.410> you<00:00:05.670> so

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:06.670 
hey guys how's it going preparing you so

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.060 
hey guys how's it going preparing you so
I<00:00:07.029> figured<00:00:07.720> out<00:00:08.049> that<00:00:08.260> doing<00:00:08.559> risks<00:00:08.920> as

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
I figured out that doing risks as

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.709 
I figured out that doing risks as
opposed<00:00:09.820> to<00:00:09.969> what<00:00:10.120> I've<00:00:10.240> mentioned<00:00:10.570> yesterday

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
opposed to what I've mentioned yesterday

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.459 
opposed to what I've mentioned yesterday
my<00:00:11.110> overall<00:00:11.559> review<00:00:12.010> of<00:00:12.250> Reaper<00:00:13.180> of<00:00:13.209> souls

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
my overall review of Reaper of souls

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.109 
my overall review of Reaper of souls
it's<00:00:14.469> actually<00:00:14.860> kind<00:00:15.070> of<00:00:15.129> worth<00:00:15.279> it<00:00:15.490> and<00:00:15.610> the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
it's actually kind of worth it and the

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.210 
it's actually kind of worth it and the
reason<00:00:16.420> it<00:00:16.510> is<00:00:16.660> is<00:00:16.990> just<00:00:17.680> in<00:00:17.860> the<00:00:17.949> off<00:00:18.160> chance

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
reason it is is just in the off chance

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.390 
reason it is is just in the off chance
that<00:00:19.210> your<00:00:19.359> map<00:00:19.570> is<00:00:19.750> populated<00:00:20.590> by<00:00:20.620> goblins

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
that your map is populated by goblins

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.180 
that your map is populated by goblins
and<00:00:21.640> just<00:00:21.940> in<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:22.330> slight<00:00:22.990> chance<00:00:23.590> that<00:00:23.830> your

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
and just in the slight chance that your

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.450 
and just in the slight chance that your
character<00:00:24.790> is<00:00:25.260> overpowered<00:00:26.260> enough<00:00:26.680> to<00:00:27.100> kill

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
character is overpowered enough to kill

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.990 
character is overpowered enough to kill
them<00:00:28.080> you're<00:00:29.080> gonna<00:00:29.230> have<00:00:29.470> a<00:00:29.500> wrap<00:00:30.490> load<00:00:30.820> of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
them you're gonna have a wrap load of

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.840 
them you're gonna have a wrap load of
loot<00:00:31.240> drop<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:31.930> this<00:00:32.770> happens<00:00:33.219> three<00:00:33.520> or<00:00:33.640> four

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
loot drop and this happens three or four

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.330 
loot drop and this happens three or four
times<00:00:34.059> yesterday<00:00:34.510> and<00:00:35.050> I'll<00:00:35.890> show<00:00:36.100> you<00:00:36.130> guys

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
times yesterday and I'll show you guys

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.130 
times yesterday and I'll show you guys
the<00:00:36.400> first<00:00:36.790> time<00:00:36.970> it<00:00:37.120> happened<00:00:37.450> here<00:00:37.780> in<00:00:37.840> a<00:00:37.930> bit

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
the first time it happened here in a bit

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.639 
the first time it happened here in a bit
but<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:39.010> idea<00:00:39.489> is<00:00:39.550> that<00:00:40.120> while<00:00:40.750> rifts<00:00:41.500> in

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
but the idea is that while rifts in

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.440 
but the idea is that while rifts in
general<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.720> really<00:00:43.720> kind<00:00:44.410> of<00:00:44.470> crap<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:46.270> get

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
general a really kind of crap you get

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.350 
general a really kind of crap you get
what<00:00:47.380> I've<00:00:47.470> noticed<00:00:47.760> pretty<00:00:48.760> crappy<00:00:49.059> mob

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
what I've noticed pretty crappy mob

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.840 
what I've noticed pretty crappy mob
density<00:00:49.899> and<00:00:50.079> then<00:00:50.530> you<00:00:51.010> go<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.460> second

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
density and then you go to the second

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.340 
density and then you go to the second
level<00:00:51.940> against<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.420> little<00:00:52.570> better<00:00:52.780> than<00:00:53.140> third

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
level against a little better than third

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.229 
level against a little better than third
level<00:00:53.620> guys<00:00:53.770> a<00:00:53.800> little<00:00:53.980> better<00:00:54.250> usually<00:00:55.120> the

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
level guys a little better usually the

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.350 
level guys a little better usually the
last<00:00:55.450> level<00:00:55.930> has<00:00:56.350> quite<00:00:56.950> quite<00:00:57.910> good<00:00:58.090> mob

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
last level has quite quite good mob

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.510 
last level has quite quite good mob
density<00:00:58.930> but<00:00:59.410> sometimes<00:00:59.860> the<00:00:59.950> last<00:01:00.100> level<00:01:00.399> is

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
density but sometimes the last level is

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.060 
density but sometimes the last level is
level<00:01:00.670> three<00:01:01.180> I've<00:01:01.540> gotten<00:01:01.899> level<00:01:02.200> eight<00:01:02.440> once

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
level three I've gotten level eight once

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.450 
level three I've gotten level eight once
level<00:01:03.760> six<00:01:04.059> like<00:01:04.449> five<00:01:05.170> times<00:01:05.500> but<00:01:05.829> most<00:01:06.369> of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
level six like five times but most of

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.580 
level six like five times but most of
the<00:01:06.549> time<00:01:06.729> it<00:01:06.909> ends<00:01:07.299> around<00:01:07.420> three<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.350> five

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
the time it ends around three to five

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.349 
the time it ends around three to five
and<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:10.240> only<00:01:10.509> reason<00:01:11.170> why<00:01:11.679> it's<00:01:11.969> worth<00:01:12.969> it<00:01:13.179> at

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:13.359 
and the only reason why it's worth it at

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:16.499 
and the only reason why it's worth it at
all<00:01:13.420> is<00:01:13.990> just<00:01:14.740> because<00:01:15.520> when<00:01:15.969> you<00:01:16.090> do<00:01:16.329> get

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
all is just because when you do get

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.669 
all is just because when you do get
goblins<00:01:17.079> your<00:01:17.590> inventory<00:01:18.310> fills<00:01:18.880> up

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
goblins your inventory fills up

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:20.819 
goblins your inventory fills up
instantly

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
instantly

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.669 
instantly
so<00:01:21.579> it's<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.329> pretty<00:01:22.539> cool<00:01:22.749> thing<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:23.529> also

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
so it's a pretty cool thing it also

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.679 
so it's a pretty cool thing it also
makes<00:01:24.069> it<00:01:24.279> so<00:01:24.459> it's<00:01:24.609> kind<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:24.969> challenging<00:01:25.240> to

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
makes it so it's kind of challenging to

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.379 
makes it so it's kind of challenging to
try<00:01:25.899> to<00:01:25.959> you<00:01:26.709> know<00:01:26.770> write<00:01:27.490> rush<00:01:27.880> through<00:01:28.179> all

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:28.389 
try to you know write rush through all

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:30.419 
try to you know write rush through all
levels<00:01:28.659> just<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.590> chance<00:01:29.889> that<00:01:30.039> you<00:01:30.159> run<00:01:30.340> up

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
levels just the chance that you run up

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.730 
levels just the chance that you run up
to<00:01:30.549> one<00:01:30.700> of<00:01:30.789> the<00:01:30.880> goblins<00:01:31.420> min/max<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:32.679> the

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
to one of the goblins min/max and the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.999 
to one of the goblins min/max and the
time<00:01:32.979> may<00:01:33.189> max<00:01:33.459> in<00:01:33.639> the<00:01:33.729> goblins<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.770> pretty

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
time may max in the goblins it's pretty

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.510 
time may max in the goblins it's pretty
cool<00:01:36.249> so<00:01:37.119> epic<00:01:37.630> as<00:01:37.749> enjoy<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.079> yesterday<00:01:38.520> hope
