you can't really change the weather but

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.179 
you can't really change the weather but

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
you could offer to fix her hair and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:02:00.830 
you could offer to fix her hair and
probably<00:01:51.000> get<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> date

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.930 

streaming<00:02:01.840> music<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:02.500> videos<00:02:02.830> is<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.490> great

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
streaming music and videos is a great

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.600 
streaming music and videos is a great
standard<00:02:04.390> feature<00:02:04.660> but<00:02:05.440> in<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.650> future<00:02:05.950> you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
standard feature but in the future you

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.540 
standard feature but in the future you
will<00:02:06.730> be<00:02:06.880> also<00:02:07.060> able<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.840> stream<00:02:08.410> real<00:02:08.979> objects

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
will be also able to stream real objects

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.290 
will be also able to stream real objects
so<00:02:10.119> streaming<00:02:11.190> count<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.430> milk<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.060> first

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
so streaming count and milk is the first

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.320 
so streaming count and milk is the first
prototype<00:02:13.950> simply<00:02:14.950> set<00:02:15.310> up<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.610> FaceTime

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
prototype simply set up a FaceTime

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.900 
prototype simply set up a FaceTime
connection<00:02:17.490> so<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.520> hope<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:19.090> ready<00:02:20.790> that's<00:02:21.790> my
