00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.970
 I want to talk to a manager 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.320
 no one believes you when you say 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.129
 that what happened was a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.129
 natural disaster 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:26.240
 you lie it was not a tremor 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:30.500
 earthen or fake because in reality 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.500
 you tried to hide something 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.059

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.940
 the pacific was not testing it 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.940
 was trying to kill him 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.140
 you have no idea what we 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.140
 waits 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.590
 you can kill 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.259
 the arrogance of the man is to think 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.259
 that they master nature 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.960
