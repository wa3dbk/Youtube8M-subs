 Dr 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.590
 I am here with share of Viva Voce from Ansbach transfer page 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.460
 I am there 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.710
 Michael Basting 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.710
 al-qaida and you have come together as a headscarf 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.790
 ten years ago 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.360
 Percent take him though Knabenchor MÃ¼nsterer met Canon happen 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.940
 Cottbus even almost 20 years 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.780
 and then we have just man called it with the choir slowly closer towards the end 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.600
 Considered could actually continue as a quartet 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.030
 Hamsters fed and fireplace can be on the hunt yet 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.410
 outside is 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 then and then at that time Capella Quintet 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.220
 in the way 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.880
 and that was clear from the beginning that the a cappella quartet was or was at the beginning 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760
 including instruments 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.740
 they started at the beginning I am already clear who learned me from the ground up 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.240
 just have to deal with and thus make a piece of history 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.380
 so that had never been up for debate 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.920
 by Detlef Scherle 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.880
 contacted and which role models musically 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.010
 so 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.610
 I think you already have limits 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.330
 you're just son's role model or are you still here 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.480
 then we have never had time where we have sung a lot at SKS songs 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.440
 they also brought us a little bit on our way who have so 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.320
 the desire aroused with us to write German texts and German 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.270
 a-cappella to make pop music 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.780
 this fine course, Welty Titi grandfather Taser Kapeller this 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.200
 Scully has that, of course 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.390
 and still ask the last question what were your biggest hits of the set 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.540
 as good 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.540
 So I think by the big success, it's worth it 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.690
 Bull 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.169
 actually one can say 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.999
 who can give something of that here 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.969
 just cancel as a hobby and have now become a profession so that it to 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.649
 Final result ago 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.629
 it is pretty quiet 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.629
