okay<00:00:00.480> now<00:00:00.750> we've<00:00:00.989> learned<00:00:01.199> how<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.500> find<00:00:01.770> all

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
okay now we've learned how to find all

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.889 
okay now we've learned how to find all
the<00:00:02.070> notes<00:00:02.220> are<00:00:02.399> guitar<00:00:02.730> using<00:00:03.240> half<00:00:03.600> steps

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
the notes are guitar using half steps

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.240 
the notes are guitar using half steps
and<00:00:03.959> whole<00:00:04.049> steps<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.589> in<00:00:04.920> that<00:00:05.009> previous

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
and whole steps and in that previous

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.880 
and whole steps and in that previous
lesson<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.029> explain<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.140> that<00:00:07.350> just<00:00:07.740> to

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
lesson I explain to you that just to

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.740 
lesson I explain to you that just to
work<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.130> finding<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.000> notes<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.360> sixth

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
work on finding the notes and the sixth

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.540 
work on finding the notes and the sixth
and<00:00:09.840> fifth<00:00:10.019> string<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.530> getting<00:00:11.219> comfortable

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
and fifth string and getting comfortable

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.129 
and fifth string and getting comfortable
with<00:00:11.670> them<00:00:11.849> for<00:00:12.030> now<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.780> doesn't<00:00:12.990> mean

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
with them for now that doesn't mean

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.990 
with them for now that doesn't mean
don't<00:00:13.559> work<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.889> all<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.160> them<00:00:14.250> but<00:00:14.759> what<00:00:14.910> I'm

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
don't work on all of them but what I'm

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000 
don't work on all of them but what I'm
going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.150> show<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.360> now<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.960> pattern<00:00:16.410> using

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
going to show you now is a pattern using

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.010 
going to show you now is a pattern using
what's<00:00:17.190> called<00:00:17.279> octaves<00:00:18.000> or<00:00:18.390> an<00:00:18.720> octave

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
what's called octaves or an octave

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.109 
what's called octaves or an octave
pattern<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.890> help<00:00:20.160> us<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.520> also<00:00:20.699> find

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
pattern to help us to also find

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.820 
pattern to help us to also find
ourselves<00:00:21.330> if<00:00:21.810> we're<00:00:21.960> lost<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.439> don't<00:00:22.650> know

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
ourselves if we're lost and don't know

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.830 
ourselves if we're lost and don't know
what<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.010> notice<00:00:23.340> now<00:00:24.150> octaves<00:00:24.600> serve<00:00:24.810> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
what a notice now octaves serve a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.540 
what a notice now octaves serve a
purpose<00:00:25.140> other<00:00:25.529> than<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.369> let's

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
purpose other than just this but let's

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.529 
purpose other than just this but let's
let's<00:00:26.760> go<00:00:26.880> ahead<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.150> show<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
let's go ahead and show you what that

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.109 
let's go ahead and show you what that
pattern<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.920> octave<00:00:29.340> as<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.910> talked

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
pattern is now in octave as we talked

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.540 
pattern is now in octave as we talked
about<00:00:30.179> before<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:32.279> here's

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
about before it's just like this here's

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.410 
about before it's just like this here's
an<00:00:32.640> e<00:00:33.320> here's<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> knee<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.730> same<00:00:36.030> note

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
an e here's a knee it's the same note

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
an e here's a knee it's the same note
just<00:00:37.140> higher<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.710> pitch<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.910> II<00:00:39.890> that<00:00:40.890> he<00:00:41.040> is

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
just higher in pitch so II that he is

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.830 
just higher in pitch so II that he is
higher<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.730> z<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.719> z<00:00:44.510> you're<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> same

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
higher here z here z you're all the same

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.979 
higher here z here z you're all the same
note<00:00:47.030> but<00:00:48.030> they're<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:48.270> different<00:00:48.539> pitches

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
note but they're all different pitches

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.639 
note but they're all different pitches
okay<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:50.219> higher<00:00:50.460> some<00:00:50.850> lower<00:00:51.289> the<00:00:52.289> octave

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
okay some higher some lower the octave

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.630 
okay some higher some lower the octave
patterns<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> deal<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.520> only

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
patterns are going to deal with are only

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.459 
patterns are going to deal with are only
two<00:00:53.850> patterns<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.390> they're<00:00:54.780> both<00:00:54.930> movable

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
two patterns and they're both movable

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.090 
two patterns and they're both movable
I'm<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.520> start<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> G<00:00:58.100> now

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
I'm going to start here at the G now

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.520 
I'm going to start here at the G now
what<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.090> skip<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> string<00:01:00.809> come<00:01:01.440> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
what we do is we skip a string come to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.329 
what we do is we skip a string come to
the<00:01:01.620> fourth<00:01:01.829> string<00:01:02.449> skip<00:01:03.449> over<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> fret<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
the fourth string skip over a fret and

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.600 
the fourth string skip over a fret and
our<00:01:05.339> third<00:01:05.640> finger<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.930> fifth<00:01:07.170> fret

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
our third finger is on the fifth fret

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.649 
our third finger is on the fifth fret
they<00:01:08.610> play<00:01:08.790> those<00:01:08.939> two<00:01:09.090> notes<00:01:09.240> those<00:01:09.540> are

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
they play those two notes those are

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.640 
they play those two notes those are
octaves<00:01:11.150> g<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.510> 3rd<00:01:12.990> fret<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> sixth

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
octaves g here 3rd fret of the sixth

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.870 
octaves g here 3rd fret of the sixth
string<00:01:14.090> g<00:01:15.090> here<00:01:15.270> at<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> fifth<00:01:15.689> fret<00:01:16.880> wherever

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
string g here at the fifth fret wherever

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.990 
string g here at the fifth fret wherever
I<00:01:17.939> move<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.150> pattern<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.439> off<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.850> all<00:01:20.850> those

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
I move that pattern is off to all those

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.249 
I move that pattern is off to all those
two<00:01:21.240> strings<00:01:21.619> there's<00:01:22.619> an<00:01:22.740> F<00:01:22.890> F<00:01:23.220> sharp<00:01:23.729> G<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.420> B

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
two strings there's an F F sharp G a B

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.580 
two strings there's an F F sharp G a B
see<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:27.240> pattern<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.900> also<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.259> dropped

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
see that pattern can also be dropped

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.300 
see that pattern can also be dropped
down<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:30.420> fifth<00:01:30.659> string<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:32.130> third

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
down to the fifth string and the third

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.120 
down to the fifth string and the third
string<00:01:32.579> same<00:01:33.210> thing<00:01:33.450> here's<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.930> see<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.009> that's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
string same thing here's a see so that's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.399 
string same thing here's a see so that's
a<00:01:35.250> see<00:01:35.540> here's<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.659> d<00:01:36.869> that's<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.770> deep

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.359 

very<00:01:42.979> simple<00:01:44.469> wherever<00:01:45.469> this<00:01:45.649> fingers<00:01:45.979> on<00:01:46.159> as

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
very simple wherever this fingers on as

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.249 
very simple wherever this fingers on as
long<00:01:46.490> as<00:01:46.579> you<00:01:46.670> have<00:01:46.759> that<00:01:46.789> pattern<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.869> next

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
long as you have that pattern the next

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.950 
long as you have that pattern the next
note<00:01:48.409> is<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:48.590> same<00:01:48.950> note<00:01:49.219> higher<00:01:49.490> pitch<00:01:49.960> so

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
note is the same note higher pitch so

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.789 
note is the same note higher pitch so
let's<00:01:51.140> drop<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:51.560> down<00:01:51.679> again<00:01:52.069> this<00:01:52.490> time<00:01:53.799> not

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
let's drop it down again this time not

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.069 
let's drop it down again this time not
going<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:54.979> quite<00:01:55.130> work<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:56.450> here<00:01:56.750> because<00:01:56.990> the

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
going to quite work so here because the

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.809 
going to quite work so here because the
way<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.289> guitars<00:01:57.590> set<00:01:57.890> up<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:58.069> be<00:01:58.189> tuned<00:01:58.459> we

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
way the guitars set up to be tuned we

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.819 
way the guitars set up to be tuned we
have<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.149> take<00:01:59.299> this<00:01:59.479> third<00:01:59.750> finger<00:02:00.109> and<00:02:00.289> drop

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
have to take this third finger and drop

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.949 
have to take this third finger and drop
the<00:02:01.009> pinkie<00:02:01.399> in<00:02:01.490> front<00:02:01.729> of<00:02:01.789> it<00:02:01.909> so<00:02:02.390> our<00:02:02.509> pattern

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
the pinkie in front of it so our pattern

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.520 
the pinkie in front of it so our pattern
is<00:02:03.670> finger<00:02:04.670> here<00:02:04.939> skip<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.780> string<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.319> skip

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
is finger here skip a string and skip

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.309 
is finger here skip a string and skip
two<00:02:06.709> frets<00:02:07.179> first<00:02:08.179> fingers<00:02:08.539> on<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.840> 3rd<00:02:09.110> fret

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
two frets first fingers on the 3rd fret

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.240 
two frets first fingers on the 3rd fret
of<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.679> D<00:02:09.769> string<00:02:10.660> which<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:11.690> an<00:02:11.900> F<00:02:12.140> note<00:02:12.410> we

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
of the D string which is an F note we

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.660 
of the D string which is an F note we
skip<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.879> the<00:02:13.970> B<00:02:14.120> string<00:02:15.129> 1<00:02:16.129> 2<00:02:16.670> 3<00:02:16.700> over<00:02:17.360> here

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.640 

fnf<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.540> patterns<00:02:21.930> move<00:02:22.080> was<00:02:22.260> well<00:02:22.440> so

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
fnf and that patterns move was well so

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.490 
fnf and that patterns move was well so
here's<00:02:22.800> F

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.830 

so<00:02:28.340> if<00:02:28.430> we<00:02:28.580> go<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.270> note<00:02:29.510> we<00:02:29.600> don't<00:02:29.750> what

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
so if we go to this note we don't what

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.370 
so if we go to this note we don't what
it<00:02:29.960> is<00:02:30.640> f<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:32.000> pattern<00:02:32.810> works<00:02:32.960> when<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.200> drop

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
it is f that pattern works when you drop

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.100 
it is f that pattern works when you drop
it<00:02:33.530> again<00:02:37.630> now<00:02:38.630> you're<00:02:38.810> probably<00:02:38.900> wondering

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
it again now you're probably wondering

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.660 
it again now you're probably wondering

notice we do our off to pattern we find

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.240 
notice we do our off to pattern we find
the<00:02:53.810> next<00:02:54.050> note<00:02:54.320> in<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.440> octave<00:02:54.860> lower<00:02:54.920> and

the next note in that octave lower and

the next note in that octave lower and
pitch<00:02:55.660> we<00:02:56.660> still<00:02:56.870> don't<00:02:56.990> know<00:02:57.020> what<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.200> is

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
pitch we still don't know what that is

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.050 
pitch we still don't know what that is
do<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.670> next<00:02:58.820> octave<00:02:59.150> pattern<00:03:00.760> we<00:03:01.760> know<00:03:01.910> this

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
do the next octave pattern we know this

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.920 
do the next octave pattern we know this
is<00:03:02.209> Annie<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.870> that's<00:03:02.989> Annie<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:04.220> that's<00:03:04.340> Annie

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
is Annie so that's Annie so that's Annie

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.420 
is Annie so that's Annie so that's Annie

same thing if I'm here I don't know what

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.260 
same thing if I'm here I don't know what
note<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:07.910> do<00:03:08.750> my<00:03:08.870> octave<00:03:09.200> pattern<00:03:10.270> don't

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
note that is do my octave pattern don't

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.430 
note that is do my octave pattern don't
know<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.600> so<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:11.810> do<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.080> other<00:03:12.260> off<00:03:12.410> to

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
know that so I do the other off to

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.330 
know that so I do the other off to
pattern<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.270> know<00:03:14.270> this<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.690> see<00:03:14.959> so<00:03:15.950> that's<00:03:16.190> a

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
pattern I know this is a see so that's a

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.020 
pattern I know this is a see so that's a
scene<00:03:17.020> so<00:03:18.020> that's<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.350> seat<00:03:18.590> same<00:03:19.370> thing<00:03:19.670> you

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
scene so that's a seat same thing you

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.360 
scene so that's a seat same thing you
might<00:03:20.209> be<00:03:20.420> here<00:03:20.750> at<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:20.959> low<00:03:21.170> way<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:22.160> don't

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
might be here at this low way you don't

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.580 
might be here at this low way you don't
like<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.880> where<00:03:23.480> it's<00:03:23.630> at<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.959> like<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.320> tone

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
like the where it's at you like the tone

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.590 
like the where it's at you like the tone
but<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.550> want<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.820> go<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:25.910> little<00:03:26.030> higher<00:03:26.239> pitch

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
but you want to go a little higher pitch

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.180 
but you want to go a little higher pitch
where<00:03:26.900> do<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.080> go<00:03:27.260> it's<00:03:27.440> there<00:03:27.590> just<00:03:27.620> kind<00:03:28.130> of

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
where do you go it's there just kind of

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.470 
where do you go it's there just kind of
oh<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:30.680> got<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.610> want<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.880> have<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.000> way<00:03:32.420> to

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
oh I got it you want to have a way to

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.990 
oh I got it you want to have a way to
map<00:03:33.019> around<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:33.590> we<00:03:33.709> do<00:03:33.830> here<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.340> want<00:03:34.880> to

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
map around so we do here I want to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.360 
map around so we do here I want to
pattern<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:36.019> little<00:03:36.680> higher<00:03:36.830> you<00:03:36.980> like<00:03:37.160> that

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
pattern a little higher you like that

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.170 
pattern a little higher you like that
one<00:03:37.489> but<00:03:37.670> maybe<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:37.940> little<00:03:38.150> higher<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:41.000> like

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
one but maybe a little higher you like

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.780 
one but maybe a little higher you like
that<00:03:41.209> there<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.690> go<00:03:42.250> octaves<00:03:43.250> really<00:03:43.519> serve<00:03:43.760> a

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
that there you go octaves really serve a

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.430 
that there you go octaves really serve a
purpose<00:03:44.030> other<00:03:44.450> than<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.810> they're<00:03:45.170> really

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
purpose other than that they're really

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.840 
purpose other than that they're really
cool<00:03:45.620> technique<00:03:46.130> you'll<00:03:46.370> hear<00:03:46.489> them<00:03:46.549> a<00:03:46.610> lot<00:03:46.760> in

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
cool technique you'll hear them a lot in

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.850 
cool technique you'll hear them a lot in
blues<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.180> lot<00:03:47.510> of<00:03:47.600> jazz<00:03:47.840> stuff<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:48.769> can

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
blues a lot of jazz stuff you can

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.860 
blues a lot of jazz stuff you can
utilize<00:03:48.980> Barack<00:03:49.459> if<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.940> get<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:50.360> just<00:03:50.630> slide

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
utilize Barack if you get you just slide

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.560 
utilize Barack if you get you just slide
those<00:03:51.080> patterns<00:03:51.350> around
