00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
but yeah we can see that in the ph

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.399 
but yeah we can see that in the ph
forwards<00:01:49.710> torn<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:52.140> images

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
forwards torn this is because the images

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.749 
forwards torn this is because the images
behind<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.829> which<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.220> kind<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.460> smaller

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
behind that which is a kind of smaller

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.999 
behind that which is a kind of smaller
image<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.630> map<00:01:54.780> before<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:55.799> where

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
image is the map before and then where

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.819 
image is the map before and then where
it's<00:01:56.130> ripped<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.180> map<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.759> so<00:01:59.759> like

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
it's ripped is the map for that so like

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.050 
it's ripped is the map for that so like
it's<00:02:01.829> really<00:02:02.100> hard<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.430> sort<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.729> put<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it's really hard to sort of put in the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.950 
it's really hard to sort of put in the
words<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:04.040> you<00:02:05.040> see<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.700> mops<00:02:06.149> before<00:02:06.659> die

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
words but you see to mops before die

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.900 
words but you see to mops before die
rise<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.799> know<00:02:07.890> i<00:02:07.920> mean<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:08.280> i'll<00:02:08.579> explain

rise if you know i mean so i'll explain

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.600 
rise if you know i mean so i'll explain
that<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.179> little<00:02:09.360> bit<00:02:09.479> more<00:02:09.630> not<00:02:10.070> so<00:02:11.070> if<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.489> go

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that a little bit more not so if you go

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.490 
that a little bit more not so if you go
back<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.820> transit<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.690> take<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.930> loading

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
back to transit and you take the loading

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.380 
back to transit and you take the loading
screen<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:14.070> then<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.579> sort<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.820> crop<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> time

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
screen and then you sort of crop a time

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.870 
screen and then you sort of crop a time
and<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.989> just<00:02:16.019> take<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.650> postcard<00:02:17.400> part<00:02:17.700> and

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
and you just take the postcard part and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.270 
and you just take the postcard part and
then<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.690> flip<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:18.930> upside<00:02:19.320> down<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.799> then

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
then you flip it upside down and then

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.979 
then you flip it upside down and then
you<00:02:20.400> stick<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> Diaries<00:02:21.540> loading

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
you stick it on the Diaries loading

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.740 
you stick it on the Diaries loading
screen<00:02:22.200> i<00:02:22.320> know<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.829> lot<00:02:23.489> but<00:02:23.730> image<00:02:24.630> is

the die rise loading screen you will

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.660 
the die rise loading screen you will
realize<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.900> part<00:02:31.379> before<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:32.489> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
realize that the part before like the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.250 
realize that the part before like the
little<00:02:33.150> rep<00:02:33.330> before<00:02:33.629> you<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:33.930> actually<00:02:34.080> see

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
little rep before you can actually see

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.350 
little rep before you can actually see
there<00:02:34.590> if<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.830> put<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.069> over<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.400> top<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:36.209> can

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
there if I put it over the top you can

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.290 
there if I put it over the top you can
see<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.840> dot<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.319> that<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.099> transit<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:39.150> is

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.170 
all know this and it's all information
stuff<00:02:47.190> because<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.489> happened<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.760> black<00:02:47.970> ops

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.430 
is also mostly black ops 2 there but
that<00:02:50.790> would've<00:02:51.300> been<00:02:51.360> really<00:02:51.510> confusing<00:02:51.900> and

obviously<00:03:16.349> in<00:03:16.560> particular<00:03:16.890> I'm<00:03:17.370> talking

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
obviously in particular I'm talking

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.839 
obviously in particular I'm talking
about<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.360> bottom<00:03:18.870> right<00:03:19.110> there<00:03:19.849> so

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
about in the bottom right there so

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.140 
about in the bottom right there so
according<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.450> theory<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:22.019> mine<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.970> is

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
according to this theory of mine that is

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.819 
according to this theory of mine that is
not<00:03:24.390> what<00:03:24.690> people<00:03:24.959> think<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.349> is<00:03:25.410> people<00:03:25.620> think

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
not what people think it is people think

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.819 
not what people think it is people think
it's<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:25.980> theory<00:03:26.450> like<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.569> fellow<00:03:28.049> marine<00:03:28.170> that

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
it's a theory like a fellow marine that

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.729 
it's a theory like a fellow marine that
we've<00:03:28.950> seen<00:03:29.160> in<00:03:29.370> kinder<00:03:29.730> Toten<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:31.200> that's

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
we've seen in kinder Toten but that's

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.500 
we've seen in kinder Toten but that's
not<00:03:31.860> that's<00:03:32.160> not<00:03:32.280> what<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.519> is<00:03:32.609> it<00:03:32.819> is<00:03:33.329> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
not that's not what it is it is the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
not that's not what it is it is the
antec<00:03:34.489> ethir<00:03:35.630> mechanism<00:03:38.420> so<00:03:39.420> now<00:03:40.109> we<00:03:40.290> need<00:03:40.470> to

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
antec ethir mechanism so now we need to

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.319 
antec ethir mechanism so now we need to
go<00:03:40.650> back<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.040> black<00:03:41.370> ops<00:03:41.519> 1<00:03:41.609> map<00:03:41.910> we<00:03:42.060> need<00:03:42.239> to

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
go back to a black ops 1 map we need to

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.009 
go back to a black ops 1 map we need to
go<00:03:42.420> back<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.810> moon<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:44.269> going<00:03:45.269> back<00:03:45.389> to<00:03:45.510> moon<00:03:45.810> in

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
go back to moon so going back to moon in

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.440 
go back to moon so going back to moon in
the<00:03:46.470> moon<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.829> East<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.850> moon<00:03:48.030> easter<00:03:48.359> egg

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
the moon is East the moon easter egg

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.870 
the moon is East the moon easter egg

hundreds from the Antikythera rack so

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.320 
hundreds from the Antikythera rack so
the<00:04:35.270> Antikythera<00:04:35.960> was<00:04:36.169> actually<00:04:36.590> ship<00:04:37.330> so

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
the Antikythera was actually ship so

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
sort of designed it and what it was used

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.560 
sort of designed it and what it was used
for<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:45.199> what<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:45.860> actually<00:04:45.979> did<00:04:46.400> but<00:04:47.210> Edward

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
for and what it actually did but Edward

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.279 
for and what it actually did but Edward
Richtofen<00:04:48.020> states<00:04:48.470> that<00:04:48.740> he<00:04:49.009> made<00:04:49.250> it<00:04:49.400> so<00:04:50.389> he

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
Richtofen states that he made it so he

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.680 
Richtofen states that he made it so he
could<00:04:51.320> either<00:04:51.919> he<00:04:52.250> did<00:04:52.490> he<00:04:52.880> did<00:04:53.090> actually<00:04:53.240> make

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
could either he did he did actually make

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.680 
could either he did he did actually make
it<00:04:53.870> but<00:04:54.710> he<00:04:54.979> wasn't<00:04:55.160> born<00:04:55.460> at<00:04:55.580> this<00:04:55.699> time<00:04:55.880> so<00:04:56.360> it

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
it but he wasn't born at this time so it

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.050 
it but he wasn't born at this time so it
it<00:04:56.930> was<00:04:57.349> discovered<00:04:57.710> in<00:04:57.800> nineteen<00:04:58.099> in<00:04:58.250> 1900

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
it was discovered in nineteen in 1900

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.480 
it was discovered in nineteen in 1900
but<00:04:59.870> wrecked<00:05:00.440> often<00:05:00.740> wasn't<00:05:01.099> alive<00:05:01.280> at<00:05:01.430> this

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
but wrecked often wasn't alive at this

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.560 
but wrecked often wasn't alive at this
time<00:05:01.960> he<00:05:02.960> is<00:05:03.919> this<00:05:04.159> that<00:05:04.280> he<00:05:04.580> will<00:05:05.240> he<00:05:05.419> would

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
time he is this that he will he would

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.850 
time he is this that he will he would
have<00:05:05.690> it<00:05:06.080> would<00:05:06.199> have<00:05:06.289> been<00:05:06.349> alive<00:05:06.590> but<00:05:06.800> he

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
have it would have been alive but he

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.589 
have it would have been alive but he
would<00:05:06.949> have<00:05:07.070> been<00:05:07.130> a<00:05:07.340> young<00:05:07.789> child<00:05:08.090> perhaps<00:05:08.360> a

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
person who literally minute he's took

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.060 
person who literally minute he's took
credit<00:05:17.599> for<00:05:17.750> it<00:05:17.990> by<00:05:18.169> killing<00:05:18.770> them<00:05:19.039> and

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
credit for it by killing them and

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.909 
credit for it by killing them and
finishing<00:05:19.580> it<00:05:19.669> or<00:05:20.169> he<00:05:21.169> went<00:05:21.470> back<00:05:21.620> in<00:05:21.770> time

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
finishing it or he went back in time

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.740 
finishing it or he went back in time
created<00:05:22.430> this<00:05:22.550> and<00:05:22.849> give<00:05:23.449> it<00:05:23.479> to<00:05:23.599> the

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
created this and give it to the

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.580 
created this and give it to the
Antikythera<00:05:24.650> crew<00:05:25.190> IC<00:05:26.030> said<00:05:26.240> it<00:05:26.330> right<00:05:26.419> there

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
Antikythera crew IC said it right there

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.100 
Antikythera crew IC said it right there
so<00:05:27.590> if<00:05:27.830> we're<00:05:28.280> seeing<00:05:28.550> Atlantis<00:05:29.180> map<00:05:29.330> it<00:05:29.599> will

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
so if we're seeing Atlantis map it will

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.830 
so if we're seeing Atlantis map it will
probably<00:05:30.440> be<00:05:30.710> based<00:05:31.070> around<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.880> Antikythera

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
probably be based around the Antikythera

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.350 
probably be based around the Antikythera
mechanism<00:05:33.310> key<00:05:34.310> it<00:05:34.490> will<00:05:34.520> be<00:05:34.759> used<00:05:35.000> in<00:05:35.180> wrecked

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
mechanism key it will be used in wrecked

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.930 
mechanism key it will be used in wrecked
orphans<00:05:35.659> plan<00:05:35.960> or<00:05:36.550> we<00:05:37.550> will<00:05:37.669> be<00:05:37.759> on<00:05:37.909> the

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
orphans plan or we will be on the

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.180 
orphans plan or we will be on the
Antikythera<00:05:38.570> ship<00:05:38.870> I'm<00:05:39.770> starting<00:05:40.070> to<00:05:40.099> get

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
Antikythera ship I'm starting to get

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.800 
Antikythera ship I'm starting to get
really<00:05:40.370> good<00:05:40.490> at<00:05:40.550> saying<00:05:40.759> that<00:05:40.849> much<00:05:41.479> like<00:05:41.690> my

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
really good at saying that much like my

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.050 
really good at saying that much like my
moon<00:05:42.050> theory<00:05:42.469> in<00:05:42.620> the<00:05:42.650> mops<00:05:42.949> to<00:05:43.219> do<00:05:43.370> we<00:05:43.880> have<00:05:44.030> a

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
moon theory in the mops to do we have a

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.320 
moon theory in the mops to do we have a
rasp<00:05:44.389> reference<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.229> the<00:05:45.560> ocean<00:05:46.130> or<00:05:46.330> Atlantis

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
rasp reference to the ocean or Atlantis

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.510 
rasp reference to the ocean or Atlantis
or<00:05:47.449> whatever<00:05:47.719> there's<00:05:48.560> actually<00:05:48.949> beside<00:05:49.280> the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
or whatever there's actually beside the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.969 
or whatever there's actually beside the
map<00:05:49.699> named<00:05:50.050> creatures<00:05:51.050> from<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:51.530> moon<00:05:51.680> oh<00:05:51.860> no

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
map named creatures from the moon oh no

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.879 
map named creatures from the moon oh no
space<00:05:52.940> monsters<00:05:53.060> from<00:05:53.630> the<00:05:53.780> moon<00:05:53.930> beside<00:05:54.860> that

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
space monsters from the moon beside that

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.249 
space monsters from the moon beside that
there's<00:05:55.310> a<00:05:55.370> thing<00:05:55.849> called<00:05:55.960> creatures<00:05:56.960> from

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
there's a thing called creatures from

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:59.020 
there's a thing called creatures from
the<00:05:57.349> deep<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:58.280> it's<00:05:58.520> sort<00:05:58.669> of<00:05:58.729> based<00:05:58.880> around

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
the deep and it's sort of based around

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.029 
the deep and it's sort of based around
the<00:05:59.150> sea<00:05:59.300> and<00:05:59.360> stuff<00:05:59.659> so<00:05:59.930> that's<00:06:00.590> all<00:06:00.710> it<00:06:00.830> links

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
the sea and stuff so that's all it links

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.379 
the sea and stuff so that's all it links
up<00:06:01.099> with<00:06:01.159> my<00:06:01.310> moon<00:06:01.460> theory<00:06:01.760> if<00:06:01.940> you<00:06:02.180> haven't

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389
