it's CHP five in E SLI now this
motherboard<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.320> based<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.710> Nvidia<00:00:14.160> 650i

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.130 
chipset and we all know that's fast
now<00:00:17.730> because<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.180> an<00:00:18.270> Nvidia<00:00:18.539> chipset<00:00:18.810> and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
now because it's an Nvidia chipset and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.810 
now because it's an Nvidia chipset and
you<00:00:19.320> could<00:00:19.470> use<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.740> Nvidia<00:00:20.100> graphics<00:00:20.250> cards

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.130 
go alright first off right there's where
the<00:02:11.430> processor<00:02:12.150> goes<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.629> said<00:02:12.810> suck<00:02:12.989> at

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the processor goes like I said suck at

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.210 
the processor goes like I said suck at

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
talk about these for a minute when you

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.880 
talk about these for a minute when you
run<00:03:00.090> one<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.510> runs<00:03:00.720> at<00:03:00.840> 16<00:03:01.170> speed<00:03:01.440> when<00:03:01.800> you're

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
run one it runs at 16 speed when you're

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.170 
run one it runs at 16 speed when you're
on<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.100> 2<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.370> shares<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.670> bandwidth<00:03:03.030> and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
on the 2 it shares the bandwidth and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.760 
on the 2 it shares the bandwidth and
runs<00:03:03.300> at<00:03:03.420> 8x<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:03.959> like<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.170> said<00:03:04.410> the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
runs at 8x and like I said the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.010 
runs at 8x and like I said the
performance<00:03:05.190> increases<00:03:05.489> between<00:03:05.670> 8x<00:03:06.420> +<00:03:06.600> 16<00:03:06.900> X

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
performance increases between 8x + 16 X

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.800 
performance increases between 8x + 16 X
is<00:03:07.200> somewhere<00:03:07.709> around<00:03:07.830> 2<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.370> 3%<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:09.000> almost

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
is somewhere around 2 to 3% it's almost

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.440 
is somewhere around 2 to 3% it's almost
even<00:03:10.800> in<00:03:10.980> games<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.340> benchmarks<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.030> games

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
even in games and benchmarks and games

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.790 
even in games and benchmarks and games
you're<00:03:12.810> not<00:03:12.900> even<00:03:13.020> gonna<00:03:13.110> notice<00:03:13.350> hardly<00:03:13.590> any

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
you're not even gonna notice hardly any

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.520 
you're not even gonna notice hardly any
difference<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.340> if<00:03:14.760> speed<00:03:15.270> in<00:03:15.570> price<00:03:16.290> like<00:03:16.440> I

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
difference so if speed in price like I

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.170 
difference so if speed in price like I
said<00:03:16.709> this<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.250> way<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.400> go<00:03:17.520> all<00:03:17.910> right<00:03:18.000> now

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
said this is the way to go all right now

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.699 
said this is the way to go all right now

into the motherboard so when you want to

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.170 
into the motherboard so when you want to
make<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.799> change<00:04:14.100> you<00:04:14.730> just<00:04:14.880> pull<00:04:15.060> this

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
make a change you just pull this

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.729 
make a change you just pull this
straight<00:04:15.450> out<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.720> don't<00:04:15.810> have<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.049> rewire

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
straight out you don't have to rewire

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.710 
straight out you don't have to rewire
