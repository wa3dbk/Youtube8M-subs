the<00:01:40.720> main<00:01:40.960> focus<00:01:41.289> has<00:01:41.350> been<00:01:41.410> to<00:01:41.590> make<00:01:41.830> sure

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
the main focus has been to make sure

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.980 
the main focus has been to make sure
that<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.220> movement<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.789> is<00:01:43.240> smoother<00:01:43.720> more

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
that the movement is is smoother more

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.380 
that the movement is is smoother more
more<00:01:44.259> fluid<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:45.009> has<00:01:45.190> more<00:01:45.369> freedom<00:01:45.640> in<00:01:45.909> it<00:01:46.119> and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
more fluid it has more freedom in it and

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.060 
more fluid it has more freedom in it and
it's<00:01:46.539> more<00:01:46.720> responsive<00:01:47.289> and<00:01:47.470> with<00:01:47.920> more

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
it's more responsive and with more

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.340 
it's more responsive and with more
freedom<00:01:48.429> it's<00:01:48.580> like<00:01:48.759> an<00:01:49.390> example<00:01:49.960> of<00:01:50.020> that<00:01:50.080> is

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
freedom it's like an example of that is

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.840 
freedom it's like an example of that is
that<00:01:50.560> one<00:01:50.920> in<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.280> first<00:01:51.429> game<00:01:51.610> you<00:01:51.729> could

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
that one in the first game you could

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.309 
that one in the first game you could
only<00:01:51.970> springport<00:01:52.450> from<00:01:52.569> certain<00:01:52.840> objects<00:01:53.200> and

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
only springport from certain objects and

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.809 
only springport from certain objects and
now<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.679> can<00:01:53.830> springboard<00:01:54.130> from<00:01:54.190> any<00:01:54.429> object

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
now you can springboard from any object

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.820 
now you can springboard from any object
of<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.030> certain<00:01:55.270> height<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:56.229> can<00:01:56.350> also<00:01:56.470> use

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
of a certain height and you can also use

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.070 
of a certain height and you can also use
many<00:01:57.610> different<00:01:57.850> types<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.539> moves<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:58.929> get

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
many different types of moves to get

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.210 
many different types of moves to get
into<00:01:59.259> another<00:01:59.470> type<00:01:59.740> of<00:01:59.770> move<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.130> you

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
into another type of move that you

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.249 
into another type of move that you
couldn't<00:02:00.490> before<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:01.149> then<00:02:01.929> we<00:02:02.050> also<00:02:02.170> have

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
couldn't before and then we also have

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.290 
couldn't before and then we also have
the<00:02:02.440> combat<00:02:02.800> which<00:02:03.009> is<00:02:03.220> completely<00:02:03.909> revamped

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
the combat which is completely revamped

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.940 
the combat which is completely revamped
and<00:02:04.600> now<00:02:04.840> it's<00:02:05.050> integrated<00:02:05.619> into<00:02:05.830> the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
and now it's integrated into the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.290 
and now it's integrated into the
fluidity<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.429> movement<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.060> combine

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
fluidity of the movement so you combine

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.020 
fluidity of the movement so you combine
your<00:02:07.780> environment<00:02:08.350> your<00:02:08.470> momentum<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.369> your

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
your environment your momentum and your

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.660 
your environment your momentum and your
moves<00:02:10.329> with<00:02:10.780> specific<00:02:11.709> attacks<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.340> take<00:02:12.519> down

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
moves with specific attacks to take down

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.880 
moves with specific attacks to take down
enemies<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.930> combat<00:02:14.260> as<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.560> said<00:02:14.709> is

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
enemies so the combat as you said is

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.190 
enemies so the combat as you said is
revamped<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.579> there's<00:02:15.970> no<00:02:16.120> guns<00:02:16.450> fake<00:02:16.810> on<00:02:17.019> use

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
revamped and there's no guns fake on use

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.990 
revamped and there's no guns fake on use
guns<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.799> time<00:02:17.860> around<00:02:18.130> what<00:02:18.370> made<00:02:18.519> you<00:02:18.640> make

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
guns this time around what made you make

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.120 
guns this time around what made you make
that<00:02:19.060> decision<00:02:19.329> well<00:02:20.290> we<00:02:20.440> think<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.709> there

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
that decision well we think that there

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.740 
that decision well we think that there
were<00:02:21.549> a<00:02:21.579> few<00:02:21.850> things<00:02:22.000> about<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.390> first<00:02:22.570> game

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
were a few things about the first game

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.970 
were a few things about the first game
that<00:02:22.780> we<00:02:22.959> really<00:02:23.320> really<00:02:23.500> liked<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.860> then

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
that we really really liked and then

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.900 
that we really really liked and then
they<00:02:24.040> were<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.160> few<00:02:24.340> games<00:02:24.489> that<00:02:24.579> didn't<00:02:24.820> work

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
they were a few games that didn't work

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.340 
they were a few games that didn't work
as<00:02:25.060> well<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.510> gun<00:02:25.690> plate<00:02:25.870> was<00:02:25.989> one<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
as well and the gun plate was one of the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.750 
as well and the gun plate was one of the
things<00:02:26.440> we<00:02:26.650> didn't<00:02:26.890> really<00:02:27.190> think<00:02:27.280> worked<00:02:27.640> as

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
things we didn't really think worked as

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.729 
things we didn't really think worked as
well<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:29.049> know<00:02:29.170> there<00:02:29.350> are<00:02:29.380> many<00:02:29.560> options

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
well so you know there are many options

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.250 
well so you know there are many options
is<00:02:30.070> one<00:02:30.280> make<00:02:30.579> it<00:02:30.730> work<00:02:30.880> well<00:02:31.090> but<00:02:31.810> we<00:02:32.019> felt

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
is one make it work well but we felt

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.780 
is one make it work well but we felt
like<00:02:32.350> there<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:32.799> a<00:02:32.829> space<00:02:33.160> here<00:02:33.459> where<00:02:33.549> we<00:02:33.640> can

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
like there is a space here where we can

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.420 
like there is a space here where we can
do<00:02:33.880> something<00:02:34.120> that's<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.570> lot<00:02:34.690> more<00:02:34.750> different

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
do something that's a lot more different

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.250 
do something that's a lot more different
so<00:02:36.430> we<00:02:36.940> actually<00:02:37.570> started<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.019> create<00:02:38.230> a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
so we actually started to create a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.199 
so we actually started to create a
prototype<00:02:38.470> what<00:02:39.280> would<00:02:39.400> happen<00:02:39.640> if<00:02:39.760> we<00:02:39.880> just

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
prototype what would happen if we just

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.910 
prototype what would happen if we just
worked<00:02:40.690> with<00:02:40.900> faith<00:02:41.079> hand<00:02:41.410> with<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.709> more

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
worked with faith hand with a more

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.800 
worked with faith hand with a more
martial<00:02:42.160> arts<00:02:42.430> inspired<00:02:42.760> type<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:43.060> combat<00:02:43.390> and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
martial arts inspired type of combat and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.240 
martial arts inspired type of combat and
we<00:02:43.900> pretty<00:02:44.140> quickly<00:02:44.380> found<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:45.010> works

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
we pretty quickly found that that works

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.740 
we pretty quickly found that that works
really<00:02:45.400> well<00:02:45.519> with<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.850> movement<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.480> we

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
really well with the movement so we

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.270 
really well with the movement so we
started<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.260> design<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.769> system<00:02:48.130> where

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
started to design in the system where

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.490 
started to design in the system where
it's<00:02:48.400> all<00:02:48.519> about<00:02:48.760> hands<00:02:49.600> getting<00:02:49.930> close<00:02:50.170> up<00:02:50.380> to

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
it's all about hands getting close up to

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.140 
it's all about hands getting close up to
the<00:02:50.620> enemy<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.100> taking<00:02:51.400> them<00:02:51.519> out<00:02:51.670> with<00:02:51.910> your

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
the enemy and taking them out with your

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.180 
the enemy and taking them out with your
hands<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.600> feet<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.140> game<00:02:53.290> is<00:02:53.320> now<00:02:53.799> much

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
hands and feet so the game is now much

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.740 
hands and feet so the game is now much
more<00:02:54.370> open<00:02:54.609> world<00:02:54.970> than<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.239> used<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.510> be<00:02:55.630> it

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
more open world than it used to be it

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.210 
more open world than it used to be it
was<00:02:55.870> very<00:02:56.049> linear<00:02:56.350> before<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.799> now<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:56.950> can

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
was very linear before and now you can

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.099 
was very linear before and now you can
go<00:02:57.400> anywhere<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.120> city<00:02:58.329> so<00:02:58.750> can<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:58.989> tell

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
go anywhere in the city so can you tell

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.140 
go anywhere in the city so can you tell
us<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.260> bit<00:02:59.290> about<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.680> yeah<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.760> we<00:03:01.000> really

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
us a bit about that yeah so we really

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.610
