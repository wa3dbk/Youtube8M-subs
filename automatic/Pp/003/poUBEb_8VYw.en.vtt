00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.500 

here's<00:00:16.980> another<00:00:17.220> stem<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.090> nothing's

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
here's another stem that nothing's

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.150 
here's another stem that nothing's
fooling<00:00:18.990> with<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.470> can<00:00:19.650> see<00:00:19.859> what<00:00:20.039> it

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
fooling with and you can see what it

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.939 
fooling with and you can see what it
looks<00:00:20.369> like<00:00:21.109> so<00:00:22.109> some<00:00:22.439> little<00:00:22.650> creatures

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
looks like so some little creatures

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.769 
looks like so some little creatures
eating<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.789> which<00:00:24.090> would<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.510> like<00:00:24.720> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
eating on this which would be like a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.250 
eating on this which would be like a
horn<00:00:25.199> worm<00:00:25.820> but<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.449> eating<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:27.990> that

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
horn worm but if it was eating on that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.859 
horn worm but if it was eating on that
it<00:00:28.500> would<00:00:28.619> drop<00:00:28.920> France<00:00:29.490> its<00:00:29.910> waste<00:00:30.269> products

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
it would drop France its waste products

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.319 
it would drop France its waste products
would<00:00:31.019> drop<00:00:31.260> out<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.920> least<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.610> there's

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
would drop out on the least and there's

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.780 
would drop out on the least and there's
some<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.719> insects<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.440> little<00:00:34.829> teeny<00:00:35.340> nets

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
some little insects on little teeny nets

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.670 
some little insects on little teeny nets
but<00:00:36.210> there's<00:00:37.050> no<00:00:37.320> fresh<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.840> I'm<00:00:39.840> gonna<00:00:40.200> close

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
but there's no fresh so I'm gonna close

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.350 
but there's no fresh so I'm gonna close
out<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.280> plant<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.879> tend<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.300> think

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
out on this plant but I tend to think

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
out on this plant but I tend to think
something<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.530> something's<00:00:44.070> eating<00:00:44.219> it

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
something I know something's eating it

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.229 
something I know something's eating it
it's<00:00:45.030> part<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.480> leaf<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.879> this<00:00:47.879> these

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
it's part of a leaf going and this these

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.119 
it's part of a leaf going and this these
two<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.719> stems<00:00:48.960> are<00:00:49.140> going<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.829> need<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
two little stems are going you need to

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.830 
two little stems are going you need to
pay<00:00:50.280> attention<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.789> your<00:00:51.059> plants<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.600> catch

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
pay attention to your plants to catch

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.260 
pay attention to your plants to catch
the<00:00:52.079> horn<00:00:52.320> worms<00:00:52.590> when<00:00:52.890> they're<00:00:53.070> small<00:00:53.460> they

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the horn worms when they're small they

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.020 
the horn worms when they're small they
are<00:00:54.300> awful<00:00:54.930> hard<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.350> find<00:00:55.590> because<00:00:55.860> there<00:00:56.820> are

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
are awful hard to find because there are

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.110 
are awful hard to find because there are
divine<00:00:57.420> when<00:00:57.629> they're<00:00:57.780> 2<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.020> 3<00:00:58.199> inches<00:00:58.440> long

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
divine when they're 2 or 3 inches long

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.549 
divine when they're 2 or 3 inches long
so<00:01:00.120> anyway<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.480> need<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.780> check<00:01:01.020> all<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> tops

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
so anyway you need to check all the tops

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.020 
so anyway you need to check all the tops
of<00:01:01.710> your<00:01:01.859> plants<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:02.579> they<00:01:02.730> eat<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
of your plants because they eat the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.789 
of your plants because they eat the
tenderest<00:01:03.449> foliage<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:04.290> where<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.619> is

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
tenderest foliage and that's where it is

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.590 
tenderest foliage and that's where it is
and<00:01:05.100> that's<00:01:05.670> generally<00:01:05.820> where<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and that's generally where you see the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.140 
and that's generally where you see the
damage<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.280> sort<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> stare<00:01:08.909> at

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
damage so if you just sort of stare at

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.300 
damage so if you just sort of stare at
it<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.720> need<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.080> look<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> leaves<00:01:10.830> just

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it you need to look at the leaves just

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.710 
it you need to look at the leaves just
to<00:01:11.400> make<00:01:11.580> sure<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.970> don't<00:01:12.150> see<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.479> little

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
to make sure you don't see the little

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.760 
to make sure you don't see the little
black<00:01:12.900> dots<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.560> they<00:01:13.770> excrete<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.450> eat

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
black dots that they excrete as they eat

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.100 
black dots that they excrete as they eat
and<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.090> those<00:01:18.270> dots<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> leaves

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and if you see those dots on the leaves

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.910 
and if you see those dots on the leaves
you<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> own<00:01:20.130> worm<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.640> your<00:01:21.920> plant

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
you have a own worm in your plant

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.740 
you have a own worm in your plant
somewhere<00:01:23.220> they<00:01:23.880> don't<00:01:23.909> move<00:01:24.299> they'll<00:01:24.600> eat

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
somewhere they don't move they'll eat

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.270 
somewhere they don't move they'll eat
everything<00:01:25.170> off<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.650> branch<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.159> then

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
everything off of one branch and then

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.859 
everything off of one branch and then
move<00:01:26.460> slowly<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.119> another<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.780> they

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
move slowly to another one but they

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.840 
move slowly to another one but they
don't<00:01:28.080> move<00:01:28.259> from<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:29.070> part<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.549> tomato

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
don't move from one part of your tomato

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.030 
don't move from one part of your tomato
plant<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.360> other<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.020> very<00:01:31.229> short<00:01:31.770> time

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
plant to the other in a very short time

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.580 
plant to the other in a very short time
mostly<00:01:32.850> they<00:01:33.119> probably<00:01:33.390> live<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.140> one<00:01:34.350> whole

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
mostly they probably live on one whole

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.550 
mostly they probably live on one whole
branch<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> whole<00:01:35.250> year<00:01:35.549> before<00:01:35.909> they<00:01:36.060> die<00:01:36.560> or

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
branch the whole year before they die or

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.100 
branch the whole year before they die or
move<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.460> becomes<00:01:38.790> another<00:01:39.509> moth

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.850
