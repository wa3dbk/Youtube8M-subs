00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hello everyone, all welcome to 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.299
 294 floor review of fairytale 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.010
 episode as you have seen by part of 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.750
 jean and on the part of lucy it has been 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.190
 more than anything from fans services but good 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.570
 we have advanced a bit the story 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.460
 let's comment as always what 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.199
 has been in the prominent parts of 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.539
 this episode first of all we have 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.039
 that has reappeared then charges 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.109
 we see that he was imprisoned and thank you 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.300
 to the request of hey to the dt really that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.710
 I got out of jail to help 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.570
 beat these dragons since then 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.460
 you charge a slayer dragon and it's one of the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.859
 unique that can beat these dragons 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.350
 basically he is very useful for 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.120
 this battle on the other hand we have the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.770
 team of bloopers is a team of macho 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.899
 thank you very much not because I really 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.910
 does not control any has no better 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.870
 in his guild to no dragon slayer by 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.910
 therefore it can not do practically 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.890
 nothing in fact to try in this case 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.510
 jenny then on behalf of that fan serve 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.280
 not that you have already seen then try 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.230
 attract the dragon for that way 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.820
 make reason between the dragon 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.649
 even then with the wall of cobra 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.539
 to save these as he tries to do 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.640
 the same with cobra but does not get it 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 either on the other hand we have you can 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.840
 to say with is a pretty epic power is 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.519
 saying what you can basically do is 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.690
 use a type of magic to in this 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.880
 case remove clothes 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.380
 to humans and actually eat them here 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.060
 we also see a little the tastes that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.100
 has this circus and tells us not to 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.510
 Do not like clothes or like them 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.910
 men liked women 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.160
 obviously it is some round that understands and 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.530
 after that bunch of men 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.660
 naked because of this dragon 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.160
 you effectively appear fun service 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.540
 part of looks and that is when 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.670
 activate that magic to remove the clothes 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.230
 Allusive enough to do so because it is 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.450
 golden tries two stages gives you a lot 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.880
 shame and there is a part in this 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.220
 You do not eat it, you do not take shelter 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.230
 Lucy starts touching them so she does not know 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.150
 it will put you is messing around or some allusion 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.160
 as much as it is a dragon and that lucky 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.840
 be a human because you do not start 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.460
 touch not like before you eat it 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.230
 she wants me to be able to play with her a little 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.030
 dragon or something that is very 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.400
 perverted but then finally thank you 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.530
 to wendy in this case thanks to miralles 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.360
 they manage to save lucy between 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.430
 quotes not because I find the dragon 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.650
 see what he's giving him for sack and baskets 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.750
 kelly cocks that make me here a strip to 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.550
 take for lucy ass and that moment happens 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.500
 in something quite epic that this case to 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.450
 flip this dragon to lucy liu if 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.610
 collides with unasur and both go together 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.500
 towards that bell and they end up in a place 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.050
 where they end up finding a day 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.820
 this diary based enough important not 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.800
 of sole intro you see this diary 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.720
 burning with these rays of light that 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.320
 fall after this great night of the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.810
 dragons 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.610
 so that dragon is the one in the notebook or 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.200
 the newspaper that had the light and the future 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.730
 a said a very important newspaper 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.560
 for what is going to happen next and 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.209
 nothing, basically, it 's a bit fun 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.830
 service a bit of funny parts 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.959
 we also see for example how great 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.090
 save this as it is fully 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.100
 weakened and is therefore wanted to continue 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.240
 fighting against these dragons that we have 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.130
 seen also that appear in this 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.020
 episode that are dragons expelled by 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.640
 the dragon that is riding robots is 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.920
 has sounded very bad in the end are thieves what 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.959
 said that they come out of that dragon that is 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.100
 riding role and that are with eggs that 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.080
 they finish to include and finish 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.489
 becoming that kind of one I do not know 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.320
 if call it dragon this kind of 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.880
 metallic bugs that we also see in the 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.560
 intro if I remember correctly and this is 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.650
 I also tell you that they are going to have to 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.050
 see with a possible fall and a possible 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.489
 sadness that is going to have hub no longer say 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.140
 nothing more because I think that's 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.489
 practically everything we see in this 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.020
 episode all the highlights that 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.250
 you can take out of this episode the 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.650
 next seen as you have seen 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.150
 we will see that crazy plane that has 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.130
 nothing is that plan that occurs to you 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.520
 has to do with the food of the 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.440
 dragon 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.300
 in this case, it's the humans we'll see 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.980
 that crazy plan and we're also going to see how 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.080
 somehow fight this drone that 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.220
 is riding rose with this hell not 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.050
 I remember the same as it is called 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.510
 this fire dragon and I as he had 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.430
 said the review of episode 190 I think 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.720
 that you had been told that this dragon of 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.920
 fire was going to be very important for what 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.570
 that will happen later and there what 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.010
 you see not already in this next floor what 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.510
 let's see fighting this dragon 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.380
 of role and nothing because practically that is 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.970
 everything that happens in this episode 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.710
 talking a bit about the animation we can 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.450
 make a pretty good animation quite 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.580
 better than the one we saw in the episode of 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.380
 Naruto shippuden of yesterday who did not 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.510
 before yesterday sorry is that I came back 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.580
 because yesterday I do not know why fucking shit not 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.410
 it came out in definitive manga let's hope that 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.390
 the chicken that is in these next days 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.710
 me that-according to Tuesday we do not know how to direct 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:09.090
 massive earlier in chapter 373 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.560
 or 83 or I do not know in a chapter of those then 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.940
 basically he did the same thing not in the 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.860
 chapter in which breeding area appeared 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.600
 for the first time because in this case 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.310
 maximum no no I do not work it the day 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.600
 Friday but I do not work it on Tuesday 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.459
 of next week let's hope that 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.410
 this is so in our sleeve then 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.210
 we have it effectively this Tuesday or 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.470
 this Monday or tomorrow or I know that what 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.240
 let's have it soon because the truth is that 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.099
 I have enough to know what happens in 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.840
 of manga in nothing by practically I've 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.759
 said in pretty good animation and 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.169

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.460
