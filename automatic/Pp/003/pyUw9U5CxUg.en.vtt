why<00:01:08.150> it's<00:01:08.470> generating<00:01:09.470> at<00:01:09.560> such<00:01:09.800> a<00:01:09.950> slow<00:01:10.220> pace

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
why it's generating at such a slow pace

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.690 
why it's generating at such a slow pace
right<00:01:11.060> now<00:01:11.120> but<00:01:11.630> it's<00:01:12.380> taking<00:01:12.770> its<00:01:12.920> time<00:01:13.100> it's

right now but it's taking its time it's
taking<00:01:14.030> its<00:01:14.150> time<00:01:14.330> but<00:01:14.630> um<00:01:14.900> this<00:01:15.410> is<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.790> double

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
taking its time but um this is a double

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.850 
taking its time but um this is a double
village<00:01:17.450> seed<00:01:17.750> there's<00:01:18.020> two<00:01:18.260> villages<00:01:18.650> near

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
another well over here now I do believe

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.580 
another well over here now I do believe
that<00:01:29.180> none<00:01:29.510> of<00:01:29.540> these<00:01:29.840> villages<00:01:30.260> actually

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
that none of these villages actually

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.550 
that none of these villages actually
have<00:01:31.010> blacksmiths<00:01:31.700> which<00:01:32.420> it's<00:01:33.140> kind<00:01:33.410> of<00:01:33.470> a

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
have blacksmiths which it's kind of a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.260 
have blacksmiths which it's kind of a
bummer<00:01:33.800> that<00:01:34.070> they<00:01:34.160> don't<00:01:34.340> have<00:01:34.490> blacksmiths

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
bummer that they don't have blacksmiths

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.880 
bummer that they don't have blacksmiths
but<00:01:35.540> I<00:01:35.690> mean<00:01:36.080> it's<00:01:36.200> still<00:01:36.350> awesome<00:01:36.590> because

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
but I mean it's still awesome because

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.890 
but I mean it's still awesome because
double<00:01:37.430> villages<00:01:37.850> at<00:01:38.030> spawn<00:01:38.330> but<00:01:38.450> that's<00:01:38.660> not

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
double villages at spawn but that's not

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.830 
double villages at spawn but that's not
the<00:01:39.080> only<00:01:39.500> thing<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:39.800> is<00:01:40.460> really<00:01:41.270> exciting

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
the only thing that is really exciting

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.330 
the only thing that is really exciting
about<00:01:41.930> this<00:01:42.140> scene<00:01:42.380> if<00:01:42.560> we<00:01:42.680> go<00:01:42.830> back<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.220> the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
about this scene if we go back to the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.700 
about this scene if we go back to the
first<00:01:43.580> village<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.240> if<00:01:44.690> you<00:01:44.810> dive<00:01:45.020> down<00:01:45.380> into
