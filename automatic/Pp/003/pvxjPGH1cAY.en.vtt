00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.190
 this is a faster video for the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.009
 analyze the fourth month 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.810
 of the advances of the minor city I think that 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.850
 they go pretty well 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.000
 I'm living some changes in the 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.090
 parts where where I do not have where 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.050
 I did not have hair only as data when 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.210
 I started the first month 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.430
 This does not have a lot of hair street 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.200
 normal so do not be scared do not be 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.390
 asusten 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.670
 it's part of the process for it to come out 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.290
 new hair is the first month wheat 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.570
 everyone commented yes as saying the 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.950
 channel is falling lamata this weight 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.059
 normal because good I'm always 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.920
 accustomed from the plan to something else 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.440
 this these parts of equipment the example 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.050
 this medium has been very constant I have 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.160
 to say it suddenly in a heat of 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.820
 Africa 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.500
 this 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.050
 this very constant reduction and has 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.600
 failed a little at night and the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.170
 Saturday is suddenly at the airplane level and not 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.320
 You can place the product if bad 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.240
 well I finished the fourth booty I'm going 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.850
 the fifth and this may be the reason for 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.150
 video to understand is going to be very 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.100
 dark the camera of the compu but good 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.369
 this good part is much more vote of 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.369
 here 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.700
 and this is where I forgot to put myself here 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.280
 this part of starting the little horses 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.760
 these chapters 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.310
 and all this part of here had not 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.869
 Market Stall 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.140
 the minoxidil so I started thinking 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.140
 as you can see 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.229
 Hello 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.219
 in this part of here you can already know a 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.659
 little more hair and in the part of 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.460
 the crown on the part of the crown 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.560
 It's pretty good too 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.600
 the advance is very slow but nevertheless 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.070
 I am seeing progress since it is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.680
 active in this part of you especially 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.980
 I'm starting a few hair 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.020
 It's another thing to know'm 30 years old 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.960
 I have not said that I have 30 years 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.450
 from this year when I started to notice 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.569
 hair loss 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.340
 the key is to be constant 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.730
 every day brings you every day 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.750
 wins if the morning ponete 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.820
 product and already 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.450
 and it's really not very dangerous I'm not 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.420
 taking because I decided to before starting 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.310
 Any product try it before 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.630
 get me the finasteride I know it's 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.280
 working and it is this 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.810
 many people are working for you too 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.730
 well though I have a lot of fear 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.470
 of the moment taking you can stay 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.360
 a familiar way like that 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.470
 then it is in heavy metal video yo 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.760
 I think that at the moment I'm not going to 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.750
 get into that I'm seeing changes 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.650
 eliminated civil and this one are slow very 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.390
 slow and how this good journalism was going 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.630
 then it is the fourth month I hope that you 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.460
 has served in something simply 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.170

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.780

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.060
