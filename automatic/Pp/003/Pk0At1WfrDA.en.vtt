through the background and if you look

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.380 
through the background and if you look
really<00:01:40.530> hard<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.040> notice<00:01:41.189> them<00:01:41.460> once<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
really hard you can notice them once I

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.510 
really hard you can notice them once I
took<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.750> course<00:01:43.020> setting<00:01:43.320> off<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.920> left

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
took that course setting off and left

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.310 
took that course setting off and left
black<00:01:44.970> bars<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> side<00:01:47.600> there<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.689> go<00:01:48.780> left

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
black bars on the side there we go left

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080 
black bars on the side there we go left
black<00:01:49.649> bars<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> side<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:50.970> and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
black bars on the side and not up and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.120 
black bars on the side and not up and
down<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.750> um<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.290> was<00:01:52.649> vertically<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
down but it was um it was vertically the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.330 
down but it was um it was vertically the
black<00:01:53.310> bars<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.939> weren't<00:01:54.210> big<00:01:55.040> those<00:01:56.040> lines

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
black bars it weren't big those lines

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.300 
black bars it weren't big those lines
went<00:01:56.579> away<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.240> even<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.570> 16<00:01:57.990> by<00:01:58.170> 9<00:01:58.380> or<00:01:58.740> 4<00:01:58.799> by<00:01:59.280> 3

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
went away so even in 16 by 9 or 4 by 3

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.850 
went away so even in 16 by 9 or 4 by 3
the<00:01:59.759> lines<00:01:59.939> went<00:02:00.210> away<00:02:00.350> 4<00:02:01.350> by<00:02:01.469> 3<00:02:01.500> they're

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
the lines went away 4 by 3 they're

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.090 
the lines went away 4 by 3 they're
definitely<00:02:02.299> much<00:02:03.299> less<00:02:03.540> apparent<00:02:04.100> they're

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
definitely much less apparent they're

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.160 
definitely much less apparent they're
non-existent<00:02:05.399> action

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
non-existent action

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.290 
non-existent action
but<00:02:06.799> in<00:02:06.950> 16<00:02:07.280> by<00:02:07.369> 9<00:02:07.549> you<00:02:07.759> don't<00:02:07.909> see<00:02:08.060> them<00:02:08.209> either

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
but in 16 by 9 you don't see them either

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.240 
but in 16 by 9 you don't see them either
but<00:02:08.959> it's<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:09.380> know<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.560> stretches<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.950> little

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
but it's you know it stretches a little

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.880 
but it's you know it stretches a little
bit<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:10.849> kept<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.270> on<00:02:11.360> sixteen<00:02:11.720> by<00:02:11.840> nine<00:02:11.890> I

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
bit so I kept it on sixteen by nine I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.350 
bit so I kept it on sixteen by nine I
also<00:02:13.340> put<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.060> gamma<00:02:14.300> at<00:02:14.540> its<00:02:14.660> highest<00:02:14.870> to

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
also put the gamma at its highest to

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.270 
also put the gamma at its highest to
make<00:02:17.360> up<00:02:17.569> for<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.840> lack<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.110> like<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.800> /

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
make up for the lack of like that /

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.910 
make up for the lack of like that /

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
cables that I was showing the VJ came up

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.640 
cables that I was showing the VJ came up
a<00:02:29.090> little<00:02:29.180> dimmer<00:02:29.540> wasn't<00:02:30.020> as<00:02:30.080> bright<00:02:30.440> and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
a little dimmer wasn't as bright and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.670 
a little dimmer wasn't as bright and
over<00:02:30.860> saturated<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.720> ended<00:02:33.410> up<00:02:33.500> turning

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
over saturated and I ended up turning

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.160 
over saturated and I ended up turning
the<00:02:33.890> dynamic<00:02:34.310> contrast<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.940> low<00:02:35.239> just<00:02:35.959> look<00:02:36.080> at

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
the dynamic contrast a low just look at

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.479 
the dynamic contrast a low just look at
the<00:02:36.230> docks<00:02:36.470> were<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.769> little<00:02:36.920> darker<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.459> the

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
the docks were a little darker and the

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.979 
the docks were a little darker and the
lights<00:02:37.700> are<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.849> little<00:02:37.970> lighter<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.480> that

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
lights are a little lighter and that

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.470 
lights are a little lighter and that
really<00:02:39.290> even<00:02:39.650> things<00:02:39.860> out<00:02:40.010> so<00:02:40.730> overall<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.180> mean

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
really even things out so overall I mean

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.940 
really even things out so overall I mean
the<00:02:41.540> picture<00:02:41.750> quality<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.989> amazing<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.800> it's

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
the picture quality is amazing and it's

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.070 
the picture quality is amazing and it's
hands-down<00:02:43.819> much<00:02:44.209> better<00:02:44.510> than<00:02:44.690> what<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
hands-down much better than what the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.740 
hands-down much better than what the
composite<00:02:46.069> cables<00:02:46.430> were<00:02:46.549> doing<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:47.030> definitely

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
composite cables were doing I definitely

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.259 
composite cables were doing I definitely
recommend<00:02:47.959> them<00:02:48.410> um<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:49.519> definitely<00:02:50.090> recommend

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
recommend them um I definitely recommend

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.960 
recommend them um I definitely recommend
it<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:51.130> fine-tuning<00:02:52.130> your<00:02:52.190> TV<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.610> what<00:02:52.760> works

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
it to fine-tuning your TV to what works

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.000 
it to fine-tuning your TV to what works
best<00:02:53.180> for<00:02:53.299> you<00:02:53.600> but<00:02:54.260> if<00:02:54.350> you<00:02:54.440> strip<00:02:54.769> over

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
best for you but if you strip over

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.940 
best for you but if you strip over
stretch<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.640> found<00:02:56.269> it<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.600> be<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:57.680> get<00:02:57.769> these

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
stretch it I found it to be to get these

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.920 
stretch it I found it to be to get these
light<00:02:58.130> lines<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:59.000> your<00:02:59.150> best<00:02:59.239> bet<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.690> not

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
light lines so your best bet is to not

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.080 
light lines so your best bet is to not
do<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.319> especially<00:03:00.530> we<00:03:00.890> have<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.010> samsung<00:03:01.459> but
