law<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.720> bearest<00:00:07.080> law<00:00:07.170> states<00:00:07.500> the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
law and bearest law states the

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.930 
law and bearest law states the
absorbance<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.220> light<00:00:08.280> at<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.670> certain

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
absorbance of light at a certain

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.400 
absorbance of light at a certain
wavelength<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.540> directly<00:00:09.840> proportional<00:00:10.320> to

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
wavelength is directly proportional to

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
wavelength is directly proportional to
the<00:00:10.500> concentration<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.219> solution<00:00:11.460> what

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
the concentration of the solution what

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.789 
the concentration of the solution what
that<00:00:12.210> essentially<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.690> saying<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.469> darker

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
that essentially is saying is the darker

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.220 
that essentially is saying is the darker
the<00:00:13.920> solution<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.849> more<00:00:15.089> concentrated<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:16.109> is

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
the solution the more concentrated it is

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.810 
the solution the more concentrated it is
so<00:00:16.470> if<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:16.619> were<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.800> look<00:00:16.890> over<00:00:17.250> actually<00:00:17.699> at

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
so if we were to look over actually at

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.640 
so if we were to look over actually at
these<00:00:18.000> two<00:00:18.240> solutions<00:00:18.390> these<00:00:18.990> are<00:00:19.140> both<00:00:19.289> T

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
these two solutions these are both T

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.830 
these two solutions these are both T
solutions<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:21.090> would<00:00:21.180> automatically<00:00:21.600> know

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
solutions you would automatically know

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.689 
solutions you would automatically know
that<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.170> guy<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.410> more<00:00:22.800> concentrated<00:00:23.100> than

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
that this guy is more concentrated than

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.290 
that this guy is more concentrated than
this<00:00:23.850> guy

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
this guy

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.730 
this guy
and<00:00:24.539> that's<00:00:24.660> because<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.080> guy<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.260> darker

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
and that's because this guy is darker

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.920 
and that's because this guy is darker
it's<00:00:25.980> actually<00:00:26.310> absorbing<00:00:26.699> more<00:00:27.029> more<00:00:27.660> light

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
it's actually absorbing more more light

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.140 
it's actually absorbing more more light
than<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.650> guy's<00:00:28.890> absorbing<00:00:29.310> less<00:00:29.490> light<00:00:29.820> so

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
than this guy's absorbing less light so

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.640 
than this guy's absorbing less light so
that's<00:00:30.269> basically<00:00:30.539> what<00:00:30.689> beers<00:00:30.929> law<00:00:31.080> stating

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
that's basically what beers law stating

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.350 
that's basically what beers law stating
and<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.070> actually<00:00:32.399> there's<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.969> met<00:00:33.210> there

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
and you can actually there's a met there

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.819 
and you can actually there's a met there
is<00:00:33.480> an<00:00:33.600> instrument<00:00:33.899> out<00:00:34.140> there<00:00:34.350> called<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
is an instrument out there called the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.500 
is an instrument out there called the
spectrophotometer<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:36.030> actually<00:00:36.270> talks

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
spectrophotometer that actually talks

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.090 
spectrophotometer that actually talks
about<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.020> measures<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
about this and measures this the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.950 
about this and measures this the
absorbance<00:00:38.520> how<00:00:38.670> much<00:00:38.820> absorbance<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
absorbance how much absorbance see it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.229 
absorbance how much absorbance see it
solution<00:00:40.620> actually<00:00:40.890> has<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.940> if<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.120> actually

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
solution actually has so if you actually

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.000 
solution actually has so if you actually
were<00:00:42.570> go<00:00:42.690> over<00:00:42.899> back<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> beers<00:00:43.469> law<00:00:43.620> beers

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
were go over back to the beers law beers

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.560 
were go over back to the beers law beers
law<00:00:44.190> states<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> molarity<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.239> particular

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
law states the molarity of a particular

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.270 
law states the molarity of a particular
solution<00:00:45.809> divided<00:00:46.289> by<00:00:46.350> its<00:00:46.530> absorbency<00:00:47.100> is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
solution divided by its absorbency is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.040 
solution divided by its absorbency is
equal<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> molarity<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.750> second

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
equal to the molarity of a second

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.240 
equal to the molarity of a second
solution<00:00:49.230> divided<00:00:49.620> by<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.829> some<00:00:50.039> its

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
solution divided by is some its

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.549 
solution divided by is some its
absorbency<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.329> how<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.600> get<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
absorbency so how do you get that the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.080 
absorbency so how do you get that the
absorbency<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> light<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
absorbency of light so you go to a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.170 
absorbency of light so you go to a
spectrophotometer<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.399> what<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.550> does<00:00:56.789> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
spectrophotometer and what that does is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.369 
spectrophotometer and what that does is
you<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.629> make<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> certain

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
you have to make it at a certain

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.569 
you have to make it at a certain
wavelength<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.039> you're<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.280> you're

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
wavelength so you're going to you're

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.010 
wavelength so you're going to you're
going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> actually<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.480> measure<00:01:00.719> give

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
going to actually have it measure give

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.349 
going to actually have it measure give
off<00:01:01.140> energy<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:02.010> light<00:01:02.820> at<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.059> certain

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
off energy to light at a certain

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.000 
off energy to light at a certain
wavelength<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.530> what's<00:01:04.680> going<00:01:04.920> on

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
wavelength and that's what's going on

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.590 
wavelength and that's what's going on
here<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.339> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> actually<00:01:05.909> filter<00:01:06.479> out

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
here it's going to actually filter out

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.060 
here it's going to actually filter out
some<00:01:06.840> light<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> go<00:01:07.799> through<00:01:07.979> your

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
some light and so to go through your

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.890 
some light and so to go through your
sample<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.610> actually<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> read<00:01:09.390> how

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
sample and actually going to read how

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.740 
sample and actually going to read how
much<00:01:10.049> light<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.500> actually<00:01:10.770> absorbed<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:12.630> then

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
much light it actually absorbed and then

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.030 
much light it actually absorbed and then
we're<00:01:12.840> concentrated<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> solution<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
we're concentrated the solution is the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.710 
we're concentrated the solution is the
more<00:01:14.189> absorption<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.090> so

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
more absorption it's going to have so

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.850 
more absorption it's going to have so
let's<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:15.960> actually<00:01:16.110> go<00:01:16.350> over<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
let's go actually go over here and do a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.030 
let's go actually go over here and do a
problem<00:01:17.280> relating<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.270> together<00:01:18.509> so

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
problem relating all this together so

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.840 
problem relating all this together so
let's<00:01:20.040> say<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.369> solution<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
let's say we have a solution with the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.719 
let's say we have a solution with the
concentration<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.540> 0.14<00:01:22.229> molar<00:01:22.470> its<00:01:23.400> measured

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
concentration of 0.14 molar its measured

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.609 
concentration of 0.14 molar its measured
to<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:23.970> an<00:01:24.090> absorption<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.630> 0.4<00:01:25.080> 3<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.500> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
to have an absorption of 0.4 3 but that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.800 
to have an absorption of 0.4 3 but that
point<00:01:25.830> 4<00:01:26.040> 3<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.490> actually<00:01:26.820> indicating<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.630 
point 4 3 is actually indicating is that
it<00:01:28.080> absorbs<00:01:28.170> 43<00:01:28.860> percent<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> light<00:01:29.460> at

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it absorbs 43 percent of the light at

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
it absorbs 43 percent of the light at

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500

has absorbance of 0.3 seven thirty-seven
percent<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.530> concentration<00:01:37.920> well

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
percent what is the concentration well

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.859 
percent what is the concentration well
let's<00:01:38.579> think<00:01:38.850> before<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.420> even<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
let's think before we even get to this

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.060 
let's think before we even get to this
problem<00:01:40.170> let's<00:01:40.320> think<00:01:40.439> what<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.710> should<00:01:40.920> be

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
problem let's think what it should be

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.120 
problem let's think what it should be
okay<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.150> kind<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:43.040> absorbency<00:01:44.040> is

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
okay so the kind of absorbency is

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.499 
okay so the kind of absorbency is
lowering<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> concentration<00:01:45.329> should

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
lowering so the concentration should

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.690 
lowering so the concentration should
also<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:46.049> lowering<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.460> actually

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
also be lowering so it's actually

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.130 
also be lowering so it's actually
getting<00:01:47.939> more<00:01:48.030> dilute<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.780> we're<00:01:48.899> gonna<00:01:48.990> say

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
getting more dilute so we're gonna say

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.730 
getting more dilute so we're gonna say
the<00:01:49.290> first<00:01:49.740> molarity<00:01:50.280> which<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:51.049> 0.14<00:01:52.049> smaller

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the first molarity which is 0.14 smaller

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.289 
the first molarity which is 0.14 smaller
divided<00:01:53.640> by<00:01:53.700> its<00:01:53.909> absorbency<00:01:54.540> which<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.780> 0.4<00:01:55.200> 3

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
divided by its absorbency which is 0.4 3

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.770 
divided by its absorbency which is 0.4 3
is<00:01:57.299> going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.719> equal<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:59.119> absorbency<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
is going to equal the absorbency of the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.719 
is going to equal the absorbency of the
new<00:02:01.259> concentration<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.189> diluted

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
new concentration or the diluted

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.770 
new concentration or the diluted
concentration<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.390> know<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.719> this

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
concentration that we know of in this

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.219 
concentration that we know of in this
case<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.229> equal<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.219> sorry<00:02:05.820> divided<00:02:06.180> by<00:02:06.270> 0.3<00:02:06.810> 7

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
case is equal to sorry divided by 0.3 7

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.240 
case is equal to sorry divided by 0.3 7
and<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.209> cross<00:02:09.390> multiply<00:02:09.599> 0.37<00:02:10.590> times<00:02:10.800> 0.1

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and if you cross multiply 0.37 times 0.1

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.190 
and if you cross multiply 0.37 times 0.1
4<00:02:11.489> divided<00:02:11.970> by<00:02:12.030> 0.4<00:02:12.510> 3<00:02:12.750> you're<00:02:12.900> going<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.080> end

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
4 divided by 0.4 3 you're going to end

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.410 
4 divided by 0.4 3 you're going to end
up<00:02:13.290> with

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
up with

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.390 
up with
0.12<00:02:15.420> molar<00:02:15.750> solution<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.319> your<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.950> your<00:02:16.980> new

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
0.12 molar solution of your is your new

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.920 
0.12 molar solution of your is your new
solution<00:02:17.819> which<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.030> exactly<00:02:18.330> how<00:02:18.480> we<00:02:18.510> protect

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
solution which is exactly how we protect

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.229 
solution which is exactly how we protect
it<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:20.010> constant<00:02:20.340> sorry<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.760> absorbance<00:02:21.120> is

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
it the constant sorry the absorbance is

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.000 
it the constant sorry the absorbance is
going<00:02:21.480> down<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.020> concentration<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.650> also

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
going down so the concentration is also

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.949 
going down so the concentration is also
going<00:02:23.250> down<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.030> actually<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.450> good

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
going down this is actually a good

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.459 
going down this is actually a good
