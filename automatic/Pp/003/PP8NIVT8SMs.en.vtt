00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
have these these like slap reels that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.969 
have these these like slap reels that
would<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.990> would<00:01:16.110> come<00:01:16.350> off<00:01:16.380> they<00:01:16.830> would

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
would as it would come off they would

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.670 
would as it would come off they would
randomly<00:01:17.189> pick<00:01:17.790> different<00:01:18.390> modifiers<00:01:19.200> who

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
randomly pick different modifiers who

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.969 
randomly pick different modifiers who
you<00:01:19.920> would<00:01:20.070> fight<00:01:20.490> who<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.030> would<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
you would fight who you would be and

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.560 
you would fight who you would be and
these<00:01:22.979> modifiers<00:01:23.580> were<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.060> exposed

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
these modifiers were just exposed

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.420 
these modifiers were just exposed
elements<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.409> you'll<00:01:25.619> flip<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.070> screen

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
elements like you'll flip the screen

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.020

upside<00:01:26.670> down<00:01:27.380> double<00:01:28.380> damage<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.850> what

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
upside down double damage and what

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.819 
upside down double damage and what
happened<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.570> when<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.049> implemented<00:01:31.680> this

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
happened is when we implemented this

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.280 
happened is when we implemented this
people<00:01:32.340> were<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.759> excited<00:01:33.119> about<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.900> it

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
actually it ended up spawning off its

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.289 
actually it ended up spawning off its
own<00:01:36.780> separate<00:01:37.680> mode<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> game<00:01:38.670> sometimes

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
own separate mode in the game sometimes

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.240 
own separate mode in the game sometimes
