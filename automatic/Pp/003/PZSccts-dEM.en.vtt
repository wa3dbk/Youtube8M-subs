00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.650 

another<00:00:16.800> solution<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.490> have<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:18.029> D<00:00:18.240> mounting

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
another solution we have for D mounting

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.510 
another solution we have for D mounting
is<00:00:18.779> what<00:00:19.770> we<00:00:19.920> call<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.430> PRT<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:22.340> that's<00:00:23.340> an

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
is what we call the PRT and that's an

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.720 
is what we call the PRT and that's an
impact<00:00:24.000> driven<00:00:24.390> tool<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:25.619> driven<00:00:26.220> here<00:00:26.580> on

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
impact driven tool it's driven here on

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.810 
impact driven tool it's driven here on
this<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.509> drive<00:00:27.779> nut<00:00:28.070> with<00:00:29.070> an<00:00:29.189> impact<00:00:29.669> gun

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
this this drive nut with an impact gun

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.479 
this this drive nut with an impact gun
and<00:00:30.289> we'll<00:00:31.289> see<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.829> action<00:00:32.160> hearing<00:00:32.430> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and we'll see that in action hearing a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.250 
and we'll see that in action hearing a
little<00:00:32.550> bit<00:00:32.700> very<00:00:33.030> effective<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:33.750> D<00:00:33.899> mounting

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
little bit very effective for D mounting

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.530 
little bit very effective for D mounting
it<00:00:34.770> was<00:00:34.860> very<00:00:35.070> difficult<00:00:35.370> fourteen<00:00:36.149> hundred

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
it was very difficult fourteen hundred

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.110 
it was very difficult fourteen hundred
twenty<00:00:37.290> four<00:00:37.500> inch<00:00:37.680> tires<00:00:38.070> now<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
twenty four inch tires now for the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.540 
twenty four inch tires now for the
mounting<00:00:39.480> side<00:00:39.750> what<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> very

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
mounting side what we have is a very

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.569 
mounting side what we have is a very
special<00:00:42.090> mounting<00:00:42.450> bar<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.379> has<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.590> very

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
special mounting bar it has a very

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.180 
special mounting bar it has a very
abrupt<00:00:44.879> offset<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.290> this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.800> able<00:00:46.980> to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
abrupt offset here this this is able to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.410 
abrupt offset here this this is able to
reach<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.050> grab<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.320> rim<00:00:49.589> and<00:00:50.149> easily<00:00:51.149> pry

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
reach in and grab the rim and easily pry

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.329 
reach in and grab the rim and easily pry
that<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.839> we<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> little<00:00:52.559> kink<00:00:52.859> here<00:00:53.160> that

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
that on we have a little kink here that

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:54.829 
that on we have a little kink here that
gives<00:00:53.519> us<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.760> little<00:00:53.879> bit<00:00:53.999> of<00:00:54.179> a<00:00:54.210> mechanical

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
gives us a little bit of a mechanical

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.189 
gives us a little bit of a mechanical
advantage<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:56.190> see<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.489> has<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> nice<00:00:57.199> long

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
advantage and you see it has a nice long

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.970 
advantage and you see it has a nice long
handle<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.519> it's<00:01:00.420> able<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.749> to<00:01:01.289> put<00:01:01.800> that

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
handle so it it's able to to put that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.790 
handle so it it's able to to put that
very<00:01:02.249> difficult<00:01:02.519> bead<00:01:03.089> onto<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:04.230> that<00:01:04.500> very

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
very difficult bead onto that that very

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.719 
very difficult bead onto that that very
difficult<00:01:05.280> ramp<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:07.200> then<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.860> very<00:01:08.280> very

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
difficult ramp and then a very very

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.790 
difficult ramp and then a very very
instrumental<00:01:09.450> part<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:10.380> mounting

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
instrumental part of the mounting

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.330 
instrumental part of the mounting
process<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.640> our<00:01:12.000> bead<00:01:12.270> lock<00:01:13.010> you'll<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.190> that

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
process is our bead lock you'll see that

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.680 
process is our bead lock you'll see that
in<00:01:14.520> action<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.120> a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.240> bit<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.540> has

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
in action here in a little bit it has

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.280 
in action here in a little bit it has
this<00:01:15.960> kind<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.070> turnbuckle<00:01:17.870> or<00:01:18.870> this<00:01:19.020> little

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
this kind of a turnbuckle or this little

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.620 
this kind of a turnbuckle or this little
hinge<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.159> we'll<00:01:20.790> see<00:01:20.969> how<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.180> works

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
hinge here and we'll see how that works

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020 
hinge here and we'll see how that works
between<00:01:21.899> putting<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.590> first<00:01:22.890> bead<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
between putting the first bead on and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.760 
between putting the first bead on and
then<00:01:24.149> you<00:01:24.630> flip<00:01:24.899> it<00:01:24.990> over<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.439> puts<00:01:25.649> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
then you flip it over and it puts the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.319 
then you flip it over and it puts the
second<00:01:26.189> bead<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.700> we'll<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.060> in

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
second bead on and we'll see that in

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.319 
second bead on and we'll see that in
action<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.250> moment<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.670> with

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
action here in just a moment so with

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.520 
action here in just a moment so with
these<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:31.020> simple<00:01:31.110> tools<00:01:32.869> we<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.079> take<00:01:34.320> that

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
these very simple tools we can take that

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.630 
these very simple tools we can take that
tire<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.909> off<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.270> RIM<00:01:37.070> in<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.250> matter<00:01:38.520> of

and for for hand tools that's that's

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.810 
and for for hand tools that's that's
unprecedented<00:01:51.829> it<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.100> shows<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> value

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
unprecedented it really shows the value

illustrate<00:02:26.230> first<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:27.010> all<00:02:27.130> is<00:02:27.370> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
illustrate first of all is the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.380 
illustrate first of all is the
difference<00:02:28.180> between<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.630> domestics

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
difference between a domestics

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.070 
difference between a domestics
24<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.480> 1,400<00:02:32.290> tire<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:33.480> an<00:02:34.480> off-brand

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
24 and 1,400 tire and a an off-brand

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.550 
24 and 1,400 tire and a an off-brand
tire<00:02:35.470> or<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.240> typically<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.270> foreign<00:02:37.690> tire

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
tire or a typically a foreign tire

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.900 
tire or a typically a foreign tire
the<00:02:38.830> difference<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.400> in<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.670> beat

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
the difference is in the beat

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.440 
the difference is in the beat
thicknesses<00:02:40.860> if<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.010> get<00:02:42.160> in<00:02:42.280> here<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:43.270> can

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
thicknesses if you get in here you can

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.890 
thicknesses if you get in here you can
see<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:44.380> has<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.620> very<00:02:44.950> thick<00:02:45.310> bead

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
see that this this has a very thick bead

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.600 
see that this this has a very thick bead
looks<00:02:46.900> like<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.230> comes<00:02:47.440> out<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.890> about<00:02:47.920> an<00:02:48.370> inch

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
looks like it comes out to about an inch

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.940 
looks like it comes out to about an inch
and<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.150> half<00:02:49.180> at<00:02:49.660> least<00:02:49.690> maybe<00:02:50.320> even<00:02:50.590> inch<00:02:50.770> in

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
and a half at least maybe even inch in

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.260 
and a half at least maybe even inch in
3/4<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:53.200> thickness<00:02:53.440> on<00:02:53.770> that<00:02:53.980> bead

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
3/4 is the the thickness on that bead

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.390 
3/4 is the the thickness on that bead
this<00:02:55.270> is<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.450> domestic<00:02:55.810> tire<00:02:56.260> now<00:02:57.010> if<00:02:57.100> we<00:02:57.250> look

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
this is a domestic tire now if we look

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.780 
this is a domestic tire now if we look
at<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.670> off-brand<00:02:58.630> tire<00:02:59.190> we<00:03:00.190> find<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.640> it's

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
at the off-brand tire we find that it's

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.510 
at the off-brand tire we find that it's
it's<00:03:01.090> really<00:03:01.660> only<00:03:01.780> about<00:03:01.930> an<00:03:02.290> inch<00:03:02.500> maybe<00:03:02.830> an

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
it's really only about an inch maybe an

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.500 
it's really only about an inch maybe an
inch<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.790> an<00:03:03.940> eighth<00:03:04.440> thickness<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:06.510> the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
inch and an eighth thickness so the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.030 
inch and an eighth thickness so the
difference<00:03:07.900> in<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.110> characteristics<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:08.920> the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
difference in the characteristics of the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.100 
difference in the characteristics of the
tires<00:03:09.280> really<00:03:09.610> makes<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:10.150> difference<00:03:10.180> in<00:03:10.959> the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
tires really makes a difference in the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.170 
tires really makes a difference in the
way<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.650> handles<00:03:12.459> when<00:03:12.880> you're<00:03:13.000> when

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
way that it handles when you're when

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.330 
way that it handles when you're when
you're<00:03:13.299> putting<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:13.810> when<00:03:14.110> you're

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
you're putting it on when you're

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.130 
you're putting it on when you're
removing<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.610> or<00:03:15.730> putting<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.450> on<00:03:16.600> that<00:03:16.840> ramp

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
removing it or putting it on that ramp

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.940 
removing it or putting it on that ramp
and<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:20.080> kind<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.350> describes<00:03:20.769> the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
and so that kind of describes the

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.590 
and so that kind of describes the
differences<00:03:21.430> between<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.970> two<00:03:22.150> we'll<00:03:22.390> stop

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
differences between the two we'll stop

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.580 
differences between the two we'll stop
right<00:03:22.840> there

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.440 

here<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.430> 24<00:03:30.209> inch<00:03:30.420> steel<00:03:31.410> rim<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:32.250> takes<00:03:33.209> a

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
here is a 24 inch steel rim that takes a

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.860 
here is a 24 inch steel rim that takes a
24-inch<00:03:34.370> 1400<00:03:35.370> tubeless<00:03:36.209> tire<00:03:36.510> these

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
24-inch 1400 tubeless tire these

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.710 
24-inch 1400 tubeless tire these
typically<00:03:37.379> go<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:37.769> scraper<00:03:38.580> or<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:39.060> grater

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
typically go on a scraper or a grater

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.900 
typically go on a scraper or a grater
and<00:03:40.260> what<00:03:40.920> we're<00:03:41.010> going<00:03:41.129> to<00:03:41.220> emphasize<00:03:41.610> here

and what we're going to emphasize here

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.500 
and what we're going to emphasize here
is<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.060> use<00:03:42.269> for<00:03:42.480> good<00:03:42.629> tire<00:03:42.870> lubricant<00:03:44.510> there's

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
is a use for good tire lubricant there's

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.059 
is a use for good tire lubricant there's
a<00:03:45.599> lot<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.870> different<00:03:46.140> tire<00:03:46.440> lubricants<00:03:46.980> on

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
almost acts like like a heavy grease but

viscosity<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.889> little<00:04:38.160> longer<00:04:38.400> than<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:39.150> tire

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
viscosity a little longer than the tire

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.240 
viscosity a little longer than the tire
so<00:04:39.690> now<00:04:40.169> when<00:04:40.380> we<00:04:40.410> when<00:04:40.830> we<00:04:40.860> do<00:04:41.100> the

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
so now when we when we do the

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.680 
so now when we when we do the
demonstration<00:04:41.460> we're<00:04:42.120> actually<00:04:42.270> going<00:04:42.600> to

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
demonstration we're actually going to

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.490 
demonstration we're actually going to
show<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:44.010> use<00:04:44.250> of<00:04:44.520> your<00:04:45.030> standard<00:04:45.479> shop<00:04:46.200> tire

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
show the use of your standard shop tire

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.000 
show the use of your standard shop tire
so<00:04:46.800> because<00:04:47.190> that's<00:04:47.370> what<00:04:47.550> that's<00:04:48.450> what<00:04:48.630> most

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
so because that's what that's what most

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.750 
so because that's what that's what most
individuals<00:04:50.010> have<00:04:50.220> that's<00:04:50.460> what<00:04:50.610> they're

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
individuals have that's what they're

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.050 
individuals have that's what they're
familiar<00:04:50.880> with<00:04:51.210> so<00:04:51.710> again<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:53.130> need<00:04:53.550> for<00:04:53.580> good

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
familiar with so again the need for good

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.870 
familiar with so again the need for good
heavy<00:04:54.479> tire<00:04:55.380> paste<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.099> lubricant<00:04:56.610> and

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
heavy tire paste and lubricant and

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.750 
heavy tire paste and lubricant and
applying<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.539> generously<00:04:58.169> is<00:04:58.760> extremely

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
applying it generously is extremely

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.320 
applying it generously is extremely
important<00:05:00.300> in<00:05:00.510> mounting<00:05:00.960> these<00:05:01.110> 24-inch

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
important in mounting these 24-inch

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:12.730 
important in mounting these 24-inch
14-hundred<00:05:03.330> tires
