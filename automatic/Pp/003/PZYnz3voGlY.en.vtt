learn if F is real easy we're going to

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.140 
learn if F is real easy we're going to
start<00:06:09.599> with<00:06:09.750> a<00:06:09.779> note<00:06:10.310> that's<00:06:11.310> just<00:06:11.819> to<00:06:12.029> the

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:19.519 
left of the three black notes that's an
F<00:06:17.090> then<00:06:18.090> we're<00:06:18.210> going<00:06:18.330> to<00:06:18.389> add<00:06:18.569> these<00:06:19.229> two

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:19.529 
F then we're going to add these two

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:25.430 
F then we're going to add these two
notes<00:06:19.740> which<00:06:20.009> is<00:06:20.219> an<00:06:20.460> A<00:06:20.880> and<00:06:21.240> a<00:06:21.990> CF<00:06:22.590> AC
