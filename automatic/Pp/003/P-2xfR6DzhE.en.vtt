videos<00:06:54.439> you<00:06:54.740> know<00:06:54.830> because<00:06:55.639> I<00:06:55.699> think<00:06:55.909> rock<00:06:56.060> and

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
videos you know because I think rock and

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.540

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
roll live is very boring I think you

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.519 
roll live is very boring I think you
really<00:06:58.699> should<00:06:58.789> be<00:06:59.060> there<00:06:59.270> you<00:06:59.629> know<00:06:59.779> and<00:06:59.990> you

really should be there you know and you

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:02.740 
really should be there you know and you
can't<00:07:00.770> really<00:07:00.939> create<00:07:01.939> the<00:07:02.150> atmosphere<00:07:02.270> of<00:07:02.689> a

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
can't really create the atmosphere of a

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.230 
can't really create the atmosphere of a
live<00:07:02.930> concert<00:07:03.199> on<00:07:03.560> tape<00:07:03.860> and<00:07:04.759> most<00:07:05.000> of<00:07:05.150> the

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
live concert on tape and most of the

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.269 
live concert on tape and most of the

a<00:07:07.400> boring

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:07.939 
a boring

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:09.760 
a boring
I<00:07:07.969> think<00:07:08.449> crisscross<00:07:08.870> the<00:07:09.020> ocean<00:07:09.259> is<00:07:09.379> good<00:07:09.620> it

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
I think crisscross the ocean is good it
