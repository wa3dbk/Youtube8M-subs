00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
go up and make it a group I was pretty

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.599 
go up and make it a group I was pretty
tired<00:00:55.590> by<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.190> point<00:00:56.399> there<00:00:56.670> they<00:00:56.879> go<00:00:56.910> I

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.060 

contemplated<00:01:02.609> not<00:01:03.710> participating<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:04.830> all<00:01:04.949> on

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
contemplated not participating at all on

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.300 
contemplated not participating at all on
the<00:01:05.189> sprint<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:06.770> decided<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.860> would<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.010> worth

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the sprint but decided it would be worth

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.370 
the sprint but decided it would be worth
it<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.760> some<00:01:09.030> video<00:01:09.180> depending<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.229> how

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
it to get some video depending on how

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.429 
it to get some video depending on how
things<00:01:10.619> played<00:01:10.920> out<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.020> thought<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.320> would

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
things played out and I thought it would

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.310 
things played out and I thought it would
be<00:01:13.560> safe<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> sit<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:15.140> then<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.290> noticed<00:01:18.320> andy

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
be safe to sit here then I noticed andy

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.749 
be safe to sit here then I noticed andy
baker<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:20.009> off<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:22.070> some<00:01:23.070> other<00:01:23.250> riders

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
baker going off and some other riders

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.120 
baker going off and some other riders
that<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.299> figured<00:01:24.750> would<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.200> pretty<00:01:25.740> strong

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
that I figured would be pretty strong

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.660 
that I figured would be pretty strong
and<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:27.030> did<00:01:27.360> get<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> break<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.920> would<00:01:29.430> be

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
and if they did get a break it would be

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.100 
and if they did get a break it would be
over<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.640> tried<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.150> wait<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.600> see<00:01:33.869> what

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
over so I tried to wait and see what

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:44.490 
over so I tried to wait and see what
would<00:01:34.259> happen

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.690 

trying<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.590> conserve<00:01:45.950> as<00:01:46.160> much<00:01:46.190> as<00:01:46.520> possible

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
trying to conserve as much as possible

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.600 
trying to conserve as much as possible
if<00:01:47.210> I<00:01:47.300> could<00:01:50.500> but<00:01:51.500> coming<00:01:51.770> up<00:01:51.890> about<00:01:52.190> here<00:01:52.580> I

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
if I could but coming up about here I

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.200 
if I could but coming up about here I
realized<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:54.280> things<00:01:55.280> were<00:01:55.520> going<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:55.940> get

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
realized that things were going to get

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.460 
realized that things were going to get
out<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.390> hand<00:01:56.720> pretty<00:01:57.020> fast<00:01:59.200> hoping<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.290> guys

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
out of hand pretty fast hoping the guys

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.930 
out of hand pretty fast hoping the guys
in<00:02:00.680> front<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:00.950> me<00:02:01.070> would<00:02:01.310> begin<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.640> make<00:02:01.880> a

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
in front of me would begin to make a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.330 
in front of me would begin to make a
move<00:02:02.380> but<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.410> realized<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:03.950> Carolina

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
move but I realized the Carolina

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.700 
move but I realized the Carolina
triathlon<00:02:04.940> guy<00:02:05.150> probably<00:02:05.690> was<00:02:06.110> not<00:02:06.350> going<00:02:06.650> to

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
triathlon guy probably was not going to

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.280 
triathlon guy probably was not going to
do<00:02:06.860> anything<00:02:07.130> so<00:02:07.910> I<00:02:07.940> decided<00:02:08.540> it<00:02:08.899> was<00:02:09.050> Now<00:02:09.259> or

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
do anything so I decided it was Now or

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.560 
do anything so I decided it was Now or
Never<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:11.300> decided<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.870> bridge<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:14.000> was

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
Never and I decided to bridge this was

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.440 
Never and I decided to bridge this was
really<00:02:15.050> my<00:02:15.230> first<00:02:15.680> mistake<00:02:16.010> though<00:02:16.910> really<00:02:17.270> if

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
really my first mistake though really if

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.080 
really my first mistake though really if
I<00:02:17.570> didn't<00:02:17.900> do<00:02:17.990> this<00:02:18.730> there<00:02:19.730> would<00:02:19.850> have<00:02:19.970> been

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
I didn't do this there would have been

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:30.030 
I didn't do this there would have been
any<00:02:20.300> chance<00:02:20.630> at<00:02:20.840> all

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.490 

so<00:02:30.790> as<00:02:30.939> I<00:02:31.090> was<00:02:31.209> crossing<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.840> was<00:02:31.989> just<00:02:32.200> praying

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
so as I was crossing I was just praying

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.349 
so as I was crossing I was just praying
that<00:02:32.680> once<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.129> got<00:02:33.310> there<00:02:33.549> they<00:02:33.760> would<00:02:33.909> ease<00:02:34.120> up

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
that once I got there they would ease up

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.679 
that once I got there they would ease up
and<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:36.310> actually<00:02:36.489> appeared<00:02:37.060> as<00:02:37.239> though<00:02:37.480> they

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
and it actually appeared as though they

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.929 
and it actually appeared as though they
had<00:02:37.719> eased<00:02:38.079> up<00:02:38.260> at<00:02:38.439> first<00:02:41.430> but<00:02:42.430> then<00:02:42.670> they

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
had eased up at first but then they

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:55.140 
had eased up at first but then they
started<00:02:42.969> accelerating<00:02:43.750> again

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.320 

so<00:02:56.150> we've<00:02:56.300> got<00:02:56.650> Annie<00:02:57.650> Baker<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:58.610> believe

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
kit that I'm not sure who he is and

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.170 
kit that I'm not sure who he is and
here's<00:03:09.830> where<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.070> made<00:03:10.250> another<00:03:10.520> mistake<00:03:10.700> I

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
here's where I made another mistake I

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.390 
here's where I made another mistake I
guess<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.900> probably<00:03:12.500> should<00:03:12.800> have<00:03:12.890> just<00:03:12.950> sat<00:03:13.370> on

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
guess I probably should have just sat on

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.140 
guess I probably should have just sat on
the<00:03:13.640> back<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:15.440> that's<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:16.250> not<00:03:16.400> me<00:03:16.730> i<00:03:16.760> guess

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
the back but that's just not me i guess

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.780 
the back but that's just not me i guess
so<00:03:17.750> i<00:03:17.780> went<00:03:18.080> up<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.260> do<00:03:18.590> my<00:03:18.800> share<00:03:19.130> in<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.460> pace

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
so i went up to do my share in the pace

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.890 
so i went up to do my share in the pace
line<00:03:21.430> hoping<00:03:22.430> they<00:03:22.820> would<00:03:23.000> very<00:03:23.330> quickly<00:03:23.390> be

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
line hoping they would very quickly be

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.980 
line hoping they would very quickly be
handed<00:03:24.200> over<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.470> somebody<00:03:24.860> else<00:03:25.810> which<00:03:26.810> it

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
handed over to somebody else which it

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.430 
handed over to somebody else which it
was<00:03:28.660> hey<00:03:29.660> there's<00:03:29.900> my<00:03:30.050> echelon<00:03:30.500> guy<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:33.320> he's

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
was hey there's my echelon guy and he's

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.570 
was hey there's my echelon guy and he's
pulling

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.840 

I<00:03:39.470> was<00:03:40.470> enjoying<00:03:40.740> this<00:03:41.040> because<00:03:41.430> things<00:03:41.700> had

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
I was enjoying this because things had

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.970 
I was enjoying this because things had
eased<00:03:42.030> up<00:03:42.240> a<00:03:42.390> bit<00:03:42.420> at<00:03:42.900> least<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.500> was<00:03:43.710> on<00:03:43.860> the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
eased up a bit at least I was on the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.430 
eased up a bit at least I was on the
back<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.570> seemed<00:03:45.810> as<00:03:45.930> though<00:03:45.960> the<00:03:46.260> pace

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
back and it seemed as though the pace

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.640 
back and it seemed as though the pace
line<00:03:46.680> was<00:03:46.860> beginning<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.400> fall<00:03:47.640> apart<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:49.620> I

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
line was beginning to fall apart so I

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.980 
line was beginning to fall apart so I
wouldn't<00:03:49.920> have<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.070> go<00:03:50.250> back<00:03:50.400> up<00:03:50.610> there<00:03:50.790> again

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.360 

by<00:03:54.990> this<00:03:55.050> time<00:03:55.200> we're<00:03:55.560> starting<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.040> climb<00:03:56.310> a

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
by this time we're starting to climb a

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.200 
by this time we're starting to climb a
little<00:03:56.910> bit<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:59.160> legs<00:03:59.430> are<00:03:59.730> not<00:03:59.940> feeling

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
little bit the legs are not feeling

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:09.170 
little bit the legs are not feeling
nearly<00:04:00.780> as<00:04:00.870> good<00:04:07.400> here's<00:04:08.400> an<00:04:08.580> acceleration

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
nearly as good here's an acceleration

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.690 
nearly as good here's an acceleration
that<00:04:09.600> this<00:04:10.020> is<00:04:10.200> when<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.410> really<00:04:10.890> first<00:04:11.220> started

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
that this is when I really first started

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.090 
that this is when I really first started
feeling<00:04:12.060> as<00:04:12.180> though<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:13.380> just<00:04:13.710> wasn't<00:04:14.010> going

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
feeling as though it just wasn't going

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.660 
feeling as though it just wasn't going
to<00:04:14.160> happen<00:04:14.220> they<00:04:15.060> eased<00:04:15.300> up<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.690> bit<00:04:15.720> when<00:04:16.670> looks

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
to happen they eased up a bit when looks

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.510 
to happen they eased up a bit when looks
like<00:04:18.620> Andy<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.880> Jim<00:04:20.880> went<00:04:21.450> off<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.870> front<00:04:22.520> so

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
like Andy and Jim went off the front so

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.880 
like Andy and Jim went off the front so
I<00:04:23.550> thought<00:04:23.850> hey<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.360> can<00:04:25.350> at<00:04:25.440> least<00:04:25.560> hang<00:04:25.770> with

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
I thought hey I can at least hang with

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.620 
I thought hey I can at least hang with
these<00:04:26.010> guys<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.310> maybe<00:04:26.730> even<00:04:27.120> get<00:04:27.390> a<00:04:27.420> third

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
these guys and maybe even get a third

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:35.090 
these guys and maybe even get a third
place<00:04:27.900> out<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.260> this<00:04:33.320> unfortunately<00:04:34.320> not<00:04:34.770> too

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
place out of this unfortunately not too

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.290 
place out of this unfortunately not too
long<00:04:35.280> after<00:04:35.700> this<00:04:36.480> when<00:04:36.840> they<00:04:37.080> accelerated

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
long after this when they accelerated

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.170 
long after this when they accelerated
right<00:04:39.300> about<00:04:39.570> here<00:04:40.020> I<00:04:40.520> tried<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.670> go<00:04:41.790> with<00:04:41.970> them

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
right about here I tried to go with them

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.570 
right about here I tried to go with them
and<00:04:42.919> my<00:04:43.919> legs<00:04:44.220> just<00:04:44.370> were<00:04:44.790> done<00:04:46.430> we're<00:04:47.430> talking

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
and my legs just were done we're talking

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:58.950 
and my legs just were done we're talking
about<00:04:47.790> painful<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:52.020> off<00:04:52.290> they<00:04:52.530> went

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.930 

then<00:04:59.960> several<00:05:00.380> minutes<00:05:00.680> later<00:05:00.980> i<00:05:01.310> happen<00:05:01.850> to

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
then several minutes later i happen to

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.080 
then several minutes later i happen to
come<00:05:02.000> across<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:03.140> sprint<00:05:03.770> zone<00:05:04.670> i<00:05:04.820> think

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
come across the sprint zone i think

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.240 
come across the sprint zone i think
that's<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.480> line<00:05:05.690> that<00:05:05.990> would<00:05:06.890> have<00:05:07.040> ended

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
that's the line that would have ended

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.520 
that's the line that would have ended
the<00:05:07.490> sprint<00:05:07.880> cause<00:05:08.480> up<00:05:08.750> here<00:05:09.110> in<00:05:09.230> just<00:05:09.260> a

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
the sprint cause up here in just a

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.490 
the sprint cause up here in just a
moment<00:05:09.920> we'll<00:05:10.360> be<00:05:11.360> making<00:05:11.780> a<00:05:11.870> turn<00:05:12.140> to<00:05:12.380> the

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
moment we'll be making a turn to the

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.490 
moment we'll be making a turn to the
right<00:05:12.940> as<00:05:13.940> i<00:05:14.300> was<00:05:14.480> making<00:05:14.810> this<00:05:14.930> turn<00:05:15.200> to<00:05:15.380> the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
right as i was making this turn to the

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.590 
right as i was making this turn to the
right<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:16.340> rest<00:05:16.640> of<00:05:16.790> the<00:05:16.910> group<00:05:17.030> caught<00:05:17.390> me

right the rest of the group caught me

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.510 
right the rest of the group caught me
