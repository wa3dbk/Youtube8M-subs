00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.590 
can also use a knife to strike it but
kinda<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.490> don't<00:01:47.820> know<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> best

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
kinda I don't know if it's the best

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.190 
kinda I don't know if it's the best
thing<00:01:48.689> for<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.020> knife<00:01:49.280> but<00:01:50.990> might<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.079> well

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
thing for the knife but might as well

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.920 
thing for the knife but might as well
just<00:01:52.350> use<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.740> since<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.220> comes<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.930> so

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
just use this since it comes with it so

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.289 
just use this since it comes with it so
I<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.560> new<00:01:55.740> one<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:55.950> EMS<00:01:56.549> actually<00:01:57.090> says
