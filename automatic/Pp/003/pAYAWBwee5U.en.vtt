where do I know this guy from and by the

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.259 
where do I know this guy from and by the
time<00:04:02.380> they<00:04:02.860> there<00:04:03.190> think<00:04:03.400> about<00:04:03.609> that<00:04:03.730> for<00:04:04.180> a

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
time they there think about that for a

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.880 
time they there think about that for a
second<00:04:04.630> you're<00:04:05.019> long<00:04:05.230> gone<00:04:05.260> around<00:04:05.739> the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
second you're long gone around the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.130

corner not that I could outrun them I

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.190 
corner not that I could outrun them I
could<00:04:08.739> probably<00:04:09.030> give<00:04:10.030> most<00:04:10.600> of<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.840> run<00:04:11.019> for

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
could probably give most of a run for

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.620 
could probably give most of a run for
the<00:04:11.260> money<00:04:11.320> with<00:04:11.620> this<00:04:11.709> one<00:04:11.950> but<00:04:12.850> not<00:04:13.090> not<00:04:13.359> this

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
the money with this one but not not this

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.140 
the money with this one but not not this
but<00:04:14.200> since<00:04:14.470> most<00:04:14.799> police<00:04:15.580> officers<00:04:15.730> have

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
but since most police officers have

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.710 
but since most police officers have
never<00:04:16.390> seen<00:04:16.780> a<00:04:17.109> gyro<00:04:18.099> three<00:04:18.400> wheeler<00:04:18.729> they
