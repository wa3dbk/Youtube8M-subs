00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:13.559
 Today October 8, autumn work in the garden 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:19.619
 garden looks so elegant and beautiful 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:22.470
 blueberry foliage is very beautiful and elegant 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.840
 I think it will be a decoration for any garden and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.320
 not only decorations but also in summer 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.810
 wonderful tasty berries 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.329
 need to take care that she is well 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.399
 wintered though cold-resistant plant 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:44.520
 but better of course to warm and insulate 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:47.760
 by your moss litter that we have here in 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.969
 in my case, I scored such a moss 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:58.060
 and opad and here we are insulating we take and 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:01.090
 neatly lay out layer by layer 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.090
 Well, somewhere centimeters can be 10 so 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.820
 to make it warmer and so 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.820
 we put everything around 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:20.670
 here is the first harvest 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:26.020
 garden cranberries look so big 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:30.420
 beautiful and tasty healthy is quite possible 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.420
 plant with blueberries and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:41.260
 there will be a good harvest we drift twigs 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.770
 and look, they give then these 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.700
 here are the roots then my spring we cut them 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.660
 and plant as a separate qi plant here 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.050
 so I'm going in this way 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:02:01.360
 multiply the garden cranberries with one 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.500
 bush here it is so small I will reconnoiter 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.310

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.950
 plants and I have no compost heaps 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:28.900

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.219

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.340
 selecting separately just 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:41.049
 I recline, but I cut these sticks here 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.719
 and laying between the row where to walk the beds 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:48.319

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:51.500

00:02:52.069 --> 00:03:00.040
 it will be recycled and to 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.519
 microorganisms worm and improve 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.730

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:22.340
 strawberries spread foliage flies usually 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.009
