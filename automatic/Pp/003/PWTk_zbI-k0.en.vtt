00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.720
 the one who drives and places the center 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.720
 It will feel very good for the moon 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.700
 if the moon of the table oriented the ball 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.190
 far from the good range but it shows 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.160
 immediately put in please the 28 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.180
 minutes in legs enters and now an ossuary 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.879
 central 11 28 and a half minutes in the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.320
 First time the Chinese Chinese and Carlos 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.320
 Luna was a bullfighter 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.100
 I could not find the spaces 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.880
 this time the play came by left 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.040
 and the rating 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.740
 greetings clearly by hand lanzini 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.030
 Carlos Luna fellow mate 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.330
 so many 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.460
 of river but the goal was more than 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.080
 important for me to be losing here 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.229
 the local 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.640
 this we always go out to be 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.490
 aggressive that new in a flyer that 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.390
 we out there get a little complicated in 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.560
 the environment so we took out and luckily 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.690
 It was given to me 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.300
 If you're not good from above , very 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.970
 difficult because 35 thousand people waiting 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.020
 a long time ago to convert not 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.020
 it's easy for a forward 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:53.100
 helps you handle that situation when 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.100
 the ball to try to forget 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.670
 things go back to their place in that 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.670
 moment is good 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.580
 I think an intense match of the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.940
 two sides at least it is difficult to 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.940
 the two teams 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.120
 but 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.120
 the first of January
