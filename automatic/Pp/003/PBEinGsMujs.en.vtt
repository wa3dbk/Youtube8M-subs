serious disease that needs to be

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.120 
serious disease that needs to be
investigated<00:01:03.570> now<00:01:04.570> colic<00:01:05.019> tends<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.710> begin<00:01:05.979> at

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
investigated now colic tends to begin at

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.459 
investigated now colic tends to begin at
that<00:01:06.310> age<00:01:06.490> it<00:01:06.820> peaks<00:01:07.119> at<00:01:07.270> around<00:01:07.390> six<00:01:07.990> weeks<00:01:08.079> of

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
that age it peaks at around six weeks of

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.739 
that age it peaks at around six weeks of
life<00:01:08.649> and<00:01:08.950> it<00:01:09.310> usually<00:01:09.490> goes<00:01:09.850> away<00:01:10.179> by<00:01:10.390> three

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:10.749 
life and it usually goes away by three

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.660 
life and it usually goes away by three
months<00:01:10.960> of<00:01:11.170> life<00:01:11.350> so<00:01:11.859> what<00:01:12.340> we're<00:01:12.490> talking

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
months of life so what we're talking

months of life so what we're talking
about<00:01:12.909> now<00:01:13.329> if<00:01:13.630> it's<00:01:13.780> going<00:01:13.840> on<00:01:14.170> longer<00:01:14.590> than

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
about now if it's going on longer than

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.709 
about now if it's going on longer than
the<00:01:15.009> third<00:01:15.189> month<00:01:15.460> of<00:01:15.609> life<00:01:15.759> that's<00:01:16.329> also

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
the third month of life that's also

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.499 
the third month of life that's also
unusual<00:01:17.229> and<00:01:17.590> deserves<00:01:18.069> looking<00:01:18.880> at<00:01:19.060> now<00:01:19.450> do

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
unusual and deserves looking at now do

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.410 
unusual and deserves looking at now do
we<00:01:19.780> know<00:01:19.929> what<00:01:20.140> causes<00:01:20.439> colic<00:01:20.979> honestly<00:01:21.670> no<00:01:22.030> we

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
we know what causes colic honestly no we

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.880 
we know what causes colic honestly no we
don't<00:01:22.630> we<00:01:22.810> don't<00:01:22.899> even<00:01:23.170> know<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.380> it's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
don't we don't even know that it's

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.590 
don't we don't even know that it's
really<00:01:24.249> abdominal<00:01:24.880> pain<00:01:25.060> I<00:01:25.090> mean<00:01:25.299> it<00:01:25.390> looks

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
really abdominal pain I mean it looks

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.959 
really abdominal pain I mean it looks
like<00:01:25.780> abdominal<00:01:26.350> pain<00:01:26.560> but<00:01:26.799> who<00:01:27.340> can<00:01:27.579> say<00:01:27.759> the

like abdominal pain but who can say the

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.969 
like abdominal pain but who can say the
infants<00:01:28.329> can't<00:01:28.539> tell<00:01:28.810> us<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.469> things<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:29.889> we

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
protein allergy don't tend to help colic

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.260 
protein allergy don't tend to help colic
very<00:01:38.079> often<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:39.159> rates<00:01:39.399> are<00:01:39.609> about<00:01:39.819> two<00:01:40.119> to

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
very often the rates are about two to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.450 
very often the rates are about two to
five<00:01:40.450> percent<00:01:40.509> so<00:01:41.439> a<00:01:41.649> lot<00:01:42.009> of<00:01:42.039> people<00:01:42.249> will
