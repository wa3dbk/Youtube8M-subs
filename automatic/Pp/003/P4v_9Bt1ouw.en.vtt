review this is of the geometric by speck
products<00:00:13.190> it<00:00:13.400> is<00:00:14.120> a<00:00:14.419> iphone<00:00:14.809> 4<00:00:15.230> case<00:00:15.440> it<00:00:16.480> is<00:00:17.480> a

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
products it is a iphone 4 case it is a

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.290 
products it is a iphone 4 case it is a
kind<00:00:18.380> of<00:00:18.440> a<00:00:18.560> slip-on<00:00:18.920> case<00:00:19.220> not<00:00:19.730> silicon<00:00:20.269> a

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
kind of a slip-on case not silicon a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.790 
kind of a slip-on case not silicon a
little<00:00:20.630> bit<00:00:20.720> more<00:00:20.840> rigid<00:00:21.199> but<00:00:21.410> it's<00:00:21.590> not<00:00:21.769> a

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
little bit more rigid but it's not a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.519 
little bit more rigid but it's not a
full<00:00:22.160> full<00:00:23.150> factor<00:00:23.480> like<00:00:23.660> slider<00:00:23.960> type<00:00:24.230> case

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
full full factor like slider type case

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.859 
full full factor like slider type case
is<00:00:24.800> very<00:00:25.630> rigid<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:26.839> very<00:00:27.080> hard<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:28.689> use<00:00:29.689> this

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
is very rigid and very hard so use this

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.679 
is very rigid and very hard so use this
for<00:00:30.109> a<00:00:30.140> couple<00:00:30.320> days<00:00:30.650> now<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:31.480> got<00:00:32.480> a<00:00:32.509> few

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
for a couple days now and got a few

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.020 
for a couple days now and got a few
things<00:00:32.720> to<00:00:32.990> say<00:00:33.140> about<00:00:33.170> it<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:34.670> I'll<00:00:34.880> just

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
things to say about it and I'll just

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.580 
things to say about it and I'll just
open<00:00:35.210> it<00:00:35.390> up<00:00:35.539> in<00:00:35.660> here<00:00:35.899> so<00:00:36.140> i<00:00:36.200> just<00:00:36.230> want<00:00:36.530> to

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
open it up in here so i just want to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.840 
open it up in here so i just want to
show<00:00:36.770> you<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:36.950> packaging<00:00:37.460> but<00:00:37.579> i<00:00:37.640> have

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
show you the packaging but i have

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.560 
show you the packaging but i have
already<00:00:38.180> been<00:00:38.329> using<00:00:38.690> it<00:00:39.309> so<00:00:40.309> very<00:00:41.270> simple

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
already been using it so very simple

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.500 
already been using it so very simple
packaging<00:00:42.020> just<00:00:42.590> pull<00:00:42.770> it<00:00:42.860> out<00:00:42.949> and<00:00:43.270> this<00:00:44.270> is

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
packaging just pull it out and this is

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.959 
packaging just pull it out and this is
the<00:00:44.750> case<00:00:44.989> it's<00:00:45.320> got<00:00:45.559> a<00:00:45.610> really<00:00:46.610> cool<00:00:46.940> design

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
the case it's got a really cool design

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.790 
the case it's got a really cool design
that's<00:00:47.449> why<00:00:47.570> it's<00:00:47.719> called<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.020> geometric<00:00:48.620> so

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
that's why it's called the geometric so

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.799 
that's why it's called the geometric so
if<00:00:48.890> you<00:00:48.980> see<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.309> light<00:00:49.489> kind<00:00:50.270> of<00:00:50.329> reflecting

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
if you see the light kind of reflecting

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.369 
if you see the light kind of reflecting
off<00:00:50.930> it's<00:00:51.230> got<00:00:51.379> this<00:00:51.590> um<00:00:52.840> can<00:00:53.840> see<00:00:53.989> on<00:00:54.109> the<00:00:54.230> back

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
off it's got this um can see on the back

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.009 
off it's got this um can see on the back
it's<00:00:54.680> almost<00:00:54.859> like<00:00:55.039> two<00:00:55.340> ridges<00:00:55.879> it's<00:00:56.750> like

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
it's almost like two ridges it's like

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.439 
it's almost like two ridges it's like
different<00:00:57.769> angles<00:00:58.399> on<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.640> back<00:00:58.850> right<00:00:59.149> it's

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
different angles on the back right it's

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.200 
different angles on the back right it's
got<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.350> smooth<00:01:00.829> texture<00:01:01.280> too<00:01:01.460> it's<00:01:01.609> not<00:01:01.820> grippy

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
got a smooth texture too it's not grippy

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.460 
got a smooth texture too it's not grippy
it's<00:01:02.390> not<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.600> link<00:01:02.899> catcher<00:01:03.550> it<00:01:04.550> is<00:01:05.420> semi<00:01:06.170> rigid

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
it's not a link catcher it is semi rigid

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.350 
it's not a link catcher it is semi rigid
so<00:01:06.950> not<00:01:07.640> full<00:01:07.970> full<00:01:08.390> blown<00:01:08.600> silicon<00:01:09.140> but<00:01:09.500> still

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
so not full full blown silicon but still

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.060 
so not full full blown silicon but still
still<00:01:11.360> malleable<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.960> flexible<00:01:12.439> but<00:01:12.860> there's

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
still malleable and flexible but there's

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.550 
still malleable and flexible but there's
a<00:01:13.130> few<00:01:13.310> rigid<00:01:13.610> edges<00:01:13.759> on<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.780> sides<00:01:15.170> top

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
a few rigid edges on the sides top

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.350 
a few rigid edges on the sides top
bottom<00:01:15.950> as<00:01:16.900> you<00:01:17.900> can<00:01:18.020> see<00:01:18.259> no<00:01:19.009> real<00:01:19.400> of<00:01:19.729> flash

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360

issues whatsoever when I examine the

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.080 
issues whatsoever when I examine the
case<00:01:22.640> great<00:01:23.509> when<00:01:24.259> they<00:01:24.380> be<00:01:25.090> manufacturing

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
case great when they be manufacturing

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.940 
case great when they be manufacturing
process<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.630> quality<00:01:26.869> control<00:01:26.900> is<00:01:27.229> fantastic

so far the here's the cutouts this is

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.249 
so far the here's the cutouts this is
the<00:01:30.770> camera<00:01:31.250> cut<00:01:31.430> out<00:01:31.549> that's<00:01:31.790> right<00:01:31.939> there

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
the camera cut out that's right there

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.429 
the camera cut out that's right there

that<00:01:42.950> are<00:01:42.979> covered<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.700> this<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.420> vibrating

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
that are covered and this is a vibrating

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.069 
that are covered and this is a vibrating
switch<00:01:45.189> so<00:01:46.189> let's<00:01:46.340> just<00:01:46.520> put<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.149> phone<00:01:47.750> into

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
switch so let's just put the phone into

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.719 
switch so let's just put the phone into
the<00:01:48.680> case<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:49.640> just<00:01:49.790> slide<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.240> in<00:01:50.360> from<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:51.229> top

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
the case I just slide it in from the top

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.780 
the case I just slide it in from the top
very<00:01:52.729> similar<00:01:53.299> to<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.740> pixelskin<00:01:54.740> HD<00:01:54.829> and<00:01:55.640> how

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
very similar to the pixelskin HD and how

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.450 
very similar to the pixelskin HD and how
you<00:01:55.850> put<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:56.450> into<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:56.899> phone<00:01:57.229> or<00:01:58.100> put<00:01:58.369> the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
you put it into the phone or put the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.130 
you put it into the phone or put the
phone<00:01:58.610> into<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.969> case<00:01:59.619> so<00:02:00.619> there<00:02:01.549> you<00:02:01.700> have<00:02:01.759> it

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
phone into the case so there you have it

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.590 
phone into the case so there you have it
it<00:02:03.140> fits<00:02:03.469> really<00:02:03.799> nice<00:02:04.130> now<00:02:04.789> if<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:05.270> look<00:02:05.450> at

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
it fits really nice now if you look at

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.469 
it fits really nice now if you look at
my<00:02:06.170> other<00:02:06.380> video<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.130> speck<00:02:07.340> pixelskin<00:02:07.759> HD<00:02:07.820> I

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
my other video the speck pixelskin HD I

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.220 
my other video the speck pixelskin HD I
did<00:02:08.869> have<00:02:09.710> a<00:02:10.160> minor<00:02:10.580> gripe<00:02:10.880> then<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.990> the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
did have a minor gripe then that the the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.080 
did have a minor gripe then that the the
bottom<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.740> case<00:02:12.950> kind<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.250> sag<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.760> this

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
bottom of the case kind of sag and this

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.540 
bottom of the case kind of sag and this
is<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.450> same<00:02:14.720> issue<00:02:14.930> with<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.440> because<00:02:16.370> it's

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
is the same issue with this because it's

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.420 
is the same issue with this because it's
such<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> thin<00:02:17.950> component<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:18.980> goes<00:02:19.220> on<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
such a thin component that goes on the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.820 
such a thin component that goes on the
bottom<00:02:19.610> it's<00:02:20.000> it's<00:02:20.450> very<00:02:20.720> thin<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.290> because

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
bottom it's it's very thin and because

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.460 
bottom it's it's very thin and because
it's<00:02:21.980> not<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.460> rigid<00:02:23.180> slider<00:02:23.570> type<00:02:23.870> case<00:02:24.200> it's

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
it's not a rigid slider type case it's

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.630 
it's not a rigid slider type case it's
going<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.710> sag<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.950> little<00:02:25.310> bit<00:02:25.430> you're<00:02:25.520> going

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
going to sag a little bit you're going

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.910 
going to sag a little bit you're going
to<00:02:25.730> get<00:02:25.820> this<00:02:25.940> little<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.900> know<00:02:27.020> opening<00:02:27.530> that

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
to get this little you know opening that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.260 
to get this little you know opening that
kind<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.190> pulls<00:02:28.430> down<00:02:28.610> over<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.030> over<00:02:29.090> again

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
kind of pulls down over and over again

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.090 
kind of pulls down over and over again
when<00:02:29.480> you're<00:02:29.570> putting<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:29.930> out<00:02:30.050> in<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:30.980> out<00:02:31.040> of

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
when you're putting it out in and out of

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.450 
when you're putting it out in and out of
your<00:02:31.310> pocket<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:33.650> other<00:02:33.830> gripe<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.370> do

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
your pocket so the other gripe that I do

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.940 
your pocket so the other gripe that I do
have<00:02:34.790> with<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.240> again<00:02:35.960> I<00:02:36.200> use<00:02:36.770> this

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
have with it is again I use this

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.380 
have with it is again I use this
straight<00:02:37.370> out<00:02:37.550> pull<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.940> straight<00:02:38.210> out<00:02:38.360> of

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
straight out pull the straight out of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.820 
straight out pull the straight out of
the<00:02:38.570> box<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.870> think<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.140> measurements<00:02:42.740> are

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
the box and I think the measurements are

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.100 
the box and I think the measurements are
either<00:02:42.950> off<00:02:43.220> or<00:02:43.660> something<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.750> not<00:02:44.900> quite

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
either off or something is not quite

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.830 
either off or something is not quite
right<00:02:45.200> because<00:02:46.210> after<00:02:47.210> putting<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.570> into<00:02:47.660> the

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
right because after putting it into the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.410 
right because after putting it into the
case<00:02:48.110> putting<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.890> case<00:02:49.040> on<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.280> phone<00:02:49.550> you

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
case putting the case on the phone you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.140 
case putting the case on the phone you
can<00:02:50.660> still<00:02:50.960> feel<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.590> gives<00:02:51.980> like<00:02:52.640> on<00:02:52.880> the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
can still feel that it gives like on the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.550 
can still feel that it gives like on the
side<00:02:53.330> of<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.540> phone<00:02:53.660> doesn't<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.110> feels<00:02:54.320> loose

the phone feels a little bit loose in
the<00:02:56.180> case<00:02:56.390> which<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.930> wasn't<00:02:57.500> necessarily

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
the case which I wasn't necessarily

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.860 
the case which I wasn't necessarily
happy<00:02:58.520> with<00:02:58.700> because<00:02:58.910> every<00:02:59.240> time<00:02:59.270> I<00:02:59.420> hold<00:02:59.690> the

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
type of deal so hopefully that was just

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.210 
type of deal so hopefully that was just
just<00:03:17.240> a<00:03:17.390> one-off<00:03:17.690> type<00:03:18.230> deal<00:03:18.470> where<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.070> was

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
just a one-off type deal where it was

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.810 
just a one-off type deal where it was
just<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:21.680> know<00:03:21.710> quality<00:03:22.190> control<00:03:22.520> or

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
is kind of a neat design so there you
