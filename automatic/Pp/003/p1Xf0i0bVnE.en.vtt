00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
that much at that time because I was

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.719 
that much at that time because I was
having<00:01:20.660> quite<00:01:20.959> an<00:01:21.140> average<00:01:21.560> height<00:01:21.860> just<00:01:22.520> like

having quite an average height just like

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.639 
having quite an average height just like
my<00:01:22.880> friends<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:23.750> after<00:01:23.990> two<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.319> three<00:01:24.349> years

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
my friends so after two to three years

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.279 
my friends so after two to three years
of<00:01:24.770> working<00:01:25.069> out<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.490> went<00:01:25.849> from<00:01:26.000> 5-8<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:27.020> six

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
of working out I went from 5-8 to six

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.800 
of working out I went from 5-8 to six
months<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:28.160> that's<00:01:28.280> that's<00:01:29.060> like<00:01:29.300> five<00:01:29.599> inches

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
months so that's that's like five inches

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.870 
months so that's that's like five inches
into<00:01:30.259> root<00:01:30.530> three<00:01:30.709> years<00:01:30.950> that's<00:01:31.340> quite<00:01:31.610> a<00:01:31.640> lot

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
into root three years that's quite a lot

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.719 
into root three years that's quite a lot
and<00:01:32.030> hips<00:01:32.810> lifting<00:01:33.410> weight<00:01:33.619> was<00:01:34.099> supposed<00:01:34.489> to

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
and hips lifting weight was supposed to

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.839 
and hips lifting weight was supposed to
stop<00:01:35.450> my<00:01:35.810> high<00:01:36.050> growth<00:01:36.319> then<00:01:36.950> I<00:01:37.160> don't<00:01:37.459> think<00:01:37.729> I

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
stop my high growth then I don't think I

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:39.910 
stop my high growth then I don't think I
would<00:01:38.090> have<00:01:38.209> achieved<00:01:38.390> this<00:01:39.259> much<00:01:39.500> height<00:01:39.709> by

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
would have achieved this much height by

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.660 
would have achieved this much height by
this<00:01:39.979> time<00:01:40.429> so<00:01:41.209> my<00:01:41.390> answer<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:41.810> clearly<00:01:42.319> no

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
this time so my answer is clearly no

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.490 
this time so my answer is clearly no
weight<00:01:43.670> lifting<00:01:44.060> is<00:01:44.239> not<00:01:44.420> going<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.750> stop<00:01:45.229> or

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
weight lifting is not going to stop or

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.400 
weight lifting is not going to stop or
start<00:01:45.860> your<00:01:46.130> height<00:01:46.399> Road<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.330> can<00:01:47.509> flip
