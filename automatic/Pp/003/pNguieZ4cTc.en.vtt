today the way I tend to do things is

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.639 
today the way I tend to do things is
stop<00:00:38.969> every<00:00:39.300> five<00:00:39.570> minutes<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.320> my<00:00:40.469> phone

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
stop every five minutes and get my phone

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.990 
stop every five minutes and get my phone
out<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:41.070> every<00:00:41.309> kind<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.550> 200<00:00:42.239> 500<00:00:42.480> meters<00:00:44.000> left

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
out at every kind of 200 500 meters left

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.910 
out at every kind of 200 500 meters left
right<00:00:45.239> right<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:45.629> left<00:00:45.840> right<00:00:46.289> thing<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
right right right left right thing and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.110 
right right right left right thing and
then<00:00:47.039> probably<00:00:47.280> forget<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> whole<00:00:47.820> grid<00:00:47.969> on

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
then probably forget the whole grid on

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
then probably forget the whole grid on
the<00:00:48.149> route<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.510> then<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> get<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.050> out

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the route and then have to get it out

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.630 
the route and then have to get it out
again<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.039> felt<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.309> lot<00:00:50.489> more

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
again for this it felt a lot more

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.520 
again for this it felt a lot more
natural<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> really<00:00:51.719> intuitive<00:00:52.079> way<00:00:52.500> of

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
natural it's a really intuitive way of

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.500 
natural it's a really intuitive way of
getting<00:00:52.890> around<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.430> guided<00:00:53.850> me<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.270> kept<00:00:54.449> me

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
getting around it guided me and kept me

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.970 
getting around it guided me and kept me
on<00:00:54.660> track<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.170> allowed<00:00:55.440> me<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.620> make<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:55.949> own

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
on track but allowed me to make my own

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.170 
on track but allowed me to make my own
way<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.430> my<00:00:56.489> destination<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.300> took<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> few<00:00:58.140> more

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
way for my destination I took a few more

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.400 
way for my destination I took a few more
you<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.359> past<00:01:00.629> things<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.109> would<00:01:01.230> never

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
you go past things that you would never

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
you go past things that you would never
ordinarily<00:01:01.710> go<00:01:02.160> past<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.789> does<00:01:03.000> give<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.329> that

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
ordinarily go past it does give you that

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.539 
ordinarily go past it does give you that
sense<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.960> being<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.439> bit<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.650> an<00:01:04.739> explore<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
sense of being a bit of an explore it

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.219 
sense of being a bit of an explore it
gives<00:01:05.790> me<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> lot<00:01:06.299> more<00:01:06.360> autonomy<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.960> decide

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
gives me a lot more autonomy to decide

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.750 
gives me a lot more autonomy to decide
on<00:01:07.350> what<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.650> want<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> take<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.220> felt<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.640> I

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
on what we want to take I felt like I

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.460 
on what we want to take I felt like I
was<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> was<00:01:09.390> much<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:09.600> active<00:01:10.080> than<00:01:10.290> like

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
was I was much more active than like

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.469 
was I was much more active than like
listening<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> GMaps<00:01:11.400> says<00:01:11.640> turn<00:01:11.880> left<00:01:11.909> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
listening to GMaps says turn left and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.850 
listening to GMaps says turn left and
right<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.900> thought<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.350> kind<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.560> complete

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
right I thought that kind of complete

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.350 
right I thought that kind of complete
would<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.159> entering<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> dead<00:01:14.880> ends<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.180> lot

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
would be entering the dead ends a lot

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.080 
would be entering the dead ends a lot
and<00:01:15.600> kind<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.930> finding<00:01:16.500> ourselves

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
and kind of finding ourselves

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.340 
and kind of finding ourselves
key<00:01:17.179> problems<00:01:17.509> but<00:01:17.689> that<00:01:17.869> really<00:01:18.170> didn't

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
key problems but that really didn't

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.959 
key problems but that really didn't
happen<00:01:18.380> I've<00:01:18.829> lived<00:01:19.009> my<00:01:19.460> whole<00:01:19.490> life<00:01:19.789> so<00:01:19.909> I

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
happen I've lived my whole life so I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.270 
happen I've lived my whole life so I
know<00:01:20.030> my<00:01:20.270> way<00:01:20.299> around<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.689> bit<00:01:20.899> and<00:01:21.799> I<00:01:21.890> can<00:01:21.950> use

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
know my way around a bit and I can use

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.679 
know my way around a bit and I can use
that<00:01:22.310> combined<00:01:22.909> with<00:01:23.149> that<00:01:23.179> sense<00:01:23.570> of

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
that combined with that sense of

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.899 
that combined with that sense of
direction<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:24.229> find<00:01:24.560> where<00:01:24.770> I'm<00:01:24.829> going<00:01:25.070> it's<00:01:25.700> a

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
direction to find where I'm going it's a
