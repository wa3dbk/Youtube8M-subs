00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hey guys what's up it's Benjamin Morgan

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.150 
hey guys what's up it's Benjamin Morgan
here<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.580> I<00:00:02.850> am<00:00:03.210> here<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:04.049> teach<00:00:04.830> you<00:00:04.980> guys<00:00:05.009> how

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
here and I am here to teach you guys how

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.930 
here and I am here to teach you guys how
to<00:00:05.520> use<00:00:05.640> 3d<00:00:06.120> audio<00:00:06.299> in<00:00:06.750> blender<00:00:07.550> ever<00:00:08.550> since<00:00:08.849> I

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
to use 3d audio in blender ever since I

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.629 
to use 3d audio in blender ever since I
think<00:00:09.150> 2.5<00:00:10.019> blender<00:00:10.559> has<00:00:10.679> had<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> 3d<00:00:11.460> audio

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
think 2.5 blender has had a 3d audio

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.789 
think 2.5 blender has had a 3d audio
feature<00:00:12.030> where<00:00:12.300> basically<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:13.259> can<00:00:13.380> add<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
feature where basically you can add in a

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.220 
feature where basically you can add in a
speaker<00:00:14.099> object<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:15.210> object<00:00:15.450> will<00:00:15.990> emit

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
speaker object and that object will emit

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.880 
speaker object and that object will emit
an<00:00:16.440> audio<00:00:16.800> file<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.960> will<00:00:18.960> be<00:00:19.320> heard<00:00:19.680> by<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
an audio file that will be heard by the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.070 
an audio file that will be heard by the
camera<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:21.119> camera<00:00:21.150> will<00:00:21.660> use<00:00:21.840> its

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
camera and the camera will use its

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.640 
camera and the camera will use its
position<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.710> 3d<00:00:23.010> space<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:24.080> it<00:00:25.080> will

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
position in 3d space and it will

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.290 
position in 3d space and it will
basically<00:00:25.859> take<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.460> volume<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.939> pitch<00:00:27.060> of

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
basically take the volume and pitch of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.529 
basically take the volume and pitch of
that<00:00:27.570> object<00:00:27.810> or<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.560> audio<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.640> say<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
that object or of that audio so say the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.759 
that object or of that audio so say the
audio<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.869> very<00:00:31.050> far<00:00:31.230> away

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
audio is very far away

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.130 
audio is very far away
it'll<00:00:32.700> be<00:00:32.820> low<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> pitch<00:00:33.660> will<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.899> low

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
it'll be low and the pitch will be low

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.090 
it'll be low and the pitch will be low
but<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.620> close<00:00:34.860> up<00:00:35.130> it'll<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.730> well<00:00:37.100> it

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
but if it's close up it'll be well it

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.220 
but if it's close up it'll be well it
will<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.730> will<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:38.850> louder<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> cool

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
will it will be louder but the cool

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.040 
will it will be louder but the cool
thing<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:42.090> object<00:00:42.450> moves<00:00:42.600> baaaaa<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
thing is if the object moves baaaaa the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.510 
thing is if the object moves baaaaa the
camera<00:00:43.379> had<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> fast<00:00:43.829> rate<00:00:44.070> say<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
camera had a fast rate say like a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
camera had a fast rate say like a
racecar<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.809> get<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.050> effect<00:00:46.200> where

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
racecar you can get that effect where

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.970 
racecar you can get that effect where
it's<00:00:47.190> called<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> Doppler<00:00:47.640> effect<00:00:47.850> where<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
it's called the Doppler effect where the

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.010 
it's called the Doppler effect where the
volume<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> pitch<00:00:50.640> will<00:00:50.879> increase<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.539> it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
volume and the pitch will increase as it

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.619 
volume and the pitch will increase as it
gets<00:00:52.350> close<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.829> camera<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.340> then

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
gets close to the camera and then

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.490 
gets close to the camera and then
decrease<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.949> it<00:00:56.480> gets<00:00:57.480> farther<00:00:57.629> away<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.440> I'm

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
decrease as it gets farther away so I'm

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.450 
decrease as it gets farther away so I'm
gonna<00:00:58.590> teach<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.859> guys<00:00:58.890> how<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.160> do<00:00:59.309> that

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
gonna teach you guys how to do that

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.910 
gonna teach you guys how to do that
simple<00:00:59.730> effect<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.960> first<00:01:01.440> we're<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.800> gonna

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
simple effect so first we're just gonna

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.630 
simple effect so first we're just gonna
edit<00:01:02.699> our<00:01:02.820> cube<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> race<00:01:04.140> car<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.890> sorts

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
edit our cube to be a race car of sorts

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.179 
edit our cube to be a race car of sorts
so<00:01:05.850> we're<00:01:06.390> gonna<00:01:06.479> scale<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.049> y-axis<00:01:07.200> sy

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
so we're gonna scale it on the y-axis sy

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.399 
so we're gonna scale it on the y-axis sy
and<00:01:08.670> cab<00:01:09.479> s<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.180> box<00:01:12.180> lick<00:01:12.540> these<00:01:12.750> two<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
and cab s a and box lick these two and

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.270 
and cab s a and box lick these two and
grab<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.740> down<00:01:14.960> simple<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:16.560> grab<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.130> this

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
grab it down simple now grab it on this

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.249 
grab it down simple now grab it on this
or<00:01:17.490> scale<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.820> down<00:01:17.939> actually<00:01:18.240> press<00:01:18.840> control

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
or scale it down actually press control

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.620 
or scale it down actually press control
to<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> uniform<00:01:20.100> scale<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.580> grab<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.390> on

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
to get a uniform scale and grab it on

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.800 
to get a uniform scale and grab it on
the<00:01:21.659> z-axis<00:01:24.110> until<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.689> roughly<00:01:27.689> on

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the z-axis until you have it roughly on

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.890 
the z-axis until you have it roughly on
the<00:01:27.840> plane<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.200> doesn't<00:01:28.439> matter<00:01:28.560> okay<00:01:29.900> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the plane it doesn't matter okay the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.270 
the plane it doesn't matter okay the
cool<00:01:31.110> thing<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.770> guys<00:01:31.890> wanted<00:01:32.220> to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
cool thing is if you guys wanted to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.940 
cool thing is if you guys wanted to
figure<00:01:32.460> out<00:01:32.670> how<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.140> have<00:01:34.140> wheels<00:01:34.439> move<00:01:34.740> with

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
figure out how to have wheels move with

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
figure out how to have wheels move with
this<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.310> recently<00:01:35.610> made<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.000> tutorial<00:01:36.299> where<00:01:36.600> if

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
this I recently made a tutorial where if

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.710 
this I recently made a tutorial where if
I<00:01:37.020> were<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.380> move<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.560> racecar<00:01:38.420> wheels<00:01:39.420> would

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
I were to move this racecar wheels would

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.990 
I were to move this racecar wheels would
move<00:01:40.200> along<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.340> go<00:01:41.850> check

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
move along with it so you can go check

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.330 
move along with it so you can go check
my<00:01:42.180> channel<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.720> tutorial<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.979> called

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
my channel for that tutorial it's called

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.840 
my channel for that tutorial it's called
rigging<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.060> car<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.600> rotate<00:01:46.470> our<00:01:46.860> rigging<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
rigging a car to rotate our rigging a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.630 
rigging a car to rotate our rigging a
car<00:01:48.090> wheel<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.450> rotate<00:01:48.600> using<00:01:49.009> drivers<00:01:50.009> so

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
car wheel to rotate using drivers so

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.380 
car wheel to rotate using drivers so
anyways<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.810> little<00:01:52.020> plug<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:53.640> we're

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
anyways just a little plug so we're

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.789 
anyways just a little plug so we're
gonna<00:01:54.570> drag<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.899> cube<00:01:55.140> over<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.710> we

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
gonna drag this cube over because we

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.510 
gonna drag this cube over because we
don't<00:01:55.979> need<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.130> yet

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
don't need it yet

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.190 
don't need it yet
and<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.180> wanted<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.540> start<00:01:57.719> away<00:01:57.930> from<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and if we wanted to start away from the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.050 
and if we wanted to start away from the
camera<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.070> next<00:01:59.579> we're<00:01:59.670> gonna<00:01:59.759> add<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.000> a

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
camera and next we're gonna add in a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.719 
camera and next we're gonna add in a
plane<00:02:00.299> shift<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.810> miniature<00:02:01.380> plane<00:02:01.649> scale<00:02:02.610> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
plane shift a miniature plane scale it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.020 
plane shift a miniature plane scale it
up<00:02:03.619> next<00:02:04.619> we're<00:02:04.829> gonna<00:02:04.890> add<00:02:05.130> our<00:02:05.399> speaker

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
up next we're gonna add our speaker

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.350 
up next we're gonna add our speaker
object<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.750> shift<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.439> add

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
object so shift a add

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.740 
object so shift a add
speaker<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.850> rotation<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.480> speaker

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
speaker and the rotation of the speaker

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.220 
speaker and the rotation of the speaker
doesn't<00:02:11.930> really<00:02:12.110> matter<00:02:13.390> any<00:02:14.390> see<00:02:14.660> here<00:02:15.020> if<00:02:15.170> we

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
doesn't really matter any see here if we

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.320 
doesn't really matter any see here if we
go<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.590> speaker<00:02:15.920> object<00:02:16.310> data<00:02:16.490> properties

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
go to the speaker object data properties

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.720 
go to the speaker object data properties
we<00:02:17.930> have<00:02:17.960> an<00:02:18.350> option<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:18.740> open<00:02:19.370> up<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.550> sound

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
we have an option to open up a sound

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.050 
we have an option to open up a sound
file<00:02:19.970> I'm<00:02:20.930> not<00:02:21.410> sure<00:02:21.740> if<00:02:24.070> it<00:02:25.070> matters<00:02:25.760> really

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
file I'm not sure if it matters really

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.450 
file I'm not sure if it matters really
what<00:02:26.480> sound<00:02:26.990> file<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.440> use<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:28.010> file<00:02:28.190> I'm

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
what sound file you use the file I'm

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.770 
what sound file you use the file I'm
using<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.880> m4a<00:02:29.360> I'm<00:02:29.870> sure<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.230> WAV<00:02:30.500> or<00:02:31.090> mp3<00:02:32.090> or

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
using is m4a I'm sure a WAV or mp3 or

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.600 
using is m4a I'm sure a WAV or mp3 or
you<00:02:33.590> know<00:02:33.710> a<00:02:34.660> u3<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.690> think<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:35.990> one<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.800> think

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
you know a u3 I think is one I think

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.270 
you know a u3 I think is one I think
those<00:02:37.730> will<00:02:37.940> work<00:02:38.060> I'm<00:02:38.420> not<00:02:38.890> quite<00:02:39.890> sure<00:02:39.920> which

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
those will work I'm not quite sure which

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.980 
those will work I'm not quite sure which
one's<00:02:40.580> work<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.150> which<00:02:41.240> ones<00:02:41.330> don't<00:02:41.690> but

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
one's work and which ones don't but

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.080 
one's work and which ones don't but
right<00:02:42.560> now<00:02:42.709> I'm<00:02:42.920> using<00:02:43.070> an<00:02:43.280> m4<00:02:43.640> anywhere<00:02:44.000> it's

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
right now I'm using an m4 anywhere it's

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.500 
right now I'm using an m4 anywhere it's
fine

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
fine

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.260 
fine
so<00:02:44.900> we're<00:02:45.290> opening<00:02:45.620> opening<00:02:46.400> up<00:02:46.550> our<00:02:46.700> file<00:02:47.060> and

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
so we're opening opening up our file and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.800 
so we're opening opening up our file and
it's<00:02:47.930> important<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.440> note<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.850> this<00:02:49.850> file<00:02:50.180> if

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
it's important to note that this file if

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.699 
it's important to note that this file if
I<00:02:51.110> were<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.440> go<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.860> play<00:02:52.040> this<00:02:52.280> file<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:53.780> this

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
I were to go and play this file in this

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.210 
I were to go and play this file in this
file

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
file

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.870 
file
I<00:02:55.370> do<00:02:55.459> not<00:02:56.709> change<00:02:57.709> pitches<00:02:58.150> I<00:03:00.550> am<00:03:01.550> just<00:03:01.760> doing

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
I do not change pitches I am just doing

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.010 
I do not change pitches I am just doing
this<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.930> entire<00:03:03.140> time<00:03:04.570> yes<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:05.720> sound<00:03:05.930> very

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
this the entire time yes I sound very

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.699 
this the entire time yes I sound very
silly<00:03:06.320> but<00:03:06.620> that's<00:03:07.130> how<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.910> that's

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
silly but that's how it is and that's

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.320 
silly but that's how it is and that's
just<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.830> show<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.160> I'm<00:03:10.580> not<00:03:10.910> making

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
just to show you that I'm not making

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.270 
just to show you that I'm not making
this<00:03:11.630> affect<00:03:12.080> myself<00:03:12.470> with<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.890> audio<00:03:13.100> file

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
this affect myself with the audio file

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.449 
this affect myself with the audio file
this<00:03:13.790> is<00:03:13.970> all<00:03:14.150> in<00:03:14.299> butter<00:03:14.480> so<00:03:15.049> basically<00:03:15.860> if<00:03:16.130> we

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
this is all in butter so basically if we

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.850 
this is all in butter so basically if we
drag<00:03:16.880> this<00:03:17.000> over<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.390> our<00:03:17.510> cube<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.110> grab<00:03:18.709> it

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
drag this over to our cube and grab it

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.560 
drag this over to our cube and grab it
on<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:18.980> z-axis<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.760> rotate<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.330> on<00:03:20.480> the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
on the z-axis and rotate it on the

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.270 
on the z-axis and rotate it on the
x-axis<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:21.200> little<00:03:21.500> bit<00:03:21.620> just<00:03:21.830> for<00:03:22.130> good

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
x-axis a little bit just for good

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.860 
x-axis a little bit just for good
measure<00:03:22.340> I'll<00:03:23.150> just<00:03:23.330> make<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.540> look<00:03:23.750> good

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
measure I'll just make it look good

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.539 
measure I'll just make it look good
basically<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.840> I'm<00:03:26.959> not<00:03:27.140> sure<00:03:27.320> if<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.680> would

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
basically and I'm not sure if it would

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.220 
basically and I'm not sure if it would
be<00:03:28.700> effect<00:03:29.060> if<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.330> audio<00:03:29.540> would<00:03:29.690> be<00:03:29.780> affected

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
be effect if the audio would be affected

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.050 
be effect if the audio would be affected
if<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.440> object<00:03:31.010> if<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.459> was<00:03:31.610> inside<00:03:31.880> of<00:03:32.000> the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
if the object if it was inside of the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.130 
if the object if it was inside of the
object<00:03:32.360> or<00:03:32.420> not<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:32.690> that's<00:03:32.840> why<00:03:32.930> we're<00:03:33.080> doing

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
object or not so that's why we're doing

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.920 
object or not so that's why we're doing
this<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.860> grab<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.190> over<00:03:34.400> there<00:03:34.519> and<00:03:34.930> shift

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
this so grab it over there and shift

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.470 
this so grab it over there and shift
select<00:03:36.290> your<00:03:36.560> cube<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.070> do<00:03:37.190> control<00:03:37.549> P<00:03:37.730> object

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
select your cube and do control P object

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.520 
select your cube and do control P object
so<00:03:38.840> now<00:03:39.080> our<00:03:39.110> Q<00:03:39.799> our<00:03:40.239> speaker<00:03:41.239> will<00:03:41.450> follow<00:03:41.750> the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
so now our Q our speaker will follow the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.699 
so now our Q our speaker will follow the
car<00:03:43.360> select<00:03:44.360> your<00:03:44.480> speaker<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.019> we're<00:03:45.590> gonna

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
car select your speaker and we're gonna

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.520 
car select your speaker and we're gonna
mess<00:03:45.890> with<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:46.100> few<00:03:46.340> options<00:03:47.090> here<00:03:47.230> you'll<00:03:48.230> hear

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
mess with a few options here you'll hear

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.900 
mess with a few options here you'll hear
that<00:03:48.709> we<00:03:48.830> have<00:03:49.070> you'll<00:03:49.430> see<00:03:49.610> that<00:03:49.730> we<00:03:49.880> have

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
that we have you'll see that we have

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.590 
that we have you'll see that we have
volume<00:03:50.540> maximum<00:03:51.320> volume<00:03:52.299> attenuation<00:03:53.299> which

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
volume maximum volume attenuation which

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.970 
volume maximum volume attenuation which
basically<00:03:54.019> is<00:03:54.350> how<00:03:54.890> much<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:56.500> closeness<00:03:57.500> of

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
basically is how much the closeness of

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.910 
basically is how much the closeness of
your<00:03:58.340> object<00:03:58.790> affects<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.420> sound<00:03:59.630> so<00:04:00.080> if<00:04:00.530> it's

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
your object affects the sound so if it's

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.880 
your object affects the sound so if it's
at<00:04:01.040> one<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:02.239> max<00:04:02.420> volume<00:04:02.600> when<00:04:03.019> it's<00:04:03.200> at<00:04:03.470> this

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
at one the max volume when it's at this

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.009 
at one the max volume when it's at this
reference<00:04:04.310> point<00:04:04.430> will<00:04:05.180> be<00:04:05.329> one<00:04:05.570> but<00:04:05.870> if<00:04:05.989> you

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
reference point will be one but if you

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.560 
reference point will be one but if you
put<00:04:06.350> it<00:04:06.440> at<00:04:06.500> like<00:04:06.650> -<00:04:06.880> it's<00:04:07.880> gonna<00:04:08.090> double<00:04:08.540> the

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
put it at like - it's gonna double the

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.020 
put it at like - it's gonna double the
volume<00:04:08.750> that<00:04:09.350> it<00:04:09.590> would<00:04:09.709> normally<00:04:09.829> be<00:04:10.100> at<00:04:10.579> this

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
volume that it would normally be at this

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.090 
volume that it would normally be at this
reference<00:04:11.269> point<00:04:11.480> which<00:04:11.959> brings<00:04:12.230> us<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.709> this

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
reference point which brings us to this

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.030 
reference point which brings us to this
reference<00:04:13.370> point<00:04:13.610> right<00:04:14.570> now<00:04:14.600> I<00:04:15.079> think<00:04:15.530> that's

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
reference point right now I think that's

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.659 
reference point right now I think that's
in<00:04:16.160> blender<00:04:16.400> units<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:18.320> if<00:04:18.680> it's<00:04:18.919> one<00:04:19.340> blender

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
in blender units so if it's one blender

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.580 
in blender units so if it's one blender
unit<00:04:19.910> away<00:04:20.060> it's<00:04:20.359> gonna<00:04:20.539> be<00:04:20.630> at<00:04:21.020> its<00:04:21.289> maximum

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
unit away it's gonna be at its maximum

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.570 
unit away it's gonna be at its maximum
volume

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
volume

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.240 
volume
but<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:23.479> distance<00:04:23.870> from<00:04:24.169> here<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.710> here<00:04:24.800> is

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
but the distance from here to here is

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.580 
but the distance from here to here is
more<00:04:26.210> than<00:04:26.330> one<00:04:26.479> blender<00:04:26.720> unit<00:04:26.960> it's<00:04:27.289> about

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
more than one blender unit it's about

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.209 
more than one blender unit it's about
ten<00:04:28.069> so<00:04:28.729> if<00:04:29.060> we<00:04:29.300> select<00:04:29.509> our<00:04:29.810> speaker<00:04:30.259> unit<00:04:30.650> and

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:31.219 
ten so if we select our speaker unit and

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:34.659 
ten so if we select our speaker unit and
set<00:04:31.879> a<00:04:31.909> reference<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.539> I<00:04:32.810> don't<00:04:32.960> know<00:04:33.050> ten<00:04:33.669> it

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
set a reference to I don't know ten it

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.339 
set a reference to I don't know ten it
will<00:04:35.770> make<00:04:36.770> it<00:04:36.919> so<00:04:36.949> that<00:04:37.250> when<00:04:37.520> this<00:04:37.699> cube

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
will make it so that when this cube

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.860 
will make it so that when this cube
eventually<00:04:39.349> drives<00:04:39.650> by<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:41.300> will<00:04:41.509> be<00:04:41.629> the

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
eventually drives by that will be the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.689 
eventually drives by that will be the
maximum<00:04:42.050> point<00:04:42.680> at<00:04:42.860> which<00:04:43.009> the<00:04:43.219> audio<00:04:43.460> is

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
maximum point at which the audio is

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.600 
maximum point at which the audio is
found<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:45.110> we're<00:04:45.800> gonna<00:04:45.919> have<00:04:46.099> to<00:04:46.129> animate<00:04:46.520> the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
found so we're gonna have to animate the

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.550 
found so we're gonna have to animate the
scoop<00:04:46.819> a<00:04:46.909> little<00:04:46.939> bit<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:47.629> let's<00:04:48.080> put<00:04:48.530> our

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
scoop a little bit so let's put our

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.850 
scoop a little bit so let's put our
endpoint<00:04:49.069> at<00:04:49.219> a<00:04:49.280> hundred<00:04:49.729> for<00:04:50.090> this<00:04:50.180> animation

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
endpoint at a hundred for this animation

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.429 
endpoint at a hundred for this animation
press<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:52.069> to<00:04:52.189> insert<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.120> location<00:04:53.599> keyframe<00:04:53.990> go

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439 
press I to insert a location keyframe go

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.980 
press I to insert a location keyframe go
to<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.650> end<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.490> grab<00:04:55.940> it<00:04:56.030> on<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.150> y-axis<00:04:56.360> and

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
to the end and grab it on the y-axis and

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.619 
to the end and grab it on the y-axis and
press<00:04:57.770> I<00:04:57.949> to<00:04:58.039> insert<00:04:58.669> a<00:04:58.729> location<00:04:59.120> keyframe<00:04:59.419> so

00:04:59.619 --> 00:04:59.629 
press I to insert a location keyframe so

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.510 
press I to insert a location keyframe so
now<00:05:00.169> if<00:05:00.440> you<00:05:00.530> scrub<00:05:00.770> through<00:05:00.949> you'll<00:05:01.190> see<00:05:01.280> that

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
now if you scrub through you'll see that

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.260 
now if you scrub through you'll see that
we<00:05:01.639> have<00:05:01.759> our<00:05:01.909> car<00:05:02.150> whizzing<00:05:02.930> by<00:05:03.080> our<00:05:03.440> camera

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
we have our car whizzing by our camera

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.240 
we have our car whizzing by our camera
okay<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:05.539> now<00:05:05.659> if<00:05:05.930> we<00:05:05.960> go<00:05:06.259> look<00:05:06.830> at<00:05:06.949> our<00:05:07.039> camera

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
okay so now if we go look at our camera

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.219 
okay so now if we go look at our camera
and<00:05:07.610> we<00:05:07.759> press<00:05:07.969> play<00:05:10.539> it<00:05:11.539> sounds<00:05:11.750> like<00:05:11.870> a<00:05:11.900> robot

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
and we press play it sounds like a robot

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.779 
and we press play it sounds like a robot
and<00:05:12.949> that's<00:05:13.039> because<00:05:13.340> we<00:05:13.430> don't<00:05:13.580> have<00:05:13.639> her

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
and that's because we don't have her

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.249 
and that's because we don't have her
speaker<00:05:14.120> object<00:05:14.449> selected<00:05:14.779> so<00:05:14.930> make<00:05:15.080> sure<00:05:15.169> you

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
speaker object selected so make sure you

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.499 
speaker object selected so make sure you
have<00:05:15.379> your<00:05:15.469> speaker<00:05:15.710> object<00:05:16.099> selected<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:16.639> it

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
have your speaker object selected and it

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:23.499 
have your speaker object selected and it
should<00:05:17.750> automatically<00:05:18.169> playback<00:05:22.300> inside<00:05:23.300> of

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
should automatically playback inside of

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.980 
should automatically playback inside of
our<00:05:24.610> animation<00:05:25.610> so<00:05:25.729> that's<00:05:25.909> pretty<00:05:26.029> cool<00:05:26.210> one

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
our animation so that's pretty cool one

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.869 
our animation so that's pretty cool one
thing<00:05:27.139> we<00:05:27.229> can<00:05:27.379> do<00:05:27.529> is<00:05:27.800> increase<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.400> pitch<00:05:28.699> of

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:28.879 
thing we can do is increase the pitch of

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.959 
thing we can do is increase the pitch of
me<00:05:29.029> because<00:05:29.419> I<00:05:29.449> had<00:05:29.810> a<00:05:30.080> very<00:05:30.349> low<00:05:31.340> monotone<00:05:31.550> so

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
me because I had a very low monotone so

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:33.399 
me because I had a very low monotone so
that<00:05:32.120> I<00:05:32.150> would<00:05:32.300> be<00:05:32.419> able<00:05:32.509> to<00:05:32.750> get<00:05:33.050> more<00:05:33.259> of<00:05:33.319> a

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
that I would be able to get more of a

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:38.200 
that I would be able to get more of a
higher<00:05:33.620> pitch<00:05:33.860> later<00:05:34.159> so<00:05:34.669> if<00:05:34.759> we<00:05:34.849> press<00:05:35.029> play

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.600 

you'd<00:05:39.210> even<00:05:39.420> do<00:05:39.510> him<00:05:39.660> even<00:05:40.170> higher<00:05:40.290> than<00:05:40.470> that

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.010 

it<00:05:44.610> kind<00:05:44.820> of<00:05:44.910> kind<00:05:45.240> of<00:05:45.300> sounds<00:05:45.540> like<00:05:45.660> something

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
it kind of kind of sounds like something

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.340 
it kind of kind of sounds like something
you'd<00:05:46.140> hear<00:05:46.260> in<00:05:46.380> Star<00:05:46.650> Wars<00:05:46.860> or<00:05:46.890> something<00:05:48.350> so

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
you'd hear in Star Wars or something so

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.800 
you'd hear in Star Wars or something so
that's<00:05:49.530> cool<00:05:49.740> but<00:05:50.460> maybe<00:05:50.760> if<00:05:50.970> we<00:05:51.120> increase<00:05:51.420> the

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
that's cool but maybe if we increase the

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.840 
that's cool but maybe if we increase the
attenuation<00:05:52.530> a<00:05:52.710> bit<00:05:52.830> more<00:05:53.010> you<00:05:53.340> understand

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
attenuation a bit more you understand

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.060 
attenuation a bit more you understand
what<00:05:53.940> I<00:05:53.970> was<00:05:54.120> talking<00:05:54.330> about<00:05:54.360> before<00:05:57.980> so<00:05:58.980> you

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
what I was talking about before so you

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.460 
what I was talking about before so you
can<00:05:59.160> hear<00:05:59.340> that<00:05:59.370> it<00:05:59.700> gets<00:05:59.850> a<00:06:00.030> lot<00:06:00.270> louder<00:06:00.470> even

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
can hear that it gets a lot louder even

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.170 
can hear that it gets a lot louder even
you'd<00:06:01.860> notice<00:06:02.280> even<00:06:02.400> more<00:06:02.640> if<00:06:02.730> we<00:06:02.820> increase<00:06:03.060> it

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
you'd notice even more if we increase it

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.960 
you'd notice even more if we increase it
to<00:06:03.270> five<00:06:06.740> if<00:06:07.740> you<00:06:07.800> imagine<00:06:08.040> the<00:06:08.370> sound<00:06:08.670> right

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
to five if you imagine the sound right

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.540 
to five if you imagine the sound right
now<00:06:09.120> as<00:06:09.360> a<00:06:09.390> curve<00:06:09.900> the<00:06:10.500> curve<00:06:10.800> was<00:06:10.920> sharper<00:06:11.400> as

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
now as a curve the curve was sharper as

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.160 
now as a curve the curve was sharper as
it<00:06:11.730> got<00:06:11.820> closer<00:06:12.120> to<00:06:12.240> the<00:06:12.330> camera<00:06:12.780> it<00:06:12.840> went<00:06:13.080> up

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
it got closer to the camera it went up

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.830 
it got closer to the camera it went up
sharper<00:06:13.560> and<00:06:13.740> it<00:06:13.830> went<00:06:14.190> down<00:06:14.370> even<00:06:15.180> sharper<00:06:15.540> so

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
sharper and it went down even sharper so

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.000 
sharper and it went down even sharper so
that's<00:06:16.710> what<00:06:16.950> attenuation<00:06:17.520> is<00:06:18.800> that's<00:06:19.800> what

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
that's what attenuation is that's what

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.110 
that's what attenuation is that's what
intonation<00:06:20.280> does<00:06:21.110> okay<00:06:22.110> so<00:06:22.830> now<00:06:23.490> we<00:06:23.550> have<00:06:23.700> this

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
intonation does okay so now we have this

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.710 
intonation does okay so now we have this
all<00:06:24.480> set<00:06:24.540> up<00:06:25.080> and<00:06:25.730> say<00:06:26.730> we<00:06:26.880> want<00:06:27.030> to<00:06:27.150> render<00:06:27.390> our

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
all set up and say we want to render our

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.660 
all set up and say we want to render our
scene<00:06:28.080> I've<00:06:28.980> actually<00:06:29.130> never<00:06:29.400> done<00:06:29.640> a

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
scene I've actually never done a

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.040 
scene I've actually never done a
tutorial<00:06:29.880> on<00:06:30.180> rendering<00:06:30.450> so<00:06:30.600> I<00:06:30.630> guess<00:06:30.810> this<00:06:30.930> is

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
tutorial on rendering so I guess this is

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.860 
tutorial on rendering so I guess this is
a<00:06:31.080> good<00:06:31.230> introduction<00:06:32.120> if<00:06:33.120> we<00:06:33.390> press<00:06:33.570> render

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
a good introduction if we press render

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.360 
a good introduction if we press render
animation<00:06:34.260> right<00:06:34.380> now<00:06:34.500> we're<00:06:34.800> only<00:06:34.980> gonna<00:06:35.220> get

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
animation right now we're only gonna get

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.120 
animation right now we're only gonna get
a<00:06:35.430> series<00:06:35.880> of<00:06:35.910> PNG<00:06:36.630> images<00:06:37.080> and<00:06:37.380> that's<00:06:37.980> not

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
a series of PNG images and that's not

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.190 
a series of PNG images and that's not
what<00:06:38.280> we<00:06:38.430> want<00:06:38.610> we<00:06:38.700> want<00:06:38.820> in<00:06:39.180> a<00:06:39.360> video<00:06:39.870> that

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
what we want we want in a video that

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.950 
what we want we want in a video that
will<00:06:40.470> have<00:06:41.040> audio<00:06:41.370> encoding<00:06:41.790> with<00:06:42.090> it<00:06:42.210> so<00:06:42.780> if

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
will have audio encoding with it so if

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.770 
will have audio encoding with it so if
we<00:06:43.200> select<00:06:43.940> h.264<00:06:44.940> which<00:06:45.120> is<00:06:45.360> what<00:06:45.540> I<00:06:45.570> usually

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
we select h.264 which is what I usually

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.920 
we select h.264 which is what I usually
encode<00:06:46.530> with<00:06:46.710> because<00:06:47.040> it<00:06:47.190> gives<00:06:47.430> low<00:06:47.930> file

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
encode with because it gives low file

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.430 
encode with because it gives low file
sizes<00:06:49.440> and<00:06:49.620> still<00:06:50.460> good<00:06:50.610> quality<00:06:51.290> we<00:06:52.290> will

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
sizes and still good quality we will

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.900 
sizes and still good quality we will
have<00:06:52.590> a<00:06:52.620> movie<00:06:53.070> format<00:06:53.640> that<00:06:53.940> will<00:06:54.210> basically

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
have a movie format that will basically

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.150 
have a movie format that will basically
be<00:06:56.910> able<00:06:57.000> to<00:06:57.150> hold<00:06:57.300> audio<00:06:57.750> so<00:06:58.410> if<00:06:58.440> we<00:06:58.860> go<00:06:58.980> down

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
be able to hold audio so if we go down

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.710 
be able to hold audio so if we go down
here<00:06:59.400> to<00:06:59.430> encoding<00:07:00.030> you'll<00:07:00.180> see<00:07:00.360> that<00:07:00.480> we<00:07:00.690> have

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
here to encoding you'll see that we have

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.740 
here to encoding you'll see that we have
presets<00:07:01.200> and<00:07:01.410> it<00:07:01.860> is<00:07:02.460> actually<00:07:02.700> storing<00:07:03.360> it

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
presets and it is actually storing it

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.520 
presets and it is actually storing it
has<00:07:04.440> an<00:07:04.650> audio<00:07:05.040> file<00:07:05.930> it<00:07:06.930> has<00:07:07.080> an<00:07:07.200> audio

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
has an audio file it has an audio

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.010 
has an audio file it has an audio
channel<00:07:08.130> that<00:07:08.670> you<00:07:08.760> can<00:07:08.790> store<00:07:09.240> audio<00:07:09.570> on<00:07:09.750> and

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
channel that you can store audio on and

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.720 
channel that you can store audio on and
the<00:07:10.350> audio<00:07:10.710> that<00:07:10.980> currently<00:07:11.340> is<00:07:11.520> in<00:07:11.640> the

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:11.730 
the audio that currently is in the

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.520 
the audio that currently is in the
blender<00:07:11.970> scene<00:07:12.180> will<00:07:12.870> be<00:07:12.900> put<00:07:13.230> into<00:07:13.410> this

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
blender scene will be put into this

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.720 
blender scene will be put into this
channel<00:07:13.740> automatically<00:07:14.340> so<00:07:14.520> you<00:07:14.580> don't

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:14.730 
channel automatically so you don't

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:15.920 
channel automatically so you don't
really<00:07:15.030> have<00:07:15.120> to<00:07:15.270> do<00:07:15.360> anything<00:07:15.630> all<00:07:15.750> you<00:07:15.840> have

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
really have to do anything all you have

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.830 
really have to do anything all you have
to<00:07:16.020> do<00:07:16.110> is<00:07:16.260> select<00:07:16.520> h.264<00:07:17.520> and<00:07:17.910> blender<00:07:18.690> will

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
to do is select h.264 and blender will

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.710 
to do is select h.264 and blender will
automatically<00:07:19.380> render<00:07:19.650> the<00:07:19.740> audio<00:07:20.600> for<00:07:21.600> you

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
automatically render the audio for you

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.780 
automatically render the audio for you
and<00:07:22.020> of<00:07:22.680> course<00:07:22.740> set<00:07:23.160> the<00:07:23.250> output<00:07:23.430> is

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:23.790 
and of course set the output is

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.790 
and of course set the output is
something<00:07:24.150> that<00:07:24.360> you<00:07:24.570> will<00:07:24.780> be<00:07:25.410> able<00:07:25.470> to<00:07:25.590> find

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 
something that you will be able to find

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.650 
something that you will be able to find
played<00:07:26.010> other<00:07:26.280> than<00:07:26.520> TMP<00:07:26.940> that's<00:07:27.180> not<00:07:27.420> a<00:07:27.450> very

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 
played other than TMP that's not a very

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.650 
played other than TMP that's not a very
good<00:07:27.840> default<00:07:28.230> output<00:07:29.210> but<00:07:30.210> yeah<00:07:30.390> you<00:07:30.450> can

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 
good default output but yeah you can

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.570 
good default output but yeah you can
change<00:07:31.020> the<00:07:31.230> bitrate<00:07:31.470> you<00:07:31.830> can<00:07:31.980> change<00:07:32.250> the

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 
change the bitrate you can change the

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.580 
change the bitrate you can change the
volume<00:07:32.790> of<00:07:33.150> it<00:07:33.300> the<00:07:33.540> codec<00:07:34.320> you<00:07:34.500> can<00:07:34.650> change<00:07:36.590> so

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:37.590 
volume of it the codec you can change so

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.030 
volume of it the codec you can change so
yeah<00:07:37.830> that's<00:07:38.700> pretty<00:07:39.150> much<00:07:39.540> it<00:07:39.810> thank<00:07:40.770> you<00:07:40.830> for
