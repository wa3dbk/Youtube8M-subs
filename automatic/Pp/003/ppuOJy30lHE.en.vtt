00:00:05.186 --> 00:00:10.744
 This video shows you how to create system recovery disks for your HP computer with Windows 8. 

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:15.882
 Recovery disks contain backup files for the original operating system, 

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:19.786
 As well as the drivers and software applications that came with the computer. 

00:00:20.299 --> 00:00:22.620
 If you need to do a system recovery, 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:30.463
 But the recovery data on your hard disk drive is a phone you can use recovery media to restore your computer to its original state. 

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:35.371
 It's important to know that you can create recovery media only once. 

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:45.545
 Your computer has two options for creating recovery media: a USB flash drive or writeable DVD. 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:53.486
 This video demonstrates how you can create a picture that is recoverable by a DVD. Use blank, writeable DVDs. 

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:59.726
 For best results, HP recommends using DVD + R discs. 

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:06.065
 Recovery information is very important It is helpful to use a DVD company to trust it. 

00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:09.803
 Before you begin, you must prepare your computer for the process. 

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:16.709
 Close Internet Explorer and disconnect your computer from the Internet first: 

00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:21.014
 If your computer is connected to a cable, separate it. 

00:01:21.474 --> 00:01:25.785
 If your computer uses wireless connectivity, press the wireless key. 

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:30.890
 This action makes your computer in flight mode, which disrupts its wireless capabilities. 

00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:33.395
 Close all other programs. 

00:01:39.146 --> 00:01:44.790
 The computer should not be used for any other task while creating recovery disks. 

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:49.709
 Launch the Recovery Disk Creation process by opening Recovery Manager. 

00:01:50.608 --> 00:01:55.682
 To do this, press the Windows key and the Q key to open the Applications menu. 

00:01:56.343 --> 00:02:00.817
 Type "Recovery Manager" in the Search field and click on Recovery Manager. 

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:07.393
 Choose Create Recovery Media. 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.403
 If you see a message saying "You are only allowed to create one set of recovery media," click "I agree." Click 'Continue.' 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:23.409
 The following window prompts you for the recovery media you will use. 

00:02:23.673 --> 00:02:27.514
 If you want to use a USB flash drive for recovery media, 

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:35.755
 Insert the USB flash drive. Recovery Manager discovers the drive that pops up the USB flash drive box on the screen. 

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:40.059
 Note that the minimum required size appears on the screen as well. 

00:02:40.818 --> 00:02:48.601
 From here you will follow the instructions on the screen. In this example we will create a recovery DVD. 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.108
 Note the number of disks required because you will need them to complete the recovery disks creation process. 

00:02:55.896 --> 00:02:57.582
 Before inserting discs, 

00:02:57.582 --> 00:03:04.083
 It would be useful to use a fixed disk-addressing pen to back up the ZOOM to use for system recovery. 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.064
 Insert the first disk and close the drive. 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.196
 Recovery Manager will discover the media. 

00:03:17.912 --> 00:03:23.603
 A window will open showing the disc type and number of disks required. Click Yes. 

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:27.740
 Another window will appear indicating the status of the process. 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:36.082
 This includes: disk input, data processing, data burning and disk status checking. 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.587
 It is important not to interrupt the recovery process after it is initiated. 

00:03:41.293 --> 00:03:48.127
 Wait until you see a message that the disk was successfully created and the drive opens. 

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:54.167
 If you are prompted to insert another disk, insert it into the drive and click OK. 

00:04:03.703 --> 00:04:08.281
 Repeat these steps until all recovery disks have been created successfully. 

00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:14.420
 After you create the last disc, click OK to complete the process. 

00:04:19.713 --> 00:04:26.332
 After all the required disks have been successfully created, verify that each of them is correct. 

00:04:27.253 --> 00:04:32.572
 Keep all discs in one package when storing them. It is important to protect those disks. 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.618
 Store them in a safe place away from direct sunlight. 

00:04:40.268 --> 00:04:45.918
 If these discs are lost or damaged, you will need to contact HP for other discs. 

00:04:49.232 --> 00:04:55.862
