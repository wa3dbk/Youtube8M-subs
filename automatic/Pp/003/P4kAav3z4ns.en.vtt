 defense and to tell you that's at 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.300
 Croatian frozen once again returned 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.129
 direct the first time to tell you 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.059
 I was in private and once I had 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.949
 found this big europe 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.300
 I launched a part we search on 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.470
 stumbled on this map and then that's it 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.479
 I was with members of the team but 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.949
 my little brother and some drinking and 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:45.019
 then ben I make them very direct she 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.760
 was shocked that I arrived right away 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.199
 to enter this big step so finally 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.969
 In short, we immediately went to the most 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.100
 early so you 'll start with 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.660
 put yourself on your left for you 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.920
 place in this corner once that is 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.890
 do you 're going to put your tomahawk 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.620
 like this so in fact I do not know if 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.960
 you see, we can see a little bit 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.699
 sky just below first metal on 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.990
 see a tiny piece of heaven and well 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.630
 you're going to put your thomas just 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.130
 right there then you 've lifted a whole 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.720
 little bit so that it just happens to 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.210
 above the metal bar and then 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.429
 you threw your top to enter a 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.050
 beautiful crossbar so can you go 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.960
 see where the tomahawk will go good and 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.970
 with one person but ways either 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.170
 they pass below the boat so this 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.369
 which is impossible to return from crisis 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.250
 fit when they pass below the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.619
 boat or he's going to the left side 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.450
 or on the right hand side of forgiveness 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.070
 boat so here I am on the side 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.490
 coach and it hits the mark so much better 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.649
 for me 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.049

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.570
