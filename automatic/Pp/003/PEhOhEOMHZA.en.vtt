 better for the red team that opened the board 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.240
 the right-back James days crossed 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.720
 and the striker kléber pereira rose more than behind 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.340
 and sent the ball to the goal with the result the scarpotter team 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.940

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.489
 thereby 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.360
 the young Mogi began to take a 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.210
 and the cléber goalkeeper became the highlight of the match with important defenses 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.790
 but after 36 minutes the defender Eduardo failed 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:04.689
 and scored goal against with the draw the white river was animated and continued 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:05.729
 pressing 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.490

 we were able to do 1 to 0 unfortunately 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.630
 arbitration ended up complicating us and in a grotesque way 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.570
 and in the last move and then I ended up leaving trying to help and out of the area 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.090
 gian player's head in a normal shock form a fault for 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.480
 yellow card expelled me causing plenty there that we 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.040
 impaired said 2 to 1 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.420
 but to say the average-footage ended up complicating the way we deserve this 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.190
 result

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:11.099
 an 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.129
 as a Swiss day player 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.109
