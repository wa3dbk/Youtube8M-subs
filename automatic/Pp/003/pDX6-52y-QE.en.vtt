there's other areas in the plan itself

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.480 
there's other areas in the plan itself
so<00:01:58.200> pretty<00:01:58.469> much<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.920> students<00:01:59.250> are<00:01:59.369> then

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
so pretty much the students are then

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.959 
so pretty much the students are then
directed<00:01:59.670> to<00:02:00.149> post<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.570> their<00:02:00.719> group<00:02:00.960> findings

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
directed to post to their group findings

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.090 
directed to post to their group findings
in<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.210> d2l<00:02:03.719> discussion<00:02:04.200> forum<00:02:04.860> their

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
in the d2l discussion forum their

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.469 
in the d2l discussion forum their
classmates<00:02:05.579> can<00:02:05.759> then<00:02:05.939> compare<00:02:06.299> their

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
classmates can then compare their

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.190 
classmates can then compare their
findings<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.170> discussions<00:02:07.680> and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
findings and discussions and

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.949 
findings and discussions and
Frances<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.849> classifications<00:02:09.849> they're<00:02:10.629> also

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
Frances and classifications they're also

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.199 
Frances and classifications they're also
asked<00:02:11.379> to<00:02:11.489> discuss<00:02:12.489> their<00:02:12.730> thoughts<00:02:12.760> on

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
asked to discuss their thoughts on

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.240 
asked to discuss their thoughts on
disaster<00:02:13.870> management<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.680> potential

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
disaster management and potential

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.970 
disaster management and potential
sources<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.959> support<00:02:16.959> during<00:02:17.260> disaster

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
sources of support during disaster

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.949 
sources of support during disaster
situations<00:02:18.670> there<00:02:19.330> will<00:02:19.480> be<00:02:19.510> more<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.930> follow

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
situations there will be more to follow

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.059 
situations there will be more to follow
as<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:20.950> continue<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.459> utilize<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:23.069> second
