catch on so when Fernan came over to
America<00:01:08.600> vodka<00:01:09.600> was<00:01:09.840> harder<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.260> find<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.369> so

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
America vodka was harder to find and so

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.390 
America vodka was harder to find and so
he<00:01:11.700> started<00:01:12.060> making<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.479> drink<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.869> gin

he started making the drink with gin

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.789 
he started making the drink with gin
instead<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.490> vodka<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.590> red

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
