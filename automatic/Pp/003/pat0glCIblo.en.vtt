these<00:00:04.920> are<00:00:05.069> mechanical<00:00:05.190> toys<00:00:05.730> here<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:07.140> a

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
these are mechanical toys here is a

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
these are mechanical toys here is a
little<00:00:07.560> propeller<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:09.300> has<00:00:09.480> three<00:00:10.370> blades

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
little propeller and it has three blades

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.360 
little propeller and it has three blades
and<00:00:11.820> they<00:00:12.660> are<00:00:12.840> pitched<00:00:13.139> in<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.650> very<00:00:13.860> certain

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
and they are pitched in a very certain

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.200 
and they are pitched in a very certain
way<00:00:15.020> now<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.049> have<00:00:16.560> wound<00:00:16.890> up<00:00:17.369> all<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.850> one<00:00:18.060> is

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
way now I have wound up all that one is

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.210 
way now I have wound up all that one is
wound<00:00:18.500> let<00:00:19.500> me<00:00:19.590> take<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.210> yeah<00:00:21.710> what<00:00:25.220> what

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
wound let me take that yeah what what

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.250 
wound let me take that yeah what what
what<00:00:26.519> am<00:00:26.609> i<00:00:26.699> doing<00:00:27.060> oh<00:00:27.210> there's<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> little

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
what am i doing oh there's a little

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.209 
what am i doing oh there's a little
trouble<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.740> spring<00:00:29.720> uh-huh<00:00:30.980> uh-huh<00:00:32.009> I

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
trouble with that spring uh-huh uh-huh I

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.670 
trouble with that spring uh-huh uh-huh I
have<00:00:32.820> stored<00:00:33.149> some<00:00:33.329> twist<00:00:33.930> energy<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
have stored some twist energy in a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.660 
have stored some twist energy in a
spring<00:00:35.030> when<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.059> release<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.960> will<00:00:36.989> unwind

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
spring when I release it it will unwind

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.410 
spring when I release it it will unwind
and<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:39.059> propeller<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:41.129> go<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.700> why

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and that propeller is going to go up why

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.549 
and that propeller is going to go up why
the<00:00:43.170> blade<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.680> pitched<00:00:44.360> so<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.320> whole

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the blade is pitched so as the whole

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.360 
the blade is pitched so as the whole
wheel<00:00:47.160> turns<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.480> blade<00:00:48.750> grabs<00:00:49.289> Samir<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:50.100> we

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
wheel turns the blade grabs Samir as we

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.270 
wheel turns the blade grabs Samir as we
would<00:00:50.579> say<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.270> pushes<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.199> air<00:00:52.379> down<00:00:52.890> and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
would say and pushes the air down and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.860 
would say and pushes the air down and
that's<00:00:53.730> why<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.000> goes<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> bird<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.309> fly

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
that's why it goes up so a bird can fly

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.709 
that's why it goes up so a bird can fly
only<00:00:57.870> because<00:00:58.440> he<00:00:58.980> pushes<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.730> air<00:00:59.940> down<00:01:00.329> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
only because he pushes the air down and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.349 
only because he pushes the air down and
he<00:01:00.930> goes<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.460> conservation<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.550> momentum<00:01:02.730> we

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
he goes up conservation of momentum we

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.100 
he goes up conservation of momentum we
call<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.780> watch<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.760> there<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.960> of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
call it watch it there it is and of

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.620 
call it watch it there it is and of
course<00:01:07.140> there<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> spinning<00:01:08.280> top<00:01:08.630> which

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
course there I have a spinning top which

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.929 
course there I have a spinning top which
I<00:01:09.810> could<00:01:10.020> talk<00:01:10.170> about<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.650> an<00:01:10.740> hour<00:01:10.830> let<00:01:11.640> me<00:01:11.760> do

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
I could talk about for an hour let me do

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:12.710 
I could talk about for an hour let me do
another<00:01:12.330> one

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
another one

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.330 
another one
Oh<00:01:15.650> watch<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.830> now<00:01:16.979> watch<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.729> oh<00:01:19.220> there<00:01:20.220> it

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
Oh watch it now watch it oh there it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.179 
Oh watch it now watch it oh there it
comes<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> spinning<00:01:22.650> top<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
comes and we have a spinning top on the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.450 
comes and we have a spinning top on the
floor<00:01:23.540> which<00:01:24.540> perhaps<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.530> caught<00:01:25.890> by<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
floor which perhaps can be caught by the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.569 
floor which perhaps can be caught by the
camera<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.000> that's<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.450> very<00:01:27.659> good<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.049> then

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
camera and that's all very good and then

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.499 
camera and that's all very good and then
okay<00:01:29.630> mechanical<00:01:30.630> choice<00:01:31.140> another<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.509> here

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
okay mechanical choice another one here

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.410 
okay mechanical choice another one here
is<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> wonderful<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.619> don't<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.180> play

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
is a wonderful one I don't like to play

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.950 
is a wonderful one I don't like to play
much<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:36.810> weapons<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.920> war<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.570> have

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
much with weapons of war so you have

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.760 
much with weapons of war so you have
once<00:01:40.500> detected<00:01:41.130> my<00:01:41.310> philosophy<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:43.530> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
once detected my philosophy but this is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.539 
once detected my philosophy but this is
rather<00:01:43.979> harmless<00:01:44.450> here<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> hollow<00:01:46.290> chamber

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
rather harmless here is a hollow chamber

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.990 
rather harmless here is a hollow chamber
in<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.820> shape<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.329> gun<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.920> chamber<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.700> as

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
in the shape of a gun the chamber is as

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.870 
in the shape of a gun the chamber is as
one<00:01:51.180> would<00:01:51.390> say<00:01:51.630> now<00:01:51.869> empty<00:01:52.560> oh<00:01:52.740> no<00:01:53.340> no<00:01:53.520> it's

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
one would say now empty oh no no it's

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.940 
one would say now empty oh no no it's
filled<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.210> air<00:01:54.420> filled<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
filled with air filled with that and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.389 
filled with air filled with that and
here<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> ping<00:01:56.640> pong<00:01:56.670> ball<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:58.040> I<00:01:59.040> put<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
here is a ping pong ball and I put the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.959 
here is a ping pong ball and I put the
ball<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.880> there<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:01.380> now<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.710> squeeze<00:02:02.430> suddenly

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
ball in there and now I squeeze suddenly

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.520 
ball in there and now I squeeze suddenly
on<00:02:03.149> here<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:05.130> ball<00:02:05.340> emerges<00:02:06.200> indeed<00:02:07.200> I

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
on here and the ball emerges indeed I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.279 
on here and the ball emerges indeed I
have<00:02:08.190> made<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.700> very<00:02:08.940> profound<00:02:09.270> experiment<00:02:10.200> out

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
have made a very profound experiment out

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.100 
have made a very profound experiment out
of<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.730> if<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.120> shoot

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
of this if I shoot

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.540 
of this if I shoot
ball<00:02:13.290> at<00:02:14.100> some<00:02:14.610> angle<00:02:15.170> with<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.350> horizontal

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
ball at some angle with the horizontal

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.070 
ball at some angle with the horizontal
and<00:02:17.550> then<00:02:17.910> at<00:02:18.060> another<00:02:18.180> angle<00:02:18.810> with<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
and then at another angle with the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.170 
and then at another angle with the
horizontal<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:20.040> then<00:02:20.340> at<00:02:20.520> another<00:02:20.910> angle

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
horizontal and then at another angle

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.170 
horizontal and then at another angle
with<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.570> horizontal<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:22.380> find<00:02:23.160> very<00:02:23.520> nearly

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
with the horizontal I find very nearly

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.730 
with the horizontal I find very nearly
the<00:02:24.540> following<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:26.010> quite<00:02:26.220> amazing

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
the following and this is quite amazing

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.820 
the following and this is quite amazing
if<00:02:28.740> one<00:02:29.130> shot<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.360> projectile<00:02:31.050> like<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:31.560> and

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
if one shot a projectile like that and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.790 
if one shot a projectile like that and
it<00:02:31.950> took<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.400> flight<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.900> question<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.530> when

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
it took this flight the question is when

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.910 
it took this flight the question is when
would<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.250> expect<00:02:35.670> maximum<00:02:36.390> range<00:02:36.920> well

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
would you expect maximum range well

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.820 
would you expect maximum range well
theoretically<00:02:38.540> maximum<00:02:39.540> range<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.110> at<00:02:40.260> 45

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
theoretically maximum range is at 45

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.449 
theoretically maximum range is at 45
degrees<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:43.080> we<00:02:43.620> can<00:02:43.830> show<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.070> with

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
degrees and so we can show that with

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.490 
degrees and so we can show that with
this<00:02:44.670> toy<00:02:45.020> now<00:02:46.020> there<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.380> another

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
this toy now there is another

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.270 
this toy now there is another
interesting<00:02:47.370> problem<00:02:48.020> Galileo<00:02:49.020> showed<00:02:49.280> that

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
interesting problem Galileo showed that

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.690 
interesting problem Galileo showed that
if<00:02:50.459> there<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> target<00:02:51.440> intermediate<00:02:52.700> in

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
if there is a target intermediate in

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.500 
if there is a target intermediate in
here<00:02:54.000> somewhere

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
here somewhere

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.110 
here somewhere
that<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.290> target<00:02:55.830> can<00:02:56.070> be<00:02:56.100> hit<00:02:56.520> by<00:02:56.790> this

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
that that target can be hit by this

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.350 
that that target can be hit by this
weapon<00:02:57.540> by<00:02:58.140> two<00:02:58.200> routes<00:02:58.770> one<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.970> goes<00:03:00.209> like

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
weapon by two routes one that goes like

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.070 
weapon by two routes one that goes like
this

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
this

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.229 
this
and<00:03:01.950> one<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.060> goes<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.910> they

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
and one that goes like this and they

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.840 
and one that goes like this and they
have<00:03:06.510> very<00:03:06.750> interesting<00:03:07.410> properties<00:03:07.920> this

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
have very interesting properties this

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.920 
have very interesting properties this
smaller<00:03:09.300> one<00:03:09.709> is<00:03:10.709> as<00:03:10.980> much<00:03:11.220> smaller<00:03:11.730> than<00:03:12.150> 45

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
smaller one is as much smaller than 45

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.240 
smaller one is as much smaller than 45
degrees<00:03:13.440> as<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.940> one<00:03:15.300> is<00:03:15.810> bigger<00:03:16.290> than<00:03:16.560> 45

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
degrees as this one is bigger than 45

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.789 
degrees as this one is bigger than 45
which<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.239> very<00:03:18.570> exciting<00:03:19.110> thing<00:03:19.320> and

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
which is a very exciting thing and

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.789 
which is a very exciting thing and
Galileo<00:03:20.640> did<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.269> 16th<00:03:21.750> century<00:03:21.959> so

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
Galileo did this in the 16th century so

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.039 
Galileo did this in the 16th century so
you<00:03:22.860> see<00:03:23.250> people<00:03:23.549> that<00:03:25.220> playing<00:03:26.220> with<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.610> toy

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
you see people that playing with a toy

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.960 
you see people that playing with a toy
this<00:03:28.049> may<00:03:28.290> be<00:03:28.350> for<00:03:28.680> child's<00:03:29.070> play<00:03:29.340> but<00:03:29.820> the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
this may be for child's play but the

I<00:04:58.860> have<00:04:59.860> lured<00:05:00.189> his<00:05:00.520> center<00:05:00.879> of<00:05:00.909> gravity<00:05:01.169> below

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
I have lured his center of gravity below

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.709 
I have lured his center of gravity below
the<00:05:02.379> point<00:05:02.560> of<00:05:02.740> support<00:05:02.979> and<00:05:03.969> I<00:05:04.300> have<00:05:04.479> also

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:04.719 
the point of support and I have also

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:07.529 
the point of support and I have also
increased<00:05:05.560> what<00:05:05.919> we<00:05:06.159> call<00:05:06.490> his<00:05:06.909> moment<00:05:07.449> of

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
increased what we call his moment of

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.469 
increased what we call his moment of
inertia<00:05:07.900> I<00:05:08.289> have<00:05:08.800> made<00:05:09.069> his<00:05:09.400> mass<00:05:09.669> far<00:05:10.180> out

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
inertia I have made his mass far out

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.339 
inertia I have made his mass far out
from<00:05:11.199> his<00:05:11.409> central<00:05:11.800> axis<00:05:12.189> and<00:05:12.430> now<00:05:12.939> we<00:05:13.659> hope<00:05:13.900> he

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
from his central axis and now we hope he

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.709 
from his central axis and now we hope he
can<00:05:14.590> ride<00:05:14.800> with<00:05:15.189> absolute<00:05:15.729> immunity<00:05:15.909> watch

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:16.719 
can ride with absolute immunity watch

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:20.939 
can ride with absolute immunity watch
him<00:05:17.580> there<00:05:18.580> he<00:05:18.819> goes<00:05:19.000> and<00:05:19.419> there<00:05:20.319> he<00:05:20.770> comes

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
him there he goes and there he comes

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.680 
him there he goes and there he comes
back<00:05:21.250> and<00:05:21.819> there<00:05:22.750> he<00:05:22.900> goes<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:23.589> there<00:05:24.690> he

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
back and there he goes and there he

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.529 
back and there he goes and there he
comes<00:05:25.839> back<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.699> faster<00:05:28.150> he<00:05:28.180> goes<00:05:28.330> the

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
comes back and the faster he goes the

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.890 
comes back and the faster he goes the
more<00:05:29.110> stable<00:05:29.770> which<00:05:30.759> is<00:05:31.000> because<00:05:31.509> the<00:05:31.719> wheel

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
more stable which is because the wheel

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.670 
more stable which is because the wheel
has<00:05:32.319> a<00:05:32.680> certain<00:05:33.539> gyroscopic<00:05:34.539> property<00:05:35.080> which

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
has a certain gyroscopic property which

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.360 
has a certain gyroscopic property which
I<00:05:35.889> have<00:05:36.159> no<00:05:36.339> time<00:05:36.639> to<00:05:37.180> engage<00:05:37.509> in<00:05:37.839> here<00:05:38.199> so<00:05:38.979> the
