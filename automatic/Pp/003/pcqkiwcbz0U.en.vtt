these<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.680> they<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:41.009> retain<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.670> much

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
these just that they can retain as much

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.389 
these just that they can retain as much
nutrients<00:01:42.630> as<00:01:42.780> possible<00:01:43.350> put<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> cover<00:01:44.280> on

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
nutrients as possible put the cover on

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.550 
nutrients as possible put the cover on
and<00:01:44.460> let<00:01:44.700> them<00:01:44.880> steam<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:45.689> been<00:01:45.869> about<00:01:46.049> 10

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and let them steam so it's been about 10

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.200 
and let them steam so it's been about 10
minutes<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.100> steaming<00:01:47.430> I'm<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.119> to

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
minutes of steaming I'm just going to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.539 
minutes of steaming I'm just going to
check<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.720> yams<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> fork<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.280> where

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
check the yams with a fork to see where

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.580 
check the yams with a fork to see where
they<00:01:50.670> are<00:01:50.820> because<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.420> want<00:01:51.659> as<00:01:51.869> little<00:01:52.320> time

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
they are because we want as little time

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.520 
they are because we want as little time
in<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.040> double<00:01:53.520> boiler<00:01:53.820> as<00:01:53.939> possible<00:01:54.530> we

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
in this double boiler as possible we

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.200 
in this double boiler as possible we
want<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.920> really<00:01:56.250> colorful<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.969> want<00:01:57.119> it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
want to be really colorful you want it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.940 
want to be really colorful you want it
to<00:01:57.329> retain<00:01:57.570> as<00:01:57.750> many<00:01:57.960> nutrients<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:58.530> possible

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
to retain as many nutrients as possible

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.010 
to retain as many nutrients as possible
so<00:01:59.210> this<00:02:00.210> goes<00:02:00.390> straight<00:02:00.600> through

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
so this goes straight through

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.649 
so this goes straight through
it's<00:02:01.829> definitely<00:02:02.009> ready<00:02:02.460> Oh<00:02:02.700> next<00:02:03.149> step<00:02:03.479> is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
it's definitely ready Oh next step is

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.090 
it's definitely ready Oh next step is
we're<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.079> put<00:02:04.380> these<00:02:04.560> little<00:02:04.590> chunks

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
we're going to put these little chunks

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.770 
we're going to put these little chunks
in<00:02:05.399> our<00:02:05.520> blender<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.240> we're<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.600> start

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
in our blender and we're going to start

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.210 
in our blender and we're going to start
blending<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.469> blend<00:02:07.649> I'm<00:02:07.770> using<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.190> a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
blending so the blend I'm using is a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.130 
blending so the blend I'm using is a
Blendtec<00:02:08.580> blender<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> really<00:02:09.899> don't

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
Blendtec blender but I really don't

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.630 
Blendtec blender but I really don't
think<00:02:10.229> it

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
think it

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.970 
think it
matters<00:02:11.000> what<00:02:11.360> type<00:02:11.569> of<00:02:11.600> blender<00:02:11.960> use<00:02:12.260> pretty

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
matters what type of blender use pretty

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.800 
matters what type of blender use pretty
sure<00:02:13.160> any<00:02:13.370> blender<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:13.790> going<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.000> work<00:02:14.150> just

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
sure any blender is going to work just

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.390 
sure any blender is going to work just
as<00:02:15.020> well<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:15.470> carefully<00:02:15.860> grab<00:02:16.100> your<00:02:16.280> little

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
as well so carefully grab your little

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
chunks of yam that are going to be hot

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.449 
chunks of yam that are going to be hot
and<00:02:18.319> throw<00:02:18.920> them<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.430> your<00:02:19.730> blender<00:02:21.459> because

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
and throw them in your blender because

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.400 
and throw them in your blender because
we're<00:02:22.580> making<00:02:22.790> baby<00:02:22.970> food<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.390> want<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:24.020> yams

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
we need to make it pretty liquidy so

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.160 
we need to make it pretty liquidy so
they<00:02:28.370> can<00:02:28.580> digest<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.300> swallow<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:29.900> easily

they can digest it and swallow it easily

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.199 
they can digest it and swallow it easily
so<00:02:30.440> we<00:02:30.620> need<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.860> add<00:02:30.980> some<00:02:31.280> water<00:02:31.430> torreón<00:02:32.000> now

a yellowish tinge to it if you're making
green<00:02:41.120> means<00:02:41.330> it'll<00:02:41.510> be<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.600> greenish<00:02:41.989> tinge

green means it'll be a greenish tinge
before<00:02:42.920> are<00:02:43.010> yams<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.340> has<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.459> yellowish<00:02:43.820> tinge

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
before are yams it has a yellowish tinge

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.400 
before are yams it has a yellowish tinge
to<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.360> which<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.660> basically<00:02:44.780> all<00:02:45.230> those

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
to it which is basically all those

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.199 
to it which is basically all those
nutrients<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:45.950> we<00:02:46.130> lost<00:02:46.400> from<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.790> yams<00:02:46.970> in

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
nutrients that we lost from the yams in

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.490 
nutrients that we lost from the yams in
the<00:02:47.420> water<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:47.870> we're<00:02:47.959> going<00:02:48.050> to<00:02:48.140> use<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.260> little

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
the water so we're going to use a little

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.170 
the water so we're going to use a little
bit<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.860> water<00:02:49.070> which<00:02:49.250> already<00:02:49.459> has<00:02:49.850> our

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
bit of this water which already has our

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.910 
bit of this water which already has our
yam<00:02:50.480> nutrients<00:02:51.080> in<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.560> we're<00:02:51.739> going<00:02:51.830> to

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
yam nutrients in it and we're going to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.740 
yam nutrients in it and we're going to
add<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.220> back<00:02:52.400> into<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.940> end<00:02:53.060> not<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.420> lot<00:02:53.720> just

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
add it back into the end not a lot just

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.810 
add it back into the end not a lot just
a<00:02:54.080> little<00:02:54.110> bit<00:02:54.440> enough<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.220> make<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.370> liquidy

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
a little bit enough to make it liquidy

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.850 
a little bit enough to make it liquidy
so<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.750> just<00:02:56.930> add<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.050> little<00:02:57.200> bit<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.500> water<00:02:57.680> at<00:02:57.830> a

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
so I just add a little bit of water at a

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.259 
so I just add a little bit of water at a
time<00:02:58.100> until<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.459> get<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:58.910> perfect

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
time until I get it to a perfect

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.240 
time until I get it to a perfect
consistency<00:02:59.630> once<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.590> add<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.890> water<00:03:01.070> I'm

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
consistency once I add the water I'm

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.770 
consistency once I add the water I'm
going<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.489> press<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.910> sauces<00:03:02.360> button<00:03:02.660> on<00:03:02.750> my

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
going to press the sauces button on my

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.420 
going to press the sauces button on my
blender<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.470> can<00:03:03.620> use<00:03:03.739> whatever<00:03:03.920> button<00:03:04.280> you

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
blender you can use whatever button you

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:13.800 
blender you can use whatever button you
prefer

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.910 

once<00:03:14.810> it's<00:03:14.959> done<00:03:15.140> blending<00:03:15.440> I'm<00:03:15.709> going<00:03:15.860> to

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
once it's done blending I'm going to

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.309 
once it's done blending I'm going to
check<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.310> consistency<00:03:17.060> of<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.540> that

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
check the consistency of it and that

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.900 
check the consistency of it and that
actually<00:03:18.770> looks<00:03:18.980> really<00:03:19.459> good

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
actually looks really good

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.089 
actually looks really good
check<00:03:20.599> out<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.750> consistency<00:03:21.470> nice<00:03:21.830> and

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
check out that consistency nice and

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.870 
check out that consistency nice and
smooth<00:03:22.489> all<00:03:23.030> from<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.900> blender<00:03:24.459> this<00:03:25.459> Blendtec

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
smooth all from a blender this Blendtec

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.550 
smooth all from a blender this Blendtec
is<00:03:25.910> really<00:03:26.300> good<00:03:26.450> but<00:03:26.599> like<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:26.840> said<00:03:26.900> I'm<00:03:27.200> sure

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
is really good but like I said I'm sure

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.350 
is really good but like I said I'm sure
that<00:03:28.010> any<00:03:28.220> other<00:03:28.430> blender<00:03:28.790> can<00:03:28.940> probably<00:03:29.150> give

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
that any other blender can probably give

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.820 
that any other blender can probably give
you<00:03:29.480> similar<00:03:29.810> results<00:03:30.230> all<00:03:30.349> right<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:30.680> then

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
you similar results all right so then

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.410 
you similar results all right so then
once<00:03:31.010> it's<00:03:31.160> done<00:03:31.340> I'm<00:03:31.610> going<00:03:31.819> to<00:03:31.880> go<00:03:31.940> ahead<00:03:32.150> and

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
once it's done I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.550 
once it's done I'm going to go ahead and
I'm<00:03:32.480> going<00:03:32.599> to<00:03:32.630> pour<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:32.959> into<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.319> glass

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
I'm going to pour it into a glass

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.710 
I'm going to pour it into a glass
container<00:03:33.950> I'm<00:03:34.819> really<00:03:35.120> not<00:03:35.239> sure<00:03:35.420> why<00:03:35.569> they

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
container I'm really not sure why they

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.820 
container I'm really not sure why they
would<00:03:35.840> make<00:03:35.989> a<00:03:36.019> blender<00:03:36.319> with<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.500> plastic

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
would make a blender with the plastic

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.070 
would make a blender with the plastic
container<00:03:37.099> but<00:03:37.390> whatever<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:38.510> got<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.870> use<00:03:38.959> what

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
container but whatever I got to use what

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.930 
container but whatever I got to use what
I<00:03:39.140> got<00:03:39.170> to<00:03:39.380> use<00:03:39.530> so<00:03:39.800> I'm<00:03:40.069> gonna<00:03:40.340> pour<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:40.700> into<00:03:40.819> a

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
I got to use so I'm gonna pour it into a

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.940 
I got to use so I'm gonna pour it into a
glass<00:03:41.150> container<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.840> get<00:03:41.959> it<00:03:42.050> to<00:03:42.170> cool<00:03:42.410> down<00:03:42.440> I

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
glass container to get it to cool down I

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.420 
glass container to get it to cool down I
use<00:03:43.819> glass<00:03:44.150> so<00:03:44.569> that<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:45.080> avoid<00:03:45.680> plastic

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
use glass so that I avoid plastic

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.640 
use glass so that I avoid plastic
leaching<00:03:47.180> into<00:03:47.299> my<00:03:47.450> food<00:03:47.660> although<00:03:48.140> like<00:03:48.530> I

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
leaching into my food although like I

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.610 
leaching into my food although like I
said<00:03:48.830> the<00:03:49.040> blender<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.430> plastic<00:03:49.910> oh<00:03:50.410> well

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
said the blender is plastic oh well

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.020 
said the blender is plastic oh well
that's<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.100> only<00:03:52.250> bad<00:03:52.370> thing<00:03:52.700> about<00:03:52.760> the

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
that's the only bad thing about the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.520 
that's the only bad thing about the
Blendtec<00:03:53.450> blenders<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.049> is<00:03:54.140> made<00:03:54.380> of

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
Blendtec blenders that it is made of

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.949 
Blendtec blenders that it is made of
plastic<00:03:54.890> so<00:03:55.730> now<00:03:55.850> we<00:03:55.910> have<00:03:56.120> all<00:03:56.299> of<00:03:56.330> our<00:03:56.540> smooth

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
plastic so now we have all of our smooth

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.150 
plastic so now we have all of our smooth
yam<00:03:58.060> goodness<00:03:59.060> in<00:03:59.330> our<00:03:59.480> glass<00:03:59.780> bowl<00:04:00.160> we're

yam goodness in our glass bowl we're

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.610 
yam goodness in our glass bowl we're
going<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.310> let<00:04:01.489> that<00:04:01.700> cool<00:04:01.970> down<00:04:02.319> now<00:04:03.319> that<00:04:03.500> our

yams are nice and cool
I'm<00:04:05.120> gonna<00:04:05.630> grab<00:04:05.930> just<00:04:06.349> some<00:04:06.500> simple<00:04:06.890> ice<00:04:07.069> cube

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
I'm gonna grab just some simple ice cube

I'm gonna grab just some simple ice cube
containers<00:04:07.880> I'm<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.299> going<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.510> use<00:04:08.690> two

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
containers I'm just going to use two

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.870 
containers I'm just going to use two
it'll<00:04:09.380> probably<00:04:09.620> only<00:04:09.769> fill<00:04:10.220> one<00:04:10.519> but<00:04:10.700> I<00:04:10.730> have

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
it'll probably only fill one but I have

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.940 
it'll probably only fill one but I have
two<00:04:11.090> just<00:04:11.299> in<00:04:11.360> case<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:11.930> this<00:04:12.410> is<00:04:12.470> how<00:04:12.680> I'm

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
two just in case and this is how I'm

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.039 
two just in case and this is how I'm
going<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.280> freeze<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.090> baby<00:04:14.239> because<00:04:14.599> clearly

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
going to freeze the baby because clearly

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.229 
going to freeze the baby because clearly
a<00:04:15.319> baby<00:04:16.010> Olivia<00:04:16.430> is<00:04:16.519> not<00:04:16.729> going<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:16.940> eat<00:04:17.090> all

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
a baby Olivia is not going to eat all

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.449 
a baby Olivia is not going to eat all
this<00:04:17.359> in<00:04:17.570> one<00:04:17.750> sitting<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:18.500> we<00:04:19.039> have<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.310> have<00:04:19.430> a

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
this in one sitting so we have to have a

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.460 
this in one sitting so we have to have a
way<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.729> preserve<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.390> so<00:04:20.660> I'm<00:04:20.989> going<00:04:21.140> to<00:04:21.229> just

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
way to preserve it so I'm going to just

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.200 
way to preserve it so I'm going to just
grab<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:21.739> spoonful<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.760> this<00:04:22.850> is<00:04:22.970> how<00:04:23.120> I'm

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
grab a spoonful and this is how I'm

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.570 
grab a spoonful and this is how I'm
gonna<00:04:23.419> begin<00:04:23.630> filling<00:04:24.590> my<00:04:24.710> little<00:04:24.950> trays<00:04:25.250> and

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
gonna begin filling my little trays and

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.029 
gonna begin filling my little trays and
this<00:04:26.210> does<00:04:26.479> take<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:26.930> little<00:04:27.260> bit<00:04:27.350> with<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.620> spoon

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
this does take a little bit with a spoon

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.000 
this does take a little bit with a spoon
but<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.550> ensures<00:04:28.970> that<00:04:29.090> you<00:04:29.330> have<00:04:29.650> nice<00:04:30.650> even

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
but it ensures that you have nice even

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.980 
but it ensures that you have nice even
cubes<00:04:31.640> I<00:04:31.880> tried<00:04:32.090> pouring<00:04:32.450> it<00:04:32.570> in<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:32.870> got

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
cubes I tried pouring it in and it got

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.719 
cubes I tried pouring it in and it got
all<00:04:33.140> over<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.440> place<00:04:33.650> wasn't<00:04:34.520> a<00:04:34.550> good<00:04:34.580> time

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
all over the place wasn't a good time

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.010 
all over the place wasn't a good time
unless<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.360> course<00:04:35.390> you<00:04:35.630> have<00:04:35.750> a<00:04:35.780> glass

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.200 
unless of course you have a glass
container<00:04:36.200> with<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.740> spell<00:04:37.130> I<00:04:37.340> don't<00:04:37.729> so<00:04:38.090> we

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
container with a spell I don't so we

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.420 
container with a spell I don't so we
filled<00:04:38.450> up<00:04:38.600> with<00:04:38.810> that<00:04:38.990> one<00:04:39.260> ym1<00:04:39.560> entire<00:04:40.160> ice
