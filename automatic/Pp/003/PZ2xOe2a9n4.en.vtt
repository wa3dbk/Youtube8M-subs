00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:39.409 
mean hopefully they've learned stuff

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.139 
mean hopefully they've learned stuff
today<00:00:39.620> that<00:00:39.769> they<00:00:40.190> didn't<00:00:40.460> know<00:00:40.609> before<00:00:40.789> they

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
today that they didn't know before they

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.020 
today that they didn't know before they
showed<00:00:41.690> up<00:00:41.899> you<00:00:42.710> know<00:00:42.829> the<00:00:43.429> different<00:00:43.819> types

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
showed up you know the different types

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.069 
showed up you know the different types
of<00:00:44.239> buses<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.929> the<00:00:45.260> windows<00:00:45.769> how<00:00:46.269> the<00:00:47.269> doors

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
of buses the the windows how the doors

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.380 
of buses the the windows how the doors
or<00:00:48.589> stuff<00:00:48.829> like<00:00:48.920> that<00:00:49.069> operate<00:00:49.729> so<00:00:50.059> that<00:00:50.239> they

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
or stuff like that operate so that they

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.349 
or stuff like that operate so that they
they<00:00:50.749> know<00:00:51.019> what's<00:00:51.350> what<00:00:51.859> is<00:00:52.760> going<00:00:53.059> on<00:00:53.179> with

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
they know what's what is going on with

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.169 
they know what's what is going on with
the<00:00:53.449> bus<00:00:53.659> and<00:00:54.579> hopefully<00:00:55.579> it's<00:00:55.729> something

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
the bus and hopefully it's something

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.319 
the bus and hopefully it's something
that<00:00:56.389> never<00:00:57.010> needs<00:00:58.010> to<00:00:58.190> take<00:00:58.399> place<00:00:58.429> but<00:00:59.179> at

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
that never needs to take place but at

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.450 
that never needs to take place but at
least<00:00:59.479> we're<00:00:59.899> letting<00:01:00.379> them<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:00.769> get<00:01:01.129> some<00:01:01.339> of

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
the inside yeah pretty much it's it's

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.990

we would be at a standstill and really
slacking<00:02:03.380> in<00:02:03.439> our<00:02:03.560> in<00:02:03.740> our<00:02:03.829> training<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
slacking in our in our training the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.259 
slacking in our in our training the
tactics<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:05.810> we<00:02:05.959> use<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:07.490> know<00:02:07.610> we<00:02:07.759> we<00:02:08.149> don't

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
tactics that we use you know we we don't

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.180 
tactics that we use you know we we don't
obviously<00:02:08.530> which<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.709> good<00:02:09.920> thing<00:02:10.069> don't

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
obviously which is a good thing don't

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.650 
obviously which is a good thing don't
have<00:02:10.429> all<00:02:10.700> these<00:02:10.819> situations<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.540> occur

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
have all these situations that occur

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.530 
have all these situations that occur
every<00:02:12.170> year<00:02:12.200> all<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.680> time<00:02:12.709> so<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:14.090> just

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
every year all the time so it's just

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.509 
every year all the time so it's just
like<00:02:14.690> any<00:02:14.930> any<00:02:15.470> skill<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.040> have<00:02:16.069> if<00:02:16.400> you

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
like any any skill that you have if you

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.120 
like any any skill that you have if you
don't<00:02:16.640> practice<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:17.599> tend<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.900> lose<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.290> so

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
don't practice it you tend to lose it so

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.009 
don't practice it you tend to lose it so
we<00:02:19.250> do<00:02:19.370> try<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.670> at<00:02:19.790> least<00:02:19.819> maybe<00:02:20.450> do<00:02:20.660> once<00:02:20.870> or

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
we do try to at least maybe do once or

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.289 
we do try to at least maybe do once or
twice<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.410> year<00:02:21.440> come<00:02:22.220> out<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.489> do<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.910> work<00:02:23.090> on

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
twice a year come out and do and work on

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.270 
twice a year come out and do and work on
you<00:02:23.780> know<00:02:23.840> buses<00:02:24.290> Sol<00:02:24.470> tactics<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.099> stuff

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
you know buses Sol tactics and stuff

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:56.170 
you know buses Sol tactics and stuff
like<00:02:25.459> that

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.449 

we<00:02:57.180> allowed<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.040> tape<00:02:59.040> some<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.370> the

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
we allowed you to tape some of the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.530 
we allowed you to tape some of the
movements<00:02:59.819> obviously<00:03:00.150> we're<00:03:00.300> not<00:03:00.390> gonna

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
movements obviously we're not gonna

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.380 
movements obviously we're not gonna
allow<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:02.040> show<00:03:02.069> all<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.580> tactics<00:03:02.819> that<00:03:03.000> we<00:03:03.090> do

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
allow to show all the tactics that we do

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.600 
allow to show all the tactics that we do
is<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.630> because<00:03:03.930> we<00:03:04.250> don't<00:03:05.250> want<00:03:05.490> those

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
is just because we don't want those

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.150 
is just because we don't want those
tactics<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.120> get<00:03:06.240> out<00:03:06.650> whether<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.800> be<00:03:07.890> for<00:03:08.069> the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
tactics to get out whether it be for the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.280 
tactics to get out whether it be for the
good<00:03:08.340> or<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.490> bad<00:03:08.690> we'd<00:03:09.690> like<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.990> keep<00:03:10.140> those

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
good or the bad we'd like to keep those

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.470 
good or the bad we'd like to keep those
things<00:03:10.520> you<00:03:11.520> know<00:03:11.640> within<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.030> tactical

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
things you know within the tactical

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.390 
things you know within the tactical
world<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:13.290> case<00:03:13.500> if<00:03:13.650> we<00:03:13.800> ever<00:03:13.860> have<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.130> use<00:03:14.370> it

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
world in case if we ever have to use it

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.460 
world in case if we ever have to use it
you<00:03:14.700> know<00:03:15.000> they'd<00:03:15.720> always<00:03:15.870> know<00:03:16.110> what<00:03:16.320> we're
