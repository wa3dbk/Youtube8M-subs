00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.970
 Tell me guys, we're here. 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.290
 in the perfect booth 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.240
 one of the small enterprises 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.670
 here is also 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.370
 ences 2015 and they are showing here 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.690
 for two very good news 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.160
 interesting in products that are already 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.520
 available at other stores . 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.460
 recent releases is the perfect one and the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.470
 perfect make is the big differential 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.720
 we show that the first perfect 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.160
 im working on the big 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.349
 differential is the fact that you 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 can follow step by step through 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.070
 example of mounting a link 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.110
 so here we have a software he 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.430
 was software works both on android 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.340
 as the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.700
 and to the extent that you are putting the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.950
 items as the recipe asks for it goes 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.000
 giving a mark indicating that you 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.870
 is doing things the way 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.940
 correct 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.980
 so you put first link first 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.989
 part of liquid for example it indicates 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.699
 that's ok, you pass to the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.739
 second part of the liquid 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.020
 it is also indicating so much that case 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.300
 you pass some of the revenue 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.840
 Can you go back to the previous item? 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.640
 to include the missing item 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.200
 so that the proportion was straight 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.260
 perfect drink then follows 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.259
 you until the end of your 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.070
 earring and the final result you give 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.100
 on the screen there 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.780
 based on the multiple recipes that 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.850
 available in the service 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.729
 in addition they also have the version of the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.340
 perfect make is a similar in perfect 20 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.350
 But what does it buy for you to do? 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.659
 a certain recipe of for example 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.970
 with the cake thing in that regard 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.820
 the principle is the same you will follow the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.280
 step by step of each of the items there 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.790
 you can edit these items if you want 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.159
 you 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.860
 in addition to those of the recipes 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.320
 system you can create your own 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.689
 including steps in the items there and 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.820
 following step by step puts the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.189
 measure items with how it is 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.659

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.270

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.520
 Finally it is like a kind of 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.350
 an instructor working with you 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.049
