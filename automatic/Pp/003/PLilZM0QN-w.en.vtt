our second overall project well a couple

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.230 
our second overall project well a couple
reasons<00:00:09.900> one<00:00:10.320> at<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.250> stage<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.730> our<00:00:11.820> careers

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
reasons one at this stage in our careers

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.520 
reasons one at this stage in our careers
we're<00:00:12.480> not<00:00:12.630> going<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.809> get<00:00:12.960> paid<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:13.200> our

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
we're not going to get paid for our

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.689 
we're not going to get paid for our
ideas<00:00:13.920> anyway<00:00:14.690> so<00:00:15.690> we<00:00:15.839> thought<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.289> would

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
ideas anyway so we thought this would

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.670 
ideas anyway so we thought this would
would<00:00:17.699> give<00:00:17.880> us<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.090> chance<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.650> you<00:00:19.650> know

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
would give us a chance to you know

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.010 
would give us a chance to you know
perhaps<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.310> long<00:00:20.490> shot<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:20.820> but<00:00:21.510> maybe<00:00:21.630> win

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
perhaps a long shot but but maybe win

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.670 
perhaps a long shot but but maybe win
some<00:00:22.320> money<00:00:22.910> and<00:00:23.910> at<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> same<00:00:25.050> time<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
some money and at the same time the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.500 
some money and at the same time the
beauty<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.220> contest<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:27.210> wide

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
open creatively really within reason

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.260 
open creatively really within reason
anything<00:00:32.759> goes<00:00:33.000> story<00:00:33.510> wise<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.260> that's<00:00:34.920> a

anything goes story wise and that's a
and<00:00:36.270> that's<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.200> sold<00:00:37.500> us

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
and that's really what sold us

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.060

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.790 
a little bit more vibrant I guess you
would<00:06:38.240> say<00:06:38.419> I<00:06:38.629> figure<00:06:39.229> out<00:06:39.319> how<00:06:39.379> to<00:06:39.440> make<00:06:39.620> some

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
would say I figure out how to make some

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.110 
would say I figure out how to make some
rats<00:06:40.180> I<00:06:41.289> know<00:06:42.289> the<00:06:42.409> recipe<00:06:42.590> is<00:06:43.069> cement<00:06:43.759> and

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
rats I know the recipe is cement and

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.459 
rats I know the recipe is cement and
water<00:06:46.479> probably<00:06:47.479> shouldn't<00:06:48.020> have<00:06:48.080> crunched

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:48.469 
water probably shouldn't have crunched

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:49.659 
water probably shouldn't have crunched
them<00:06:48.590> first<00:06:48.949> I<00:06:49.129> think<00:06:49.340> it<00:06:49.400> would<00:06:49.490> have<00:06:49.580> been

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 
them first I think it would have been

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:51.129 
them first I think it would have been
easier<00:06:49.969> to<00:06:50.090> paint<00:06:50.330> him<00:06:50.449> and<00:06:50.599> then<00:06:50.690> crunch<00:06:50.960> them

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
easier to paint him and then crunch them

00:06:51.139 --> 00:07:12.059 
easier to paint him and then crunch them
but<00:06:51.349> I'm<00:06:51.830> not<00:06:52.009> that<00:06:52.219> smart

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:12.069 

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:16.320
