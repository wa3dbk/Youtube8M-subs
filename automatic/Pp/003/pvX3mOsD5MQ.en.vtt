 accompany the productive process that is 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.189
 being developed that is being 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:02.960
 developed here in this industry 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.619
 knowledge of embraer 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.520
 I'm sure one thing is certain. 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:15.319
 that each of them would feel immense 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.770
 of our country and thanks to the 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:26.420

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.790

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:04.959
 And then I think our president 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:08.209
 of Embraer said something important 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.120

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.370
 Brazilian 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:19.760
 well this is nothing 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:25.310
 designed and developed in brazil 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:29.840
 kc-390 will make its first flight up 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:35.959

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.320

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:49.730
 reality 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:53.709
 It's something that thrilled and I saw the beginning. 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.040
 of this project following the discussions 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.810

 during the government of President Lula 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:08.440
 when the decision was made that in fact 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.319
 was a key issue for 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.209
