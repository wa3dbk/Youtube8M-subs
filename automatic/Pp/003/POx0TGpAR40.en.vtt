00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.590
 we come to the cup game directly from 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.900
 TV is of course as if the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.560
 fc would have been infinitely better off how 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.890
 I think that we are at least equal 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.470
 was 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.449
 and that against a team like that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.689
 hamburger sv is definitely on 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.250
 an exclamation link that gives us up 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.449
 any case not the necessary 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.849
 Confidence now for the coming 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.080
 games and in retrospect therefore a pity 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.230
 that we did not reward ourselves then 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.610
 and a round have progressed 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.920
 so I think that brings somehow a 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.890
 crack the team or yes well 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.000
 Definitely not so short 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.530
 of course, after the game was the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.390
 disappointment very big at all but 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.340
 Now we have German in training 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.079
 also talked about that we did that 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.539
 can take positive from the game 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.980
 that we even with the bundesligist 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.440
 keep up and that will take us to everyone 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.719
 case then much power for the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.800
 play next games against frankfurt 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.370
 again, it will be a completely different one again 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.649
 game 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.840
 there we meet again on such a 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.159
 opponent who enters the back and there 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.780
 we have to just then our dominance 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.520
 from then the game was easy 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.270
 win you are still relative 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.750
 boys like that is the response of the fans too 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.119
 feel 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.159
 In any case it has always been mine 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.320
 Dream there in his own stadium 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.299
 to run up so much in front of so many 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.950
 watch as they mean the first time 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.229
 have called names 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.520
 It was incredible and I get it now 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.560
 always go enjoy otherwise 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.020
 this moment but when the audience there 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.240
 your own call that the biggest and 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.560
 so I am proud that I am already 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.900
 At the age of 19, I made the jump 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.180
 So he goes positive in the second half 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.280
 In any case, we still want the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.259
 last games so positive this year 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.610
 We hope to dispute as much as possible 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.549
 drive in as many victories as possible 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.020
 can and then we will be in Belek 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.479
 training camp again hard work that 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.180
 We will continue in the second half of the season 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.369
 play as positive games as now 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.530
 and hopefully then jump to the end of the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.530
 I would like to rise
