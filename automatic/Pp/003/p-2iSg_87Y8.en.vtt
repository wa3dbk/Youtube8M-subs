 I said my idea this one I loved it helped me 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.230
 I spoke to RaÃºl because it also 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.290
 I told him to see what he thought I loved 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.970
 Trevino niko loved then we 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.780
 we put to work already with flowers which 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.780
 that put us in choreography 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.990
 Gabriel made me David's wardrobe 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.120
 flowers was the one that made this the users 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.070
 of the kids and everything then was a 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.160
 teamwork magical as always 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.410
 as always there are many people who 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.270
 support that helps me and that I appreciate 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.979
 wholeheartedly and I hope you have 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.510
 enjoyed and in your case I think that if 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.280
 we enjoyed it for the results here 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.050
 in the studio and I think you 're 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.470
 talking about times now about the 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.000
 time days approximately 356 days that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.760
 It must have led you to do all this 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.840
 If this sacrifice is a lot of effort 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.060
 a lot of delivery and fast acting you finish 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.540
 to say a fundamental thing and a thing 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.490
 real sacrifices because sometimes when 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.890
 we have the time to do or perform 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.730
 and we have to do overtime to 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.170
 that we can make the sacrifice 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.170
 to make a question totally 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.930
 great as a greeting and a hug very 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.190

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.200

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.940
 unveiled with this song very father by 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.190
 yes of course it was worth the 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.170
 sleepless 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.060
 because he conceives it if you have children 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.660
 and it's a strong applause for this team 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.660
 I presented 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.300
 hey mayito 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:25.430
 we made the trees when they want 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:27.110
 little trees tell me is the family 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.390

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.890
 sectors together I ask you stuart the and 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.510
 because it's a fundamental thing and a 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.900
 very important thing of what I am 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.100
 saying yes because it's not a day to 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.710
 what else am I going to do 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.240
 ok there were people who did not have the 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.340
 enough time that you had it in 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.890
 my pretty life yes but I think it's a 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.870
 sacrifice as you say it I think that 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.730
 that day I do not sleep 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.860
 I have much more time to be able 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.380
 sleep and do one thing control that is 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.860
 can present and do it 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.470
 it's a sacrifice is in this race is 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.880
 based on sacrifices if we are going to do 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.830

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.710
 our love with all our affection and 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.360
 with all the sacrifice because sometimes 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.770
 that we do not have the time to do it 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.230
 but we have to give ourselves some time 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.210
 exactly older and there are people waiting 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.970

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.280
