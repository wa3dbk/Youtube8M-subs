00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello then today in the 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.370
 second video 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.499
 I will show you how 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.820
 install the missing drivers after 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:10.820
 a windows 7 installation 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.769
 so I'm going to look at which drivers are 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.029
 missing on my installation 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.699
 so I'm going into the panel of 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:27.300
 configuration 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:29.750
 I go to system and I go to 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.630
 device manager 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.150
 here and there in fact I see all 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.710
 small yellow icons with a dot 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.890
 of exclamation it's all the others 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.760
 which are missing on my pc 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.730
 so in fact to install the drivers 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.790
 there is nothing simpler 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.570
 so then we go on the internet 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.340
 so of course to make for 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.250
 download the drivers and install them 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.240
 you have to have an internet connection if 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.140
 you do not have a cause and a 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.309
 internet connection it does not work everything 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.750
 what I'm going to show you 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.219
 works only if you have a 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.689
 Internet connection 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:14.189
 otherwise it's another installation that 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:22.250
 I'll do it later on then on 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:27.310
 internet you type tmd 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.310
 all the drivers points as sees the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.830
 times on the page of all drivers 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:51.080
 points as you click on my 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:52.520
 drivers you go to the bottom of the page I 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.920
 branch my computer I have no more 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:01.420
 battery so here I take you back 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.420
 go to the bottom of the page 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:20.590
 here you have launched the detection and 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.590
 the click you install the plugin 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.780
 here you are installing it 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.490
 how he presented himself 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.490
 okay 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.010
 happy 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:08.280
 once you've installed the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:12.930
 plugin you have started the detection and 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.610
 it's actually going to analyze your pc and that 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.370
 will tell you what are my drivers 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:23.670
 which are missing your installation 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:25.830
 just look at the list of 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.480
 drivers and all that is a blue like 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.170
 there is all the drivers that you 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.220
 lack in fact so you just have to 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:39.440
 tick the one that interests you the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:43.610
 download and install 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:54.150
 this is moderately this one for my pc 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:55.790
 so I click on it I go on 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.700
 downloading 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:05.750
 I click on it I click on the link 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.750
 of all the servers are like that 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.220
 and there in fact I do not open with 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.590
 but I have the files saved 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.419
 like that at the same time you can 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.160
 put on a usb stick on a hard drive 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.400
 and next time you format 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.220
 your pc and you will have to hand over the 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.940
 drivers you in stock on your key 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.940
 or your hard drive 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.970
 so once downloaded 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:52.169
 you close the tab in fact here you are 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:53.669
 go to download here at 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.039
 on it if you downloaded them there 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:01.979
 you right click 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:04.080
 you made extract everything wanted to give 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.759
 a path if you want in the file 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.860
 download it will stay there if you 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.120
 want to put it somewhere else wanted the 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.509
 put elsewhere my the occurrence I'm going 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:19.610
 put it on the desk it will be more 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:19.610
 easy to erase it after extracting 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:31.349
 here I do here and there actually I 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:36.500
 i'm going to click on seven example points 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:36.500
 here is actually I install my driver 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.050
 see there is really nothing complicated 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.050
 huh 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.310
 we are really guided by the 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.409
 software in fact often we think that 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.780
 it's difficult to install drivers 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.939
 but in fact it's not that difficult 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.020
 it has a good background for sure that the 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:09.490
 first time it's a little bit 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.090
 difficult we have the impression we know 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.550
 not but but in fact we know this guide 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.240
 and it goes by itself so the installation 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.240
 follows its course 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:32.860
 here we are 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:40.659
 do you want to restart the pc once 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:43.379
 the installation finished I say yes and the 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:43.379
 pc will restart 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.780
 the pc restarts 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:31.880
 So here is the pc to restart 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:33.950
 here and to see if really my 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.570
 arrival has been installed in fact I 

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:41.990
 return to the configuration boat 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:43.690
 system and I'm going into the manager 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:48.380
 peripherals 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:51.040
 here and if you look good here in 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:54.290
 done at the beginning of the video where I had 

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.850
 three exclamation points yellow he me 

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.690
 remains two that means that my driver has 

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.580
 well installed 

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.160
 in fact she admits to me doing the same thing for 

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:05.229
 for others the same system 

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.229
 Thank you and see you soon
