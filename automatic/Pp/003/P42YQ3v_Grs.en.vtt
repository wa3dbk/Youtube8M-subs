 hello friends now let's show the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.220
 release process of a sony 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.580
 ericsson xperia neo 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.269
 thanks to you and to point is how you can see 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.860
 in 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.410
 in an email that I have 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.119
 commanded 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:25.220
 here we have the release number of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.109
 mobile and the steps that we have to follow 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.269
 I'm going to show you now how to do it 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.039
 first thing we have to do is put 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.370
 the card of an operator other than 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.969
 that has the mobile in this case 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.969
 from vodafone 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.500
 we take the sim card 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.480
 of vodafone 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.460
 how can you see 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.829
 vodafone 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.710
 and I have another in this case of 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.710
 movistar this is an adapter of a 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.930
 micro if i have an iphone 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.480
 but with the adapter it's worth 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.050
 again we see 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.050
 A battery 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.019
 in the housing 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.330
 and we turn on the phone 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.720
 we wait for it to turn on 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.840
 you see how friends are going on 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.840
 the mobile 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.530
 what has sounded is because I'm going to see a 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.530
 little cocacola 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.679
 while the phone is turned on 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.890
 it takes a while 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.350
 Well we already have seen as places 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.350
 without service 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.700
 we unlock it we put the pin code 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.480
 which in this case is 25 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.480
 08 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.860
 we will accept 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.230
 and no espn asks us for the unlocking pin 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.230
 network cards and how can you see there 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.300
 and here we have the number 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.230

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.230

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.450

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.650

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.960
 06 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.960
 86 and we give it to unlock 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.470
 requesting network blocking 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.110

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.830
