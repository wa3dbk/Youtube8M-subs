00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:11.900
 hello again to you again 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.630
 Julia next day I have 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.670
 there was a stunning luxury occasion 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:23.660
 take off and on a balmy day and 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:26.030
 I hope you liked the fact that 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.520
 not so long ago I went to our store in 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.590
 Kraft looked booth where 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.350
 expose perfumes that discount us on 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.140
 some kind of sale and just 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.090
 running over the shelf what is there 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.040
 shots on sale my eyes fell 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.649
 on a very beautiful and interesting parfum 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.350
 which I saw somewhere here he flashed u 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.870
 me somewhere already before my eyes and only 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.340
 so I put it on my wrist 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.940
 ran on and when it came out on 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.270
 I began to smell the wrist 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.180
 him 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.860
 it's just a scent that cast 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.159
 me in some kind of ecstasy 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.469
 I really like strange flavors 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.509
 flavors and it was just such a scent and 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:13.729
 this is lure and from divine clear I was 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.789
 captivated by this scent he is so 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.459
 beautiful and long we did not hold it 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.729
 so beautifully revealed that how 

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:24.049
 I just ran home I became 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.880
 quickly googled ran on 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.880
 fragrantica to check what kind of 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.249
 the aroma and I was just amazed to know 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.789
 there are only a few notes in this 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:39.590
 perfum is a fig tree in my 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:44.359
 fig leaves and black caviar 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.420
 everything and right here it is the first parfum 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:49.990
 in which I felt 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.369
 but you, I clearly clearly feel the sweetness 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.560
 figs on the one hand 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.920
 straight here really beats in the nose 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.200
 in fatty sugary sweetness and in 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.909
 the same time is very clear 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.369
 this sweetness is felt here 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.440
 enveloped in salty something salty 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.840
 like salty air like this sea 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.280
 the air can immediately think reading 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.760
 you can immediately think about what these 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.709
 notes that it will be a black bloodstream smell 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.890
 there is no fish 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.549
 some kind of salty aroma and smell and this 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.620
 just fine but i didn't buy it 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.650
 I was a girl gave me a 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.420
 meeting here is such a kind of ravello leg 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.000
 this bottle 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.400
 I really wanted to type in it what I wanted 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.980

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.690
 I heard this parfum somewhere here I just 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.090
 I knew that what otmazat I do not care 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.370
 sometime I'll get crazy 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.760
 right now I wanted to try it 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.239
 here is this parfait mind and it is really 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.630
 strange parfait 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.570
 this is really a very unusual parfait 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.310
 if he used to dash a million me at all 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.120
 did not attract here somehow did not go to bed 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.340
 change perfumes same row residential of all 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.070
 Well known, these stars were 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.950
 even by me all his fragrances are not 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.310
 just the stars then this portfolio 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.239
 he is right here to be like me he is mad 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.019
 sits beautifully 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.060
 from first to last notes it is parfum 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.799
 many don't like it because 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.549
 with this strangeness he is very 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:36.069
 strongly out of the general mass 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:38.580
 perfume he is bluffy he is arrogant 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.390
 he is incredible 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.570
 feminine in spite of all this 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.070
 despite its strangeness it is exactly 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:52.490
 semolina me 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:52.490
 sexy very so sweet woman 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.330
 it is impossible to describe 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:02.010
 despite the fact that there are so few notes and I have them 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.530
 I clearly feel these notes 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.430
 it's impossible to describe him so much 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.190
 strange he is hot and I noticed that 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.010
 this parfum is usually so tart 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.270
 sweet perfumes and lie very well in 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.180
 cold season 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.910
 so it's very good this parfum 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.790
 lies on hot skin the higher 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.810
 degree the better it lies it is exactly 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:31.320
 summer parfum this parfum that's it 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.720
 revealed when evil when hot and he 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.550
 he doesn't choke not suffocating because i 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.650
 bit worried that he was so 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.260
 sign so much for being trouble 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.710
 when I went for a walk with Masha we 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.360
 a lot of mom in the yard and when i 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.190
 I asked the girls not all the soul I say 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.160

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.100
 they said that the smell is very good and I 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.160
 I was just surprised because I 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.470

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.210
