00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hi guys so I am on a mission to get my

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.289 
hi guys so I am on a mission to get my
naturally<00:00:03.780> healthy<00:00:04.319> curly<00:00:04.950> hair<00:00:05.339> back<00:00:05.609> the

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
naturally healthy curly hair back the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.940 
naturally healthy curly hair back the
past<00:00:06.509> year<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.899> did<00:00:07.080> nothing<00:00:07.350> but<00:00:07.500> straighten

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
past year of did nothing but straighten

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.459 
past year of did nothing but straighten
it<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.150> think<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.570> that's<00:00:09.960> just<00:00:10.170> done

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
it and I think that that's just done

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.950 
it and I think that that's just done
some<00:00:10.710> damage<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.910> I've<00:00:12.150> confused<00:00:12.660> to

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
some damage to it and I've confused to

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.049 
some damage to it and I've confused to
my<00:00:13.080> curls<00:00:13.650> like<00:00:14.070> they're<00:00:14.280> all<00:00:14.460> straight<00:00:14.910> at

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
my curls like they're all straight at

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.200 
my curls like they're all straight at
the<00:00:15.179> ends<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:16.199> can't<00:00:16.920> tell<00:00:17.190> now<00:00:17.400> because<00:00:17.970> my

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
the ends you can't tell now because my

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.000 
the ends you can't tell now because my
hair<00:00:18.390> has<00:00:18.480> been<00:00:18.510> pulled<00:00:19.050> back<00:00:19.260> all<00:00:19.529> day<00:00:19.560> and

really heavy and I felt like it's it and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.140 
really heavy and I felt like it's it and
make<00:01:27.869> my<00:01:28.020> curls<00:01:28.320> curl<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> don't<00:01:29.610> think<00:01:29.909> my

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
make my curls curl so I don't think my

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.999 
make my curls curl so I don't think my
hair<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.509> thick<00:01:30.990> enough<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.530> notice<00:01:31.829> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
hair is thick enough if you notice it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.170 
hair is thick enough if you notice it
says<00:01:32.390> thick<00:01:33.390> curly<00:01:34.200> hair<00:01:34.549> um<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.640> thought<00:01:36.000> my

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
says thick curly hair um I thought my

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.609 
says thick curly hair um I thought my
hair<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.390> thick<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:36.930> apparently<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.470> not

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
hair was thick but apparently it's not

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.340 
hair was thick but apparently it's not
that<00:01:37.799> thick<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.549> um<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.689> that's<00:01:39.960> why<00:01:40.170> they

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
that thick so um I think that's why they

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.039 
that thick so um I think that's why they
didn't<00:01:40.530> work<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.710> me<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.009> may<00:01:41.750> try<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> couple
