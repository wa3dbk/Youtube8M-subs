00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 chapter 28 there is the crown of arrogance 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.189
 of the Ephraim and Flower Serbs 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.290
 expires of the beauty of his glory that 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.200
 is on the head of the fertile valley of 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.690
 the stunned ones of the wine are here jehovÃ¡ 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.490
 has one that is strong and powerful as 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.010
 hail storm and whirlwind 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.410
 disturbed as an impetus of strong waters 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.140
 that flood with force knocks down to earth 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.779
 with the feet will be trampled the crown of 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.550
 arrogance of the drunkards of efrain and will be 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.199
 the deciduous flower of the beauty of its 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.899
 glory that is on the head of the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.390
 fertile valley like the early fruit the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.340
 first of the summer which hardly sees her 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.070
 the one who looks at it brings it to him so soon 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.809
 as he has it on hand in that day jehovah 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.670
 of the armies will be by crown of 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.160
 glory and diadem of beauty at 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.410
 remnant of his people and by spirit of 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.360
 judgment to which one feels in judgment and by 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.850
 forces to those who reject the battle in 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.489
 the door but also this closed with 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.710
 the wine and consider where they made the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.170
 priest and the prophet erred with AIDS 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.210
 they were upset by wine and 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.030
 they had with the cider they closed in the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.110
 vision stumbled in the trial because 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.180
 Every table is there 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.610
 of vomit and dirt until there is 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.290
 clean place to whom the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.080
 science or who will be made to understand 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.270
 doctrine to the weaned to the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.730
 torn from the breasts because 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.760
 commandments after mandate 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.520
 about row command after row line 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.160
 on line a little bit there another little 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.380
 there because in stutterer's language and the 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.380
 strange tongue will speak to this people to 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.020
 which he said this is the rest of the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.590
 rest reached and this is the refreshment 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.180
 more they did not want to hear the word then of 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.400
 jehovah was a commandment after 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.250
 mandate mandate 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.460
 line after line line on line 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.710
 a little bit there a little bit over there 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.520
 they go and fall on their backs and they have 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.410
 broken bound and prisoners therefore 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.540
 male scoffers that you govern this 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.880
 people who are in Jerusalem hear the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.100
 word of jehovah because you have 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.619
 said covenant we have done with death 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.630
 that we made an agreement with the Lord when 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.459
 past the whip storm will not come to 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.350
 us because we have put our 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.530
 refuge in lies and falsehood 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.890
 I do not know 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.720
 therefore jehovah the Lord says thus 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.060
 here that I have tension for 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.360
 foundation a proven stone stone 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.300
 precious angle of stable foundation the 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.239
 that you believe do not rush to adjust the 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.430
 string trial and justice level and 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.580
 hail barrier the refuge of the lie 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.709
 and waters will overwhelm the hiding place and it will be 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.660
 canceled our pact with death and 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.000
 your agreement with the seoul will not be 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.819
 firm when the scourge of the scourge passes 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.459
 you will be trampled on him after 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.650
 start to pass and you will snatch them because 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.200
 from tomorrow to tomorrow it will pass by day and from 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.080
 night and it will certainly be frightening 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.360
 understand what heard the bed will be short to 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.550
 be able to stretch and the blanket narrow for 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.160
 be able to get wrapped up because jehovah 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.470
 will rise like in the brazil forest like 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.989
 in the gabon valley he will be angry 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.130
 do his work his strange work and to 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.280
 do your operation 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.200
 his strange operation now, well, not 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.660
 mock so they do not squeeze anymore 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.459
 your ties because destruction and 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.230
 determined over the whole earth 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.550
 I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.700
 armies 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.130
 stay tuned and hear my voice attend and 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.100
 heard and said he who does to sow 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.380
 plow all day will break and break 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.780
 the clods of the earth when it has 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.480
 equaled its surface does not spill the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.250
 dill sows the cumin puts the wheat 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.350
 in rows and barley in place 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.050
 pointed and oats on its edge 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.630
 appropriate because his god instructs him and 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.850
 teaches you how straight the dill is not 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.100
 bring with trillo or on the cumin 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.590
 he passes a cart wheel but with a 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.530
 stick shakes dill and cumin with 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.720
 a stick the grain is threshed but not what 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.790
 will swallow forever or compress it with 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.590
 the wheel of his cart does not break it 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.290
 with the teeth of his threshing 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.390
 this came out of jehovah of the armies 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.680
 to do wonderful advice and 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.680
 enlarge wisdom
