00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.620
 because that most people really have all the years 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.019

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.350
 request from nac it is an initiative 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.500
 that nac 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.330
 has taken itself to three years 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.259
 season ticket holders to call and at 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.270

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.910
 years you see the boys for a moment 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.830
 have trouble finding it 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.090
 to get in, but after 10 minutes something 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.720
 people have spoken than see them 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.810

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.369

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.679

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.330
 telecom main sponsor is how nac is 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.270

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.849

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.200

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.520
 Well what are the responses that you have so far 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.890

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.840

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.929
 three points thai that still misses a nice one 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.160
 to be able to donate and then 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.140

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.629
