00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello to all friends of a turin today we will go to review walrus football 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.059
 a very nice pastime and available in the appstore for the price of 79 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.639
 cents 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.859
 also available for aipad being more different 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.859
 let's go see the game then 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:23.829
 party 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.829
 his screen as you can see interfaces 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.390
 capacitor I call immediately to see 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.950
 in what area is it substantially we should turn these punishments 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.809
 total estimate to make 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.970
 more goals to increase our or score 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.739
 as a game that is essentially based 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.570
 on sharing your score 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.030
 and also for% 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.670
 regarding 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.560
 unlockable goals 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.350
 then let's see the dynamics immediately 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.060
 us this is the main screen 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.790
 Sorry picnik of the game 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.790
 we should do nothing but 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.740
 to press 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.780
 our finger on the ball 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.380
 with a pub I am poor ok 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.050
 declared 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.270
 the famous also upwards 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.900
 in such a way 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.800
 to assign 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.960
 we have it down here 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.210
 to the right 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.350
 the button 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.160
 then we will have the various settings 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.580
 the distance 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.720
 between ball and goal 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.320
 at the top left we would have the score 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.680
 listening 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.150
 then score that must be beaten 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.010
 then here 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.470
 we will have the screw lives like 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.600
 as lele we take a monolith in substance we will have to try to make goals 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.680
 it is by staying as close as possible 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.120
 then turn off 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.570
 at the two poles and the crossbar 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.000
 these are played slowly we will go 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.059
 forward 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:14.480
 we'll find defenders that we obviously won't have to hit like this 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.299
 since then 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.930
 if we don't have any 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.369
 the life 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:22.759
 we will finish the game immediately 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.759
 now sorry but I'm playing with the screen of the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.809
 camera then 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.809
 I try to go as far as possible 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.719
 in this way 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.249
 we will 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.249
 to play 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:44.260
 here in this case the ball went close 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:46.120
 at the crossbar 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.429
 then entered the blue zone 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.840
 so we have to see how much you can see 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.359
 I took a life 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.449
 so that later 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.349
 dassault of I show 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.109
 such an ass way 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.409
 I pull it out 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.659
 here too, paradoxically, to hit poker 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.819
 see in this case for 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.949
 after pulled out and lost a life for I still have the chance 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:13.799
 of playing 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.939
 in this case, too, I took the crossbar and then another life lost 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:22.310
 and also in this case if I then hit the defender against 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:23.149
 goalkeeper 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:25.209
 the finished game 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.859
 final screen 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.389
 % 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.859
 the facts 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.419
 all taught so we have 1 in 10 out of 13 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.469
 the time taken 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.289
 ske the blue areas 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:41.509
 who we went to take queen this case 2 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:44.569
 then final score 10 out of 13 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:45.450
 TV 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.129
 indeed 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.129
 let's take a quick look at the menu 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.489
 we have. play where we can 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.209
 go to choose between 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.600
 first option comes basically 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.419
 drawn with me how to play 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:05.699
 practice 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:11.109
 of course we will go to practice a little before starting the 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.989
 arcade mode 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.870
 baresi the present one 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.870
 and this way we will have to go 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.760
 centering targets inside the door are among targets 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.419
 it brings and we will have to go in this way 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:33.990
 hit them all 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.340
 in such a way that 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.659
 earn score and stay in the game 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:40.999
 as long as possible 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.590
 if we are going to take the center of the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.080
 of the mou era 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.039
 of the circle 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.289
 we will gain 3 seconds instead we score 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.759
 without taking the viewfinder 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.789
 we will have extra seconds 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.520
 if instead 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.900
 we will only hit once 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.900
 so not in the red circle 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.240
 we will not take it 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.430
 I can 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.629
 I can not do it 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.039
 photo however substance the game 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.589
 the mode 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:24.879
 it's this one 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.279
 then we have another time attack mode 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.630
 same thing we will have to signal 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.490
 miu miu 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.539
 where to deliver 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:37.240
 then if we mark we have 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.600
 one more second 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.340
 if instead we make goals in the blue area we vindicated before we will earn three 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.620
 points 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.860
 if we will make a ski line shoulder strap 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.830
 therefore jesi. of the door the ball will become fiery in such a way that if 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.449
 we will hit a defender elements during the tour this will be beaten and us 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:00.580
 We will mark 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.050
 in a normal way 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.050
 as if we had struck a hymn 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.410
 then we have the mode 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.999
 online multiplayr e 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:11.610
 I passed plays 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.819
 so if we are in the company of only one aifon and in any case. to the octopus to ipad 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:19.979
 make a chance to play 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.830
 with our friends 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.450
 mayfly krkic 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.260
 are the statistics so time played time in practice time in arcade and so 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.969
 Street 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:33.379
 but also the possibility of resetting all the statistics 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:37.050
 then we have the goals of openfeint e 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.089
 and those of game centers of course 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:42.059
 they are both the same 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:45.889
 basically only the fact that we have the possibility changes 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.409
 d create an online ranking with our friends 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.509
 Quick look also option

 sound possibility to activate or not sound goal camera 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:02.939
 for when we're about to score in the blue zone 

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:05.819
 we will have this automatic joomla 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:09.089
 vote game share credits 

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:10.449
