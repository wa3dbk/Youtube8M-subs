00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.970
 as it is and is new to the channel it is 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.309
 as you are seeing in the thumbnail as 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.190
 you are seeing in the new title call of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.410
 duty and you're telling me greve if you do 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.480
 less than a month has come out with the wheats 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.970
 are you foolish how is going to come out now 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.250
 new call of duty could well explain 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.560
 everything about this new call of duty 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.330
 because if it is true he confirmed it they have 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.949
 Already uploaded several youtubers and we're going to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.019
 talk a lot of things selling a 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.400
 been reporting a lot of things 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.669
 about this new call of duty I'm going to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.110
 tell what is this about what this is 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.120
 It turns out that the Chinese are not good 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.420
 very given to play with the titles are 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.699
 more than starcraft of lol it that's 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.379
 a massive player now yes so that I 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.989
 you understand then activision has said 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.780
 if we get the Chinese to be 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.910
 initiate a call of duty the money that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.710
 let's win new nor average normal or 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.260
 either division is already gold because it would be 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.019
 incredible diamond platini zado 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.120
 activision would be mega rich then they have 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.559
 seen it's worth it then we're going to expensive 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.610
 let's get a new call of duty for 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.470
 China 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.510
 to get a new call of duty that receives 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.420
 the name of call of duty online 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.270
 free totally free to play and for 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.130
 tpc platform the best thing is that the rest 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.140
 of the European world in our case 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.690
 we will also be able to access 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.430
 download this game is exclusive to 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.470
 the pc platform 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.840
 I think it serves that if activision that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.120
 has a great reception for our 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.010
 part because I guess they will get a patch 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.220
 to put it in English and the whole host 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.600
 well I do this video because apart from 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.700
 that they get a new call of duty that this 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.710
 channel is based on call of duty what more 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.390
 fascinated me is the game itself and the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.340
 trailers later in this video 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.500
 Let's analyze why 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.820
 imagine that we put all the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.440
 Multiplayer manufacturers to 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.950
 date less with the typical 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.340
 cot 4 of modern warfare 2 the thing not us 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.580
 warfare 3 and the imagined costs that the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.080
 you put together a mix there a concoction 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.540
 well the call of duty that would come out and 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.270
 resulting is this call of duty call of 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.009
 duty online turns out to be a union one 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.780
 remastering the previous call 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.550
 of duty that they have put together I believe in what 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.650
 best of each 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.890
 next to maps of modern court 4 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.060
 warfare 2 with weapons several streaks are not 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.160
 go see the trailers that look a 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.230
 lot of things of those that already 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.450
 Later we will comment and the best 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.400
 is that it also includes zombies that if 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.840
 it's the mega cock from there comes this 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.140
 miniature of a zombie trailer that 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.350
 we will also analyze what is called 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.390
 the rising and like the racing game 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.060
 Well, that's what zombies are called, nothing more 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.580
 kids as soon as I know how to download 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.690
 this game like vitiate us because it 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.820
 supposes that it has already gone on sale 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.830
 you leave the Chinese source in the description 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.290

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.120

 that you some video nothing more kids 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.590
 let's move on to analyze 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.000
 the trailers of this new call of duty 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.280
 Let's go there 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.440
 we started with the analysis of the first 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.060
 trailer I tried to catch the best 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.090
 that I found on the page and we already have 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.350
 matojos del 4 with soft helicopter 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.650
 background 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.790
 24 map that I do not remember with lacquer 47 no 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.350
 I remember because basically I do not 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.120
 I played this map that I had not seen 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.580
 never by the way mega glasses 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.350
 hyperreal to break this map of the 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.540
 call of duty 4 but that I do not 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.770
 I agree how funny it is with the rpd you 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.200
 they nail a red knife made in the 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.390
 back a map of modern warfare 2 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.860
 here we already take out the clear ones that yes 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.320
 how are we doing modern warfare to 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.480
 we all get the rpg a franc that 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.150
 it seems in 2000 quad a frank staple with 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.510
 zinc betis of modern warfare 3 in knock 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.820
 down from whites 1 ak-47 which is the base 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.250
 of today what game was air support 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.989
 be streak that was a mega hyper 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.510
 super mega che tata you did here 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.239
 nothing in tafí of a million soldiers and 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.560
 bushes and we have it we take a 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.270
 modern warfare2 rocket launchers 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.430
 obviously I can not remember 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.070
 all because they are already many colors and 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.470
 too many would say I killed the support 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.940
 aerial we destroyed the helicopter state 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.210
 the modern warfare 2 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.890
 the red dot c4 there are those who eat another 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.410
 map of the corvette and 4 with what it looks like 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.180
 to be an air support or a harrier this 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.459
 map that I never had this for 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.560
 true 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.270
 basically combine with citi 4 with 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.220
 modern warfare 2 mostly 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.139
 it also translates into more secondary things 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.720
 of others with the types or are both 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.449

 12 and combined with a remington that 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.360
 Leave the guy burning if you can give him

 to go heating up second trailer 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.030
 we change the blue letters there is a big 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.010
 music synchronization at the beginning 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.580
 I let you listen and synchronize 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.580
 of music 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.080

 hours played by bullet is that I do not have 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.770

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.330

 I understand do not try to relate the 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.190
 story of zombies that we already know with 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.710
 the zombie story of this one because 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.030
 can be totally different can

 mean that in white 3 alomejor 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.220

 I know 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.000

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.510
 very good idea and maybe leave out the 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.180

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:51.320

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.320
