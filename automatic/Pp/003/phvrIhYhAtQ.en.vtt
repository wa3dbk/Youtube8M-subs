00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.849
 Now let's have a look 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:31.880
 a bit more precise and that on the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:33.739
 Let's get started with the video platform 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.020
 last update of sat clock on the 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.690
 videoweb tv platform converts her 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.540
 really videoweb tv in a right one 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.280
 full fledged smart tv box around you have you 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.910
 the possibility now within 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.859
 zattoo directly access to media libraries 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.739
 and that is a fusion of that 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.890
 really really from other smart tv boxes 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.859
 at the moment, yes, it is still qualitative 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.140
 sd content about whopping aired satiated 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.600
 currently tests but hd content that 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.239
 So for people that means the premium 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.159
 will use the offer in the future 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.400
 possibility also have certain transmitters 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.140
 in hd stream zattoo is very simple 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.460
 you can build up between them 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.170
 switch individual transmitters back and forth 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.800
 you have the possibility between 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.960
 national regional and international 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.850
 to choose stations then you have the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.140
 possibility on the current tv program 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.910
 access 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.250
 there you have an overview what 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.490
 currently running and what in the next 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.690
 hours of broadcasts and then just 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.390
 the special thing I now too 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.860
 has changed is that within 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.060
 certain sender to a HbbTV offer 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.770
 have the opportunity to have integrated 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.010
 directly access the media library 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.970
 without leaving the application 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.220
 the whole is of course not yet 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.380
 Full replacement for satellite or 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.050
 In any case, for the cable also like 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.480
 private broadcasters like rtl prosieben or 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.040
 sat 1 want to watch but that 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.720
 Of course, in the future may still be 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.620
 to change 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.270
 In any case, that will be a very 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.280
 exciting year because the limits 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.810
 between online streaming the online 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.490
 Applications on the corresponding 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.490
 platforms merge 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:19.010
 yes , that's a story in itself 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.109
 what concerns me first his parents 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.459
 concerns my parents concerns the 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.230
 like to follow the media libraries 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.120
 access and then we said good 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.569
 we have the practical solution we need 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.510
 have a video web &amp; chÃ¢teaux and have 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.700
 the video web put there and everything 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.310
 as far as set up explains also largest 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.230
 player works and then 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.379
 It does not work and indeed it does 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.290
 then had that back and forth 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.430
 on the one hand, that meant jumping 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.069
 but if you look at the 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.310
 One had to access the media libraries 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.799
 then out there again and had to go back 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.019
 button and back under the button 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.030
 choose menus then to the media libraries 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.340
 to come and that just exceeded then 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.870
 but the technical skills of mine 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.329
 Parents as we said also notice the 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.609
 sequences to remember so that 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.319
 you just say okay then you have to go to the 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.629
 start application then you are in the 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.780
 have mediathek within the media library 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.150
 you do not even if you do not 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.479
 every day with computers or with 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.639
 such techniques as you say 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:24.109
 then busy you can do that yourself 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.430
 logically also not imagine where am I 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.590
 Now what am I doing here? 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.180
 that was then easy to complicate and 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.769
 that's the problem, I think 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.540
 It always gets bigger here 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.290
 technical revolution so that 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.209
 teletext is replaced by hbbtv 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.609
 the problem is that just now 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.290
 older ones with the new media libraries 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.329
 really have their difficulties 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.579
 baywa teletext you had your side 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.709
 number because you had to go to 300 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.209
 and I have my program overview 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.129
 number son so much I mean 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.010
 weather our thing and that randomly and 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.260
 it was always the same number and here 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.269
 You really have to go through menus 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.790
 So shimmy also just the ard 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.549
 Media Center looks all great looks 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.650
 Everything really chic but around 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.579
 within a week a broadcast 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.530
 to find 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.049
 So there you have to first in the main 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.129
 media library then you have the date 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.290
 choose 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.120
 even that did not always work 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.130
 one hundred percent so just because you me 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.079
 still with arrow keys and the keys on 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.639
 the remote control is not working 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.909
 same as the keyboard to use 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.009
 for example and then there really is one 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.699
 to find broadcast there have the 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.960
 given up 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.099
 well , that's what mine mean 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.990
 mother-in-law my father-in-law 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:36.499
 then said then near so finally 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.949
 but rather have a hdmi directly and 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:41.840
 use and that worked out then 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:44.180
 and at zattoo and videoweb now the 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.979
 combination is just just great this 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.400
 intervene that we can do that 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.529
 out of the TV program and must 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.389
 then in the mediatheken and then there 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:54.289
 has to go through this is such a 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.849
 fell a bit away 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.340
 Now we have just that 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.199
 tv program the mediathek the 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.060
 difficulty programs within the 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.240
 Finding media libraries is still possible 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.430
 available but video web in combination 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.500
 with zattoo offers just something 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.509
 equivalent to cable or 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.500
 satellite reception that you really 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:17.150
 can say so the teletext replacement is 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.669
 also within nature application 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.229
 available and I think that I am 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.270
 also within the mediatheken there must 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.580
 still what to do that it just 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.089
 clearer direct access to 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.979
 Certain areas may be 

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:32.990
 also the language in the future that the 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.300
 yes, many televisions work now 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.830
 that you have language input and that is 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.719
 maybe what where then older ones too 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.819
 easy access without problems 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:43.419
 if you can just say 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:45.469
 Saturday second third I want 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.060
 movie or something and then they get 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:49.759
 counted the list of feature films 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.589
 Let's see how long that will take yes 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.240
 but otherwise a great extension 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:57.110
 finds great what's videoweb there 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.310
 currently everything is moving and up 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.610
 every case is interesting again 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.050
 Let's try that on everyone 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.069
 case on and if mine 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.960
 in-laws there as well 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.189
 a bit push that she 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.969
 Do a little more testing for us 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:09.969
 OK
