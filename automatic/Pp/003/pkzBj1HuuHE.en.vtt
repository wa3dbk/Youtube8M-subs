and then down here on the corners you

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.240 
and then down here on the corners you
can<00:01:17.640> attach<00:01:18.600> these<00:01:19.020> lines<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:20.310> logs<00:01:21.200> rocks

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250

tree<00:01:23.250> branches<00:01:23.820> trees<00:01:24.630> right<00:01:25.110> now<00:01:25.140> we've<00:01:25.710> got

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
tree branches trees right now we've got

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.300 
tree branches trees right now we've got
the<00:01:26.640> lines<00:01:26.850> attached<00:01:27.330> around<00:01:27.630> logs<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.950> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the lines attached around logs so you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.789 
the lines attached around logs so you
can<00:01:29.640> use<00:01:29.970> stakes<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.020> need<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.350> stake<00:01:31.590> this

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
can use stakes if you need to stake this

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.219 
can use stakes if you need to stake this
out<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.640> stakes<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:33.119> not<00:01:33.150> included<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:33.990> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
out the stakes are not included so you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.870 
out the stakes are not included so you
would<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> bring<00:01:34.890> those<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.400> purchase

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
would have to bring those or purchase

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.300 
would have to bring those or purchase
them<00:01:36.030> separately<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:37.200> again<00:01:37.680> they<00:01:37.920> set<00:01:38.159> up

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
them separately but again they set up

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.749 
them separately but again they set up
really<00:01:38.579> well<00:01:38.850> around<00:01:39.780> other<00:01:40.200> things<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
really well around other things in the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.660 
really well around other things in the
forest<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.020> don't<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.560> things<00:01:44.520> like

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
forest so if you don't have things like

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.819 
forest so if you don't have things like
sticks<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.240> logs<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:46.259> definitely<00:01:46.649> want<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
sticks and logs you definitely want to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.340 
sticks and logs you definitely want to
bring<00:01:47.040> some<00:01:47.280> stakes<00:01:47.640> along<00:01:48.000> with<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.450> again

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
bring some stakes along with you again

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.350 
bring some stakes along with you again
setup<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.009> really<00:01:50.189> simple<00:01:50.759> what<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> normally

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
setup is really simple what I normally

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.889 
setup is really simple what I normally
do<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.290> set<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.100> up<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.700> loose<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.570> begin

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
do is set it up really loose to begin

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.810 
do is set it up really loose to begin
with<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> attach<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> two<00:01:56.520> trees
