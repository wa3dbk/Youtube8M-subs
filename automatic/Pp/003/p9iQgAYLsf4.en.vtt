taps<00:01:19.140> before<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.650> actually<00:01:19.770> worked<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.820> home

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939

I<00:01:36.060> didn't<00:01:36.420> really<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.930> much<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.320> that's

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
I didn't really use it much but that's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.050 
I didn't really use it much but that's
just<00:01:37.590> because<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.009> don't<00:01:38.310> use<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> TV<00:01:38.909> that

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
just because I don't use the TV that

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.700 
just because I don't use the TV that
much<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.600> does<00:01:39.750> work<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> works<00:01:40.619> very

is<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> little<00:01:48.869> bit<00:01:48.990> weird<00:01:49.170> considering<00:01:49.530> most

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
is a little bit weird considering most

premier<00:02:01.020> features<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.130> what<00:02:02.280> HTC<00:02:02.820> calls

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
premier features this is what HTC calls

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.389 
premier features this is what HTC calls
the<00:02:03.270> ultrapixel<00:02:03.659> camera<00:02:04.250> basically<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> idea

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
the ultrapixel camera basically the idea

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.340 
the ultrapixel camera basically the idea
here<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.119> instead<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
here is that instead of going with the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.139 
here is that instead of going with the
megapixel<00:02:07.920> race<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.399> adding<00:02:08.670> as<00:02:08.759> many<00:02:08.940> as

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
megapixel race and adding as many as

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.119 
megapixel race and adding as many as
they<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.929> decided<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.470> stick<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:10.739> 4

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
they can they decided to stick with 4

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.250 
they can they decided to stick with 4
megapixels<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.300> make<00:02:12.480> those<00:02:12.629> pixels<00:02:12.930> bigger

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
megapixels but make those pixels bigger

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.790 
megapixels but make those pixels bigger
so<00:02:13.560> that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
so that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.590 
so that
you<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:13.950> actually<00:02:14.130> gather<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.730> lot<00:02:15.150> more<00:02:15.360> light

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
you can actually gather a lot more light

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.570 
you can actually gather a lot more light
in<00:02:15.840> practice<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.770> find<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.190> yes<00:02:17.400> it

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
in practice I find that yes it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.580 
in practice I find that yes it
definitely<00:02:17.820> gathers<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.360> lot<00:02:18.630> more<00:02:18.780> light<00:02:19.020> but

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
definitely gathers a lot more light but

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.110 
definitely gathers a lot more light but
at<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.800> same<00:02:20.010> time<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.370> can<00:02:20.520> really<00:02:20.790> tell

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
at the same time you can really tell

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.940 
at the same time you can really tell
that<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.510> lacking<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.110> megapixel<00:02:22.680> range

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
that it's lacking in the megapixel range

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.400 
that it's lacking in the megapixel range
1080p<00:02:23.880> video<00:02:24.150> looks<00:02:24.420> great<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.080> at<00:02:25.230> full

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
1080p video looks great and it's at full

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.660 
1080p video looks great and it's at full
resolution<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.190> there's<00:02:26.370> no<00:02:26.490> degradation

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
resolution so there's no degradation

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.910 
resolution so there's no degradation
there<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.810> stabilization<00:02:28.500> works<00:02:28.680> really

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
there the stabilization works really

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.560 
there the stabilization works really
well<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> colors<00:02:29.580> look<00:02:29.670> good<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.450> when

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
well and the colors look good but when

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.000 
well and the colors look good but when
moving<00:02:30.780> over<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.140> pictures<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.590> found<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.920> was

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
moving over to pictures I found it was

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.410 
moving over to pictures I found it was
leaving<00:02:32.340> me<00:02:32.430> with<00:02:32.640> something<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.240> desired

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
leaving me with something to be desired

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.360 
leaving me with something to be desired
it<00:02:34.320> definitely<00:02:34.530> works<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.070> most<00:02:35.220> people

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
it definitely works and most people

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.710 
it definitely works and most people
won't<00:02:35.550> care<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:35.880> it's<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.210> lower<00:02:36.360> resolution

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
won't care that it's a lower resolution

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.630 
won't care that it's a lower resolution
but<00:02:37.410> for<00:02:37.560> whatever<00:02:37.680> reason<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.460> definitely

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
but for whatever reason I can definitely

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.820 
but for whatever reason I can definitely

lot when taking a picture of animals

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.180 
lot when taking a picture of animals
