lag<00:03:54.020> in<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:55.730> game<00:03:56.210> is<00:03:56.360> also<00:03:56.570> loading

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
lag in it and the game is also loading

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.190 
lag in it and the game is also loading
very<00:03:57.170> fast<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:59.290> lexie<00:04:00.290> like<00:04:00.500> how<00:04:01.430> its

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
very fast and lexie like how its

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:12.820 
very fast and lexie like how its
accelerometer<00:04:03.200> VX

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:20.720 

so<00:04:13.830> it's<00:04:14.040> learning<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:19.040> see<00:04:20.040> now<00:04:20.250> like<00:04:20.519> the

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
so it's learning to see now like the

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.820 
so it's learning to see now like the
kind<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.060> graphics<00:04:21.570> is<00:04:21.780> also<00:04:22.140> very<00:04:22.290> fine<00:04:22.620> in

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
kind of graphics is also very fine in

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:32.480 
kind of graphics is also very fine in
this

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:50.870 

and<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.640> belong<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.000> each<00:04:34.330> other<00:04:34.540> group

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.240 

so<00:04:51.540> like<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.110> beginning<00:04:52.590> excellence<00:04:53.070> is

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
so like the beginning excellence is

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:00.920 
so like the beginning excellence is
externally<00:04:54.060> this<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:59.070> it's<00:04:59.910> it's<00:05:00.420> a<00:05:00.600> very<00:05:00.630> good

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
externally this so it's it's a very good

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.750 
externally this so it's it's a very good
budget<00:05:01.530> phone<00:05:01.940> with<00:05:02.940> good<00:05:03.260> specs<00:05:04.260> in<00:05:04.530> it<00:05:04.680> I
