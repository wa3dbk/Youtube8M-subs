00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
inside the phone very carefully we've

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.100 
inside the phone very carefully we've
created<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.340> new<00:02:29.519> much<00:02:30.000> smaller<00:02:30.450> lightning

created the new much smaller lightning
connector<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:32.099> all<00:02:32.340> digital<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.269> it's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
connector it's all digital so it's

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.110 
connector it's all digital so it's
designed<00:02:33.690> for<00:02:34.049> today's<00:02:34.200> uses<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:35.250> we<00:02:35.879> made<00:02:36.090> it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
designed for today's uses and we made it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.800 
designed for today's uses and we made it
reversible<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.349> fits<00:02:37.620> either<00:02:37.860> way<00:02:38.630> we<00:02:39.630> also

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
reversible so it fits either way we also
