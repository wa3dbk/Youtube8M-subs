00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.660
 Talk to people here, who's talking? 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.269
 Alpha and butt this time I 'm here to 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.080
 talk about the new generation of tablets that 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.210
 state government of pernambuco 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.260
 distributed to students in higher education 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.600
 medium and to speak also my 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.199
 opinion about this change if it is good 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.490
 not 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.689
 so come on first it's the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.140
 components that come 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.899
 the tablet product itself is not also a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.440
 fast kia where you can learn from 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.920
 every thing stays and comes the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.440
 Loader is here, come on. 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.329
 First of all I want to talk both 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.570
 more visible things you can have 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.309
 hence it is primarily the brand because 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.570
 this new generation the brand has changed 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:02.219
 Formerly it was cc now it is positive it 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.809
 was a good thing because I think the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.790
 positive quality is better than 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:13.200
 This is the other big change that has 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.740
 was the standard color was black and white 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.159
 now it's white and blue something else 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.580
 It is also part of this part here 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.040
 Iraq for those who have also changed a lot 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.920
 because the design is different is a 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.200
 a little more modern business 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.320
 I looked at him a little and saw that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.270
 some things small things only 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:43.350
 they left the place they should be 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:46.439
 How do you start? 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.820
 there is a new button here on the panel with 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.799
 What is the normal power button here? 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.079
 one of the two buttons she wants to 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.009
 connect the webcam and look at me the part 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.649
 your favorites something like this and have 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.689
 this button novak that such - that I remember 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.990
 on the other did not have that is the 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:11.310
 start you wanted it to stand out as 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.260
 usually has in cabinets something else 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.909
 It was also the microphone. 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.040
 the fan of leaving a place the microphone 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.379
 usually stayed here it came to rest 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.319
 here near the webcam 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.659
 okay and also has this luizinho that that 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.709
 from what I saw it has to do with the 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.959
 keyboard 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.069
 ok if the keyboard was somehow 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.470
 off 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.340
 this light turns off because if it is 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.049
 off 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.110
 it means that the keyboard has some 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.690
 problem and can also be used on you 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.519
 and in case you go down like this to see if 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.269
 Even at night I understood 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:51.540
 here above aktel be a normal webcam 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:57.900
 I think the same quality and good had 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:01.260
 An issue here that was hdmi is on 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.739
 another did not have at least one 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.810
 hdmi port and also the door to the iss 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.480
 Where you put the card changed place 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.409
 He came here, he still has one. 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.420
 Toxic system in with the pen is 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.280
 with the pen you click with the pen and 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.970
 will work in normal things 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.379
 they say they have released it on 28 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:28.530
 because windows 8 it is more appropriate 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.639
 for this kind of material that was made 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.680
 either for pc 6 with the normal mouse or 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.290
 you use as a toxicant and this one 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.699
 two then would be perfect at 28 for him 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.699
 be complete 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.900
 just to make it clear that she's still going 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.870
 behind so take a little bit 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.569
 okay here we go for 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.750
 settings starts at 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:59.090
 settings it is next to 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:02.760
 intel atom processor is the intel atom 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.010
 standard for all basic notebooks and the 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.389
 ram memory is still 2 gb of 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.400
 RAM memory 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:12.750
 now the operating system I saw that 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.900
 changed before came 64 bit now 32 bit 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.889
 and I know well why they 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.850
 did I I do not know think himself 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:26.450
 occupying does not support 1 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.870
 64 bits but anyway I thought it would be 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.540
 better with the 104 because it gives more support 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:37.340
 to rock programs 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.470
 Just let it down here and now I'm going 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.500
 take a look and I will show here the 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.930
 You guys, I really liked it. 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.520
 what did they do in this new 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:54.350
 this new model is the following 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:58.160
 hd's memory to face the first 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:02.180
 It took a while for the show to be here for you. 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:07.400
 see edited said the government gave the 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:11.240
 memory is very little 35 gigs only 35 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.950
 gigas and man, this was not good 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.780
 It's just not good because we do not have 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:19.910
 a lot of space to do things 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:22.270
 ok the luck is that now by the looks of it 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.480
 number of places is surprisingly 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.560
 high 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:31.550
 It's me, it's good because now we 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.010
 You'll be able to do a lot of things. 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.920
 most movies songs like this 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.500
 put some games that run and good 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.920
 This is a good thing, it's a thing. 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.040
 interesting because old of 35 to 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:49.100
 fight now 400 nÃ© 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.050
 another addition that I noticed and I 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.080
 I thought I should have come in the 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.770
 Another was the addition of the 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.020
 bluetooth communication you can is 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.690
 to communicate with other devices 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.080
 informs that they exchange information and 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:08.090
 files are via bluetooth 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.940
 This should have been released, I do not know. 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.400
 That only came now but it's ok I 'll go 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.190
 staying here because this was my 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.480
 opinion on the new model of the 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.590
 tablet of the state government of 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.710
 pernambuco 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.990
 I think I found it the best of it 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:27.740
 were good were good but should have 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.290
 more like for example admission on 28 and 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.200
 toxic to be used there are no fingers to 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.790
 by the pen as it comes 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.340
 traditionally 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.750
 to all the other things that were 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.480
 added I liked it 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.580
 Um, that's it, I really hope
