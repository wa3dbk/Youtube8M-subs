surprisingly this is you know some of

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:41.939 
surprisingly this is you know some of
the<00:00:40.839> first<00:00:41.019> area<00:00:41.319> where<00:00:41.530> people<00:00:41.559> really

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
the first area where people really

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.559 
the first area where people really
started<00:00:42.339> seeing<00:00:42.609> really<00:00:42.819> high<00:00:43.059> rates<00:00:43.329> of<00:00:43.510> the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:43.569 
started seeing really high rates of the

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:45.270 
started seeing really high rates of the
sylvia<00:00:44.109> can<00:00:44.199> a<00:00:44.379> lot<00:00:44.499> of<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.679> health<00:00:44.859> problems

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280

I'm<00:00:46.239> totally<00:00:46.479> blanking<00:00:46.809> on<00:00:46.899> the<00:00:46.960> guy's<00:00:47.170> name

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
I'm totally blanking on the guy's name

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.799 
I'm totally blanking on the guy's name
with<00:00:47.589> the<00:00:47.679> immunologist<00:00:48.280> who<00:00:48.550> track<00:00:49.389> down<00:00:49.569> the

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
with the immunologist who track down the

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.649 
with the immunologist who track down the
combined<00:00:50.999> mechanism<00:00:51.999> of<00:00:52.120> autoimmunity

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
combined mechanism of autoimmunity

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.500 
combined mechanism of autoimmunity
related<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.440> celiac<00:00:53.769> is<00:00:54.100> from<00:00:54.399> Italy<00:00:54.579> so<00:00:55.030> we

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
related to celiac is from Italy so we

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.349 
related to celiac is from Italy so we
just<00:00:55.659> did<00:00:55.809> a<00:00:55.839> little<00:00:56.019> poking<00:00:56.199> around<00:00:56.469> and<00:00:56.769> we

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
just did a little poking around and we

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.729 
just did a little poking around and we
look<00:00:58.359> for<00:00:58.859> diphtheria<00:00:59.859> sends<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.760> twin<00:01:00.969> DNA<00:01:01.359> and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
look for diphtheria sends a twin DNA and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.140 
look for diphtheria sends a twin DNA and
we<00:01:02.739> found<00:01:03.039> this<00:01:03.459> one<00:01:03.699> and<00:01:03.879> then<00:01:03.940> there's

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
we found this one and then there's

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.310 
we found this one and then there's
another<00:01:04.210> one<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.750> other<00:01:04.869> side<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.199> the

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
another one on the other side of the

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.630 
another one on the other side of the
Duomo<00:01:05.560> we're<00:01:05.920> on<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.100> back<00:01:06.250> side<00:01:06.430> of<00:01:06.490> the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
Duomo we're on the back side of the

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.720 
Duomo we're on the back side of the
Duomo<00:01:06.820> right<00:01:07.150> now<00:01:07.299> and<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:08.830> not<00:01:09.160> only<00:01:09.280> have<00:01:09.700> a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
Duomo right now and they not only have a

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.430 
Duomo right now and they not only have a
separate<00:01:10.090> mix<00:01:10.330> but<00:01:10.570> they<00:01:10.660> also<00:01:10.780> cook<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.230> in<00:01:11.350> a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
separate mix but they also cook it in a

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.230 
separate mix but they also cook it in a
separate<00:01:11.830> oven<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:12.400> you<00:01:12.490> just<00:01:12.820> have<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.120> do<00:01:13.210> a

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
separate oven so you just have to do a

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.570 
separate oven so you just have to do a
little<00:01:13.420> bit<00:01:13.690> of<00:01:13.720> poking<00:01:14.650> around<00:01:14.770> even<00:01:15.460> if

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
little bit of poking around even if

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.790 
little bit of poking around even if
you're<00:01:16.290> traveling<00:01:17.290> and<00:01:17.440> you<00:01:17.500> can<00:01:17.650> usually
