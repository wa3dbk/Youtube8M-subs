00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.770
Make sure you whisper 
as quietly as you can.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.150
If you're too loud, it'll break the spell.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.120
Roger.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.870
We'll be able to see them soon.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.670
What is that?

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.920
We can't see them yet?

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.990
It isn't a player.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.330
A bat?

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.760
It's red and small.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.860
H-Hey, what's wrong?

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.070
That's a high-level tracing searcher.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.530
We have to destroy it!

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.970
Run, Kirito-kun!

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.660
Can't we just hide again?

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.520
The enemy knows we blew up their tracer.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.400
We won't be able to fool them.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.750
And that was a fire element familiar.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.130
Which means that the approaching party...

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.550
Salamanders?

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.520
But what is a group of 
Salamanders doing here?

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.560
It's a lake...

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.280
Looks like we're going to make it.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.240
Don't lower your guard and fall in.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.580
Crap.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.470
That won't work.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.720
You should've said something sooner.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.580
You're in too big a hurry.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.690
This is an earth magic barrier.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.290
Physical attacks won't break it.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.870
Can we jump in the lake?

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.640
Nope.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.280
Supposedly, there are extremely 
high-level monsters in the water.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.480
Fighting without an Undine backing 
you up would be suicide.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.360
Then we have to fight?

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.030
Yeah, but it might not be too easy.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.990
If the Salamanders can use 
high-level earth magic,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.890
they have a powerful mage.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.590
Leafa...

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.440
It isn't that I don't trust your 
skills as a swordsman.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.480
But could you handle support from here?

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.600
I want you to stay in the back and heal me.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.510
That way, I can fight harder.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.540
They're focusing on taking him out.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.140
Kirito-kun!

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.930
He'll run out of HP at this rate...

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.240
That's enough Kirito-kun.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.300
If we lose, we'll just have 
to fly a few more hours!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.720
Let's give up!

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.520
No way.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.670
While I'm alive, I won't let 
any party members die.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.230
I will never let that happen!

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.130
What the hell?

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.790
What's he doing?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.060
This is your only chance!

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.050
Chance?

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.440
Use all the mana you have left

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.550
to block the next magic attack!

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.020
B-But that won't help.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.790
Daddy, now!

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.120
That's illusion magic.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.150
But it only makes you 
look like a big monster.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.120
Is that you, Kirito-kun?

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.680
Idiot!

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.420
Don't break formation!

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.810
It just looks scary and has long reach.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.970
If we stick to the plan and stay in formation,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.690
the damage won't get through!

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.330
E-Explosion magic!

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.270
R-Retreat!

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.860
Retreat!

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.800
Stop!

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.260
Kirito-kun, let him live!

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.770
That was amazing, wasn't it?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.330
Ow...

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.150
Now, why don't you explain 
who sent you here?
