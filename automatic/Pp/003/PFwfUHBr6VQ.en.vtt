00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
you can see that we've got squares here

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.660 
you can see that we've got squares here
filled<00:00:14.110> in<00:00:14.230> with<00:00:14.349> two<00:00:14.530> different<00:00:14.650> colors<00:00:15.099> the

two different colors just represent the
two<00:00:17.320> different<00:00:17.619> colors<00:00:17.859> of<00:00:17.919> yarns<00:00:18.279> that<00:00:18.310> we're

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
two different colors of yarns that we're

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.729 
two different colors of yarns that we're
going<00:00:18.609> to<00:00:18.669> be<00:00:18.759> using<00:00:18.939> I<00:00:19.289> already<00:00:20.289> decided<00:00:20.560> that

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:20.739 
going to be using I already decided that

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:22.470 
going to be using I already decided that
my<00:00:20.919> color<00:00:21.159> a<00:00:21.279> was<00:00:21.519> green<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:21.880> my<00:00:21.970> color<00:00:22.210> B<00:00:22.359> was

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
my color a was green and my color B was

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.880 
my color a was green and my color B was
blue<00:00:22.689> you<00:00:22.929> can<00:00:23.050> just<00:00:23.259> pick<00:00:23.409> just<00:00:23.619> make<00:00:23.739> sure

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
blue you can just pick just make sure

blue you can just pick just make sure
you<00:00:23.980> write<00:00:24.130> it<00:00:24.220> down<00:00:24.310> and<00:00:24.550> then<00:00:24.640> just<00:00:24.900> decide

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
you write it down and then just decide

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.929 
you write it down and then just decide
which<00:00:26.140> square<00:00:26.859> light<00:00:27.159> or<00:00:27.310> dark<00:00:27.519> is<00:00:27.669> going<00:00:27.880> to

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
which square light or dark is going to

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.079 
which square light or dark is going to
be<00:00:28.029> green<00:00:28.239> or<00:00:28.539> blue<00:00:28.749> um<00:00:29.849> mine<00:00:30.849> have

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.089 
be green or blue um mine have

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.240 
be green or blue um mine have
essentially<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:31.779> same<00:00:31.960> value<00:00:32.380> in<00:00:32.619> black<00:00:33.070> and

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
essentially the same value in black and

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.310 
essentially the same value in black and
white<00:00:33.340> so<00:00:33.399> I<00:00:33.579> just<00:00:33.789> picked<00:00:34.079> nothing.we<00:00:35.079> blue

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
white so I just picked nothing.we blue

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
for me and that one's going to be green

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.840 
for me and that one's going to be green
so<00:00:37.660> and<00:00:38.590> what<00:00:38.859> I'm<00:00:39.039> actually<00:00:39.250> going<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.640> say

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
feral chart we're always going to be

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:46.500 
feral chart we're always going to be
when<00:00:45.640> we're<00:00:45.760> knitting<00:00:45.910> in<00:00:46.059> the<00:00:46.089> round<00:00:46.179> we're

when we're knitting in the round we're
always<00:00:46.660> going<00:00:46.870> to<00:00:46.899> be<00:00:46.989> looking<00:00:47.289> at<00:00:47.589> this<00:00:47.710> chart

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
always going to be looking at this chart

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.090 
always going to be looking at this chart
from<00:00:48.219> right<00:00:48.609> to<00:00:48.879> left<00:00:49.359> and<00:00:49.929> each<00:00:50.559> square<00:00:50.920> on

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
from right to left and each square on

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.400 
from right to left and each square on
here<00:00:51.280> represents<00:00:51.910> one<00:00:52.210> stitch<00:00:52.539> and<00:00:52.839> this<00:00:53.260> is<00:00:53.379> a

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
here represents one stitch and this is a

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.229 
here represents one stitch and this is a
really<00:00:53.800> nice<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.249> simple<00:00:54.609> chart<00:00:54.879> because

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
really nice and simple chart because

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.239 
really nice and simple chart because
these<00:00:55.390> are<00:00:55.510> all<00:00:55.719> knit<00:00:56.649> stitches<00:00:56.920> we're

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
these are all knit stitches we're

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:58.619 
these are all knit stitches we're
knitting<00:00:57.519> this<00:00:57.609> whole<00:00:57.879> thing<00:00:58.089> we're<00:00:58.510> just

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
knitting this whole thing we're just

00:00:58.629 --> 00:00:59.939 
knitting this whole thing we're just
going<00:00:58.749> to<00:00:58.809> go<00:00:58.929> around<00:00:59.050> and<00:00:59.440> around<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.890> around

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
going to go around and around and around

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.899 
going to go around and around and around
from<00:01:00.460> right<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:00.670> left<00:01:00.820> every<00:01:01.539> single<00:01:01.870> round

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
from right to left every single round

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.360 
from right to left every single round
knitting<00:01:03.909> one<00:01:04.089> row<00:01:05.020> of<00:01:05.170> this<00:01:05.350> chart<00:01:05.650> like<00:01:06.220> that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
knitting one row of this chart like that

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.800 
knitting one row of this chart like that
so<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.580> only<00:01:06.640> thing<00:01:06.970> that<00:01:07.000> changes<00:01:07.450> here<00:01:07.690> is

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
so the only thing that changes here is

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.980 
so the only thing that changes here is
the<00:01:08.230> color<00:01:08.470> and<00:01:08.910> each<00:01:09.910> stitch<00:01:10.300> is<00:01:10.450> represented

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
the color and each stitch is represented

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.390 
the color and each stitch is represented
you<00:01:11.260> know<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.530> color<00:01:11.770> of<00:01:11.860> each<00:01:12.010> just<00:01:12.310> is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
you know the color of each just is

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.250 
you know the color of each just is
represented<00:01:12.910> by<00:01:12.940> a<00:01:13.090> colored<00:01:13.540> n<00:01:13.660> square<00:01:13.990> or<00:01:14.200> not

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
represented by a colored n square or not

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.110 
represented by a colored n square or not
so<00:01:15.010> you<00:01:15.100> can<00:01:15.190> see<00:01:15.370> that<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.610> first<00:01:15.850> whole

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
so you can see that the first whole

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.910 
so you can see that the first whole
round<00:01:17.070> from<00:01:18.070> me<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:18.460> blue<00:01:19.150> stitches<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.740> once

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
round from me is blue stitches so once

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.650 
round from me is blue stitches so once
you<00:01:21.100> get<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.730> end<00:01:21.880> of<00:01:22.000> this<00:01:22.090> chart<00:01:22.420> you

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
you get to the end of this chart you

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.850 
you get to the end of this chart you
just<00:01:22.870> read<00:01:23.050> it<00:01:23.140> from<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.290> beginning<00:01:23.470> until

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
just read it from the beginning until

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.990 
just read it from the beginning until
you<00:01:23.920> get<00:01:24.100> back<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.520> beginning

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
you get back to the beginning

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.450 
you get back to the beginning
so<00:01:25.480> um<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.720> what<00:01:29.080> I'm<00:01:29.170> going<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.380> do<00:01:29.620> is<00:01:29.860> show

and<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:38.200> reason<00:01:38.470> for<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:38.680> is<00:01:38.980> as<00:01:39.550> opposed<00:01:39.910> to

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
and the reason for that is as opposed to

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.090 
and the reason for that is as opposed to
using<00:01:40.330> like<00:01:40.480> a<00:01:40.690> pencil<00:01:41.050> to<00:01:41.290> cross<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.770> off<00:01:41.890> or

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
using like a pencil to cross it off or

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.460 
using like a pencil to cross it off or
nothing<00:01:42.460> at<00:01:42.730> all<00:01:42.820> or<00:01:43.090> whatever<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.510> it<00:01:44.110> helps

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
nothing at all or whatever is it helps

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.780 
nothing at all or whatever is it helps

to highlight this one and let's look at

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
to highlight this one and let's look at
the<00:02:28.540> next<00:02:28.750> row<00:02:28.900> we're<00:02:29.020> just<00:02:29.140> going<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.320> go<00:02:29.410> up

the next row we're just going to go up

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.670 
the next row we're just going to go up

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
all green squares so this means that

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.420 
all green squares so this means that
