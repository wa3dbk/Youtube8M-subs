00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.570
 and 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.519
 hello everyone I am girls is the new 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.990
 video of hardcore gamers and today we're going 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.910
 to do good is a video yes quickie 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.910
 to clarify a little the doubts that there were 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.750
 on the issue of the eggs they gave in 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.039
 the halloween campaign but all the 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.829
 firefight mode 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.210
 who gave us an egg and many people did not 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.500
 I knew how to see fill the egg not 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.160
 I knew what the egg was for 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.890
 and various things starting to solve 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.840
 quick way 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.110
 so that we are not a little more than 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.579
 we do with the ball to start the 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.410
 first game that we play in mode 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.980
 alierta and if I'm not mistaken they will give us a 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.980
 empty egg 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.600
 and it's like this that I have here but 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.440
 empty without colors from there on day 12 it 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.140
 opens and appears a cover without color color 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:09.640
 Naked naked without color 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.840
 then depending on the colors 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.490
 that we put inside the new color 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.430
 from others that we can put inside 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.630
 we can put it in essences that are 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.080
 how is it that this is the essence of 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.570
 I urge you to access uex other than 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.520
 It's blue and it's elongated and it 's the essence 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.930
 of quart depending on how many 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.940
 let's say we can make combinations 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.030
 as you see here 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.590
 handler inside three little balls of rut 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.650
 color a red one yellow from behind 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.930
 blue so prolonging down to caster 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.200
 blue on the left the three red ones the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.170
 right the yellow as you see from each 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.570
 a simple cheetahs the little arrows 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.340
 indicate mixtures you see above all 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.050
 the red will travel the yellow to 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.770
 orange 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.420
 blue straight for yellow and it comes out see 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.560
 with that you can make mixtures so that 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.560
 know the cover you want 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.509
 ay curios of red yellow blue 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.720
 purple green orange black white and without 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.720
 colour 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.180
 and depending on how many 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.920
 essences we put to each each color 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.300
 we will leave one level is from another 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.700
 level the only thing that influences I think it's 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.040
 in the animation of the covers is also not 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.920
 the second good if we put three 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.510
 yellow essences will have an animation 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.750
 of fire that we put only two 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.330
 those scooters are generated on 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.740
 a base that is quite cold and then at 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.920
 end of the video will be a picture there with 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.290
 all colors or ugly 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.569
 santa fe to which are added but 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.280
 mistaken 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:50.420
 tail eyes wings 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.130
 ras arms because also 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.590
 and similar things randomly 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.930
 so they will not be very similar between 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.849
 yes 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.280
 then you see that in mine he has a 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.040
 kind of aura around the aura the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.209
 grant to unusual essences 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.270
 different unusual does not fill a hole 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.700
 inside the eggs 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.250
 but they believe in the classroom that you see around 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.940
 you can see up to 3 that will increase the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.680
 probability the kind of effect that you 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.270
 a talk will not track Halcourier 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.610
 you know what you are going to do but you know that 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.030
 will give some kind of effect some kind 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.250
 of thing to the curious 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.330
 to fill something completely as I have 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.190
 I am that the 23 and 69 essences three of 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.330
 each color then if you want to put it 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.910
 presence are usual 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.130
 which are the ones that give the aura detention 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.600
 usual is the ocean by officials 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.990
 enter three barretas of now three classrooms 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.750
 different 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.680
 I have one and as they are very rare 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.190
 to get them there by exchange and 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.490
 I play too much now 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.110
 Well, I've been with one and if you want the 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.080
 last you have to have it clear you have 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.780
 a black essence the black essence a 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.030
 would gain time you remove all session 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.370
 here inside if I have this game so 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.860
 nice that I have if I got in now 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.600
 a black essence, but when you lose 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.640
 all the sessions that you have inside and you 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.500
 will put everything in black what does not 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.480
 I felt a usual would continue I do not know 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.760
 but it goes to everything it has inside and 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.270
 you can not put anything more color 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.740
 black and white 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.550
 three unusual but yes you can 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:37.050
 do it because it does not fill a hole in the web 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.090
 and good expresses day 12 or 13 that is 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.930
 when you know they will open the eggs and 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:47.760
 will appear the inventories the pies of 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:50.970
 eggs hatched ears and ear 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.470
 hatch pim pam pum that look that 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.840
 covering appeared that everyone goes 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.560
 put to the world thank you I covered myself 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.240
 the white for the most difficult to do the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.930
 world 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.449
 then you can get more eggs in the 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.860
 way is to touch an egg but if you have 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.370
 that to follow more eggs you can do it 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.230
 opening boxes of these with keys of the 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.290
 datetime they are 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.560
 these are worth about 99 other beings 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:22.680
 normal 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:26.290
 they can touch a lot of objects or 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.780
