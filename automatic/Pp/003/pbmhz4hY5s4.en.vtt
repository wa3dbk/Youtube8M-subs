00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.459 

and<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:43.820> can<00:01:44.000> stop<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.479> start<00:01:44.509> if<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.229> want

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
control and you'll see that I don't like

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:01.330 
control and you'll see that I don't like
that<00:01:54.859> line<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:55.280> I'm<00:01:55.340> going<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.549> hit<00:01:55.700> command<00:01:56.600> Z

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.770 

now<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.579> see<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.000> sometimes<00:02:03.299> I'll<00:02:03.600> make

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
now you can see that sometimes I'll make

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.859 
now you can see that sometimes I'll make
mistakes<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.560> go<00:02:05.520> over<00:02:05.880> lines<00:02:06.149> or<00:02:06.600> there'll

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
mistakes and go over lines or there'll

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.719 
mistakes and go over lines or there'll
be<00:02:06.899> lines<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.350> don't<00:02:07.439> quite<00:02:07.799> match<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.130> like

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
be lines that don't quite match up like

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.540 
be lines that don't quite match up like
this<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.209> here<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:13.069> basically<00:02:14.069> all<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.310> those

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
this one here and basically all of those

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.050 
this one here and basically all of those
mistakes<00:02:15.030> I'm<00:02:15.270> going<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.860> fix<00:02:16.860> later<00:02:17.550> on<00:02:17.790> in

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
mistakes I'm going to fix later on in

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.890 
mistakes I'm going to fix later on in
Photoshop<00:02:18.690> because<00:02:20.180> illustrator<00:02:21.180> does<00:02:21.540> not

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
Photoshop because illustrator does not
