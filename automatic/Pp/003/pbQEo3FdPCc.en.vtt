going this year and Oakland kind of a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.460 
going this year and Oakland kind of a
dysfunctional<00:01:08.390> program<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> long<00:01:10.170> time

Derek Carr is now going to be the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.820 
Derek Carr is now going to be the
starter<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.630> think<00:01:12.840> that's<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.229> good<00:01:13.619> move

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
starter and I think that's a good move

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.249 
starter and I think that's a good move
by<00:01:14.010> Oakland<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.450> my<00:01:15.659> analysis<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
by Oakland and you know my analysis of

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.020 
by Oakland and you know my analysis of
this<00:01:16.439> game<00:01:16.650> I'm<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.040> exactly<00:01:17.369> sure<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.939> know

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
this game I'm not exactly sure you know

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.640 
this game I'm not exactly sure you know
both<00:01:18.210> these<00:01:18.390> teams<00:01:18.600> makes<00:01:18.930> me<00:01:19.080> nervous<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.409> bet

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
both these teams makes me nervous to bet

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.770 
both these teams makes me nervous to bet
on<00:01:19.830> either<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.430> them<00:01:20.610> totals<00:01:21.210> 39<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> half

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
on either one of them totals 39 a half

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.140 
on either one of them totals 39 a half
or<00:01:21.960> 40<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.530> I'm<00:01:23.070> thinking<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.119> know

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
or 40 and I'm thinking that you know

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.910 
or 40 and I'm thinking that you know
maybe<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.810> jets<00:01:25.020> offense<00:01:25.200> will<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.710> able<00:01:25.799> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
maybe the jets offense will be able to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.130 
maybe the jets offense will be able to
do<00:01:26.220> something<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.270> game<00:01:27.509> at<00:01:27.659> some<00:01:27.900> point

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
do something in this game at some point

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
do something in this game at some point
and<00:01:28.350> I'm<00:01:28.619> hoping<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.549> Oakland<00:01:29.880> will

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
and I'm hoping that that Oakland will

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.880 
and I'm hoping that that Oakland will
want<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.210> pass<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> lot<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.350> Jets<00:01:31.560> are<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> tough

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
want to pass a lot the Jets are a tough

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.399 
want to pass a lot the Jets are a tough
team<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.130> run<00:01:32.430> against<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.630> know<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.700 
know Oakland is looking like like their
running<00:01:36.990> game<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.680> that

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
running game is not going to be that

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.710 
running game is not going to be that
effective<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.280> year<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:39.060> well<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.600> I'm

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
effective this year as well so I'm

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.870 
effective this year as well so I'm
hoping<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.110> maybe<00:01:40.560> Oakland<00:01:41.009> will<00:01:41.189> will<00:01:41.790> be

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
hoping that maybe Oakland will will be

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.609 
hoping that maybe Oakland will will be
pass-happy<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.630> game<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.020> I'd<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.470> for

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
pass-happy in this game and I'd go for

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.170 
pass-happy in this game and I'd go for
the<00:01:43.740> over<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.189> right<00:01:44.369> now<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.790> said<00:01:44.939> thirty

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the over and right now as I said thirty

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.910 
the over and right now as I said thirty
nine<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> half<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.930> available<00:01:46.470> market<00:01:46.740> wide

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
nine and a half is available market wide

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.770 
nine and a half is available market wide
so<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.130> would<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.369> my<00:01:47.430> my<00:01:48.180> lean<00:01:48.390> right<00:01:48.570> now

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
so that would be my my lean right now

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.060 
so that would be my my lean right now
over<00:01:49.110> thirty<00:01:49.320> nine<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> half<00:01:49.680> way<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.040> you
