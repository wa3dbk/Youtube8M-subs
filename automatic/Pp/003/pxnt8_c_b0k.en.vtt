00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:41.253
Yo, seen my new awesome MP3 player?
It's like 120 GB space!

00:00:41.538 --> 00:00:43.851
- Fo' shiz? That's sweet dude!
- Sure!

00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:46.555
- How much was it?
- No idea, my dad gave it to me..

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:48.918
I saw the most boring movie ever last night.

00:00:49.192 --> 00:00:53.719
I thought it was gonna be an action movie, 
but it was like a shitty love drama..

00:00:53.957 --> 00:00:55.395
Why did you bother watching it then?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.963
I'd spent like 7 bucks renting it!

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.782
Hey..
HEY!

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:01.801
Aaah! What's up man?

00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:04.978
Do you have to play with that 
computer all the time?

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:06.943
But I'm reading about the future!

00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:11.337
Flying cars and research on 
other planets and aliens and stuff..

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.247
It's maybe a bit more fun doing that than 
just standing there doing nothing at all?

00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:19.215
Well.. Yeah..

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.542
I know! And she was like EEH!
And I was like AH!

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:27.059
And then she was like PFFF!
And I was like.. OH! Like..

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.152
It's just so.. So, like..
So stupid, you know?

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.071
So have you seen the new
fantastic phonograph I've aquired?

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:06.503
It can play both longplay records, 
and single records!

00:02:06.684 --> 00:02:09.344
- I say! Well, that's swell!
- Yes!

00:02:09.516 --> 00:02:10.840
How much did you have to
pay for that?

00:02:10.984 --> 00:02:13.077
I'm not sure.
It's a gift from Father.

00:02:13.447 --> 00:02:16.268
I saw a terribly dull film
at the nickelodeon last night! 

00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:18.140
I thought it was supposed to be
about the war - 

00:02:18.295 --> 00:02:20.738
- but it was a sloppy love drama
that never ended!

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:25.282
But why didn't you trample out of
the theatre in a furious rage then?

00:02:25.586 --> 00:02:27.972
I had spent a whole quarter on it!

00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:31.118
Hey..
HEY YOU!

00:02:31.293 --> 00:02:32.430
Aaah! What is going on?!

00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:35.562
Must you read those journals
all the friggin time?

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:37.812
I'm reading about THE FUTURE!

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.665
Flying automobiles, research on faraway
worlds, extraterrestial beings - 

00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:45.777
- and a whole lot more within the 
realms of scientific imagination!

00:02:45.974 --> 00:02:48.043
That must be somewhat better to do, 
rather than just standing there - 

00:02:48.264 --> 00:02:50.688
- gazing out in the air and do
absolutely nothing at all?

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:52.876
Yes.. Yes, you onto something there..

00:02:54.293 --> 00:02:57.026
- I.. I wanna go home!
- Shh!

00:02:57.476 --> 00:03:02.083
Oh yes! Then she gave me a nonchalant 
groan, so I replied with a suprised moan, -

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:06.340
but then she expressed a rude hiss.
I had no other option than - 

00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:09.622
- replying with a tired and  
dejected gasp, you see..
