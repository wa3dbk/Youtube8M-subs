00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.029
 I would have 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.240
 to the angel of the church of the saints write 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.919
 thus speaks the one who possesses the 7 spirits of god 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.139
 and the seven stars 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.279
 Your conduct is known to me 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.259
 carry the name of living 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.589
 and instead you are dead 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.710
 siii vigilante and hardy gore to what remains that otherwise would end up 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.179
 to die 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.320
 in fact I do not find your conduct perfect in the presence of my god 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.560
 therefore keep in mind 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.330
 how you received is a title 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.740
 so it preserves 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.950
 ertÃ  of tt 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.380
 if you are not vigilant though 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.380
 I will come as a stranger, that is, without you knowing the hour of my coming 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.060
 however, to some people, they are not 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.250
 who have not stained their garments 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.520
 therefore they will walk with me 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.520
 invest white 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.489

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.860
 the victorious will thus dress 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.680
 with white robes 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.130
 I will not delete the name from the book of life 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.080
 rather 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.660
 I will proclaim his name before my father 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.910
 and his angels 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.300
 who has ears 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.300

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.460

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.490
 the one who opens that nobody closes 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.780
 which closes and nobody opens 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.210

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.330
