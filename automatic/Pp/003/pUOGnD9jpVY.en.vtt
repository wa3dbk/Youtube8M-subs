00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
that for a little while so you get a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.670 
that for a little while so you get a
rough<00:00:41.879> idea<00:00:42.000> where<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.510> obviously<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.530> is

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
rough idea where it is obviously this is

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.040 
rough idea where it is obviously this is
the<00:00:43.710> area<00:00:44.160> that's<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.850> cable<00:00:45.149> car<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:45.840> there

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the area that's a cable car that's there

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.110 
the area that's a cable car that's there
so<00:00:46.079> there's<00:00:46.350> kind<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.620> couple<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.860> like

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
so there's kind of a couple of like

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.950 
so there's kind of a couple of like
points<00:00:48.120> therefore<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:48.780> bearings

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
points therefore you get your bearings

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.410 
points therefore you get your bearings

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
tractor now it looks like you can't get

tractor now it looks like you can't get
in<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.580> actually<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.750> see

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
in it but you actually can and you see

them bottom right hand side it says
tractor<00:01:14.640> utility<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.750> obviously<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.140> takes

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
tractor utility and obviously this takes

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.350 
tractor utility and obviously this takes
a<00:01:16.470> while<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> start<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.220> go<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.610> it

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
a while to start there you go and it

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.020 
a while to start there you go and it
literally<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.860> old<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.220> ridiculously

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
literally is so old it's ridiculously

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.109
