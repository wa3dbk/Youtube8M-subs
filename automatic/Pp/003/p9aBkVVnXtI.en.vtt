00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.140
 i 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.480
 hi how about all youtubers after 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.279
 of so much time of not uploading videos the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.560
 I really wanted to go back to 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.750
 youtube with more elaborate videos and with 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.480
 best special effects and graphics 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.460
 although with my notebook I doubt that I will 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.650
 everything possible to improve my videos 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.170
 and make them more curved so that they do not 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.170
 bored finally let's start with the tutorial 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.720
 by the way, thank you very much for the 817 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.790
 subscriptions to my channel soon I will make a 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.860
 special to the 1000 subscriptions of 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.490
 I really appreciate it every day we are 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.280
 more happy face 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.799
 to download and install smile we must 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.960
 know what country we are from since in smart 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.939
 we have two different clients 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.369
 If you are from Europe, Asia or Oceania 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.680
 you must install the smart international 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.200
 on the other hand if you are from america 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.270
 recommends the smile latam south client 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.899
 or north depending on your country in the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.899
 which one do you live 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.700
 oh by the way it's worth noting that you should 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.040
 create an account to play and that 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.960
 you must verify the therefore you have 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.270
 than to put a valid email 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.250
 in which you have access to him 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.710
 You can create accounts on the page 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.320
 official of the game that evidently the 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.720
 I'll leave in the description we'll start with 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.479
 smart latam we must put our 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.970
 personal information the page is 100% 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.070
 sure even if you do not like it 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.640
 put personal information also tell you 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.640
 you can invent 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.849
 after filling out the data we give in 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.280
 accept terms and conditions of use 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.130
 you can read them then click on 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.930
 free download will send them a code 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.790
 of verification that they must put in a 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.390
 link that they will give them to activate 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.390
 your account 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.580
 now we proceed to install the game is 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.470
 mike the game itself does not ask much if 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.630
 you have a low-end video card 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.850
 half already the game that will work 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.190
 perfectly the graphic card that 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.520
 I have I is integrated yet I can not 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.520
 to play 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.560
 These are the requirements that the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.650
 game to see the requirements that you have 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.300
 you should go to start right click 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.400
 properties and a panel will appear as 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.800
 this one clarified that I am in windows 7 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.980
 I suppose windows 8 will be the same or 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.980
 Similary 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.820
 how can you see my pc is bad for the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.700
 gaming but still is able to 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.800
 hold on to some heavy games but 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.290
 clear here it does not tell you which card 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.760
 graph you have to know you must give 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.250
 right click on the desktop 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.020
 screen resolution and then options 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.150
 advanced and there will tell you the 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.150
 Specifications of your graphics card 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.300
 then if you meet the requirements of 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.730
 game you can download otherwise 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.430
 the most likely thing is that it works slow 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.230
 at low frames per second and even 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.830
 that does not work for you but could be 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.830
 playable 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.560
 we give you free download is mike and it 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.260
 will download an installer in which 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.840
 When the download is finished they open it and 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.090
 they install it is very simple they give everything to 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.390
 following and accepting the conditions of 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.640
 use 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.070
 You can also read them I'm going to 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.350
 cancel because right now it's cloudy 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.760
 I have wireless internet and I'm going 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.760
 little leaves them the download 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.360
 now we proceed to create an account in 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.550
 smart and international 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.620
 if you are from Latin America the most likely 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.810
 is that the page tries to send you to 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.359
 level up that would be the client latam 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.620
 you must give it in create account and fill with 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.080
 Your personal information 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.030
 After filling them, you accept the 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.220
 Terms of use will send them too 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.440
 a verification code to the mail that 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.030
 they should be an email they use 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.030
 to be able to access it 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.439
 after having installed one of the two 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.479
 clients when opening it will start at 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:47.460
 download the game files the 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.009
 download varies from the internet you have 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.550
 it can take two hours to 8 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.550
 inclusive 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.560
 well in my case I appear to play because 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.479
 I have it installed now we will see the 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.940
 difference between customers 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.760
 so international since it is very remarkable 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.700
 referring to ping the fps 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.860
 the games are exactly the same nothing 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.050
 more than one is updated instead 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.630
 the other has not yet received the update 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.640
 since in smile the tablet to a week 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.790
 later for translation issues 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.040
 I suppose is maite is a classified game 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.740
 in third-person fashion created and 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.080
 published by jair studios the game is 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.540
 based on two teams consisting of five 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.150
 gods depending on the game mode 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.040
 in my case I will play 3 versus 3 since I 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.440
 it's a bit slow and worse recording 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.230
 obviously in code to be able to teach 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.390
 the ping can say that the end is also 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.690
 based on your internet not only in the 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.690
 server 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.220
 while loading would be very helpful 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.860
 do not comment that it is a copy of the ol or 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.600
 something like that the truth I've never played and what 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.970
 unless I want is to generate a 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.830
 fight between comments or dislike the 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.230
 video the truth seems to me a game 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.480
 amazing in the third person in what 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.760
 I find the staff more exciting but 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.040
 of course this is my opinion maybe I 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.870
 wrong I've only seen videos of lol and 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.290
 the truth is I stay with smile for the 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.290
 moment 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.360
 being in fast camera you do not notice 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.940
 too much that slows me down let's see 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.069
 the fps that the game is going and elkin for 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.650
 check if we have the more 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:31.389
 under the ping better if we have the most 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.520
 It will probably be that we will see the gods 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.490
 teleporting from one place to another 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.560
 when they are really walking we 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.780
 we are without music haha as I am from 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.039
 Latin America the one that suits me is 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.039
 install the smile latam 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.590
 in this video they have not heard other 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.810
 voices more than this haha ​​I'm sorry but 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.640
 I wanted the video to be understandable to 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.840
 the newest in facilities of 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.230
 games of this style 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.810
 see you then greetings dale I like 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.780

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.980
 friends if you think it has served you look 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:10.620

 you have to be if I feel with this voice xd 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.180
