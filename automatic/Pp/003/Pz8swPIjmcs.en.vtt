along this wall I can see up top
maybe<00:00:34.789> not<00:00:35.269> I<00:00:35.300> read<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.140> rash<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.350> bicycle

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
the bicycle we've actually moved we're

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.750 
the bicycle we've actually moved we're
not<00:00:39.350> responsible<00:00:39.769> to<00:00:40.190> actually<00:00:40.579> come<00:00:40.730> down

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
not responsible to actually come down

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.220

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
but what I want to do is actually just

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.739 
but what I want to do is actually just
put<00:00:42.530> our<00:00:42.710> first<00:00:42.920> time<00:00:43.219> act<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:46.149> little<00:00:47.149> bit<00:00:47.390> too

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:47.749 
put our first time act a little bit too

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:50.860 
put our first time act a little bit too
much<00:00:47.870> maybe<00:00:48.109> above<00:00:48.379> here<00:00:48.649> and<00:00:49.629> then<00:00:50.629> we'll<00:00:50.749> get

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
much maybe above here and then we'll get

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.270 
much maybe above here and then we'll get
the<00:00:50.989> big<00:00:51.170> one<00:00:51.379> put<00:00:51.739> it<00:00:51.800> down<00:00:51.859> a<00:00:51.980> little<00:00:52.159> bit

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
the big one put it down a little bit

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.099 
the big one put it down a little bit
more<00:00:53.949> actually<00:00:54.949> measured<00:00:55.280> out<00:00:55.399> as<00:00:56.390> 12<00:00:56.870> feet

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
more actually measured out as 12 feet

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.959 
more actually measured out as 12 feet
now<00:00:57.289> turns<00:00:57.620> out<00:00:57.769> we're<00:00:58.129> actually<00:00:58.280> technical

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
now turns out we're actually technical

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.000 
now turns out we're actually technical
ultimate<00:00:59.449> all<00:00:59.719> the<00:00:59.929> way<00:01:00.050> to<00:01:00.109> that<00:01:00.350> wall

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
ultimate all the way to that wall

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.470 
ultimate all the way to that wall
so<00:01:01.429> we're<00:01:01.519> go<00:01:01.640> ahead<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:01.969> have<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.179> move<00:01:02.329> the

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
so we're go ahead and have to move the

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.429 
so we're go ahead and have to move the
ladder<00:01:02.659> and<00:01:03.050> our<00:01:03.260> recycling<00:01:03.679> bin

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
ladder and our recycling bin

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.380 
ladder and our recycling bin
it's<00:01:06.439> a<00:01:06.500> paint<00:01:06.740> fast<00:01:07.130> that's<00:01:07.970> about<00:01:08.180> it

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
it's a paint fast that's about it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.069 
it's a paint fast that's about it
that<00:01:08.899> one<00:01:09.049> thing<00:01:09.229> we'll<00:01:09.380> be<00:01:09.470> using<00:01:10.000> its<00:01:11.000> the

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.660

the pipe right in there how the gaseous
traffic<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.450> move<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:29.990> mount<00:01:30.250> but<00:01:31.329> we'll

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
traffic to move to the mount but we'll

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.149 
traffic to move to the mount but we'll
find<00:01:32.450> out<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.719> net<00:01:32.869> let's<00:01:33.770> go<00:01:33.890> ahead<00:01:33.979> and

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
find out the net let's go ahead and

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.190 
find out the net let's go ahead and
actually<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:34.549> put<00:01:34.700> this<00:01:34.789> up<00:01:34.939> on<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.090> wall<00:01:35.240> and

actually you put this up on the wall and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.580 
actually you put this up on the wall and
that<00:01:36.619> will<00:01:36.740> suit<00:01:36.920> looks<00:01:37.130> like<00:01:38.259> alright<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:39.469> now

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
that will suit looks like alright so now

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.200 
that will suit looks like alright so now
that<00:01:39.619> energy<00:01:40.250> oops

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
that energy oops

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.290 
that energy oops
in<00:01:41.360> place<00:01:42.549> go<00:01:43.549> ahead<00:01:43.579> with<00:01:44.000> kya

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
in place go ahead with kya

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.570 
in place go ahead with kya
as<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.260> see<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.680> actually<00:01:46.830> does<00:01:47.070> fit

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
as you can see if it actually does fit

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.350 
as you can see if it actually does fit
that's<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.660> higher<00:01:48.900> than<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.230> wanted<00:01:49.530> but

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
that's a little higher than I wanted but

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:03.460 
that's a little higher than I wanted but
it<00:01:51.360> fits<00:01:51.630> there<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.470> go<00:01:55.340> it's<00:01:56.340> really<00:01:56.610> well
