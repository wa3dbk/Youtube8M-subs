00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.020
 is to fold one or genealogy 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.760
 This is a program hero too. 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.700
 called the genealogical tree and the 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.060
 green or genealogy and serves to 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.710
 represent crosses made 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.680
 experimentally or occurred 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.809
 of course in the use of programs 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.090
 we have a number of pi figures in 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.640
 moment we can not understand each other better 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.739
 Let's try to untangle the engineer. 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.550
 drama so we can understand 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.660
 the males are represented by 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.430
 square squares of this type 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.460
 transparent or with white background as 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.650
 you are referred to as individuals 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.329
 normal this case is a normal male 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.840
 affected individuals or when we want to 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.329
 represent a special feature 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.850
 are painted or the jurors can say 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:11.320
 I feel then that yes would be an example of 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.049
 a male affected to females are 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.659
 represented by a circle this is a 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.520
 normal week realize that she has the 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.939
 same male pattern only 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.869
 represented this time by a circle 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:29.560
 the same will be to exemplify 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.850
 a semi-affected 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.850
 following the same pattern as the male 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.619
 when we want to represent a 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.439
 between individuals 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.920
 we passed a trace connecting the subject of the 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.700
 male with the individual sex 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.670
 female 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.359
 there we have a cross in a 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.240
 male and female video 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:02:01.069
 this in turn is a cross with 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:06.649
 where we observe a square and 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:08.060
 circle and realize that it exists in two 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.319
 connected traces 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.370
 this is the peak crossing between relatives 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:20.650
 close training sessions with healthy 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.650
 consume years and so on 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.849
 to represent a couple with children 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:33.599
 we do so ready 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.150
 here we have a couple with two sons José 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.469
 of the drama also have in figures 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:45.620
 Romans as we see one of the 34 that serves 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:57.720
 to represent the generations and also the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:03:01.739
 number commands for example 23 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.680
 picture that's good for us to keep order 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.790
 of the birth of individuals for example 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.379
 we can say that the individual of the generation 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.849
 we need to understand how gift is the most 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:18.329
 old and the individual also in the 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.750
 some individual 4 would be the most 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.750
 new 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.659
 besides these symbols that you see 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.640
 there are some other symbols that I 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:40.370
 I will not treat here but there is also 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.790
 to determine gothic anjimile twins 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.819
 abortions 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.829
 various other symbols that can 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.780
 be used but we will not use them 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.420
 so if you're curious 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.739
 you can take a look at page 22 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.680
 from your book 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.060
 good now it's easier to understand the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.180
 genealogy 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.989
 so let's take a closer look at these figures 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.230
 As ours is the brahman's will go to 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:11.720
 represent a case of the human organism 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:15.919
 and it is presented three generations 1 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.269
 2 and 3 how can they kill 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:21.199
 notes that someone 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.810
 recessive characteristic 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.210
 it manifests itself in the individuals of the 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:32.580
 first generation but needs a lot 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:35.970
 including the 2:03 and only reappears in 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.639
 deviation from what will be more 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.620
 precisely an individual who is a 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:46.110
 female person as we can 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:50.550
 note experienced second generation but gas 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.979
 mainly the stretch and 14 are the father of 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.240
 that the girl that we just talked about 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:59.370
 third generation to 1 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.789
 they are even sewage to the body 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:08.550
 because each has a parent, someone or 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:11.720
 whether your parents are at least some spice 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.720
 it was albino 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:20.130
 there is a seat for this is practically 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.410
 a rule in programs 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:26.130
 when parents do 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:29.340
 for a particular character 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.610
 dominant and the child presents the image 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.670
 different concludes that parents are André 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:39.270
 Gothic and children are the meetings 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:43.500
 successive words in many words when 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:46.320
 parents have an equal and 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.080
 the child appears with a characteristic 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.750
 different and opposite of the parents 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.810
 say that parents are just symbolic 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:06:02.430
 and movies are the votes of codes 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:07.020
 that it's good that you have some of the 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:11.010
 virus we do not put the judge that each one 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:14.520
 good in some cases not 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:18.900
 we were able to determine how, for example 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.970
 in individual 1 of the first generation 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.840
 we can assume that one million due to 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:29.060
 flow unless we are from Hasan today 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:32.220
 king determined moment he gave the reason 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:39.090
 for the individual and three of the second 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:45.410
 generation but we can not say that 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:49.080
 another gene is the blue reason why 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:53.640
 no other individual or 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.860
 either he had no son who 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.820
 demonstrate its opposite and 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:02.580
 which is that when we make excuses much 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.640
 we can also note that if he 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:09.660
 be the reason the reason we want that 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.850
 result as to the reason so the case is 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.450
 repeats for individual four of the 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.450
 first generation 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:23.180
 then we notify you to put the genes of the 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:28.099
 other individuals with this but 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:28.099
 we finished the class of going and we doubled
