00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:26.960
 I feel super dan decided face 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.620
 psychologically better a guy more 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.530
 mature that neither in question of the things that 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.020
 accounts happened to me in 2012 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.309
 in 2011 also have been a very good year 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.710
 and 2012 has an injury that a 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.580
 first injury that harmed some of the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.300
 things but always while he values ​​there 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.800
 Up always I remain confident 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.210
 trying to keep this tightly focused head 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.100
 working hard as I started the 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.100
 work thought we more 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.720
 now is to continue the strong work 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.210
 always starting with the technical committee 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.170
 always my fellow board members 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.920
 that was what was possible with friends 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:42.500
 to keep what good work when 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:46.610
 I was doing goal I think so I 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:51.430
 I have almost four years of Basque and 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.969
 knows the club well and I've played three 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.479
 Brazilians, right? 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:59.570
 so we have an experience one 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.829
 little experience and it is possible that 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.159
 People pass on to them but I'm a guy. 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.200
 I also love knowing about other 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.289
 people coming from another club 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.900
 youngest guy we talk 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.950
 also tries to help a special that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.780
 came from another English club when 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.360
 Talk is a cool idea to people. 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.100
 always puts it in the head I think this 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.590
 makes the player grow 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.610
 so it's one trying to help the other only 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.610
 with your own experience 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.270
 then 15 step by step is the world cup 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.320
 is the greatest goal of every player and I 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.940
 I'm not different 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.880
 I had a great opportunity to be 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.780
 summoned I'll try to do everything 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.150
 be reinstated. 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.090
 It's a good job for the coach here. 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.180
 Felipe calls me back to the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.180
 selection 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.990
 everybody greets you on tv 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.990
