00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.700
 Well then welcome to 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.190
 press conference after playoff final 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.480
 number three 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.250
 tribe pinguins and the kennigheim 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.390
 steelers i welcome all the spectators of 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.460
 2 tb as well as the present ones 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.380
 media representatives and of course the 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.200
 both coaches to my right mike 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.550
 stewart f3 penguins and kevin kurek 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.099
 head coach of the bietigheim steelers 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.599
 bremerhaven wins with 4 to 3 and goes 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.360
 thus in the series with 2 1 in leadership 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.399
 and as always, the first word is right 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.660
 Our guest coach Peter, I can do it 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.700
 ask for a short statement 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.440
 mirror will be a credit of mine 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.570
 my team we have a lot better 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.659
 played that first game 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.239
 we will play very fast or 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:55.809
 The idea of ​​the difference was that we 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.809
 always have an introduction immediately 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:59.449
 draw 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.909
 the next gate given to bremerhaven 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.839
 Go quickly every time and then quickly 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.540
 to rock 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.330
 against are community in special 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.130
 in the home area must try in 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.049
 moment in order to keep we never 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.400
 being made is always a fighter 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.250
 after that fast gate 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.220
 and if we could have 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.000
 it probably still einhl it 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.550
 another game 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.260
 although of course it is not over the 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.860
 Problem was we never really got that 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.890
 keep moments and think that it was 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.330
 always a fighter one side the other 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.190
 and of course in the last guests 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.260
 draw in the last third 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.840
 you have to be happy of course in 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.050
 bremerhaven and then kill this quickly 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.090
 really has to take the moral 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.420
 After that you had many chances 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.420
 would have 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.630
 many withstand and have bad 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.250
 but we fought until the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.080
 end if a few chances there at 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.360
 but also very good 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.780
 receive and you have my way 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:09.140
 gain s21 in two days because so 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.250
 many ask mr good that is not 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.930
 the fall mike then we come to you 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.560

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.880

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.850
 made 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:28.870
 on the first go cross pass house of 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:32.620
 our our own zone mcknight 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.470
 Intercepted what I want to say 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.730
 intercepted and bidding home is on 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.470
 fans quality of the incredible that 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.180
 Ice cold exploited are fast 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.900
 come back a nice gate of 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.769
 macpherson 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.230
 that was really answer conjures plate 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.400
 sounds again and this little both 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.810
 Teams fight for everyone 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.730
 centimeters and we have a slice 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.890
 twice up and looking full 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.690
 for us when we killing the penalty 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.890
 slice did not bring out and that has 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.510
 we now cost 21 man the residue 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.100
 in the second third we have these 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.010
 this error is minimized and 22 of 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.230
 victor was outstanding and it got us 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.769
 brought into play again and has us 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.579
 Much self-forgiving almost daily 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:25.630
 again third goal 33 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:29.770
 harbor judge 1 1 kramer von tor 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:33.530
 with really strong holzer all last 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:37.160
 exploited consequence and then of sunny 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.560
 cars in the last third supertor today 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.190
 Give us the lead after we 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.260
 have had opportunities but carriage was 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.450
 It was absolutely great today 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.480
 brutally tight and have both teams 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.400
 had a few chances to finish and 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.630
 we are just happy that we are 4 3 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.900
 won and we did not know any 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.690
 time to sleep or regenerating 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.709
 really it is we go again be 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:14.239
 what else is empty time today ? 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:16.930
 Okay Saturday today in bietigheim 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.930
 then it starts again 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.780
 you said you ever you 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.250
 three times in arrears from 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.870
 balanced prevails at the now 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.460
 happy about it every time 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.930
 southern branch or first you then 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.690
 rather the pest about being there three times 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.880
 dark at home I believe at home or 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.960
 away is simply displays the character 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.840
 Boys have never given up and we have 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.760
 had enough opportunities and it was important 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.800
 Just go back to the game in the game too 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.540
 it came to be different people 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:51.180
 they know they are doing something great today 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.330
 us that he rejected us as a team 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.130
 all 41 are dangerous for goal and who around 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.620
 we played with a lot of speed 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.830
 can hold through the whole six 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.910
 minutes and I believe in the end that 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.910
 That was the difference 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.070
 especially in the second third 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.330
 Hunter for me so much 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.210
 struck agitated so times 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.880
 stretched and so there's such things can indeed 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.830
 slightly struck he is a bit 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.470
 funny slipped when he rod to 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.290
 pushing rod but has just been in 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.400
 play asked and he is fine 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.360

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:32.910

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:34.169
