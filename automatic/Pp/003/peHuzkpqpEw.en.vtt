00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
my here we are with my 2011 iMac I've

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.320 
my here we are with my 2011 iMac I've
recently<00:00:06.330> fitted<00:00:06.899> an<00:00:07.230> SSD<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.160> if<00:00:09.090> you'd

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
recently fitted an SSD to it if you'd

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.060 
recently fitted an SSD to it if you'd
have<00:00:09.450> followed<00:00:09.840> my<00:00:09.960> previous<00:00:10.410> article<00:00:10.830> on<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
have followed my previous article on the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.419

on<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:12.320> on<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.469> iMac<00:00:13.830> you'll<00:00:14.009> know<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.190> one

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
on the on this iMac you'll know that one

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.129 
on the on this iMac you'll know that one
of<00:00:14.460> my<00:00:14.610> frustrations<00:00:14.790> was<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.690> couldn't

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
of my frustrations was that I couldn't

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.140 
of my frustrations was that I couldn't
fit<00:00:16.320> an<00:00:16.440> SSD<00:00:16.770> through<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.279> every<00:00:17.580> time<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.789> did

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
fit an SSD through this every time I did

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.290 
fit an SSD through this every time I did
the<00:00:18.390> fans<00:00:18.869> got<00:00:19.109> ramped<00:00:19.470> up<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:21.060> machine

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
the fans got ramped up and the machine

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.480 
the fans got ramped up and the machine
became<00:00:21.660> tube<00:00:21.930> noisy<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.529> use<00:00:22.740> well<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.369> was

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
became tube noisy to use well that was

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.009 
became tube noisy to use well that was
related<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.180> way<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.449> Apple's<00:00:24.810> than

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
related to the way that Apple's than

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.200 
related to the way that Apple's than
their<00:00:25.260> their<00:00:25.800> temperature<00:00:26.250> readings<00:00:26.609> so

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
their their temperature readings so

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.380 
their their temperature readings so
after<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> while<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.619> took<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> different

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
after a while I took a different

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.370 
after a while I took a different
approach<00:00:30.390> from<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:30.750> I've<00:00:30.869> done<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.230> I've

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
approach from what I've done is I've

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.010 
approach from what I've done is I've
actually<00:00:31.410> replaced<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.700> DVD<00:00:33.300> drive<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:33.809> with

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
actually replaced the DVD drive now with

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.590 
actually replaced the DVD drive now with
a<00:00:34.050> with<00:00:34.440> an<00:00:34.530> SSD<00:00:34.910> much<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.149> same<00:00:36.329> way<00:00:36.480> that

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
a with an SSD much in the same way that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.410 
a with an SSD much in the same way that
I<00:00:36.660> did<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.870> my<00:00:36.989> macbook<00:00:37.260> pro<00:00:38.210> machines<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.300> lot

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
I did on my macbook pro machines a lot

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.910 
I did on my macbook pro machines a lot
better<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.079> thought<00:00:40.410> would<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> quick

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
better but I thought would do a quick

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.440 
better but I thought would do a quick
comparison<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.670> between<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
comparison now between this and the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.049 
comparison now between this and the
original<00:00:42.809> video<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.920> firstly<00:00:44.520> let's<00:00:44.760> just

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
original video so firstly let's just

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.549 
original video so firstly let's just
have<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> look<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.809> which<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.200> might<00:00:46.440> be

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
have a look and see which I might be

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.439 
have a look and see which I might be
looking<00:00:46.680> at<00:00:47.629> there<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.719> go<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.680> 2011<00:00:50.449> 3.4

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
looking at there we go it's a 2011 3.4

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.889 
looking at there we go it's a 2011 3.4
geek<00:00:51.690> i7<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> quad<00:00:53.309> core<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.820> 16<00:00:54.719> gig

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
geek i7 so that's the quad core a 16 gig

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.560 
geek i7 so that's the quad core a 16 gig
ram<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.399> let's<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.760> look<00:00:56.910> at<00:00:57.090> some

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
ram in it and let's have a look at some

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.479 
ram in it and let's have a look at some
of<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.719> additional<00:00:58.079> pieces<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> system

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
of the additional pieces in the system

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.310 
of the additional pieces in the system
report<00:01:02.059> ok<00:01:03.059> firstly<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:03.989> look<00:01:04.140> at<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
report ok firstly if we look at the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.340 
report ok firstly if we look at the
drives<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.890> serial<00:01:05.400> ata<00:01:06.020> you'll<00:01:07.020> see<00:01:07.229> that

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
drives and serial ata you'll see that

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.820 
drives and serial ata you'll see that
I've<00:01:07.500> got<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:10.080> which<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> internal

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
I've got that one which is the internal

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.609 
I've got that one which is the internal
1<00:01:11.250> terabyte<00:01:11.640> drive<00:01:12.060> that's<00:01:12.930> actually<00:01:13.350> honest

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
1 terabyte drive that's actually honest

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.230 
1 terabyte drive that's actually honest
after<00:01:13.770> three<00:01:14.189> connection<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.030> obviously

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
after three connection but it obviously

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.539 
after three connection but it obviously
drives<00:01:15.750> an<00:01:15.930> eSATA<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.560> send<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.070> connection<00:01:17.460> at

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
drives an eSATA to send a connection at

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.929 
drives an eSATA to send a connection at
3<00:01:17.790> gig<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.950> second<00:01:20.090> connection<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> SATA<00:01:22.140> 3

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
3 gig the second connection is a SATA 3

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.590 
3 gig the second connection is a SATA 3
connection<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> don't<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> right

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
connection but I don't have the right

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.390 
connection but I don't have the right
cable<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.680> I've<00:01:25.830> done<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.250> I've

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
cable for that so what I've done is I've

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.050 
cable for that so what I've done is I've
actually<00:01:26.610> replaced<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.750> DVD<00:01:28.170> drive<00:01:28.939> which<00:01:29.939> is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
actually replaced the DVD drive which is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.969 
actually replaced the DVD drive which is
that<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.479> now<00:01:30.720> unfortunately<00:01:31.470> that's<00:01:31.619> only<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that one now unfortunately that's only a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.670 
that one now unfortunately that's only a
starter<00:01:32.400> 2<00:01:32.610> connections<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> my<00:01:33.680> currents

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
starter 2 connections to my currents

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.399 
starter 2 connections to my currents
after<00:01:35.070> three<00:01:35.310> SSD<00:01:36.150> which<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.659> one<00:01:36.840> is

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
after three SSD which is that one is

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.990 
after three SSD which is that one is
currently<00:01:37.950> only<00:01:38.100> running<00:01:38.340> at<00:01:38.460> started<00:01:38.880> 2

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
currently only running at started 2

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.789 
currently only running at started 2
speeds<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.930> that's<00:01:40.170> something<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.590> bear<00:01:40.740> in

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
speeds so that's something to bear in

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.670 
speeds so that's something to bear in
mind<00:01:40.939> ok<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.600> currently<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> drives<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.619> are

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
mind ok so currently the drives that are

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.840 
mind ok so currently the drives that are
in<00:01:43.799> there<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> one<00:01:44.520> terabyte

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
in there so it's the one terabyte

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.620 
in there so it's the one terabyte
internal<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.869> there's<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.770> 256<00:01:47.670> SSD<00:01:48.420> which

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
internal and there's the 256 SSD which

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.480 
internal and there's the 256 SSD which
is<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> oppor<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.290> Bay<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.799> replacement

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
is in the oppor to Bay in in replacement

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.469 
is in the oppor to Bay in in replacement
at<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.640> DVD<00:01:51.060> drive<00:01:51.439> ok<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.360> you'll<00:01:54.360> probably

the 24 inch screen would flash
periodically<00:02:57.150> which<00:02:57.390> was<00:02:57.570> incredibly

periodically which was incredibly

and<00:03:10.800> well<00:03:11.670> that's<00:03:11.760> roughly<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.209> hardware<00:03:12.690> and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
and well that's roughly the hardware and

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.390 
and well that's roughly the hardware and
let's<00:03:13.590> have<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.740> quick<00:03:14.070> look<00:03:14.160> at<00:03:14.310> the

there<00:03:52.740> you<00:03:52.860> go<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.070> can<00:03:53.310> see<00:03:53.340> it's<00:03:53.550> more<00:03:53.640> than

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
there you go you can see it's more than

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.970 
there you go you can see it's more than
double<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.380> also<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.440> course<00:03:55.500> there's<00:03:55.890> the

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
double and also of course there's the

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.160 
double and also of course there's the
advantage<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.640> seek<00:03:57.210> times<00:03:57.480> being<00:03:57.840> virtually

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
advantage of seek times being virtually

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.040 
advantage of seek times being virtually
non-existent<00:03:58.380> on<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.130> SSD<00:03:59.430> I'm<00:04:00.060> totally<00:04:00.630> sold

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
non-existent on the SSD I'm totally sold

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.260 
non-existent on the SSD I'm totally sold
on<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.260> technology<00:04:01.740> I<00:04:01.770> wherever<00:04:02.760> possible<00:04:02.910> I

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
on the technology I wherever possible I

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.670 
on the technology I wherever possible I
would<00:04:03.330> not<00:04:03.630> switch<00:04:03.900> back<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.260> physical

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
would not switch back to a physical

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.480 
would not switch back to a physical
drive<00:04:06.590> let's<00:04:07.590> have<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.830> look<00:04:07.950> at<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.100> X<00:04:08.220> bench

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
drive let's have a look at the X bench

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.840 
drive let's have a look at the X bench
stats<00:04:08.790> as<00:04:09.030> well<00:04:13.100> one<00:04:14.100> thing<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.370> found<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.730> X

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
stats as well one thing I found the X

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.699 
stats as well one thing I found the X
bench<00:04:15.090> by<00:04:15.270> the<00:04:15.330> way<00:04:15.510> I'm<00:04:15.600> lying<00:04:15.990> you<00:04:16.320> can't<00:04:16.560> run

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
bench by the way I'm lying you can't run

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.050 
bench by the way I'm lying you can't run
the<00:04:16.799> thread<00:04:17.010> test<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:17.670> I'm<00:04:17.730> just<00:04:17.880> going<00:04:18.030> to

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
the thread test so I'm just going to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:28.720 
the thread test so I'm just going to
turn<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.390> off<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:19.410> let<00:04:19.799> these<00:04:19.980> stats<00:04:20.280> run

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.690 

okay<00:04:30.620> what<00:04:31.620> we're<00:04:31.740> interested<00:04:31.950> in<00:04:32.310> really<00:04:32.520> I

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
okay what we're interested in really I

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.130 
okay what we're interested in really I
mean<00:04:32.910> that<00:04:33.060> you<00:04:33.300> got<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.540> processor<00:04:34.050> and

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
mean that you got the processor and

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.870 
mean that you got the processor and
everything<00:04:34.410> testing<00:04:34.890> up<00:04:35.040> there

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
everything testing up there

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.500 
everything testing up there
this<00:04:36.810> test<00:04:37.080> is<00:04:37.200> coming<00:04:37.380> out<00:04:37.620> very<00:04:37.890> very<00:04:38.190> good

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
this test is coming out very very good

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.130 
this test is coming out very very good
it's<00:04:39.510> at<00:04:39.660> 442<00:04:40.260> that's<00:04:40.650> significantly<00:04:41.400> higher

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
it's at 442 that's significantly higher

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.410 
it's at 442 that's significantly higher
there<00:04:43.140> my<00:04:43.290> previous<00:04:43.890> starts<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.460> SSD<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:45.390> I

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
there my previous starts to SSD so I

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.980 
there my previous starts to SSD so I
still<00:04:45.840> think<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.110> c300<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:46.830> good<00:04:46.980> device<00:04:47.990> so

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
still think the c300 so good device so

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.480 
still think the c300 so good device so
give<00:04:49.140> me<00:04:49.230> an<00:04:49.320> idea<00:04:49.380> if<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.830> rerun<00:04:50.130> that<00:04:50.280> dish

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
give me an idea if I rerun that dish

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.890 
give me an idea if I rerun that dish
test<00:04:51.110> let<00:04:52.110> me<00:04:52.200> kill<00:04:52.410> that<00:04:53.450> I'll<00:04:54.450> rerun<00:04:54.780> the

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
test let me kill that I'll rerun the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.930 
test let me kill that I'll rerun the
disk<00:04:55.080> test<00:04:55.320> but<00:04:55.500> on<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:56.220> old<00:04:56.400> physical

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
disk test but on the the old physical

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:08.750 
disk test but on the the old physical
drive<00:04:57.210> that<00:04:57.690> was<00:04:57.870> in<00:04:58.080> there<00:05:07.280> okay<00:05:08.280> as<00:05:08.610> you<00:05:08.730> can

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
drive that was in there okay as you can

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.070 
drive that was in there okay as you can
see<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.150> difference<00:05:09.540> between<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.840> two<00:05:10.020> is

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
see the difference between the two is

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.350 
see the difference between the two is
just<00:05:10.169> done<00:05:10.680> well<00:05:11.250> its<00:05:11.760> massive

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
just done well its massive

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.030 
just done well its massive
it<00:05:12.720> does<00:05:12.870> make<00:05:13.020> a<00:05:13.050> massive<00:05:13.350> difference<00:05:13.470> the

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
it does make a massive difference the

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.880 
it does make a massive difference the
the<00:05:14.310> feel<00:05:14.550> of<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:14.850> machine<00:05:15.530> being<00:05:16.530> used<00:05:16.770> for

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
the feel of the machine being used for

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.250 
the feel of the machine being used for
an<00:05:17.010> SSD<00:05:17.310> laptop<00:05:17.910> using<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.690> physical<00:05:19.050> drive

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
an SSD laptop using the physical drive

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.930 
an SSD laptop using the physical drive
iMac<00:05:19.680> just<00:05:19.919> made<00:05:20.070> this<00:05:20.220> feel<00:05:20.460> like<00:05:20.490> sludge

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
iMac just made this feel like sludge

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.240 
iMac just made this feel like sludge
compared<00:05:21.360> to<00:05:21.450> my<00:05:21.570> others<00:05:21.780> and<00:05:22.080> so<00:05:22.980> let's<00:05:23.130> have

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
compared to my others and so let's have

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.110 
compared to my others and so let's have
a<00:05:23.280> look<00:05:23.430> at<00:05:23.520> some<00:05:23.640> of<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:23.790> general

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
a look at some of the general

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.390 
a look at some of the general
performance<00:05:24.620> okay<00:05:25.620> well<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:25.800> can<00:05:25.980> fire<00:05:26.160> at<00:05:26.280> some

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
performance okay well I can fire at some

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.920 
performance okay well I can fire at some
of<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.550> office<00:05:26.790> apps<00:05:29.480> there<00:05:30.480> we<00:05:30.600> go<00:05:30.750> you<00:05:30.810> can

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
of the office apps there we go you can

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.970 
of the office apps there we go you can
see<00:05:31.050> they're<00:05:31.290> practically<00:05:31.740> instantaneous

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
see they're practically instantaneous

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:39.720 
see they're practically instantaneous
which<00:05:32.700> is<00:05:32.880> pretty<00:05:33.660> much<00:05:33.750> what<00:05:34.020> you<00:05:34.050> want

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.270 

let's<00:05:40.730> get<00:05:40.940> rid<00:05:41.060> of<00:05:41.120> those<00:05:41.860> I've<00:05:42.860> also<00:05:43.010> got<00:05:43.250> a

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
let's get rid of those I've also got a

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.860 
let's get rid of those I've also got a
couple<00:05:43.550> of<00:05:43.730> virtual<00:05:44.180> machines<00:05:44.480> running<00:05:44.720> at

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
couple of virtual machines running at

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.440 
couple of virtual machines running at
the<00:05:44.930> moment<00:05:45.080> so<00:05:45.550> let's<00:05:46.550> jump<00:05:46.820> across<00:05:47.030> and<00:05:47.150> have

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
the moment so let's jump across and have

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.210 
the moment so let's jump across and have
a<00:05:47.480> look<00:05:47.690> at<00:05:47.900> my<00:05:48.080> normal<00:05:48.440> work<00:05:48.770> Windows

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
a look at my normal work Windows

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.750 
a look at my normal work Windows
environment<00:05:49.820> that<00:05:49.970> this<00:05:50.120> is<00:05:50.300> my<00:05:51.760> work

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
environment that this is my work

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.120 
environment that this is my work
environment<00:05:53.120> so<00:05:53.420> well<00:05:53.990> my<00:05:54.140> normal<00:05:54.410> desktop<00:05:54.710> so

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
environment so well my normal desktop so

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.680 
environment so well my normal desktop so
let's<00:05:55.820> have<00:05:55.940> a<00:05:56.030> look<00:05:56.120> at<00:05:56.240> the<00:05:56.300> performance

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
let's have a look at the performance

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.480 
let's have a look at the performance
index

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
index

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.160 
index
this<00:05:58.490> is<00:05:58.670> virtualized<00:05:59.180> within<00:05:59.450> parallels<00:05:59.960> by

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
this is virtualized within parallels by

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.460 
this is virtualized within parallels by
the<00:06:00.230> way<00:06:00.440> I<00:06:01.420> have<00:06:02.420> to<00:06:02.510> show<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.810> configuration

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
the way I have to show the configuration

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.150 
the way I have to show the configuration
I<00:06:03.620> have<00:06:04.300> all<00:06:05.300> all<00:06:06.080> core<00:06:06.380> or<00:06:06.650> four<00:06:06.860> cores

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
I have all all core or four cores

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.460 
I have all all core or four cores
allocated<00:06:07.820> to<00:06:07.940> the<00:06:08.030> machine<00:06:08.330> so<00:06:09.170> it's<00:06:09.290> showing

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
allocated to the machine so it's showing

allocated<00:06:13.060> okay<00:06:14.060> if<00:06:14.120> we<00:06:14.210> look<00:06:14.330> at<00:06:14.450> the

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
allocated okay if we look at the

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.140 
allocated okay if we look at the
performance<00:06:14.900> index<00:06:15.640> it's<00:06:16.640> currently<00:06:16.970> running

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
performance index it's currently running

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.730 
performance index it's currently running
a<00:06:17.270> five<00:06:17.480> point<00:06:17.750> nine<00:06:17.810> with<00:06:18.170> the<00:06:18.200> slowest<00:06:18.680> one

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
a five point nine with the slowest one

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.610 
a five point nine with the slowest one
being<00:06:19.010> the<00:06:19.100> memory<00:06:19.990> which<00:06:20.990> bit<00:06:21.200> of<00:06:21.230> a<00:06:21.380> surprise

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
being the memory which bit of a surprise

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.230 
being the memory which bit of a surprise
really<00:06:21.860> did<00:06:22.160> this<00:06:22.310> transfer<00:06:22.730> rate<00:06:22.910> seven

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
really did this transfer rate seven

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.530 
really did this transfer rate seven
point<00:06:23.420> eight<00:06:23.540> so<00:06:23.840> that's<00:06:24.200> a<00:06:24.350> great<00:06:24.560> score<00:06:24.830> and

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
point eight so that's a great score and

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.000 
point eight so that's a great score and
performance<00:06:26.540> is<00:06:26.660> also<00:06:26.990> excellent<00:06:27.680> in<00:06:27.920> the

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
performance is also excellent in the

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:34.150 
performance is also excellent in the
machine<00:06:32.470> bizarrely<00:06:33.470> it's<00:06:33.710> actually<00:06:33.950> faster

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
machine bizarrely it's actually faster

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.010 
machine bizarrely it's actually faster
than<00:06:34.340> my<00:06:34.550> normal<00:06:34.610> Windows<00:06:35.180> laptop<00:06:35.600> but<00:06:35.750> I<00:06:35.840> get

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
than my normal Windows laptop but I get

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.310 
than my normal Windows laptop but I get
from<00:06:36.170> work<00:06:36.350> that<00:06:36.770> I<00:06:36.980> mention<00:06:37.850> that<00:06:38.230> there<00:06:39.230> you

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
from work that I mention that there you

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.150 
from work that I mention that there you
go<00:06:39.530> okay<00:06:40.280> so<00:06:41.230> per<00:06:42.230> se<00:06:42.410> I<00:06:42.440> think<00:06:42.650> the<00:06:42.710> SSD<00:06:43.100> is

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
go okay so per se I think the SSD is

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.830 
go okay so per se I think the SSD is
that<00:06:43.370> revolutionized<00:06:44.030> this<00:06:44.180> machine<00:06:44.570> for<00:06:44.720> me

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
that revolutionized this machine for me

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.660 
that revolutionized this machine for me
it's<00:06:44.960> made<00:06:45.080> it<00:06:45.230> far<00:06:45.650> more<00:06:45.830> usable<00:06:46.310> than<00:06:46.340> it<00:06:46.550> was

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
it's made it far more usable than it was

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.060 
it's made it far more usable than it was
previously

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
previously

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.200 
previously
but<00:06:49.070> I<00:06:49.100> guess<00:06:49.340> that<00:06:49.520> depends<00:06:49.850> on<00:06:49.970> what<00:06:50.090> you

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
but I guess that depends on what you

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.600 
but I guess that depends on what you
used<00:06:50.450> to<00:06:50.540> of<00:06:51.440> course<00:06:51.620> I<00:06:51.800> mean<00:06:51.950> my<00:06:52.070> laptops<00:06:52.490> I've

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
used to of course I mean my laptops I've

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.190 
used to of course I mean my laptops I've
got<00:06:52.730> SSDs<00:06:53.180> on<00:06:53.360> them<00:06:53.480> so<00:06:53.630> obviously<00:06:53.870> I<00:06:53.930> found

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
got SSDs on them so obviously I found

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.370 
got SSDs on them so obviously I found
found<00:06:54.860> them<00:06:55.070> quite<00:06:55.100> restrictive<00:06:56.380> yeah

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
found them quite restrictive yeah

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.900 
found them quite restrictive yeah
there's<00:06:57.830> there's<00:06:58.070> no<00:06:58.280> way<00:06:58.460> I'll<00:06:58.580> be<00:06:58.700> going

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
there's there's no way I'll be going

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:06.190 
there's there's no way I'll be going
back<00:06:59.090> to<00:06:59.770> using<00:07:00.770> a<00:07:01.130> physical<00:07:01.760> drive<00:07:05.200> anyway

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.200 
back to using a physical drive anyway

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.170 
back to using a physical drive anyway
hope<00:07:06.620> you<00:07:06.650> found<00:07:06.860> that<00:07:06.950> useful<00:07:07.070> the<00:07:07.730> upgrade

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
hope you found that useful the upgrade

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.350 
hope you found that useful the upgrade
process<00:07:08.330> was<00:07:08.780> a<00:07:08.810> little<00:07:08.960> bit<00:07:09.170> painful<00:07:09.350> and<00:07:10.360> you

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
process was a little bit painful and you

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.850 
process was a little bit painful and you
know<00:07:11.480> you<00:07:11.540> just<00:07:11.810> need<00:07:11.960> patience<00:07:12.470> really<00:07:12.650> and

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
know you just need patience really and

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.260 
know you just need patience really and
you<00:07:12.980> need<00:07:13.100> to<00:07:13.190> be<00:07:13.280> very<00:07:13.490> careful<00:07:13.940> with<00:07:14.030> all<00:07:14.150> the

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
you need to be very careful with all the

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.540 
you need to be very careful with all the
cables<00:07:14.660> on<00:07:14.780> the<00:07:14.870> back<00:07:15.020> of<00:07:15.140> the<00:07:15.200> screen<00:07:15.440> I<00:07:16.190> just

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
cables on the back of the screen I just

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.000 
cables on the back of the screen I just
take<00:07:16.910> care<00:07:16.940> really<00:07:17.590> obviously<00:07:18.590> it<00:07:18.650> does<00:07:18.830> void

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.010 
take care really obviously it does void

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.250 
take care really obviously it does void
your<00:07:19.250> warranty<00:07:19.510> it's<00:07:20.510> obvious<00:07:20.960> when<00:07:21.140> you've

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260 
your warranty it's obvious when you've

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.460 
your warranty it's obvious when you've
taken<00:07:21.440> the<00:07:21.620> machine<00:07:21.890> apart<00:07:22.220> so<00:07:22.780> yeah<00:07:23.780> I<00:07:23.990> guess

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470 
taken the machine apart so yeah I guess

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.660 
taken the machine apart so yeah I guess
it<00:07:24.590> comes<00:07:24.740> down<00:07:24.800> to<00:07:24.920> your<00:07:25.130> attitude<00:07:25.520> on<00:07:25.640> that

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.670 
it comes down to your attitude on that

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.100 
it comes down to your attitude on that
front<00:07:26.200> anyway<00:07:27.200> I<00:07:27.380> hope<00:07:27.620> that<00:07:27.800> helped
