00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.440 
one of these abilities and next one if
you're<00:01:24.150> using<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.729> trap<00:01:26.729> strategy<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you're using like the trap strategy and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.850 
you're using like the trap strategy and
you've<00:01:27.750> got<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.200> these<00:01:28.290> subsurface

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you've got one of these subsurface

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.770 
you've got one of these subsurface
resonators<00:01:29.490> down<00:01:29.700> or<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:30.240> could<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.540> call<00:01:30.659> it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
resonators down or we could just call it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.929 
resonators down or we could just call it
a<00:01:30.810> sub<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:31.290> he'll<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:32.100> off<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.909> a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
a sub for now he'll go off and get you a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.580 
a sub for now he'll go off and get you a
turbine<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.689> say<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:33.900> turbine<00:01:34.229> smashed

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
turbine just say your turbine smashed

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.080 
turbine just say your turbine smashed
he'll<00:01:34.799> go<00:01:34.979> off<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.220> get<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.460> another<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.850> now

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
he'll go off and get you another one now

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.580 
he'll go off and get you another one now
we'll<00:01:36.210> only<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:37.079> you've<00:01:37.200> built<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
we'll only do this if you've built the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.289 
we'll only do this if you've built the
turbines<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.369> bear<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.880> mind<00:01:38.909> and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
turbines to do bear that in mind and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.179 
turbines to do bear that in mind and
he'll<00:01:39.900> go<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.200> bring<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.470> back<00:01:40.500> for<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.950> like

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
he'll go and bring it back for you like

he'll go and bring it back for you like
you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.700> him<00:01:41.850> looks<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.420> small

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you can see him looks really small

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
actually when he carries it and he looks

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.340 
actually when he carries it and he looks
kind<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.610> funny<00:01:44.790> too<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.270> yeah<00:01:45.630> that's<00:01:45.810> really

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
just had him out and you was doing the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.560 
just had him out and you was doing the
trap<00:01:49.649> strategy<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.850> was<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.090> ah<00:01:51.210> dammit

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
trap strategy and you was like ah dammit

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.030 
trap strategy and you was like ah dammit
my<00:01:51.659> turbines<00:01:52.020> broke<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.590> actually<00:01:52.770> give

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
and we'll go into one of the other

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.470 
and we'll go into one of the other
abilities<00:02:56.010> involving<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.579> box<00:02:56.849> now<00:02:57.299> this

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
abilities involving the box now this

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.759 
abilities involving the box now this
probably<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.870> best<00:02:58.079> ability<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.620> this

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
probably the best ability that this

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.860 
probably the best ability that this
guy's<00:02:58.950> got<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.579> it's<00:03:00.060> when<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.389> box<00:03:00.599> isn't

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
guy's got and it's when the box isn't

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.050 
guy's got and it's when the box isn't
there<00:03:01.230> he'll<00:03:01.530> actually<00:03:01.769> go<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.459> fetch<00:03:02.790> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
there he'll actually go and fetch the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.759 
there he'll actually go and fetch the
box<00:03:03.269> from<00:03:03.450> wherever<00:03:03.689> it<00:03:04.019> is<00:03:04.139> and<00:03:04.379> bring<00:03:04.650> it

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
box from wherever it is and bring it

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.610 
box from wherever it is and bring it
back<00:03:04.799> to<00:03:05.129> that<00:03:05.280> location<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.629> amazing

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
back to that location that is amazing

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.470 
back to that location that is amazing
literally<00:03:08.220> if<00:03:08.370> there's<00:03:08.730> remember<00:03:09.299> playing

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
literally if there's remember playing

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.819 
literally if there's remember playing
with<00:03:09.569> merkins<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.139> wheels<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.379> high<00:03:10.560> round

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
with merkins and wheels on high round

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.339 
with merkins and wheels on high round
and<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.430> box<00:03:11.639> went<00:03:11.879> to<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.120> maze<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.629> then<00:03:12.989> we

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
and the box went to the maze and then we

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.619 
and the box went to the maze and then we
had<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.889> like<00:03:14.040> figure<00:03:14.849> out<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.299> try<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.450> move

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
had to like figure out and try and move

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.149 
had to like figure out and try and move
it<00:03:15.780> ourselves<00:03:15.870> we<00:03:16.349> can<00:03:16.470> just<00:03:16.620> get<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:16.889> guy<00:03:17.069> to

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
it ourselves we can just get this guy to

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.710 
it ourselves we can just get this guy to
go<00:03:17.340> bring<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:17.639> back<00:03:17.879> to<00:03:18.030> us<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.510> pretty

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
more candy and get there permanently so

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.680 
more candy and get there permanently so
it's<00:03:23.160> pretty<00:03:23.280> epic<00:03:23.430> you've<00:03:23.910> got<00:03:24.120> some<00:03:24.269> really

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
it's pretty epic you've got some really

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.509 
it's pretty epic you've got some really
good<00:03:24.780> abilities<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.470> are<00:03:26.010> doing<00:03:26.280> maybe<00:03:26.430> you

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
good abilities that are doing maybe you

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.589 
good abilities that are doing maybe you
guys<00:03:26.609> didn't<00:03:26.970> know<00:03:27.000> about<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.299> think<00:03:27.480> the

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
guys didn't know about I think the

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.300 
guys didn't know about I think the
mystery<00:03:27.810> box<00:03:28.290> ones<00:03:28.620> are<00:03:28.769> probably<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.099> best

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
mystery box ones are probably the best

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.039 
mystery box ones are probably the best
but<00:03:29.579> we've<00:03:29.699> got<00:03:29.849> a<00:03:29.879> few<00:03:30.120> more<00:03:30.269> others<00:03:30.629> after

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
but we've got a few more others after

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.399 
but we've got a few more others after
this<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:31.949> let's<00:03:32.129> look<00:03:32.310> at<00:03:32.489> our<00:03:32.609> next<00:03:32.909> one<00:03:33.030> and

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
this so let's look at our next one and

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.420 
this so let's look at our next one and
this<00:03:34.409> next<00:03:34.620> one<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:34.829> going<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.040> involve<00:03:35.280> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
this next one is going to involve the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.129 
this next one is going to involve the
workbench<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.209> can<00:03:36.329> actually<00:03:36.599> get<00:03:36.780> him<00:03:36.959> to

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
workbench you can actually get him to

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.720 
workbench you can actually get him to
build<00:03:37.409> stuff<00:03:37.680> for<00:03:37.919> you<00:03:38.040> as<00:03:38.159> well<00:03:38.370> there's

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
build stuff for you as well there's

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.220 
build stuff for you as well there's
quite<00:03:38.879> a<00:03:39.000> lot<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.180> stuff<00:03:39.419> that<00:03:39.599> this<00:03:39.780> guy<00:03:39.930> can't

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
quite a lot of stuff that this guy can't

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.229 
quite a lot of stuff that this guy can't
actually<00:03:40.500> do<00:03:40.829> you<00:03:41.370> could<00:03:41.489> do<00:03:41.579> so<00:03:41.940> many<00:03:42.120> things

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
actually do you could do so many things

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.149 
actually do you could do so many things
which<00:03:42.629> is<00:03:42.720> pretty<00:03:42.900> cool<00:03:43.079> so<00:03:43.290> what<00:03:43.889> you<00:03:43.979> want<00:03:44.099> to

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
which is pretty cool so what you want to

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.309 
which is pretty cool so what you want to
do<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.519> I'm<00:03:45.209> actually<00:03:45.449> putting<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.870> part<00:03:46.109> down

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
do is I'm actually putting a part down

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.839 
do is I'm actually putting a part down
because<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.709> want<00:03:46.919> the<00:03:47.069> tramplesteam<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.729> be

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
because I want the tramplesteam to be

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.969 
because I want the tramplesteam to be
built<00:03:48.150> here<00:03:48.359> so<00:03:48.900> if<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.109> add<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.290> part<00:03:49.650> first

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
built here so if you add a part first

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.860 
built here so if you add a part first
he'll<00:03:50.400> go<00:03:50.639> and<00:03:50.790> fetch<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.060> other<00:03:51.359> parts<00:03:51.750> I'm

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.449 
he'll go and fetch the other parts I'm
going<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.109> add<00:03:52.199> a<00:03:52.229> part<00:03:52.440> now<00:03:52.590> giving<00:03:53.280> some

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
going to add a part now giving some

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.159 
going to add a part now giving some
candy<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:53.970> he'll<00:03:54.239> go<00:03:54.419> and<00:03:54.510> build<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.870> rest<00:03:55.019> of

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
candy and he'll go and build the rest of

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.140 
candy and he'll go and build the rest of
the<00:03:55.260> tramplesteam<00:03:55.620> for<00:03:56.010> us<00:03:56.159> but<00:03:56.699> if<00:03:56.819> you<00:03:56.940> do<00:03:57.060> it

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
the tramplesteam for us but if you do it

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.420 
the tramplesteam for us but if you do it
without<00:03:57.239> adding<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.780> pot<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.229> all<00:03:59.220> that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
without adding a pot and all that

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.099 
without adding a pot and all that
doesn't<00:03:59.639> mean<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.329> that<00:04:00.449> he'll<00:04:00.629> just<00:04:00.720> run<00:04:00.989> off

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
doesn't mean is that he'll just run off

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.869 
doesn't mean is that he'll just run off
and<00:04:01.139> get<00:04:01.470> around<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:01.979> buildable<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.519> just

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
and get around and buildable and just

these are ones that are currently known

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.420 
these are ones that are currently known
there's<00:04:55.380> probably<00:04:55.650> going<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:55.920> be<00:04:55.980> some<00:04:56.160> others

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
I've got one last ability which I

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.060 
I've got one last ability which I
think's<00:05:00.150> really<00:05:00.210> useful<00:05:00.840> since<00:05:01.440> in<00:05:01.650> black<00:05:01.860> ops

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
think's really useful since in black ops

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.830 
think's really useful since in black ops
2<00:05:02.280> when<00:05:02.910> you've<00:05:03.030> got<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.180> crawler<00:05:03.450> and<00:05:03.600> you<00:05:03.690> go

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
2 when you've got a crawler and you go

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.840

into a certain area it always dies and

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.710 
into a certain area it always dies and
it's<00:05:06.000> really<00:05:06.300> annoying

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
it's really annoying

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.660 
it's really annoying

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
they'll actually babysit the crawler for

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.110
