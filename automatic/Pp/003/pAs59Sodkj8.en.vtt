00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
this is the next clip and there's so

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.380 
this is the next clip and there's so
much<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.840> do<00:03:45.080> in<00:03:45.110> this<00:03:45.319> game<00:03:45.849> 810<00:03:46.849> hours<00:03:46.970> or

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
much to do in this game 810 hours or

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.990 
much to do in this game 810 hours or
whatever<00:03:47.660> this<00:03:47.840> says<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.519> complete<00:03:49.880> this

whatever this says and to complete this
game<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.510> think<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.050> wrong<00:03:51.310> firstly<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.489> the

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
game I think the wrong firstly is the

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.220 
game I think the wrong firstly is the
missions<00:03:53.000> obviously<00:03:53.569> there's<00:03:53.810> tons<00:03:54.110> of

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
missions obviously there's tons of

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.479 
missions obviously there's tons of

sculpting tools I've got all them know

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.689 
sculpting tools I've got all them know
how<00:05:27.539> easy<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:27.870> get<00:05:28.139> anyway<00:05:29.039> yes<00:05:29.280> that's<00:05:29.550> why<00:05:29.669> I

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
how easy to get anyway yes that's why I

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.330 
how easy to get anyway yes that's why I
think<00:05:30.060> it<00:05:30.630> attacked<00:05:31.020> a<00:05:31.139> lot<00:05:31.349> more<00:05:31.590> than<00:05:32.009> ours

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
think it attacked a lot more than ours

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.969 
think it attacked a lot more than ours
to<00:05:32.550> complete<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.090> whole<00:05:33.270> of<00:05:33.479> this<00:05:33.599> game

to complete the whole of this game

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.770 
to complete the whole of this game
finding<00:05:34.979> all<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.520> relics<00:05:35.849> geodes<00:05:36.419> all<00:05:36.570> those

finding all the relics geodes all those

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.529 
finding all the relics geodes all those
tools<00:05:37.080> and<00:05:37.440> everything<00:05:37.849> it<00:05:38.849> took<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.090> while<00:05:39.330> I

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539
