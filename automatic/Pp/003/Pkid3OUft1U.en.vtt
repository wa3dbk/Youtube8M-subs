00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.730 
Bonnie I think it was and then we've had
another<00:02:30.700> picture<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.480> said<00:02:31.720> 30<00:02:32.230> years

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
another picture and it said 30 years

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.760 
another picture and it said 30 years
later<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:34.300> i'm<00:02:34.660> guessing<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.140> game<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.620> going

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
later so i'm guessing the game is going

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.290 
later so i'm guessing the game is going
to<00:02:35.830> be<00:02:35.890> 30<00:02:36.340> years<00:02:36.820> after<00:02:38.250> i<00:02:39.250> guess<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.910> second

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
to be 30 years after i guess the second

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.210 
to be 30 years after i guess the second
game<00:02:40.450> or<00:02:40.660> maybe<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.050> first<00:02:41.260> game<00:02:41.560> that's

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
game or maybe the first game that's

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.740 
game or maybe the first game that's
where<00:02:42.460> it's<00:02:42.580> based<00:02:42.790> around<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.420> it's<00:02:43.570> like

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
where it's based around and it's like

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.550 
where it's based around and it's like
five<00:02:44.710> laps<00:02:44.980> at<00:02:45.130> freddy's<00:02:45.430> 3<00:02:45.460> so<00:02:46.330> it's<00:02:46.750> 30<00:02:47.290> years

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
five laps at freddy's 3 so it's 30 years

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.980 
five laps at freddy's 3 so it's 30 years
later<00:02:48.210> 330<00:02:49.210> you<00:02:49.570> know<00:02:51.030> there's<00:02:52.030> only<00:02:52.120> one<00:02:52.540> left

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
later 330 you know there's only one left

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.690 
later 330 you know there's only one left
that<00:02:53.710> was<00:02:53.890> on<00:02:54.040> one<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.550> things<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:56.700> 30

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
that was on one of the things so 30

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.420 
that was on one of the things so 30
years<00:02:57.940> later<00:02:58.000> one<00:02:58.540> left<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.860> means<00:03:00.070> all

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
years later one left so that means all

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.200 
years later one left so that means all
the<00:03:01.030> other<00:03:01.200> animatronics<00:03:02.200> have<00:03:02.770> just<00:03:03.070> left<00:03:03.940> as

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
the other animatronics have just left as

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.050 
the other animatronics have just left as
you<00:03:04.360> can<00:03:04.450> see<00:03:04.630> in<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.810> picture<00:03:05.020> it's<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:06.280> box<00:03:06.760> of

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
you can see in the picture it's a box of

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.970 
you can see in the picture it's a box of
all<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.360> old<00:03:07.540> animatronics<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.770> one

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
all the old animatronics and the one

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.180 
all the old animatronics and the one
left<00:03:09.340> we'll<00:03:09.880> be<00:03:10.030> golden<00:03:10.270> Freddy<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.590> in<00:03:11.950> my

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
left we'll be golden Freddy so in my

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.880 
left we'll be golden Freddy so in my
opinion<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.790> think<00:03:12.820> golden<00:03:13.750> Freddy<00:03:14.020> kind<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.590> is

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
opinion I think golden Freddy kind of is

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.020 
opinion I think golden Freddy kind of is
the<00:03:15.610> king<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.390> guess<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.590> conqueror<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.370> all

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
the king I guess the conqueror of all

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.730 
the king I guess the conqueror of all
the<00:03:19.240> animatronics<00:03:20.610> my<00:03:21.610> guess<00:03:21.850> is<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.180> he

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
the animatronics my guess is that he

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.090 
the animatronics my guess is that he
destroyed<00:03:23.740> the<00:03:24.160> other<00:03:24.240> animatronics<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:26.100> gain

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
destroyed the other animatronics to gain

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.440 
destroyed the other animatronics to gain
more<00:03:27.580> popularity<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.600> guess<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.280> guess<00:03:30.700> it's

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
more popularity I guess so I guess it's

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.020 
more popularity I guess so I guess it's
gonna<00:03:32.250> be<00:03:33.250> really<00:03:33.720> hard<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:35.490> defeat<00:03:36.490> him<00:03:36.700> since

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
gonna be really hard to defeat him since

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.610 
gonna be really hard to defeat him since
there's<00:03:37.240> only<00:03:37.330> one<00:03:37.600> left<00:03:37.840> there's<00:03:38.140> obviously

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
there's only one left there's obviously

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.300 
there's only one left there's obviously
going<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:38.920> be<00:03:39.010> some<00:03:39.250> other<00:03:39.690> small<00:03:41.280> detail<00:03:42.280> that

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
going to be some other small detail that

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.370 
going to be some other small detail that
will<00:03:42.880> make<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.270> a<00:03:43.540> little<00:03:43.959> bit<00:03:44.200> more

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
will make it a little bit more

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.210 
will make it a little bit more
interesting<00:03:44.910> but<00:03:45.910> yeah<00:03:46.860> there's<00:03:47.860> another

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
interesting but yeah there's another

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.970 
interesting but yeah there's another
comment<00:03:48.730> it's<00:03:48.970> saying<00:03:49.330> they<00:03:49.870> are<00:03:50.170> watching<00:03:50.800> us

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
comment it's saying they are watching us

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.410 
comment it's saying they are watching us
so<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:52.030> could<00:03:52.270> mean<00:03:52.470> maybe<00:03:53.470> an<00:03:54.459> aura<00:03:54.940> of<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
so that could mean maybe an aura of the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.650 
so that could mean maybe an aura of the
place<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.290> watching<00:03:56.860> them<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:57.220> making<00:03:57.610> sure

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
place is watching them to making sure

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.060 
place is watching them to making sure
they're<00:03:58.660> not<00:03:58.810> doing<00:03:58.989> anything<00:03:59.260> bad<00:03:59.590> or<00:03:59.620> maybe

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
they're not doing anything bad or maybe

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.680 
they're not doing anything bad or maybe
um<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:03.010> animatronics<00:04:03.760> are<00:04:03.880> watching<00:04:04.330> someone

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
um the animatronics are watching someone

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.640 
um the animatronics are watching someone
else<00:04:04.900> or<00:04:05.290> that<00:04:06.160> could<00:04:06.400> mean<00:04:06.580> anything<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:07.650> yeah

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
else or that could mean anything so yeah

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.060 
else or that could mean anything so yeah
the<00:04:08.800> next<00:04:08.830> one<00:04:09.160> is<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:11.020> purple<00:04:11.470> man's<00:04:11.620> badge

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
the next one is a the purple man's badge

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.400 
the next one is a the purple man's badge
if<00:04:12.520> you've<00:04:13.030> ever<00:04:13.239> seen<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:13.810> it's<00:04:13.989> got<00:04:14.260> a

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
if you've ever seen it and it's got a

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.479 
if you've ever seen it and it's got a
purple<00:04:15.010> smiley<00:04:15.700> face<00:04:15.940> it's<00:04:16.600> like<00:04:16.750> a<00:04:17.489> cool

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
purple smiley face it's like a cool

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.360 
purple smiley face it's like a cool
little<00:04:18.730> smiley<00:04:19.450> face<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:20.290> that<00:04:20.500> might

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
little smiley face so that might

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.080 
little smiley face so that might
indicate<00:04:21.760> that<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.960> purple<00:04:23.530> man<00:04:23.710> will<00:04:24.520> be<00:04:24.700> in

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
indicate that the purple man will be in

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.210 
indicate that the purple man will be in
five<00:04:25.780> nights<00:04:25.990> at<00:04:26.260> Freddy's<00:04:26.620> 3

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
five nights at Freddy's 3

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.600 
five nights at Freddy's 3
or<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:28.360> phone<00:04:28.600> guy<00:04:28.870> maybe<00:04:29.110> it's<00:04:29.610> because

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
or the phone guy maybe it's because

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.730 
or the phone guy maybe it's because
everyone's<00:04:31.240> thinking<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.930> phone<00:04:32.110> guy<00:04:32.290> is<00:04:32.530> the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
everyone's thinking the phone guy is the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.550 
everyone's thinking the phone guy is the
purple<00:04:33.100> man<00:04:33.420> so<00:04:34.420> maybe<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.840> purple<00:04:35.200> man<00:04:35.350> will

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
purple man so maybe the purple man will

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.260 
purple man so maybe the purple man will
make<00:04:35.740> an<00:04:35.860> appearance<00:04:35.980> in<00:04:36.580> this<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.800> yeah

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
make an appearance in this and yeah

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.840 
make an appearance in this and yeah
another<00:04:40.270> comment<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:41.380> remain<00:04:42.130> so<00:04:42.640> this

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
another comment is I remain so this

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.940 
another comment is I remain so this
could<00:04:43.090> be<00:04:43.150> from<00:04:43.510> golden<00:04:44.020> Freddy<00:04:44.320> may<00:04:44.890> be

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
could be from golden Freddy may be

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.600 
could be from golden Freddy may be
saying<00:04:45.810> he's<00:04:46.810> destroyed<00:04:47.620> all<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.980> other

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
saying he's destroyed all the other

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.320 
saying he's destroyed all the other
animatronics<00:04:49.420> and<00:04:49.570> he<00:04:50.260> remains<00:04:51.060> because<00:04:52.060> he

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
animatronics and he remains because he

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.210 
animatronics and he remains because he
wanted<00:04:52.600> to<00:04:52.720> be<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:53.020> only<00:04:53.230> one<00:04:53.560> since<00:04:53.800> he<00:04:53.950> had

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
wanted to be the only one since he had

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.630 
wanted to be the only one since he had
