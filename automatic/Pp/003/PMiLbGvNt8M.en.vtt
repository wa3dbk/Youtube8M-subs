00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.160
 ayew people it's screwed but it's a 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.140
 good day of the hole for a soft music 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.910
 and well in any case me it's great and 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.010
 where I find for a new series a 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.420
 again on our youtube channel 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.790
 your bullshit will be for a new 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.140
 series that will be titled with a little 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.390
 your english so here is the bilingual 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.439
 French-English custom mode then 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.370
 what is it I explained it 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.800
 quite briefly 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.880
 so basically it's a series that goes 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.560
 to basically play with my 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.350
 subscribers or to people online I 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.190
 think I rather enjoyed 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.450
 privileged but is good and me big 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.920
 project joined since that has full 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.120
 ask me what I could play 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.800
 with you and that's precisely it had a 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.050
 opportunity wholesale it will be to play to 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.790
 parties on modes of play of course 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.510
 at the dock of the cursed gambling monks who do not 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.750
 are not available 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.950
 usually on on call of and there for the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.810
 first episode precisely we could 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.130
 see with the gameplay it's a mode 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.079
 zombieland we want to explain a little the 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.820
 principle on good call of duty black 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.350
 ops August 2 this series she will get 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.670
 unfold on several symposia like 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.610
 candy at the fare of pack not 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.470
 according to should you tell me if 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.000
 you really want to pass the model 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.530
 blackhawk flagship 2 two full cars 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.470
 more game modes and multiple maps 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.270
 there will perhaps there m23 code 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.370
 But I think it will be more 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.880
 black ops I like to have two so 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.080
 I immediately just you see in 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 these gameplay basically then the gameplay 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.860
 it was a small balance sheet of which I 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.150
 tested with shine for 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.070
 test drink it works well for at 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.150
 prefers videos and I thought that 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.240
 for the first video it's not there 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.290
 really a video like gfr for them 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.799
 next episodes but rather a video 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.720
 of presentation 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.280
 we see there it was a small balance sheet 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.970
 so a zombie game mode on the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.590
 cover flow 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.369
 so why do I sign because I like it because 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.680
 I did on all maps 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.060
 I was trying to sit on tottenham we 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.240
 it was friday night with my subscribers 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.460
 were a little near 16 maximum season has 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.350
 been partly private and basically if a 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.670
 part where I could resist because 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.920
 until the end of time because we have 10 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.299
 minutes so I explain a little the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.729
 principle of my series it will be to do 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.439
 precisely to parties left with 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.469
 my subscribers so I think I'll you 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.849
 warned or as soon as I will know about 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.020
 my fashion account on the roger track 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.250
 break I see myself 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.050
 I will invite you but you will do 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.540
 parties with me anyway at every 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.010
 once I published ebay the episode I 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.940
 put in the inscription I think 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.830
 that she is going to be episode 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.090
 what's going to be the next episode on 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.100
 what game modes and on which games 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.590
 so you can tell me if you 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.150
 want to join me the images of the tsunami 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.410
 so I explained now a little the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.780
 zombie landes principle because I think 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.790
 that he is not bad of the deserts landes on 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.660
 his mast chain cockroach the zombie lamb 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.610
 fir game modes quite unique enough in 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.460
 big it's a bit of an infected mode except 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.980
 we have two teams we have money from 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.790
 life we ​​have a menu mode to buy 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.020
 ammunition asset skills 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.970
 walls of arms 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.390
 a lot of things like that and at the same 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.370
 time help flags in the flag 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.710
 and coral brochures of the teleporters 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.730
 and we also have bloggers like this 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.200
 therefore more separately to the group 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.510
 winner with doors that open 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.740
 strategic parcel hookups it depends 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.850
 maps there are all the maps that are 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.140
 like that they carry way of they are 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.190
 really better than others 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.350
 it was really not the best 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:16.090
 what we resisted well so here is 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.110
 for this video is getting ready live but 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.360
 I think I'm trying to organize myself 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.040
 to do live wholesale I 'm going to do 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.840
 a the party and at the same time I'm going 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.100
 comment at the same time as the party at 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.840
 less knew rather funny and at least 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.100
 I will be able to communicate with my subscribers 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.020
 yes it's quite difficult that 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.270
 adding very little that sprinkles with the 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.350
 micro path is sure been a big one so we 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.000
 will try to have failed in his homework 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.070
 anyway the same can see in 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.510
 marked rise photo mode the microphone for 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.320
 here we are we can not see that the 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.840
 others because they were in 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.280
 studio but the people they spoke well 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.290
 we got it and it was 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.630
 really funny I think it's 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.220
 terrible as you please and that makes me 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.330
 like thought it makes me think of 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.070
 a person I really liked 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.020
 put on YouTube some oxides 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.700
 game if you want is known it's a 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.720
 person who was just doing it there 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.280
 had a chain is mainly based 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.420
 there are more than 10000 subscribers he was walking 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.560
 well this guy he had even passed on 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.340
 chains like sharks little like qg 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.020
 or side f with a same to 1 1 phoenix the 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.640
 five surveys he's videos with him 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.050
 he was just introducing nina not they have 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.220
 of course way to reward two 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.510
 series than what she did that she was playing 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.160
 with his subscribers will greet loved ones were 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.660
 subscribers I liked it that's why 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.430
 that I know to take back a little bit 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.410
 idea even though yes I'm more videos 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.390
 and on just this new call of 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.919
 since the same morning both if you 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.250
 really up to date and in addition we 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.650
 can not really play it too 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.580
 these votes is quite difficult to access 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.890
 on black ops here it is it's really 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.910
 easy enough to access so the others 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.430
 modes that I could offer you this 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.720
 will be zombie lamp top this one of 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.580
 hide-and-seek our sahara of the best 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.110
 raid modes 6 so that's really enough 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.490
 funny we can disguise an object 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.430
 like that in two runs 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.050
 there are the researchers and the things that 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.430
 basically hide it's enough 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.140
 crazy this for those who know the 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.250
 modem 2 it's the same I could 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.540
 also do ahly zombies on the 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.630
 dead of if you're leaving we have 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.280
 preferred that you go bypass 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.020
 could do that we could do to 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.430
 high stakes durix kippen wholesale if you 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.140
 want it's basically that's real 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.669
 of which 1 v1 rather because basically it goes 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.530
 to be a part where we only play 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.660
 knight hours we can do scop 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.919
 this new style can we when we 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.060
 back to normal and we can not 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.650
 to make a knife so basically there will be 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.460
 not the tube lines as we could 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.140
 read etc 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.330
 there are others like me I can 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.040
 propose rpt on the coast of good it is 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.480
 not great that it says your inquiry 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.040
 my name is not at all how that 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.370
 is called a French it was the fashion where 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:26.270
 we had to kill guys in 30 seconds 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.910
 on ghost that's it if you remember it 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.590
 there was anything else as convenient 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.430
 there is also game rage mode and full 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.140
 other small fashion hands 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.190
 are not too great after the 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.110
 three communes issue as the zombie 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.180
 heathland on a purpose to give full and this 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.800
 that catch is also a long record of where 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.390
 I think it would be unworthy of the modes 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.740
 I could do because they need 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.060
 of his ranks super fun especially this 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.110
 black ops and there are plenty of players and 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.640
 I lean to say what is my shovel 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.350
 are pretty huge which classifies one 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.910
 little dedication to the cra that 59 who wants 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.979
 put a little dedications just a 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.110
 bide or had not even expected 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:58.160
 hold with a little heart so thank you has 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.570
 you so here it is so here I think the 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.290
 do these modes earlier so like the 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.690
 said but to leave comments 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.120
 in the video frankly I think that 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.630
 it'll be pretty fun and hp tempted to 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.090
 to propose 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.229
 it's this series ap chains 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.450
 that compensated enough 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.830
 original because I think I never know 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.110
 views on youtube and I saw nobody 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.669
 who did that on youtube 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.260
 because frankly it's really 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.870
 h modes and friendly and it changes I 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.120
 normal we will say that renews the game 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.470
 so here I think you a little 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.450
 understood principle so the next 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.729
 episode I tried to do it live 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.960
 as it will be even more fun 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:31.610
 yet done on the concrete assessment seeds 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.100
 of blackhawk 2 it would surprise me that 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.010
 patrice dison b london on a map 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.090
 and as it could see and over 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.960
 time we will see if the series works well 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.470
 but I think it will work because 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.360
 it's a pretty original series so 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.130
 since the gameplay will soon finish 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.200
 because I loved to all die I will do
