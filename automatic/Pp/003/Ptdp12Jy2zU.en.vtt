00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.250
 what is done and the human being is that 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.550
 energy that we bring 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.680
 to an office to a meeting towards other 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.869
 people etc 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.900
 sometimes you will have noticed that in a 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.590
 meeting reaches a person and suddenly 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.529
 the place cools not the coexistence 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.540
 it kind of works out a bit and that sometimes 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.320
 it has to do with the energy that a 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.660
 person is leading to a place 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.820
 then sometimes you have to reflect and 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.600
 there you have to see what kind of energy 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.760
 we are broadcasting towards people is not 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.120
 also responsibility of us like this 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.230
 as not spreading flu 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.960
 infect bad energies 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.770
 If we have not had a bad day, 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.960
 Normally we will generate bad energy 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.810
 if we had the discussion we are in 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.930
 the process of generating bad energies does not 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.210
 if we have received bad news 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.240
 we will generate bad energies then in 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.500
 those moments is important 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.660
 have a private space not to go 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.410
 with other people because then to 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.590
 sometimes unintentionally first insist the 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.620
 life of other people but also this one 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.840
 sometimes sucks, we go inadvertently 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.869
 positive energies to improve them 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.910
 then it is important to be aware 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.490
 of one's energy then I'm going to 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.160
 give some guidelines on how to evaluate 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.440
 where is our energy in the first 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.860
 place when we get up how we 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.320
 we feel we feel rested or we 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.410
 we feel tired not if we feel 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.180
 tired tiredness is contagious and 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.250
 we are going to demand an energy that is going to 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.500
 manage the energy of other people 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.050
 so good if we get up 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.570
 tired then at least you have to 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.420
 have a good breakfast not to be able to 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.910
 counteract some of that fatigue and 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.220
 make a mental note saying good 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.590
 tonight I'm going to go to bed early 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.560
 so that tomorrow is better that's what 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.780
 First 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.209
 second place good breakfast is not 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.130
 breakfast is one of the most meals 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.709
 important of the day actually for me 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.110
 all meals are important but 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.560
 well we start the day and breakfast is 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.200
 just break the fast that is the 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.280
 eight-hour period that one has been 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.150
 resting and has not consumed food 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.019
 that's breakfast then I must see myself 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.900
 in the mirror and say this how I look 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.560
 I see sad I look upset I see myself 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.600
 bitter or I look happy and good 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.450
 psychological studies show that 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.049
 when I force a smile on me 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.099
 face I start to generate in my good 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.430
 Energy 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:09.790
 so I smile I smile to myself 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.129
 gave a smile not in the bathroom 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.980
 while I'm doing and so 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.620
 I start to generate good energy and 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.829
 remember when I wake up tired 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.099
 I have bad bad news to smile for 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:27.900
 counteract the bad energy laughter is 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:31.019
 very important this started it 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.170
 the great scholar for me norman coaching 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.240
 in his famous book the anatomy of a 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.360
 disease where he discovered 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.960
 when the king to laughter from his 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.690
 stomach as he says this one had a 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.730
 anesthetic effect and then the pain 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.810
 that he felt in his joints was going 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.340
 for a couple of hours 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.290
 then laugh is very good 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.019
 and he said he had to laugh 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.970
 honestly but the latest studies 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.050
 already show that the body does not know the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:08.020
 difference between a 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:12.060
 a smile or a laugh this 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.530
 artificially generate like this 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.380
 naturally of course it is not to have 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.830
 for example a movie with a comedy 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.950
 that makes us laugh is not the best but 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:28.060
 this one can also go to these 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:32.320
 centers that teach laughter therapy 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:36.370
 and power is learning to laugh out loud 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.010
 and that is totally therapeutic and that 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.870
 It also helps us generate very good 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.900
 energies the other obviously is the 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:48.040
 forgiveness therapy not forgiving does not want 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.800
 to say commute an affront not to forgive 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.860
 it means that we develop 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.450
 the ability to remember those events 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.820
 that have generated us bad moments 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:04.150
 resentments etcetera and this remember 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.050
 the unjustly generate the bad 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.870
 bad energies 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.840
 that is fundamentally the therapy of 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.050
 sorry then of those in this way 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.810
 it handles a bit the human energy is 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.360
 simplified these issues not but good 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.150
 I hope these tips I've given you 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.370
 As it helps, remember not the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.060
 time has to be adequate the place 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.370
 it has to be also this 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.040
 and sanitized by a good function but 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.480
 also the human being must be healthy 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.530
 for good emotions 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.530
 thank you very much
