00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.020
 meanwhile, this miracle has already been brought to us 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.900
 a prize for such a pretty heavy one 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.700
 adren give up 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.220
 I tell the Kazakh need this monitor he 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.379
 trying extra kazakhstan 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.430
 bad internet but it will be good 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.879
 monitor adren minus 8 13 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.600
 home modern prepared for this tournament 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:58.790
 in my opinion a dream is just such a monitor 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.440
 you don't recognize shooting here 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.469
 just shooting I mean there in my opinion 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.509
 just gutting my ax for now 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.240
 the champion works out your very zone 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.970
 but my champion gives minus 5 on 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.060
 parapet and after that still goes snack 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.950

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.270
 the end of the pen is half two rounds and jois 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.400
 gives comeback is necessary here just luck 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.400
 I think that the monitor does not want a big 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.400
 beautiful with one millisecond delay and 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.049

 Adreno advantage or all the same 263 1 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.299
 half toughly played in three rounds 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.280
 advantage fervent need him to take 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.799
 only 4 to win and exhale is necessary 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.759

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.159

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.720

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.190
