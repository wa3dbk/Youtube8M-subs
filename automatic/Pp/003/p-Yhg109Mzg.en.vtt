00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
think it's not the level we are judging

for the admins it's important for us to

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.260 
for the admins it's important for us to
have<00:03:38.190> girls<00:03:38.460> so<00:03:39.210> they<00:03:39.930> could<00:03:40.110> have<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.380> better

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270
