00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.340
 this game was one of the pioneers in having a specialist scenarios 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.840
 says they used to and continued the judge has accepted one screen to another the game is 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.940
 so popular in Japan although its monetary value for collectors is the 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 equivalent of 6 thousand 500 stores 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.390

 power is set in our days 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.190
 the story talks about me 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.410
 a 12-year-old boy who has psychic powers and was so much to use them 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.020
 to end with alien invasion and whose purpose is to control the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.080
 human minds 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.330
 although for that a very special song is expected 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
 this song is divided into several steps by all cities 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.690
 indigent to collect them to kill them 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.750
 it's a science fiction story I felt a bit slow but 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.750
 safe 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.360
 In the beginning, moving was also gaining an entire level of English 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.420
 nor will it have a few touches and censure 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.690

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.870

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.700
 the way to play moderate used to be based on everyday life with 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.360
 children of our time sony defend themselves canes and wild animals with aids 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.360
 from foreigners 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.630

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:10.389
 Iran 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.829

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.559
 very seriously if the strain super nintendo what happened 20 to 64 dt 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:24.889
