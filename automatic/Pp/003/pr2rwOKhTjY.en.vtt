I've got a twenty ton jack off my press

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.740 
I've got a twenty ton jack off my press
and<00:01:58.620> I've<00:01:59.220> got<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> launch<00:01:59.790> bowl<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.360> don't<00:02:00.659> we

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and I've got a launch bowl I don't we

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.290 
and I've got a launch bowl I don't we
cut<00:02:00.900> down<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.440> what<00:02:02.190> I'm<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.460> do<00:02:02.730> I'll

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
cut down and what I'm going to do I'll

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.240 
cut down and what I'm going to do I'll
show<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.979> top<00:02:04.979> end<00:02:06.530> up<00:02:07.530> here<00:02:07.860> against

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
show you on the top end up here against

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.369 
show you on the top end up here against
the<00:02:08.459> roof<00:02:09.360> truss<00:02:09.659> I've<00:02:10.560> mounted<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.940> six<00:02:12.870> by<00:02:13.050> six

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
the roof truss I've mounted a six by six

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.470 
the roof truss I've mounted a six by six
and<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.519> what<00:02:14.700> we're<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:14.940> do<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.450> a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and so what we're going to do is a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.600 
and so what we're going to do is a
theory<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.379> to<00:02:16.530> Jack<00:02:16.769> this<00:02:16.950> thing<00:02:17.010> up<00:02:17.370> and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
theory is to Jack this thing up and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.030 
theory is to Jack this thing up and
hopefully<00:02:18.510> it'll<00:02:18.840> raise<00:02:19.049> it<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.530> then

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
hopefully it'll raise it up and then

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.270 
hopefully it'll raise it up and then
we'll<00:02:20.310> dig<00:02:20.819> down<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.390> we'll<00:02:22.140> pour<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.860> little

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
we'll dig down and we'll pour a little

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.820 
we'll dig down and we'll pour a little
concrete<00:02:23.459> pad<00:02:23.909> in<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.659> secure<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.440> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
concrete pad in this and secure it the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.220 
concrete pad in this and secure it the
way<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.069> should<00:02:26.129> have<00:02:26.340> been<00:02:26.459> done<00:02:26.580> originally

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
way it should have been done originally

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.550 
way it should have been done originally
beginning<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.409> cracking<00:02:29.330> settling

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.600 

but<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.620> wasn't<00:02:34.920> really<00:02:35.010> sure<00:02:35.220> if<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.459> was

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
but I wasn't really sure if this was

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.640 
but I wasn't really sure if this was
going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.880> work<00:02:36.060> when<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.330> first<00:02:36.599> did<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.870> I'm

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
going to work when I first did it I'm

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.140 
going to work when I first did it I'm
really<00:02:37.950> surprised<00:02:38.340> how<00:02:38.459> easily<00:02:38.819> that's

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
really surprised how easily that's

00:02:39.150 --> 00:03:08.210 
really surprised how easily that's
coming<00:02:39.420> out<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.660> ground<00:03:04.519> do<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:08.010> here's

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
coming out of the ground do it so here's

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.380 
coming out of the ground do it so here's
how<00:03:08.340> we're<00:03:08.459> going<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.670> fix<00:03:08.819> this<00:03:08.940> I'm<00:03:09.209> going<00:03:09.330> to

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
how we're going to fix this I'm going to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.330 
how we're going to fix this I'm going to
take<00:03:09.510> these<00:03:09.690> big<00:03:09.930> spikes<00:03:10.260> here<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.160> see

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
take these big spikes here like you see

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.890 
take these big spikes here like you see
and<00:03:12.150> we're<00:03:12.299> going<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.450> drive<00:03:12.690> them<00:03:12.870> down

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
and we're going to drive them down

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.140 
and we're going to drive them down
inside<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:14.100> post<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.640> then<00:03:14.730> pour<00:03:15.000> some

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
inside the post and then pour some

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.850 
inside the post and then pour some
concrete<00:03:15.299> around<00:03:15.720> dig<00:03:15.989> down<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.230> couple<00:03:16.680> feet

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
concrete around dig down a couple feet

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.550 
concrete around dig down a couple feet
on<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:18.150> post<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.569> we<00:03:18.660> just<00:03:18.840> jacked<00:03:19.110> up<00:03:19.319> and

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
on the post that we just jacked up and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.320 
on the post that we just jacked up and
we'll<00:03:19.739> drive<00:03:19.980> some<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.250> those<00:03:20.430> big<00:03:20.730> spikes<00:03:21.090> in

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
we'll drive some of those big spikes in

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.970 
we'll drive some of those big spikes in
the<00:03:21.480> side<00:03:21.690> there<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.170> then<00:03:22.650> we'll<00:03:22.769> fill<00:03:22.950> that

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
the side there and then we'll fill that

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.130 
the side there and then we'll fill that
up<00:03:23.130> with<00:03:23.220> concrete<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.450> will<00:03:24.690> secure

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
up with concrete and that will secure

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.870 
up with concrete and that will secure
that<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.860> keep<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.190> from<00:03:26.370> coming<00:03:26.610> down<00:03:26.640> to

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
that and keep that from coming down to

that and keep that from coming down to
any<00:03:26.970> further<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.540> then<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.470> keep<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> rest<00:03:28.950> of

all prepped and ready for concrete we'll

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.030 
all prepped and ready for concrete we'll
drive<00:03:36.540> some<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.780> those<00:03:36.930> baek's<00:03:37.230> bikes<00:03:37.739> right

at the ground level and the concrete

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.180 
at the ground level and the concrete
will<00:03:40.170> set<00:03:40.320> around<00:03:40.560> them<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.100> will

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
will set around them and that will

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.440 
will set around them and that will

and when you do in concrete small bats

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.610 
and when you do in concrete small bats
and<00:04:20.549> stuff<00:04:20.729> make<00:04:21.000> sure<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.209> shake<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:22.019> stick<00:04:22.410> or

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
and stuff make sure you shake a stick or

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.120 
and stuff make sure you shake a stick or
a<00:04:22.650> rod<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.250> really<00:04:24.500> chunk<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.560> in<00:04:25.890> there

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
a rod and really chunk that in there

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.990 
a rod and really chunk that in there
you'll<00:04:26.910> get<00:04:27.150> a<00:04:27.930> lot<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.770> voids<00:04:29.039> in<00:04:29.340> concrete<00:04:29.880> so

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
you'll get a lot of voids in concrete so

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.439 
you'll get a lot of voids in concrete so
get

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
get

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.510

pocket<00:04:30.840> in<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.650> by<00:04:31.770> doing<00:04:31.800> this<00:04:32.249> we'll

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
pocket in it and by doing this we'll

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.489 
pocket in it and by doing this we'll
bring<00:04:32.699> it<00:04:32.819> all<00:04:32.939> to<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.330> top<00:04:33.569> so<00:04:34.080> whenever<00:04:34.259> you

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:34.499 
bring it all to the top so whenever you

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:38.809 
bring it all to the top so whenever you
do<00:04:34.650> a<00:04:34.680> small<00:04:35.039> horrible<00:04:35.749> pad<00:04:36.749> or<00:04:37.610> whatever<00:04:38.610> make

do a small horrible pad or whatever make
sure<00:04:38.999> you<00:04:39.289> you<00:04:40.289> really<00:04:40.499> chunk<00:04:40.949> it<00:04:41.099> in<00:04:41.219> good<00:04:41.990> so

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
sure you you really chunk it in good so

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.459 
sure you you really chunk it in good so
we'll<00:04:43.139> let<00:04:43.259> this<00:04:43.319> sit<00:04:43.770> for<00:04:43.939> 48<00:04:44.939> hours<00:04:45.029> or<00:04:45.360> so

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:45.469 
we'll let this sit for 48 hours or so

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:48.439 
we'll let this sit for 48 hours or so
well<00:04:46.469> I'll<00:04:46.949> take<00:04:47.159> the<00:04:47.309> jack<00:04:47.520> off<00:04:47.759> and<00:04:47.969> this

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
well I'll take the jack off and this

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.809 
well I'll take the jack off and this
will<00:04:48.749> support<00:04:49.379> this<00:04:49.770> post<00:04:50.069> until<00:04:50.400> we<00:04:50.610> get<00:04:50.699> this

will support this post until we get this

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.670 
will support this post until we get this
lab<00:04:51.089> in<00:04:51.330> it<00:04:51.809> doesn't<00:04:52.050> have<00:04:52.139> to<00:04:52.259> hold<00:04:52.439> it<00:04:52.559> very

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
lab in it doesn't have to hold it very

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.140 
lab in it doesn't have to hold it very
long<00:04:52.800> just<00:04:53.219> long<00:04:53.430> enough<00:04:53.490> for<00:04:53.699> me<00:04:53.819> to<00:04:53.939> get<00:04:54.029> the

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
long just long enough for me to get the

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.019 
long just long enough for me to get the
jack<00:04:54.389> out<00:04:54.629> once<00:04:55.439> we<00:04:55.620> put<00:04:55.800> once<00:04:55.979> we<00:04:56.129> pour<00:04:56.370> four

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:57.029 
jack out once we put once we pour four

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.779 
jack out once we put once we pour four
four<00:04:57.180> four<00:04:57.419> inches<00:04:57.719> of<00:04:57.870> concrete<00:04:58.050> here<00:04:58.789> what

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
four four inches of concrete here what

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.489 
four four inches of concrete here what
I'll<00:04:59.879> do<00:05:00.059> is<00:05:00.210> I'll<00:05:00.330> put<00:05:00.360> some<00:05:00.659> two<00:05:00.809> by<00:05:00.990> sixes<00:05:01.319> on

00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:01.499 
I'll do is I'll put some two by sixes on

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:04.070 
I'll do is I'll put some two by sixes on
the<00:05:01.589> side<00:05:01.830> bolt<00:05:02.219> them<00:05:02.430> through<00:05:02.729> so<00:05:03.360> those<00:05:03.839> will

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
the side bolt them through so those will

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.899 
the side bolt them through so those will
sit<00:05:04.319> on<00:05:04.349> the<00:05:04.499> slab<00:05:04.800> itself<00:05:05.009> giving<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.699> even

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
sit on the slab itself giving it even

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.600 
sit on the slab itself giving it even
more<00:05:06.439> strength<00:05:07.439> and<00:05:07.650> preventing<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.580> from

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
more strength and preventing it from

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.179 
more strength and preventing it from
sinking<00:05:09.419> any<00:05:09.599> further<00:05:09.810> I'll<00:05:10.259> also<00:05:10.560> do<00:05:10.860> that<00:05:11.039> on

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:11.189 
sinking any further I'll also do that on

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.189 
sinking any further I'll also do that on
all<00:05:11.219> the<00:05:11.580> rest<00:05:11.759> of<00:05:11.909> them<00:05:12.029> so<00:05:12.810> we<00:05:12.870> don't<00:05:13.050> have

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
all the rest of them so we don't have

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.959 
all the rest of them so we don't have
any<00:05:13.409> more<00:05:13.529> settling<00:05:13.919> problems<00:05:14.370> I'm

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:14.969 
any more settling problems I'm

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:16.820 
any more settling problems I'm
suspecting<00:05:15.449> that<00:05:15.870> whoever<00:05:16.259> installed<00:05:16.710> this

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
suspecting that whoever installed this

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.409 
suspecting that whoever installed this
pull<00:05:17.069> barn<00:05:17.310> they<00:05:17.759> probably<00:05:17.969> just<00:05:18.120> threw<00:05:18.389> a

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
pull barn they probably just threw a

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.809 
pull barn they probably just threw a
couple<00:05:18.629> shovels<00:05:18.839> of<00:05:19.110> gravel<00:05:19.439> in<00:05:19.529> the<00:05:19.560> bottom

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
couple shovels of gravel in the bottom

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.450 
couple shovels of gravel in the bottom
it<00:05:20.819> didn't<00:05:21.120> put<00:05:21.270> any<00:05:21.449> concrete<00:05:21.689> and<00:05:22.199> up<00:05:23.069> here

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
it didn't put any concrete and up here

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.209 
it didn't put any concrete and up here
where<00:05:24.330> we're<00:05:24.479> at<00:05:24.659> we<00:05:25.319> have<00:05:25.469> so<00:05:25.710> much<00:05:25.860> thawing

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
where we're at we have so much thawing

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.670 
where we're at we have so much thawing
and<00:05:26.490> freezing<00:05:26.550> that<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.270> soil<00:05:27.569> really<00:05:28.289> heaves

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
and freezing that the soil really heaves

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.559 
and freezing that the soil really heaves
up<00:05:28.889> and<00:05:29.069> down<00:05:29.219> a<00:05:29.249> lot<00:05:29.520> that's<00:05:30.120> why<00:05:30.330> it's<00:05:30.449> really

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 
up and down a lot that's why it's really

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.339 
up and down a lot that's why it's really
important<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.169> secure<00:05:31.499> these<00:05:31.710> so<00:05:32.520> we<00:05:33.349> protect

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
important to secure these so we protect

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.670 
important to secure these so we protect
the<00:05:34.469> integrity<00:05:34.710> of<00:05:34.979> our<00:05:35.219> pool<00:05:35.999> building<00:05:36.330> here

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
the integrity of our pool building here

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.800 
the integrity of our pool building here
so<00:05:37.680> that's<00:05:37.919> it<00:05:38.129> and<00:05:38.430> I'd<00:05:39.029> share<00:05:39.360> that<00:05:39.389> with<00:05:39.659> you

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
so that's it and I'd share that with you

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.149 
so that's it and I'd share that with you
and<00:05:41.180> hopefully<00:05:42.180> next<00:05:42.719> video<00:05:42.960> will<00:05:43.169> be<00:05:43.199> towards

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
and hopefully next video will be towards

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:51.999 
and hopefully next video will be towards
a<00:05:44.249> mud<00:05:44.430> dull<00:05:44.819> ceiling
