 Eugenie Kitchen 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.629
 Hi, I'm Eugenie. 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.769
 Today I'm going to make macaroons. 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.660
 Some people say that Macaron. 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.900
 There are plenty of recipes and demonstrations there. 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.160
 That day I did not invent my own description, 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.000
 The recipe will use Cordon Bleu, 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.210
 Culinary School in Paris. 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.820
 And Aeri, 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.970
 thank you very much! 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.089
 Aeri Kitchen is a Korean cooking channel. 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.420
 My channel recommended, 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.339
 Where there were many opinions and participants yesterday. 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.969
 everybody, 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.440
 Thank you very much and welcome to my channel. 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.300
 I will do my best! 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.629
 For this recipe, you will need to: 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.649
 60 g egg whites, 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.730
 30 g of soft sugar, 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.170
 50 g ground almonds, 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.480
 Sugar 90 g sweeteners', 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.000
 a pinch of salt, 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.980
 40 grams strawberry jam, 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.120
 Red and food coloring. 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.820
 Firstly, 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.410
 In the mixing bowl, 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.540
 Add the egg whites. 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.540
 And overcame it severely until foamy. 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.200
 Then add the sugar slowly while the skin. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.960
 Keep air in egg whites 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.790
 So form a soft top. 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.790
 This is called "French Meringue". 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.060
 Add in a drop of red color. 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.140
 And whisk up combined. 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.739
 In another bowl, check the ground almonds, 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.269
 Sugar sweeteners', 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.799
 And salt. 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:19.939
 And whisk together. 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:26.939
 Pour the confectioners' sugar mixture into a meringue 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.959
 Fold with a spoon. 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.629
 Stop folding when the surface of the mixture begins to be shiny. 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:58.629
 Fill a pastry bag fitted with a pastry tip with batter. 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.950
 Then repair a college degree paper on baking paper. 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:17.469
 And tubes on a parchment paper. 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.389
 After finishing the tubing, let stand in the tempurture room 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.879
 Until the surface is dried. 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.099
 It took today one hour. 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:36.099
 Bake for 13 minutes at 150 Â° C or 300 F. 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:46.329
 Once cool, remove the macaroons carefully off the parchment paper. 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.310
 On the underside of the macaroni, 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.359
 Place a teaspoon of strawberry jam 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:59.279
 And make a sandwich with another macaroni. 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:03.099
 Macaronis ... 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.389
 I think the beauty of Macaron is feet. 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:12.519
 I mean the ruffles are trimmed on the edges. 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.919
 The surface looks like a shell egg, 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.160
 And now also feel like egg shell. 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.160
 The texture is soft and rubbery. 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.190
 Voila, 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.960
 Characteristics of French macaroons. 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.389
 thanks for watching. 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.030
 Bye for now!
