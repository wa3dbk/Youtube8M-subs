00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.079
 24 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.960
 hello welcome back in my channel what 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.599
 done like that to make it a little more 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.700
 let's say natural I got it good 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.050
 today I bring you a very special video 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.180
 tight what do you mean with very 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.869
 special according to you almost all your videos 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.699
 they are special 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.440
 Give us some reason why we 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.000
 we can determine and classify in this 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.710
 video as special on your channel 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.150
 well then the first reason god could 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.280
 give is that this video is not 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.140
 exclusively from modern warfare 3 that 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.670
 it is evident right now in front of 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.410
 our eyes but what if I tell you 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.140
 that essex also not consigned in addition to 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.520
 feel 3 if surely as you will 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.070
 guessed already or at least you will be 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.469
 trying on I'm making you dollars 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.550
 I have devised a new video system 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.870
 for you that now I am going to 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.489
 comment what it is about 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.770
 in the best possible way you already know 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.090
 how do I usually do it but before 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.039
 nothing to tell you that if I do not leave the 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.750
 head let me tell you something and that is 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.580
 I just finished my first streaming of 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.140
 competitive thanks ambulance for sonar 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.640
 right now these instants 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.350
 my first competitive streaming and for 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.670
 that same reason I'm going to leave a link 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.810
 in the description you are also going to 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.660
 have on screen right now in form 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.799
 annotation so you can access the 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.900
 twitch where the 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.130
 streaming so you can pass 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.290
 for the situation of seeing me suffer and 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.730
 comment pathetically I think that 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.550
 It can be quite fun for 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.230
 you bastards good you will have 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.760
 noticing that a new one has just appeared 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.460
 modern warfare gameplay 3 in our 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.110
 screens like that if an apparent reason and 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.400
 it really is how I had it and 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.350
 that's going to help me expose what 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.610
 I really have thought for you and 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.320
 is that lately they have had boys already 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.760
 I said it in the previous video a lot of way 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.020
 Battlefield 3 because you say good 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.760
 Well, precisely because I follow it 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.950
 having and that came to question me 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.180
 many things are really tight 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.500
 because you had both battlefield 3 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.300
 after so long of having it 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.770
 really abandoned a question that 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.330
 we have all in mind battlefield 3 is 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.340
 better than modern warfare 3 and the 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.170
 lavender in this 8 at this point 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.610
 because the silos questioned you jump 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.140
 in plain sight it's obvious but I 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.550
 I also see it I think so too 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.140
 as many of you are surely going to 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.180
 have three is a better game is a game 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.710
 much more elaborate but it does not stop being 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.660
 a personal opinion a vision 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.920
 subjective of things and really if not 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.600
 we agreed tests have a certain 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.190
 validity and I have proposed exactly 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.900
 that objective provide evidence and 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.670
 determine finally which game is better 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.260
 or just determine if they are 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.030
 different and they bring us playability is 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.560
 I'll do different things from the point 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.620
 of good sight then from the point of 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.180
 view that characterizes a shooter from 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.860
 you already know that there are weapons that appear in 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.940
 modern warfare 3 and battlefield 3 from 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.290
 the same name what I'm going to do is 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.780
 compare them taking into account 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.159
 same aspects that I follow that I continue in a 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.260
 video of normal comparisons in the 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.849
 canal i llevant year is worth those that I 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.860
 you have been following for a while now, you know 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.510
 you will not see it from now on and that's what 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.980
 will allow to have variety in the same 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.930
 video in an eight minute video then to 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.190
 to please everyone and bring matters 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.220
 filter without modern warfare 3 so that 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.269
 you are all a little bit 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.319
 happy, let's start with the 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.000
 hurt you already know that I always like 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.799
 start here and have said a lot 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.720
 times in a lot of videos that damage 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.640
 online in the cr of modern warfare 3 is 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.920
 of 45 points and begins to decrease to 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.190
 35 meters as you can see in the graph 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.109
 the 30 points on the other side the acr of 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.440
 battlefield 3 has much less damage 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:12.040
 of 20 points over 100 and long 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.109
 distances about 16 17 ok but this one 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.819
 high damage in acr is reduced by 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.140
 its cadence then we can already draw the 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.909
 first conclusion taking into account 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.590
 this data is that they have balanced the 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.870
 two games weapons in ways 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.280
 different one raising them their damage and 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.409
 reducing its cadence as modern 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.940
 warfare 3 and battlefield 3 instead what 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.650
 what he has done is increase his cadence 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.720
 but reduce your damage worth 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.640
 you know that everything depends on the time 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.920
 we need to kill an enemy in 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.019
 cadence ratio of the year the charger in 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.560
 both games is more or less the same a 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:44.220
 little reduced in battlefield 3 and in addition 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.810
 we are going to lose many more bullets because 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.939
 as the cadence is much higher we go 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.700
 to have problems when they come to us 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:54.519
 two or three enemies are going to be almost 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.200
 impossible to finish with everyone in front if 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.390
 they're on their backs that's another thing 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.510
 let's consider now how 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.590
 unlock already know that both games 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.750
 unlock we can unlock the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.099
 weapons in different ways in models 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.019
 strong in the cr we have to get to the 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.849
 level 50 or buy a house one 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.440
 prestigious piece and on several fronts 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.780
 it's a bit more complicated to get train 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.639
 work 30 casualties with carbines or 20 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.039
 low with the rocket launcher as it can be 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.049
 the rpg the sma william lynn vale 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.820
 You see we can see the first 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.410
 differences in the games worth we see that 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.300
 latent a much more complicated game 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.919
 much more elaborate 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.990
 we see that to kill an enemy we go 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.220
 to need a lot more skill since 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.199
 its lack is much higher and its damage 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.849
 much more reduced its charger also 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.680
 is less let's see the time of 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.139
 recharge that is the same 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.300
 90 considering that we do not empty the 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.830
 charger and 2.5 is the charger is left 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.690
 emptying is worth so there is no difference 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.310
 apparent in the recharge time of 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.350
 both weapons it seems that in this aspect 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.690
 they have put on quite a lot of 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.729
 agreement so for now I leave you in 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.110
 your opinion that taking it game 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.050
 these aspects that we have seen until the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.449
 moment is better, it's better, here you see 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.850
 the scattering of bullets both raised 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.500
 as half spent as lying down 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.560
 you see that they are values 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.789
 about 10 vouchers are relative values ​​and 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.830
 we see that the scattering of bullets in 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.020
 battlefield 3 we have a lot much much 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.900
 much much smaller is worth around the 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.970
 34 points out of 10 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.460
 shooting from the hip it's worth repeating 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.160
 without pointing we see that the retreat of the 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.770
 look pointing are values ​​about 1 vale 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.050
 this is the recoil is quite greater 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.220
 in modern warfare 3 and chases them 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.060
 the closing of modern warfare 3 just 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.560
 has recoil 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.630
 Well, tell those who 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.000
 have the acr mattel filtres that the 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.389
 almost new recoil around 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.690
 from 0.1 0.2 upwards to the sides 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.520
 a 0.2 also almost nothing worth values 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.210
 about 1 I repeat and a modern warfare 3 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.530
 they are around 03 04 we are going to see 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.150
 what accessories can we get to 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.159
 unlock in both games and in both 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.569
 weapons we start if you look with the acr 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.069
 modern warfare 3 we believe that we can 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.169
 unlock the red dot sight at 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:58.090
 level 2 the muffler to level 5 the 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.789
 grenade launcher coupled to level 8 the 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.490
 look catch the level 11 the sensor 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:05.199
 beats to 14 looks at the graph the 17 the 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.090
 shotgun equipped to the mind looks 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.220
 hybrid to 23 on the chargers 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.690
 extended to 26 and finally the average 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.520
 thermal to 29 you see that the fact of 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.130
 unlock accessories comes determined 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.659
 by levels in modern warfare 3 he 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.120
 also remind me that we can apply 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.889
 competitions that are battlefield 3 is not 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.940
 possible ok let's see brother his 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.139
 interest what accessories we can 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.180
 determine what we remember comes 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.340
 determined by the casualties starting with 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.009
 the reflex to the ten casualties and for one 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.550
 look more complete at 350 vouchers going on 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:36.490
 by the muffler ramiro the graphic 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.699
 that there are so many things tactical light in 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.880
 the grip the heavy cannon there 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:44.370
 a lot of things are worth 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.650
 so good the live of paleo if there 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.850
 many more accessories that we could 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.230
 get to unlock in butterfield 3 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.870
 but in a more complex way we will 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.180
 prove more difficult so we can 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.800
 to conclude taking into account 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.000
 this and let's see if the following 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.150
 videos in the following comparisons 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.010
 this also takes place that instead 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.650
 from c3 he knew much more complex much more 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.270
 difficult to manage where it will reward 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.610
 much more to the skill of 943 in 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.470
 change will reward the newbie much more 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.720
 maybe it's a much simpler game 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.730
 much easier to understand so 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.320
 well let's see if these conclusions 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.940
 to which we have arrived are 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.050
 also reflected the following videos 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.340
 ok I hope you liked the idea 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.300
 see you in the next video 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.300
 greetings goodbye
