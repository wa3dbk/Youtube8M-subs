00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.090
 we welcome alessia vedovato 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.040
 tell us a little about the history of the brand that 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.289
 represents and what news present 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.500
 presented this year I willingly give myself 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.240
 the warner brand is definitely a brand is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.850
 linked to the world of sports in the world 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.859
 of the ski where based on his 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.590
 origins 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.830
 mido is certainly an opportunity 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.219
 very important for this brand 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.950
 especially because of a new one 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.270
 is the beginning of a new of a new one 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.640
 a new era of a new era for 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.030
 this brand because now it's totally 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.000
 independent is free but despite 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.440
 this will remain true to those who 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.949
 let's say the points 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.710
 exact key hinges of his true 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.600
 the identity of his DNA which are precisely the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.379
 made of using excellent materials 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.519
 like the mineral lenses that offer one 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.939
 quality 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:15.299
 really excellent and without optical vision 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:18.750
 and unparalleled as well as one materials 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.069
 among these precisely the nylon 66 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.740
 which is part of the della 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:27.289
 tradition that provides 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.329
 performance really really e 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.659
 unexceptionable and above all with a 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:38.840
 coupling with mineral lenses 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.840
 the key concept that pushed the 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.700
 the creation of the models is of 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.290
 January 2013 and those of March 2013 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.180
 which we are presenting now at 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:54.110
 mido is just that of the concept of 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:56.870
 trustworthy becks that is to underline 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.750
 the importance of this tradition 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.020
 brand that there is a legacy that exists 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.410
 it exists is tangible and concrete 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:10.540
 testified naturally by developing it 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:14.440
 with say through technologies i 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.520
 technological improvements we are 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.450
 studying the day-to-day level 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:24.830
 at the level of the nest product precisely there 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.840
 allows us to continue in the let's say in the 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:34.520
 in the development of acetate models 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.590
 like the one in my hand now where it is 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.040
 note the concept of the we have it 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:44.060
 called ultra v la v on the front that 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.620
 precisely the same takes the logo a little 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.280
 same as the brand 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.130
 of course with emphasizing also in 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.030
 a very soft and very elegant way 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:00.720
 casual belonging to the background 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.600
 French the made in france that it is 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.480
 present on each of us models 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.640
 we are producing models we say 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.490
 iconic vintage that belong precisely 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.590
 to the very simple vintage in the very 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.360
 their extremely refined simplicity 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.130
 and elegant 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.150
 on the other side like I already had 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.330
 announced before we can say it 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.310
 reintroduction of nylon models is a 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.640
 particular nylon that is your own 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.130
 of the first vintage models that they are 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.300
 those were the successful models 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:39.600
 iconic of the brand that allows yes 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.750
 really interesting performances 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.860
 yes especially with mineral lenses 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.770
 so particular details why 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.220
 because first of all they are dyed 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.950
 means there are no bathrooms 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.910
 particular the color is pigmented since 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.770
 from the first production steps are year 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.540
 treatments that really prolong the 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:09.310
 them very productive steps e 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.470
 of course it is necessary that the 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.830
 the technicians are really prepared because 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.769
 are hydrophobic oil treatments year 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.299
 internal and anti-glare phobics 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.850
 different mirrors they render 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.100
 really the best short protection for 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.350
 your eyes and a quality of vision 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.780
 without equal 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.570
 they are glass lenses so no not there 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:36.760
 are comparisons with other types of 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:38.169
 all plastic and organic materials 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.570
 the news you told me about 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.030
 presented here starch and then the arises 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.410
 he asks why you chose mido 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.840
 what it represents for you and that 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.300
 expectations you have from this fair gives me 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.360
 an unmissable opportunity and it is a 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.639
 greater reason this year after a few 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.720
 year of absence actually from Warner 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:01.630
 within this expo its a 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.180
 following the important changes that 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:10.810
 the brand has suffered in recent months e 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.060
 therefore it is precisely a moment 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.160
 fundamental for 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.930
 re-establish contacts with 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.580
 international partners e 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.979
 also consolidate those with 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.259
 in the national customers that will come 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.289
 managed from now on in a way 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.289
 direct way therefore without 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.879
 intermediaries and so I really did 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.889
 unmissable an inevitable opportunity e 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:40.159
 then we hope it brings you luck 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.639
 to mido and thanks for being with 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:43.030
 we 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.030
 thank you very much
