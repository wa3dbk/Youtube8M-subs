00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
very jealous and that was probably the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.549 
very jealous and that was probably the
biggest<00:00:51.809> challenge<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.379> me<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.250> I

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
biggest challenge for me but and I

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.910 
biggest challenge for me but and I
really<00:00:55.559> enjoyed<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.550> a<00:01:00.829> difficult<00:01:01.829> question

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
really enjoyed it a difficult question

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.100 
really enjoyed it a difficult question
to<00:01:02.190> answer<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.660> know<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.840> didn't

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
to answer because you know I didn't

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.570 
to answer because you know I didn't
really<00:01:04.290> notice<00:01:04.409> myself<00:01:04.920> growing<00:01:05.159> up<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
really notice myself growing up but I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.990 
really notice myself growing up but I
think<00:01:05.880> from<00:01:06.090> people<00:01:06.390> who<00:01:06.510> watch<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.110> films<00:01:07.530> um

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
think from people who watch the films um

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.460 
think from people who watch the films um
it's<00:01:09.000> probably<00:01:09.420> more<00:01:09.979> obvious<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:13.189> I<00:01:14.189> started

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
it's probably more obvious I I started

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.230 
it's probably more obvious I I started
working<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.770> these<00:01:16.890> films<00:01:17.220> from<00:01:17.790> about<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
working on these films from about the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.999 
working on these films from about the
age<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.509> 10<00:01:18.810> 11<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.409> I'm<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:19.680> 15<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.670> um<00:01:22.009> quite

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
age of 10 11 and I'm now 15 so um quite

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.570 
age of 10 11 and I'm now 15 so um quite
lots<00:01:23.250> happened<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.970> time<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
lots happened in that time and I

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.550 
lots happened in that time and I
definitely<00:01:26.580> feel<00:01:29.780> different<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.259> making

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
definitely feel different to making

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.920 
definitely feel different to making
these<00:01:31.680> films<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.369> think<00:01:35.360> it's<00:01:36.360> difficult<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
these films I think it's difficult to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:47.560 
these films I think it's difficult to
explain<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:38.329> but<00:01:39.329> um<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.619> suppose<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.400> feel<00:01:41.430> more

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.580 

and<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.590> experience<00:01:50.520> has<00:01:50.820> done<00:01:51.060> me<00:01:51.409> wonders<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
and the experience has done me wonders I

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.120 
and the experience has done me wonders I
feel<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:52.979> I've<00:01:53.130> learnt<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.939> much<00:01:54.469> and<00:01:55.469> been

feel like I've learnt so much and been

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.980 
feel like I've learnt so much and been
able<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.850> many<00:01:56.939> places<00:01:57.119> meet<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:57.929> many
