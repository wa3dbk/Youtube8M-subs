oscillating sander I built the speed
controller<00:00:04.830> over<00:00:05.130> here<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:06.359> oscillating

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
controller over here the oscillating

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.740 
controller over here the oscillating
device<00:00:07.560> hooked<00:00:08.069> onto<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.519> drill<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.000> my

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
sanders so this time I'm going to build

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.829 
sanders so this time I'm going to build
the<00:00:13.290> table<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:14.360> that's<00:00:15.360> what<00:00:15.509> I'll<00:00:15.599> be<00:00:15.630> doing

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839
