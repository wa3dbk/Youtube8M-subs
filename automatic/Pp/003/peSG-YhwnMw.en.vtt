00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
looking for it themselves they just copy

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.030

pasting a link that shows the four so

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.690 
pasting a link that shows the four so
I'm<00:00:35.370> I'm<00:00:35.520> gonna<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.030> myself<00:00:36.180> now<00:00:36.690> because

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
I'm I'm gonna do it myself now because

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.860 
I'm I'm gonna do it myself now because
apparently<00:00:38.700> everyone<00:00:39.210> believes<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.570> random

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
apparently everyone believes a random

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.869 
apparently everyone believes a random
link<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.200> appears<00:00:40.290> out<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> nowhere<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
link that appears out of nowhere so I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.240 
link that appears out of nowhere so I
just<00:00:42.510> use<00:00:42.719> saturation<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.920> made<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
just use saturation and I made it to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.619 
just use saturation and I made it to
100%<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.840> still<00:00:46.350> don't<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.590> anything<00:00:47.629> even

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
100% and I still don't see anything even

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.990 
100% and I still don't see anything even
though<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> used<00:00:49.079> saturation<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.850> I'm

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
though I used saturation and I'm

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.639 
though I used saturation and I'm
brightening<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.570> up<00:00:51.690> there's<00:00:52.110> still<00:00:52.500> nothing

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
brightening it up there's still nothing

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.930 
brightening it up there's still nothing
there<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.370> saturation<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:55.940> what

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
there in saturation is what

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.020 
there in saturation is what
differentiates<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.960> pixels<00:00:58.469> from<00:00:59.219> black<00:00:59.609> so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
differentiates the pixels from black so

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.060 
differentiates the pixels from black so
if<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.300> was<00:01:00.420> anything<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.289> darkness<00:01:01.649> in

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
if there was anything in the darkness in

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.020 
if there was anything in the darkness in
the<00:01:02.190> corners<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:02.820> anywhere<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.589> black

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
the corners or anywhere with black

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.460 
the corners or anywhere with black
pixels<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.689> would<00:01:06.869> show<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.260> because

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
pixels it would show up because

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.969 
pixels it would show up because
saturation<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.430> makes<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.790> different

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
saturation is what makes it different

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.560 
saturation is what makes it different
saturation<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.130> what<00:01:11.360> differentiates<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
saturation is what differentiates it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.560 
saturation is what differentiates it
from<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.869> black<00:01:13.140> pixels<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.909> still<00:01:15.420> don't

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
from the black pixels so I still don't

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.120 
from the black pixels so I still don't
see<00:01:15.750> anything<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.770> don't<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.009> what

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
see anything so I really don't know what

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.010 
see anything so I really don't know what
else<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.460> do<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.759> maybe<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.780> could<00:01:18.840> do

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
else I can do for that maybe I could do

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.230 
else I can do for that maybe I could do
some<00:01:19.200> hue<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.680> saturation<00:01:20.030> which<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.150> already

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
some hue and saturation which I already

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.600 
some hue and saturation which I already
did<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.930> mean<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.070> changing<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
did I mean this is just changing the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.710 
did I mean this is just changing the
color<00:01:24.020> again<00:01:25.159> saturation<00:01:26.450> still<00:01:27.450> don't<00:01:27.600> see

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
color again saturation still don't see

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.940 
color again saturation still don't see
anything<00:01:27.930> even<00:01:28.259> when<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.470> brighten<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.799> up

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
anything even when you brighten it up

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.740 
anything even when you brighten it up
it's<00:01:29.430> supposed<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> bottom<00:01:30.420> right

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
it's supposed to be in the bottom right

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.490 
it's supposed to be in the bottom right
corner<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:31.259> well<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:34.350> probably

up that Geass Oh image as well let me

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.950 
up that Geass Oh image as well let me
just<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.210> some<00:01:42.420> vibrance<00:01:42.899> again<00:01:43.860> nope<00:01:44.960> okay

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
settings that the other one was

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.699

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
it up even more on mine just to see if

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.050 
it up even more on mine just to see if
there's<00:02:31.920> anything<00:02:32.130> but<00:02:32.400> as<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.580> can<00:02:32.700> see<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
there's anything but as you can see the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.470 
there's anything but as you can see the
bottom<00:02:33.450> still<00:02:33.810> stays<00:02:34.400> dark<00:02:35.400> as<00:02:35.640> night<00:02:35.670> it's

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
bottom still stays dark as night it's

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.670 
bottom still stays dark as night it's
not<00:02:36.630> gonna<00:02:37.050> change

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
not gonna change

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.979 
not gonna change
there's<00:02:38.010> no<00:02:38.250> pixels<00:02:38.820> there<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.239> formulate<00:02:39.810> a

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
there's no pixels there that formulate a

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.940 
there's no pixels there that formulate a
for<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.680> anywhere<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.140> if<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.620> actually<00:02:43.769> go

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
for in anywhere and if you actually go

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.050 
for in anywhere and if you actually go
back<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.430> fake<00:02:44.640> one

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
back to the fake one

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.320 
back to the fake one
I<00:02:45.709> could<00:02:46.709> try<00:02:46.920> branding<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.400> up<00:02:47.489> even<00:02:47.760> more<00:02:47.790> but

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
I could try branding it up even more but

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.600 
I could try branding it up even more but
like<00:02:48.540> as<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.230> can<00:02:49.380> see<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.650> four<00:02:49.920> gets<00:02:50.220> even

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
like as you can see the four gets even

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.670 
like as you can see the four gets even
clearer<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.330> more<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.630> brighten<00:02:52.140> up<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.410> fake

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
clearer the more I brighten up the fake

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.140 
clearer the more I brighten up the fake
one<00:02:53.300> so<00:02:54.620> obviously<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.830> fake<00:02:56.100> guys<00:02:56.430> because

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
