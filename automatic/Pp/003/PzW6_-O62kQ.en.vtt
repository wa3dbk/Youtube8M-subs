00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.519
 use to all the well-found boys 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:10.840
 can in mega ruby pokémon last 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.280
 time we saw the event of 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.590
 ticket ion that allows you to capture 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.539
 the rubin omega and side awards you 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.430
 without an alpha wire today we will see 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.529
 another legendary explosive I am 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.359
 speaking of reshiram reshiram is 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.089
 obtainable only in poke world at 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.919
 rubin omega while in sapphire alpha ci 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:29.199
 will be the possibility of finding zekrom 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.779
 for the latter's child owners 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.030
 and play don't worry because the method 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.680
 Capture and place of capture are 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.930
 therefore identical in both games 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.059
 don't worry about it either 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.050
 today we're going to see how to capture 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.789
 ratio 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.280
 but the procedure is the same also for 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.100
 zekrom first we should have 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.440
 team at least a little not at a hundred level 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.510
 I have smear goals that lately there is 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.250
 helping fellow tour and therefore not 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.499
 we don't even have to get ourselves another bit 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.289
 not at level 100 then ecological smear 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:01.300
 it will be doubly useful once admitted 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.940
 this pomona level one hundred we go to 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.220
 use the flop and one to start a 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.700
 furrow the dion skies with ours 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.140
 beautiful mega latos because a hoe 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.380
 instead it's free 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.170
 how nice that guys then 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.100
 let's start from the resort fight and let's go 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.620
 towards cic the friend you see them this 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.300
 little light red city that emanates 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:31.840
 flashes of yellow or perhaps glow 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.700
 java lucetta that red flashes 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.370
 these things have never been good 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.740
 however this boys is defined 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.960
 mirage area every mirage area has a 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.460
 different name and there are precisely some 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.170
 mirage areas and details that 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.840
 allow to capture pokémon 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.780
 legendary we enter this call 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.580
 tormenting cave then we go down 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:58.390
 immediately and let's see what awaits us a 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.750
 earth thanks a lot latos of the passage e 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.650
 we are here in front of the elusive cave 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.550
 boys 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.920
 let's enter the air is full of tension yes 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.740
 it's getting hotter and hotter 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.260
 ok and here is the usual circle 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.360
 mysterious then you want to put a hand 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.160
 in the mystery circle 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.980
 I put it on, but I still have to understand 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.110
 like the legendary pokemon a 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.510
 appear only when we insert it 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.370
 one hand is fine ok it appeared 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.070
 reshiram we send ours 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:34.110
 smergo row turbine ok now that the 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.990
 only spore guys I try to 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.300
 also use flood for 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.360
 turn it into a little dandy like water 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.459
 in this way he will lose his stubs said 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.500
 which states did not like the type of guy 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.090
 water will not achieve stability 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.560
 fight and it's a good thing 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.930
 in this way our lord goal 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.450
 will suffer me not years and can 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.100
 I quietly back to sleep when 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.420
 but he wakes up for the moment let's go 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.160
 of false end and let's take it to one 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.050
 health point before starting a 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.850
 throw the ultra balls over ball that 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.220
 however lately I'm using for 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.870
 take some boys' catches 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.880
 fox that I miss the pop and 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.760
 setting how humbly there will be 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:24.299
 few are left, let's hope they are enough 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.400
 then sleep sheeran good night ha 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.730
 slept three shifts first if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.650
 well good to heavy sleep maybe 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.480
 perhaps by pure chance it also enters the 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.510
 first ultra ball and save us one 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:41.330
 fatigue and we have 32 the illustrious ok a 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.160
 cabbage a cabbage but with a good turn 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.170
 wild reshiram sleeps we hope to 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.850
 captured as soon as possible I don't want to 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.500
 use all my ultra balls I have to 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:56.370
 go and buy them again then finished 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:58.920
 the episode is fine then 123 by the dai 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.400
 you give by yes the boys to the second 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.620
 ultra ball reshiram has been captured 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.420
 very well the bridge experience of 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.459
 capture as usual are shared 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.739
 and here we are reshiram we give him a 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.650
 nickname and now we go to the pop center 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.880
 man to see the boys his moves and 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.070
 the nature 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.410
 here's our guys reshiram with 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.600
 the dragon spiro moves extra tear 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.220
 sense and intersections ham 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.930
 plus of a neutral nature 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.080
 I believe therefore does not receive any envelopes 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.490
 no decrease in statistics 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.510
 of neutral nature in general does 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.790
 really worth it 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.860
 unfortunately our reshiram can do 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.570
 other than occupying a PC box 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.060
 I still guys if I can afford 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.920
 and if you have software in operation 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.800
 set reshiram for your team 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.360
 huber I recommend you take it modest 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.400
 if you want to do it with the cia and scarfò 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.860
 shy if you want to do it with shas pecs 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.980
 because however these are his two 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.230
 better sets and under the sun maybe 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.810
 put the eaves that I'm always good 20 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.550
 mover is able to feed the most powerful 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.610
 incro flame that they really do 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.490
 very bad guys a little everything is meta e 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.130
 so well if you want reshiram there 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.510
