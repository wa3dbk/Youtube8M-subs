00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.889
 I salute all people it's xenon and 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.990
 today we find ourselves on call of 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.030
 hungry for a new gameplay that 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.680
 is going to be surely the third episode of 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.330
 my case series even with all the weapons 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.820
 so this time we find ourselves for 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.460
 a hate cream tarik the last 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.740
 submachine gun of the game I was playing on it 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.570
 with a silencer and a laser sight 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.340
 so who is for me the best set up 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.110
 that you can use on this weapon 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.120
 so as you have noticed we are 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.470
 on the web in dominance and I was 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.820
 totally solo for once I 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.140
 did not have people with me so 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.960
 no croque madam no growling and 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.770
 so you'll see that on this 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.079
 series that m 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.730
 at the end of the series I got a sc 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.500
 2010 which is an assault rifle but 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.120
 I did that 4 5 kills with in the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.399
 series which even then still has 5.6 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.329
 afterwards but hey I still considered 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.739
 that it was still 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.989
 al ain tarik because the biggest of 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.300
 that it is made with this weapon so for 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.159
 me if I had to give you a weapon 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.540
 level smg low this one would be part 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.790
 I would even say it would surely 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.320
 the one I would advise you more 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.900
 because frankly it's a 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.549
 big kiff for me the cmj are not 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.770
 super powerful on this game because it 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.960
 are a lot of great maps supported are 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.090
 often a weird recoil particularly 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.560
 the hem tarik of times she makes me 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.479
 chelous stuff but good in general they 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.440
 remain fairly stable and suddenly I 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.900
 the ray advise because she is 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.790
 stable and the damage which unfortunately not 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.960
 plus a disgusting cadence when you 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.549
 are in melee it's pretty easy 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.860
 to chain two or three enemies that 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.700
 come on you so this is it 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.900
 really huge that I can you 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.420
 advise if you want to return from 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.100
 case even with besides speaking of m 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.540
 I think today I give you 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.400
 two three tips if you want 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.229
 succeed dkm more easily 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.299
 so it's going to be some kind of mini tutorial 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.600
 how to succeed more easily when 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.020
 even 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.310
 so I think I'm starting to take 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.990
 a little bit of experience on the game 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.210
 I had to exceed 10 km per hour 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.040
 current knowing that I do not have either 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.290
 enormously played despite I'm already 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.909
 prestigious let's say that my score by 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.780
 minute and my ratio puts a lot to climb 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.000
 faster than the average 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.790
 finally for all the little clever they 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.170
 will go to life and that's when I have the 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.480
 play three days so before its release 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.440
 finally short if you want to have a 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.209
 still easier 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.500
 already the first thing that I you 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.590
 advise to do it is not 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.519
 play like on the coast 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.959
 two months that's what I was doing at 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.349
 beginning and I was literally 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.580
 exploded made black ops of it was a game 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.200
 we had a lot of lives we could 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.550
 easily rock in the middle and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.160
 chaining three four guys in a row this 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.420
 was not a problem as long as the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.879
 guys finally I was not playing with 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.959
 company civet detector but hey 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.819
 it's something that is sooner 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.890
 on the treyarch games and the room is 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.450
 practically not on this spearhead of the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.040
 tiguan when you die in two bullets 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.090
 even guys with big silencer i 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.010
 support me one shot 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.780
 so what I would advise you to 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.280
 to do is rather to stay on the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.650
 edges of the map do not go like a 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.819
 gogo in the middle another advice that I 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.079
 can you give that is pretty general 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.910
 it's all the time look at your 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.220
 radar I know there is not a lot of 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.360
 people who play with the set like but 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.530
 it can still be very useful 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.120
 so to people who play are 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.720
 silent in front and believe me there is 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.430
 will always 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.319
 it can give you a global position 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.760
 from where are the enemies because if 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.690
 you were going on one side of the map 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.640
 and you see in red polka dots 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.590
 appear on the other side you can 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.819
 deduce that there is surely not only one 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.750
 enemy at this point and that's why 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.750
 that it will be necessary to be careful 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.680
 so do not play as a tried google 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.049
 to be intelligent in his travels 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.790
 there are moving according to the placement 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.170
 of his allies one step only 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.430
 only his enemies because the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.040
 enemies is good but there can be 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.389
 have a little bit everywhere on the map 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.920
 while you go at least that's 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.299
 pretty sure if you see them not dying 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.400
 you can tell yourself with a good 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.500
 precision that is surely no enemies 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.970
 in this area then it's serving 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.340
 moving enemy allies for 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.170
 move after something that I can 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.209
 advise you to six is ​​used 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.340
 tracker especially on guns 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.930
 of assault because tracker is a 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.060
 asset that allows you to shift easily 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.069
 people but believe me you will 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.389
 need was shifted by aiming on this 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.680
 game knowing that one dies extremely 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.930
 so fast if you can have some 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.069
 throws advantage to aim first I 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.169
 can you make sure that it will save you the 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.030
 put a lot of times that's why 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.230
 besides that me tracker sanaa all 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.519
 use on all my classes 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.349
 practically maybe what about 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.900
 machine guns I put him as a specialist 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.919
 but in the end I still have it 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.359
 suddenly it is a board over it 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.859
 that I can give you after the fact of 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.660
 play with a silencer I do not know 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.940
 if I told you but that's 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.380
 practically indispensable for me to the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.450
 rigor leave you with one or two 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.739
 other assets of stealth mingling 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.450
 silent I think that's the thing 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.180
 the most important is shorter 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.490
 important that assassin 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.780
 things like that because the 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.490
 silent every time you have 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.780
 mortar to aim an enemy if you in 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.949
 have not you're going to have a damn 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.169
 red dots that will appear on the 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.340
 mini map of your opponents for you 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.870
 find I can tell you that they will 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.800
 not put all the time especially that on 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.259
 this game I noticed that people 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.910
 were often quite surly even with 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.169
 a silence that often come back on my 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.389
 mouth to two or three to try to 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.340
 to stop me more quickly so 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.419
 if you do not have silence it's okay 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.550
 clearly be the galley for you 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.229
 after one last little tip this is 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.570
 rather comfort it depends on what 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.030
 you like it or not if you find a 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.680
 weapon to a little too low recoil but 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.330
 you're a guy tomorrow except that if you 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.160
 do not be able to aim with the sea 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.810
 it will be useless to stop 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.370
 it's going to have to do it 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.110
 good choice in general between the accessory 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.000
 guard tomorrow is the viewfinder accessory 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.590
 laser I tend to favor the 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.880
 laser sight for most trees 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.889
 I prefer to have a little more 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.240
 precision when I say rather than 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.610
 lesser hindsight it's still 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.120
 manageable at a pinch so that the 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.860
 precision 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.150
 it's not invented if you find that 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.800
 the disgusting army mother and that 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.110
 you win a visa with bah it's not 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.099
 it's not by praying to heaven that you 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.870
 go aim better 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.030
 so here I think I gave you 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.260
 a little bit the main tips that 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.210
 I had to give you to succeed 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.979
 km5 more easily I really hope 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.030
 who will help tell me if it was 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.500
 the case in the comments you can 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.389
 always come back a little later 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.979
 he is also struggling to let go of a small lake 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.599
 if you enjoyed the video subscribe to 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.710
 the chain has not been done yet it's 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.930
 not mandatory but it will allow you 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.580
 to follow my next videos and me 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.320
 on this I tell you to tomorrow for a 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.280
 next video just wear you 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.280
 well next worse 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.790
 the rise or the entire guard 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.720
 some enemies
