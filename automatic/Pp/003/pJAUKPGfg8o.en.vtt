the doors and starts the car I wouldn't

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.890 
the doors and starts the car I wouldn't
know<00:00:26.820> about<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.029> because<00:00:27.360> my<00:00:27.630> car<00:00:27.869> is

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
know about that because my car is

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.500 
know about that because my car is
actually<00:00:28.290> a<00:00:28.560> train<00:00:28.860> no<00:00:29.490> that's<00:00:29.760> too<00:00:30.210> clean

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
actually a train no that's too clean

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.220 
actually a train no that's too clean
it's<00:00:30.630> more<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.020> bad<00:00:31.619> AVS<00:00:32.220> graffiti<00:00:32.640> train

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
it's more like a bad AVS graffiti train

it's more like a bad AVS graffiti train
holla<00:00:34.550> anyway<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> technology<00:00:36.120> behind<00:00:36.239> its

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
holla anyway the technology behind its

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.150 
holla anyway the technology behind its
pretty<00:00:36.809> complex<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.470> not<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.830> a<00:00:37.890> signal

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
pretty complex it's not just a signal

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.650 
pretty complex it's not just a signal
being<00:00:38.309> sent<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> car<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> car

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
being sent to the car but the car

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.240 
being sent to the car but the car
actually<00:00:39.840> sends<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> signal<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.800> remote<00:00:41.040> as

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
actually sends a signal to the remote as

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.790 
actually sends a signal to the remote as
well<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.360> high<00:00:42.540> tech<00:00:42.809> right<00:00:43.170> it'll<00:00:43.620> never

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
well it's so high tech right it'll never

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.189 
well it's so high tech right it'll never
be<00:00:43.890> hacked<00:00:44.220> right<00:00:44.580> well<00:00:45.000> wrong<00:00:45.479> a<00:00:45.720> team<00:00:46.140> of

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
be hacked right well wrong a team of

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.930 
be hacked right well wrong a team of
security<00:00:46.620> researchers<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.250> Switzerland<00:00:47.729> took

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
security researchers in Switzerland took

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.579 
security researchers in Switzerland took
a<00:00:48.030> look<00:00:48.150> at<00:00:48.300> 10<00:00:48.570> different<00:00:48.839> car<00:00:49.170> models<00:00:49.199> from

a look at 10 different car models from
eight<00:00:49.830> different<00:00:49.860> manufacturers<00:00:50.699> and<00:00:50.909> were

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
eight different manufacturers and were

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.640 
eight different manufacturers and were
able<00:00:51.089> to<00:00:51.330> figure<00:00:51.510> out<00:00:51.720> ways<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> access<00:00:52.290> all

able to figure out ways to access all

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.289 
able to figure out ways to access all
ten<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.159> them<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.670> drive<00:00:53.850> away<00:00:53.970> by

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
ten of them and drive away by

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.030 
ten of them and drive away by
intercepting<00:00:54.839> signals<00:00:55.350> from<00:00:55.409> the<00:00:55.530> cars<00:00:55.739> and

intercepting signals from the cars and
the<00:00:56.100> wireless<00:00:56.280> keys<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.299> how<00:00:57.750> did<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:57.989> it

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
the wireless keys so how did they do it

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.079 
the wireless keys so how did they do it
the<00:00:58.680> hackers<00:00:59.010> used<00:00:59.220> transmitters<00:00:59.790> to<00:00:59.879> send

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
the hackers used transmitters to send

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.270 
the hackers used transmitters to send
the<00:01:00.150> signal<00:01:00.479> from<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.690> key<00:01:01.080> to<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.409> car<00:01:01.799> even

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the signal from a key to a car even

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.649 
the signal from a key to a car even
though<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> key<00:01:02.640> was<00:01:02.790> nowhere<00:01:03.089> near<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:03.479> car

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
though the key was nowhere near the car

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.840 
though the key was nowhere near the car
and<00:01:03.900> voila<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.010> car<00:01:05.190> popped<00:01:05.460> open<00:01:05.610> with

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and voila the car popped open with

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
and voila the car popped open with
engine<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.479> everything<00:01:06.690> so<00:01:07.440> say

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
engine going and everything so say

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.230

nearby he'd sniff out your keys code and
bam<00:01:19.170> no<00:01:19.649> more<00:01:19.829> car<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.670> what's<00:01:20.969> the<00:01:21.090> big<00:01:21.240> deal

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
bam no more car so what's the big deal

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.359 
bam no more car so what's the big deal
these<00:01:21.869> guys<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.350> being<00:01:22.560> wasn't<00:01:23.219> trying

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
these guys are just being wasn't trying

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.039 
these guys are just being wasn't trying
to<00:01:23.430> steal<00:01:23.579> cars<00:01:23.880> right<00:01:24.210> well<00:01:24.780> they're<00:01:24.930> doing

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to steal cars right well they're doing

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.450 
to steal cars right well they're doing
the<00:01:25.229> research<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.859> order<00:01:26.039> to<00:01:26.159> come<00:01:26.310> up<00:01:26.430> with

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the research in order to come up with

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.880 
the research in order to come up with
ways<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.789> prevent<00:01:27.119> other<00:01:27.530> active<00:01:28.530> stealing

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
ways to prevent other active stealing

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.499 
ways to prevent other active stealing
cars<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.189> working<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.939> car<00:01:30.090> makers<00:01:30.390> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
cars and working with the car makers to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.090 
cars and working with the car makers to
do<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.289> guess<00:01:31.469> that<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.710> makes<00:01:31.950> them

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
do it so I guess that just makes them

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.029 
do it so I guess that just makes them
jerks<00:01:32.969> moving<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> movie<00:01:34.350> inception

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
jerks moving on in the movie inception
