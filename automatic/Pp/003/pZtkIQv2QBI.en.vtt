00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
them on the screen here with two of them

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.290 
them on the screen here with two of them
one<00:06:19.710> of<00:06:19.770> my<00:06:20.039> hamper<00:06:20.310> a<00:06:20.520> lot<00:06:20.849> for<00:06:21.060> grass

one of my hamper a lot for grass

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.020 
one of my hamper a lot for grass
clippings<00:06:21.979> so<00:06:22.979> that<00:06:23.160> I<00:06:23.190> can<00:06:23.280> feed<00:06:23.669> it<00:06:23.789> to<00:06:23.940> the

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
clippings so that I can feed it to the

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.129 
clippings so that I can feed it to the
other<00:06:24.180> one<00:06:24.360> because<00:06:24.510> it<00:06:24.780> needs<00:06:24.990> some

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
other one because it needs some

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.550 
other one because it needs some
more<00:06:28.009> dry<00:06:28.580> solid<00:06:29.060> compost<00:06:29.539> we're<00:06:30.139> putting<00:06:30.469> in

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
more dry solid compost we're putting in

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.080 
more dry solid compost we're putting in
our<00:06:30.680> banana<00:06:30.979> peels<00:06:31.280> and<00:06:31.550> whatnot<00:06:31.909> and

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
our banana peels and whatnot and

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.769 
our banana peels and whatnot and
basically<00:06:32.900> the<00:06:33.110> way<00:06:33.229> this<00:06:33.409> works<00:06:33.680> is<00:06:34.629> you<00:06:35.629> put

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:35.779 
basically the way this works is you put

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:39.610 
basically the way this works is you put
your<00:06:35.930> hand<00:06:36.110> on<00:06:36.289> it<00:06:36.819> flip<00:06:37.819> it<00:06:37.849> over<00:06:38.060> and<00:06:38.620> you

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
your hand on it flip it over and you

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.320 
your hand on it flip it over and you
flip<00:06:40.310> it<00:06:40.340> over<00:06:40.520> again<00:06:40.729> you<00:06:40.939> do<00:06:41.060> this<00:06:41.180> a<00:06:41.240> few

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
flip it over again you do this a few

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.909 
flip it over again you do this a few
times<00:06:41.479> a<00:06:41.779> day<00:06:41.900> and<00:06:42.139> it<00:06:42.229> kind<00:06:42.409> of<00:06:42.439> evens<00:06:42.620> itself

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
times a day and it kind of evens itself

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:48.249 
times a day and it kind of evens itself
out<00:06:43.629> so<00:06:44.629> you<00:06:44.689> can<00:06:44.840> spin<00:06:45.080> it<00:06:45.110> real<00:06:45.349> fast<00:06:47.259> it

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:48.259 
out so you can spin it real fast it

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:53.339 
out so you can spin it real fast it
comes<00:06:48.439> across<00:06:48.710> really<00:06:49.069> fast<00:06:50.110> there<00:06:51.110> you<00:06:51.259> go

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:53.349 
comes across really fast there you go

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:56.379 
comes across really fast there you go
give<00:06:54.349> it<00:06:54.439> itself<00:06:54.740> out<00:06:54.949> this<00:06:55.849> one's<00:06:56.090> full<00:06:56.240> of

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:56.389 
give it itself out this one's full of

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:57.550 
give it itself out this one's full of
grass<00:06:56.569> clippings<00:06:57.080> it's<00:06:57.199> a<00:06:57.289> little<00:06:57.469> bit

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 
heavier see that works pretty good

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:07.269 
heavier see that works pretty good
