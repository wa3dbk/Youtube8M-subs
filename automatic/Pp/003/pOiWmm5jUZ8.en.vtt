comfortable with it he's a little

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.110 
comfortable with it he's a little
off-balance<00:00:52.860> ur<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:53.820> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.969> go<00:00:54.090> ahead

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
off-balance ur so I'm going to go ahead

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.600 
off-balance ur so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:54.390> square<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:55.920> go<00:00:56.070> back<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and square them up then we go back and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
and square them up then we go back and
then<00:00:56.760> again<00:00:57.270> there's<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.539> weak<00:00:57.719> spot<00:00:57.870> down

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
then again there's a weak spot down

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560 
then again there's a weak spot down
below<00:00:58.739> by<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.399> fetlock<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.390> put

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
below by the fetlock and if you just put

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.510 
below by the fetlock and if you just put
your<00:01:00.660> hand<00:01:00.899> against<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.500> he<00:01:01.980> will<00:01:02.190> start

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
your hand against it he will start

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.369 
your hand against it he will start
buckling<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.149> little<00:01:03.359> bit<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.750> eventually

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
buckling in a little bit and eventually

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.530 
buckling in a little bit and eventually
you<00:01:05.010> know<00:01:05.129> after<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> good<00:01:06.090> amount<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.360> time

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you know after a good amount of time

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.210 
you know after a good amount of time
goes<00:01:06.750> by<00:01:06.810> he's<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> end<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.010> just

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
goes by he's going to end up just

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.510 
goes by he's going to end up just
handing<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.880> his<00:01:09.570> hind<00:01:10.170> legs<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.340> think

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
handing you his hind legs do you think

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.420 
handing you his hind legs do you think
you're<00:01:11.610> going<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.760> get<00:01:11.880> kicked<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.659> do<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
you're going to get kicked don't do it

you're going to get kicked don't do it
you<00:01:14.430> know<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.760> different<00:01:15.270> video<00:01:15.390> will<00:01:15.720> go

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
you know in a different video will go

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.530 
you know in a different video will go
over<00:01:15.900> chicken<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> again<00:01:17.939> I'm<00:01:18.180> under<00:01:18.420> it's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
over chicken so again I'm under it's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.390 
over chicken so again I'm under it's
going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> run<00:01:18.930> my<00:01:19.049> hand<00:01:19.259> down<00:01:19.439> there<00:01:19.680> I'm<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
going to run my hand down there I'm a

going to run my hand down there I'm a
hold<00:01:20.759> as<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.060> got<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.810> few<00:01:22.049> seconds<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
hold as I got for just a few seconds and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.770 
hold as I got for just a few seconds and
then<00:01:22.680> we'll<00:01:22.860> put<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.070> back<00:01:23.100> down<00:01:23.479> after<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
then we'll put it back down after a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.719 
then we'll put it back down after a
while<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.290> start<00:01:25.500> picking<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.860> Stu<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.580> up

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
while you can start picking up Stu it up

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.120 
while you can start picking up Stu it up
for<00:01:27.090> longer<00:01:27.509> periods<00:01:27.840> at<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.020> time<00:01:28.259> now<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:28.979> go

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
for longer periods at a time now I'm go

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.340

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
make sure the horse is going to be

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.690 
make sure the horse is going to be
squared<00:02:07.170> up<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.590> some<00:02:07.799> point<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.369> it's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
squared up to some point because it's

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.820 
squared up to some point because it's
very<00:02:08.819> hard<00:02:09.149> for<00:02:09.239> them<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.629> try<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> give<00:02:10.739> you

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
very hard for them to try to give you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.110 
very hard for them to try to give you
their<00:02:10.979> foot<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.370> they're<00:02:11.489> not<00:02:11.610> squared

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
their foot if they're not squared

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.990 
their foot if they're not squared
because<00:02:12.269> they'll<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.569> off<00:02:12.720> balance<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:14.730> these

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
because they'll be off balance so these

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.550
