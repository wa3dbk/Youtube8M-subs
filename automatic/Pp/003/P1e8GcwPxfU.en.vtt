sometimes a very thin person can have a

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.569 
sometimes a very thin person can have a
double<00:00:50.850> chin<00:00:51.350> it's<00:00:52.350> also<00:00:52.590> due<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.920> slack

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
double chin it's also due to slack

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.850 
double chin it's also due to slack
facial<00:00:54.149> muscles<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.170> contribute<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
facial muscles that can contribute to a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.260 
facial muscles that can contribute to a
double<00:00:56.219> chin<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.809> also<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> third<00:00:58.199> thing<00:00:58.500> is

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
double chin and also the third thing is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.290 
double chin and also the third thing is
weight<00:01:00.270> gain<00:01:00.539> calorie<00:01:01.350> intake<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.760> let's

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
weight gain calorie intake so let's

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.210 
weight gain calorie intake so let's
address<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.780> calorie<00:01:04.080> intake<00:01:04.320> first<00:01:04.860> because

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
address the calorie intake first because

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.289 
address the calorie intake first because
that's<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> one<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> most

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
that's the one we will see the most

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.260 
that's the one we will see the most
dramatic<00:01:06.450> results<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.490> you<00:01:08.490> reduce<00:01:09.240> your

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
dramatic results if you reduce your

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.140 
dramatic results if you reduce your
calorie<00:01:09.780> intake<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.500> exercise<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.670> lose

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
calorie intake and exercise and lose

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.950 
calorie intake and exercise and lose
weight<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.960> will<00:01:13.229> lose<00:01:13.530> your<00:01:14.100> double<00:01:14.460> chin

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
weight you will lose your double chin

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.109 
weight you will lose your double chin
because<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> fat<00:01:16.799> accumulation<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.880> that

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
because of the fat accumulation in that

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.820 
because of the fat accumulation in that
area<00:01:18.420> when<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.930> lose<00:01:19.110> fat<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.470> over<00:01:19.560> your

body you will lose it in your face too

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.760 
body you will lose it in your face too
now<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:23.159> older<00:01:24.140> your<00:01:25.140> facial<00:01:25.650> muscles

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
now as you get older your facial muscles

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.539 
now as you get older your facial muscles
get<00:01:26.340> more<00:01:26.520> slack<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:28.140> will<00:01:28.439> pull<00:01:29.340> your

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
get more slack and it will pull your

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.670 
get more slack and it will pull your
face<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.360> double<00:01:30.780> chin<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.200> often

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
face down and a double chin can often

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.179 
face down and a double chin can often
occur<00:01:32.549> what<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.659> do<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.500> mitigate<00:01:34.680> that

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
occur what we can do to mitigate that

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.350 
occur what we can do to mitigate that
situation<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.890> we<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.100> exercise<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.970> facial

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
situation is we can exercise the facial

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.190 
situation is we can exercise the facial
muscles<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.170> keep<00:01:40.380> them<00:01:40.619> from<00:01:40.829> becoming<00:01:41.040> slack

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
muscles to keep them from becoming slack

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.429 
muscles to keep them from becoming slack
certainly<00:01:43.200> sitting<00:01:43.560> up<00:01:43.710> having<00:01:44.310> good<00:01:44.490> posture

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
certainly sitting up having good posture

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.990 
certainly sitting up having good posture
will<00:01:46.439> guard<00:01:46.680> against<00:01:47.130> getting<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.490> double<00:01:47.790> chin

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
will guard against getting a double chin

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.670 
will guard against getting a double chin
because<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.689> keeps<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:49.110> facial<00:01:49.560> muscles

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
because it keeps your facial muscles

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.420 
because it keeps your facial muscles
taut<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.450> keep<00:01:51.720> your<00:01:51.930> chin<00:01:52.430> straight

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
taut so if you keep your chin straight

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
want it to and the most that will get in

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.690 
want it to and the most that will get in
is<00:05:20.170> just<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:20.500> under<00:05:20.920> hair<00:05:21.220> underneath

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
is just the under hair underneath

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.520 
is just the under hair underneath
because<00:05:22.120> that's<00:05:22.480> what's<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:22.840> closest<00:05:23.230> to<00:05:23.410> my

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
because that's what's the closest to my

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.980 
because that's what's the closest to my
neck<00:05:23.710> if<00:05:23.890> I<00:05:24.040> but<00:05:24.460> you<00:05:24.670> know<00:05:24.790> my<00:05:25.060> longer<00:05:25.660> hair

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
neck if I but you know my longer hair

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.020 
neck if I but you know my longer hair
where<00:05:26.290> it<00:05:26.380> tends<00:05:26.620> to<00:05:26.740> get<00:05:26.920> drier<00:05:27.280> will<00:05:27.880> be

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
where it tends to get drier will be

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.030 
where it tends to get drier will be
piled<00:05:28.300> up<00:05:28.480> on<00:05:28.570> top<00:05:28.630> of<00:05:28.990> my<00:05:29.110> head<00:05:29.320> nice<00:05:29.590> and<00:05:29.620> safe

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
piled up on top of my head nice and safe

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.280 
piled up on top of my head nice and safe
but<00:05:30.550> again<00:05:30.760> where<00:05:30.910> that<00:05:30.940> bathing<00:05:31.330> cap<00:05:31.690> coat

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
but again where that bathing cap coat

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.340 
but again where that bathing cap coat
and<00:05:32.500> wet<00:05:33.070> your<00:05:33.250> hair<00:05:33.460> first<00:05:33.810> because<00:05:34.810> wet<00:05:35.050> hair

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
and wet your hair first because wet hair

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.650 
and wet your hair first because wet hair
is<00:05:35.560> less<00:05:35.830> likely<00:05:36.280> to<00:05:36.460> soak<00:05:36.760> in<00:05:37.030> the<00:05:37.060> chlorine

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
is less likely to soak in the chlorine

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.810 
is less likely to soak in the chlorine
so<00:05:37.870> if<00:05:37.960> you<00:05:38.050> wet<00:05:38.290> your<00:05:38.410> hair<00:05:38.740> then<00:05:39.370> you<00:05:39.610> put

so if you wet your hair then you put

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.970 
so if you wet your hair then you put
