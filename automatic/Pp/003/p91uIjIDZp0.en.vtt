so this is what we like to call the
scissor<00:00:39.800> and<00:00:40.190> I'm<00:00:40.640> going<00:00:40.850> to<00:00:40.910> have<00:00:41.030> similarly

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
scissor and I'm going to have similarly

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.090 
scissor and I'm going to have similarly
