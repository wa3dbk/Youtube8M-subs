00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.700
 Hello everyone , I continue to heading 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.170
 best and worst tanks in the game war thunder 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.900
 at the time of patch 141 in this video will be 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.050
 the worst tanks in war thunder games 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.140
 For the Soviet side, I singled out three tanks 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.039
 here and once again tell you a little about 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.029
 one but i don't have it in the hangar 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.890
 it 's about isu-152 I want to remind you that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.020
 everything I said is my personal 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.180
 opinion on this you can like it 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.309
 challenge well and completely with him 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.329
 agree to decide you and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.489
 this does not include anti-aircraft guns and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.570
 premium tanks why yes because they 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.550
 not everyone is available let's say well and anti-aircraft guns 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.160
 they just are tanks 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.730
 therefore, there is no big consideration 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.660
 sense 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.050
 well, let's start, let's start with t-80 why 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.750
 he is bad i wouldn't say he 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.060
 so too is the direct 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.170
 persimmon food that knits tongue and everything 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.530
 the rest but he is so lower 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.500
 mean why because in many ways here 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.840
 played my conviction that light tanks in 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.850
 principle in the game ineffective and in 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.680
 principle not needed but still 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.320
 why because he is 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.640
 heir to t-60 and t-70 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.990
 and roughly speaking this is such a modification 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.409
 enhanced modification of the t-70 but also large 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.659
 but he is not more efficient than these 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.110
 tanks that is up to no doubt is 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.840
 more effective t-60 but combat 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.630
 efficiency he is not inferior to the t-70 he 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.439
 same just the same with him too 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.780
 cannon same dynamics same armor 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.049
 the only thing he wins is a little 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.320
 faster recharge but believe me 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.460
 half a second recharge is a small 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.340
 the role is 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.670
 it is due to this is not much but wins 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.470
 he has a higher combat rating of 2 and 3 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.830
 while at T71 and 7 that plays 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.350
 big role about such thoughts would be 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.260
 I have achieved a lot of attention on this tank 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.600
 I want to because it is a light tank on it 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.069
 plays a little man move on already 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.209
 kV-85 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:36.880
 why this tank is bad too 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:39.730
 it's just that the tank is not armored just 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.870
 He is not armored. 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.620
 combat rating of 40 and punch it all yes 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.230
 he's a heavy tank he's a lot like 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.390
 tank heavy tank tiger 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.239
 but the tiger can really beat off 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.670
 blow i really have some kind of 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.310
 his armor is not all punch at that time 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.310
 how in 85 they pierce everything in many ways 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.500
 due to the fact that the Germans at that time and 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.690
 more precisely at this level better guns they 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.880
 better punch and 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.680
 it is easier for them just it is easier for them to punch but 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.450
 anyway kv-85 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:26.019
 This is a heavy tank with that 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:30.010
 efficiency, he is many times worse than the t-34 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:33.010
 85 precisely these machines they in many ways 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:37.870
 similar why because they have in essence 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.610
 the same armor that the t-34 is 85 that the q-85 is not 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.280
 possesses any armor have 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.950
 the same implement well 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:49.390
 identical here d 5 t with increased 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.019
 recharge out quick recharge here 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.750
 recharge a little worse but still but 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.170
 at that time t-34 85 has the best 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:03.160
 dynamics as I have already seen on the personal 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.640
 experience dynamics are much more affected 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.459
 battle than armor therefore apt-85 is 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.829
 much worse and is some such 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.520
 a small cactus when I played on it 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:20.180
 I really experienced it 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:23.250
 satisfaction and some kind of note 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.260
 lousy something i just 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.540
 makes you play on this tank 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.170
 although I don't want to play on him he doesn't 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.260
 tanking 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.110
 he does not go and he does not cope with his 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.680
 task tanking possible on the map 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.220
 Kursk 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.680
 he can tank more or less but 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.500
 if gets to tigers then 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.840
 or to the more panther mta this question 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.820
 immediately dismiss 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.860
 such thoughts about this tank further 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:55.170
 turn and su-122 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.900
 what the hell is this Fri-Sau or self-propelled gun 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.240
 somehow everything is very simple with her 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.670
 recharge huge just incredible 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.720
 reloading while it's with the crew 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.840
 as far as I remember with the top crew 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.280
 imagine with top crew 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.410
 recharge this self-propelled is 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.300
 almost 34 seconds 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:21.680
 we have self-propelled gun su-122 with which 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.720
 recharge is 25 seconds 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:29.330
 Can you imagine this efficiency 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:32.130
 self-propelled gun and but sense by precisely 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.190
 characteristics it is identical in 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.470
 accuracy is identical but has much worse 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.060
 recharge in many ways it is just 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:44.010
 played the role that this tank is lousy 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.620
 still shoot at thirty-five 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.630
 seconds it's really very long well 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.480
 and besides, the tank is extremely 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.910
 generally not armored 90 millimeters to 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.460
 this level of fights at the fourth rank is 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:01.860
 something besides the tank 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.530
 mediocre dynamics that is very 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.380
 seriously affects the combat 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.770
 efficiency here are some of these thoughts 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.810
 further goes su-122 what is this tank 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.820
 horseradish is the only thing 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.130
 but this is the only video where I shoved 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.930
 after all four tanks they are 3 in all 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.570
 the remaining vidos will be three tanks 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.510
 why the hell is this but because 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:30.620
 efficiency comparable to su-152 only 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.100
 drying 152 worth reminding on the third 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.150
 rank 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.820
 and issue we stomped all identical 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.350
 reloading armor but armor 90 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.380
 millimeters here at ISU 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:45.380
 and 75 is not important here 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:48.729
 imagine yes on the fifth rank has 90 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.770
 millimeters when all tanks 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:54.950
 armor penetration and more than two hundred that is 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.840
 but you know even at this distance 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.990
 a layer will be pierced all without 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:03.520
 exceptions besides the dynamics we have 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:07.430
 identical not only for this 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:13.389
 comparable effectiveness of isu-152 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:17.770
 is a full persimmon sous-152 farrell 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:21.710
 isu-152 bottom here are about such thoughts 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:24.710
 I hope I convinced you enough 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:29.350
 proved why these tanks are 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:32.810
 bad in our game but that's all 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:35.600
 The next vidos will already be at the best 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.539
 tank SSR and 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:42.380
 on this all thank you all like 

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:42.770
 subscribe to the channel and good luck to you 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.520
 battles 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.520
 win
