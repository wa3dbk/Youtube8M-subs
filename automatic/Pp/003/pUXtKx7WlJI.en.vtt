00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.310
 hello and welcome again i am cs and os 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.340
 I bring a trick here in the auditory tst 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.840
 and good this trick would be two stars 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.840
 in the strike map 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.760
 and the truth is very difficult because 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.320
 you have to do two stars 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.200
 first you have to do one and then there's 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.980
 than to make another one the first 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.900
 in this area of the map according what 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.510
 what we will do with this star will be 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.879
 get on just the part of the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.350
 roof that you are seeing in that house that 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.140
 we are trying to do it here with 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.970
 pussycat and with marc is quite done a 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.129
 guillo as I said is very difficult 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.860
 because the stars have always been 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.670
 very difficult and good now just 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.829
 I get it right once we get out 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.539
 We will stay here, not therefore what 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.500
 we will have to do will be to walk towards 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:08.300
 ahead 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.790
 and go right here where is the 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.470
 area of the car is right there and here 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.510
 what we have to do is make another 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.010
 they crash in agreement that is to turn the 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.260
 camera a little bit and jump at the same time 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.580
 according to me the knife had 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.490
 escaped unintentionally because he had given 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.680
 unintentionally making stars so no 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.119
 you need blades, much less and 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.380
 well once you're up here what 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.390
 you will have to do will be walking little to 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.180
 little around here and let them drop here is worth 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.550
 this can be done in any 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.240
 game mode I guess 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.460
 I recorded it in 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.290
 the infected you will have a clip now more 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.880
 go ahead that I cite here with marc 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.130
 agreement you will see it much later 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.360
 now when you teach here a little bit 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.220
 the map so you can see that I'm 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.590
 under the map just really 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.200
 from here you can kill even the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.490
 enemies what happens that can not be 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.409
 stabbing because it's too far from 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.890
 roof of the floor 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.259
 and well do not use it much I tell you that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.969
 it is very difficult to do this trick and 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.710
 good nothing to enjoy it give to there 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.950
 have to subscribe the first videos until 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.950
 soon 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.959
 i 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.750
 yes
