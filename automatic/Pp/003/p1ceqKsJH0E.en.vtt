00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 to volkswagen in 2007 2008 when she 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.200
 threw the g5 goal right 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.040
 this goal is currently being sold 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.710
 she had already prepared the voyage and the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.840
 sailboat and a parati 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.050
 This photo shoot here is not a 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 assembly has many mounts of paraty 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.500
 g5 on the internet but this one is not a 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.480
 assembly is a mockup made by the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.719
 volkswagen called the var goal 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.850
 barand then this is a separate chapter 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.309
 volkswagen prepared an active part 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.219
 but because she never released this car 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:56.190
 in the market because of the competitor 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:01:00.719
 what is fox was also 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.739
 remodeled in one of its prices 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.330
 would be very close to the fish fox 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.909
 volkswagen chose not to put this 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.970
 car to sell more 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.110
 spacebox ie I think the margin of 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.820
 profit from them selling spacebox is higher than 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.590
 than in the market because the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.409
 most would have to enter with prices 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.590
 smaller space fox would be a painting 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.049
 input then I think ah let's not go 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.420
 place to sell that tipa 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.799
 buyer who will buy for you to migrate 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.750
 for the cheapest spacefox that is 2 face 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:40.770
 a match then is that the never part 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.640
 was launched in Brazil and nowhere in the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.950
 world 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.659
 due to this direct competition with the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.009
 spacefox in here 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.810
 Argentina then this car came 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.720
 in Argentine 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.060
 the sales of spacefox affection nÃ© 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.810
 it would be cheaper then is this that is 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.649
 However, it is not to have a para- 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.960
 now by 2015 perhaps by the end of 2015 to 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.799
 volkswagen will reshape the whole goal 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.319
 go line 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.940
 will the rum will come back is 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.610
 agenda will be that they will do at least 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.940
 a mockup of a new 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.310
 here like the one that was made 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.430
 Yes, right, because Paraty always sold well. 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.720
 here in Brazil the name for you brings a lot of 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.830
 nostalgia is a lot of people like to 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.110
 so this is it I think again they 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.460
 are not going to throw a break for not 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.460
 fight with space fox 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.820
 unfortunately that's what happens right? 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.060
 but I think this part if it were 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.190
 marketed 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.280
 she would be pretty the size of the door 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.320
 her back she uses the same the same in 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.989
 sections of the sloop, right? 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.250
 parati always shared with the sloop in the 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.650
 production line 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.630
 then it would be a bigger wheelbase here 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.840
 would have plenty of space in the backseat 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.640
 it would be a very comfortable car behind 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.130
 It's a shame even Volkswagen does not have 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.290
 put this car on the market 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.370
 That's all I had to tell staff 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.370
 until the next video
