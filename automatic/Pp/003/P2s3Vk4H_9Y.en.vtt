a puppy puppy is me and what we need to

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.649 
a puppy puppy is me and what we need to
do<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.130> learn<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> movie<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.270> actually<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
do is learn what the movie is actually a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.020 
do is learn what the movie is actually a
surprisingly<00:01:13.590> complex<00:01:14.159> number<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.700> different

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
surprisingly complex number of different

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.179 
surprisingly complex number of different
movements<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.810> form<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.040> as

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
movements that we can form here and as

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.679 
movements that we can form here and as
you<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.490> they'll<00:01:17.820> actually<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.180> combined

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you can see they'll actually be combined

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.660 
you can see they'll actually be combined
together<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.200> form<00:01:19.770> new<00:01:19.830> things<00:01:20.310> like

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
together to form new things like

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.749 
together to form new things like
high-fiving<00:01:21.210> standing<00:01:22.140> playing<00:01:22.619> dead<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
high-fiving standing playing dead so you

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.160 
high-fiving standing playing dead so you
need<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> learn<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.330> fundamentals<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.049> then

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
need to learn the fundamentals and then

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.020 
need to learn the fundamentals and then
you<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.380> learn<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.680> advanced<00:01:26.070> stuff<00:01:26.430> because

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
you can learn the advanced stuff because

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.310 
you can learn the advanced stuff because
occasionally<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:27.930> girl<00:01:28.110> will

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
occasionally the little girl will

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.620 
occasionally the little girl will
actually<00:01:28.680> call<00:01:28.920> out<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.210> ask<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
actually call out to you and ask you to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.149 
actually call out to you and ask you to
do<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> certain<00:01:31.110> trick<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> don't<00:01:32.070> know

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
do a certain trick and if you don't know

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.319 
do a certain trick and if you don't know
what<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.490> well<00:01:32.759> you're<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:32.939> gonna<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
what it is well you're not gonna get the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.730 
what it is well you're not gonna get the
point<00:01:33.570> bonus<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.020> fact<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.320> might<00:01:34.350> even<00:01:34.470> get<00:01:34.680> a

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
point bonus in fact you might even get a

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.100 
point bonus in fact you might even get a

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
if I'm just terrible at things oh I can

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.729 
if I'm just terrible at things oh I can
go<00:03:36.260> through<00:03:36.290> these<00:03:36.530> rings<00:03:36.829> too<00:03:37.040> can<00:03:37.280> i<00:03:37.430> yeah

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
go through these rings too can i yeah

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.990 
go through these rings too can i yeah
look<00:03:39.739> at<00:03:39.859> those<00:03:39.950> advanced<00:03:40.310> maneuvers<00:03:40.730> can<00:03:40.880> I

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
look at those advanced maneuvers can I

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.240 
look at those advanced maneuvers can I
act<00:03:41.450> like<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.720> show<00:03:41.989> dog<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.590> go<00:03:42.680> between<00:03:42.859> them

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
act like a show dog and go between them

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.700 
act like a show dog and go between them
to<00:03:43.430> know<00:03:44.269> I<00:03:44.299> guess<00:03:44.570> that<00:03:44.750> doesn't<00:03:44.780> work

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
to know I guess that doesn't work

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.810 
to know I guess that doesn't work
I<00:03:48.560> could<00:03:49.560> just<00:03:49.710> keep<00:03:49.860> going<00:03:50.160> back<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.400> forth

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
I could just keep going back and forth

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.220 
I could just keep going back and forth
through<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.060> Rings<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.630> guess<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.110> probably

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
through the Rings I guess that probably

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.570 
through the Rings I guess that probably
wouldn't<00:03:52.530> be<00:03:52.650> very<00:03:52.740> entertaining<00:03:53.070> with<00:03:53.490> it

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
wouldn't be very entertaining with it

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.900 
wouldn't be very entertaining with it
but<00:03:54.150> suds<00:03:54.450> do<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.870> dash<00:03:55.200> Oh<00:03:55.700> high<00:03:56.700> five<00:03:56.940> yeah<00:03:57.660> I

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
but suds do a dash Oh high five yeah I

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.310 
but suds do a dash Oh high five yeah I
wish<00:03:59.910> there<00:04:00.090> was<00:04:00.180> more<00:04:00.210> to<00:04:00.510> go<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.660> see<00:04:00.990> and<00:04:01.140> do

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
wish there was more to go and see and do

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.140 
wish there was more to go and see and do
in<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.650> area<00:04:02.040> or<00:04:02.310> like<00:04:02.520> more<00:04:02.790> things<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.060> I

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
in this area or like more things that I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.810 
in this area or like more things that I
could<00:04:03.330> do<00:04:03.450> tricks<00:04:03.720> off<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.430> but<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:05.580> know<00:04:05.610> as

could do tricks off of but you know as

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.370 
could do tricks off of but you know as
it<00:04:06.000> stands<00:04:06.270> it<00:04:06.480> kind<00:04:06.630> of<00:04:06.690> makes<00:04:06.840> sense<00:04:07.080> that

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.690 
most aerodynamically sound puppy like it
will<00:04:47.580> flip<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.180> spin<00:04:48.600> at<00:04:48.870> all<00:04:49.440> times<00:04:49.770> in<00:04:50.250> all

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
will flip and spin at all times in all

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.430 
will flip and spin at all times in all
directions<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.510> it<00:04:51.600> does<00:04:51.810> not<00:04:52.020> care<00:04:52.320> about

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
directions and it does not care about

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.170 
directions and it does not care about
reality<00:04:52.770> I'm<00:04:53.010> actually<00:04:53.160> negative<00:04:53.820> points

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
reality I'm actually negative points

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.120 
reality I'm actually negative points
right<00:04:54.360> now<00:04:54.540> which<00:04:55.350> is<00:04:55.380> fine<00:04:55.680> i<00:04:55.710> was<00:04:55.950> actually

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
right now which is fine i was actually

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.790 
right now which is fine i was actually
kind<00:04:56.430> of<00:04:56.490> trying<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:56.940> do<00:04:57.060> that<00:04:57.470> also<00:04:58.470> I<00:04:58.500> wanted

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
kind of trying to do that also I wanted

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.470 
kind of trying to do that also I wanted
to<00:04:58.950> dash<00:04:59.340> around<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.760> little<00:04:59.910> bit<00:05:00.090> but<00:05:00.240> i<00:05:00.270> think

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
to dash around a little bit but i think

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.690 
to dash around a little bit but i think
i<00:05:00.540> can<00:05:00.690> only<00:05:00.780> dash<00:05:01.080> for<00:05:01.350> like<00:05:01.470> a<00:05:01.680> split<00:05:02.070> second

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
i can only dash for like a split second

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.060 
i can only dash for like a split second
before<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:03.060> puppy<00:05:03.420> gets<00:05:03.570> tired<00:05:03.920> all<00:05:04.920> right

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070

at least the core he gets a home I've

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.700 
at least the core he gets a home I've
been<00:05:12.390> pretty<00:05:12.660> sure<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:12.870> was<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.080> corgi<00:05:13.410> anyway

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.780 
great idea I would love to see more
things<00:05:21.720> finished<00:05:22.200> in<00:05:22.590> this<00:05:22.740> style<00:05:23.040> you<00:05:23.760> know

things finished in this style you know
I'd<00:05:24.180> basically<00:05:24.420> i'm<00:05:24.810> in<00:05:24.990> love<00:05:25.140> with<00:05:25.170> the

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
I'd basically i'm in love with the

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.200 
I'd basically i'm in love with the
concept<00:05:25.500> of<00:05:25.920> tony<00:05:26.160> hawk<00:05:26.370> score<00:05:26.670> attack<00:05:26.910> game

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
concept of tony hawk score attack game

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.490 
concept of tony hawk score attack game
so<00:05:27.420> if<00:05:27.510> you<00:05:27.600> want<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:27.840> put<00:05:27.930> a<00:05:27.960> different<00:05:28.290> skin

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
so if you want to put a different skin

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.930 
so if you want to put a different skin
on<00:05:28.620> them<00:05:28.800> i'll<00:05:29.010> probably<00:05:29.250> enjoy<00:05:29.700> them

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
on them i'll probably enjoy them

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.390 
on them i'll probably enjoy them
regardless<00:05:30.530> you<00:05:31.530> know<00:05:31.650> given<00:05:31.980> the<00:05:32.010> fact<00:05:32.280> that

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
regardless you know given the fact that

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.740 
regardless you know given the fact that
the<00:05:32.550> animations<00:05:33.060> worth<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.390> game<00:05:33.570> is<00:05:33.720> not

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
the animations worth the game is not

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.590 
the animations worth the game is not
buggy<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:35.070> premise<00:05:35.430> is<00:05:35.580> simple<00:05:35.640> and<00:05:36.180> concise

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
buggy the premise is simple and concise

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.900 
buggy the premise is simple and concise
and<00:05:36.990> just<00:05:37.410> reduced<00:05:37.740> down<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:38.010> a<00:05:38.280> concept<00:05:38.790> that

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
and just reduced down to a concept that

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.180 
and just reduced down to a concept that
is<00:05:39.120> easily<00:05:39.420> expressible<00:05:40.170> to<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.890> people

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
is easily expressible to the people

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.620 
is easily expressible to the people
playing<00:05:41.430> and<00:05:41.700> doesn't<00:05:42.090> take<00:05:42.240> a<00:05:42.270> lot<00:05:42.450> of<00:05:42.510> time

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
playing and doesn't take a lot of time

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.510 
playing and doesn't take a lot of time
to<00:05:42.930> learn<00:05:42.960> I<00:05:43.140> guess<00:05:43.320> really<00:05:43.680> the<00:05:43.800> fact<00:05:44.430> that

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
to learn I guess really the fact that

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.340 
to learn I guess really the fact that
the<00:05:44.700> basics<00:05:45.180> are<00:05:45.420> you<00:05:45.480> know<00:05:45.810> run<00:05:46.050> around<00:05:46.290> and

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
the basics are you know run around and

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.540 
the basics are you know run around and
jump<00:05:46.410> off<00:05:46.650> of<00:05:46.710> things<00:05:47.010> and<00:05:47.190> then<00:05:47.310> you<00:05:47.370> also

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
jump off of things and then you also

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.760 
jump off of things and then you also
have<00:05:47.700> this<00:05:47.940> other<00:05:48.120> layer<00:05:48.450> which<00:05:49.050> is<00:05:49.080> memorize

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
have this other layer which is memorize

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.380 
have this other layer which is memorize
the<00:05:50.010> advance<00:05:50.280> control<00:05:50.640> so<00:05:51.000> when<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.210> girl

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
the advance control so when the girl

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.640 
the advance control so when the girl
calls<00:05:51.600> out<00:05:51.780> to<00:05:51.810> you're<00:05:52.110> able<00:05:52.320> to<00:05:52.410> do<00:05:52.530> those

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
calls out to you're able to do those

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.410 
calls out to you're able to do those
which<00:05:52.860> gives<00:05:53.130> it<00:05:53.220> sort<00:05:53.370> of<00:05:53.490> this<00:05:53.610> like<00:05:53.820> rock

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
which gives it sort of this like rock

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.180 
which gives it sort of this like rock
band<00:05:54.660> guitar<00:05:54.840> hero<00:05:55.290> style<00:05:55.590> thing<00:05:55.890> you<00:05:56.010> got<00:05:56.160> to

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
band guitar hero style thing you got to

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.530 
band guitar hero style thing you got to
remember<00:05:56.280> certain<00:05:56.760> things<00:05:56.910> hit<00:05:57.240> them<00:05:57.360> at<00:05:57.450> the

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
remember certain things hit them at the

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.600 
remember certain things hit them at the
right<00:05:57.570> times<00:05:57.960> and<00:05:58.350> their<00:05:58.919> generous<00:05:59.340> enough

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
right times and their generous enough

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.220 
right times and their generous enough
with<00:05:59.790> the<00:05:59.910> time

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
with the time

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.810 
with the time
you<00:06:00.380> have<00:06:00.530> to<00:06:00.680> hit<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:00.890> buttons<00:06:01.190> in<00:06:01.370> so<00:06:01.580> if<00:06:01.700> you

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
you have to hit the buttons in so if you

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.070 
you have to hit the buttons in so if you
screw<00:06:02.060> up<00:06:02.090> you<00:06:02.360> have<00:06:02.480> a<00:06:02.510> little<00:06:02.750> bit<00:06:02.870> of<00:06:02.960> extra

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
screw up you have a little bit of extra

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.240 
screw up you have a little bit of extra
time<00:06:03.260> and<00:06:03.560> I'm<00:06:03.650> going<00:06:03.770> to<00:06:03.830> be<00:06:03.890> the<00:06:03.980> end<00:06:04.130> of<00:06:04.160> the

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
time and I'm going to be the end of the

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.400 
time and I'm going to be the end of the
world<00:06:04.400> and<00:06:04.730> the<00:06:05.480> way<00:06:05.600> the<00:06:05.750> score<00:06:06.020> works<00:06:06.230> in

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
world and the way the score works in

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.140 
world and the way the score works in
general<00:06:06.830> is<00:06:06.980> like<00:06:07.130> it's<00:06:07.340> pretty<00:06:07.760> nice<00:06:07.910> it

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
general is like it's pretty nice it

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.180 
general is like it's pretty nice it
doesn't<00:06:08.420> give<00:06:08.540> you<00:06:08.690> too<00:06:08.960> much<00:06:09.620> pressure<00:06:09.950> to

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
doesn't give you too much pressure to

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.950 
doesn't give you too much pressure to
perform<00:06:10.550> although<00:06:11.180> I<00:06:11.390> guess<00:06:11.540> in<00:06:11.810> this<00:06:11.900> case

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
perform although I guess in this case

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.230 
perform although I guess in this case
you<00:06:12.410> would<00:06:12.530> have<00:06:12.770> some<00:06:13.040> pressure<00:06:13.310> I<00:06:13.610> could

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
you would have some pressure I could

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.970 
you would have some pressure I could
also<00:06:14.360> imagine<00:06:14.660> this<00:06:14.960> would<00:06:15.080> be<00:06:15.260> like<00:06:15.470> if<00:06:15.830> you

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
also imagine this would be like if you

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.890 
also imagine this would be like if you
get<00:06:16.130> an<00:06:16.220> a<00:06:16.340> rank<00:06:16.580> than<00:06:16.940> like<00:06:17.180> you<00:06:17.330> get<00:06:17.510> extra

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
get an a rank than like you get extra

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.720 
get an a rank than like you get extra
special<00:06:18.500> treats<00:06:18.830> or<00:06:18.980> like<00:06:19.100> it<00:06:19.220> unlocks<00:06:19.580> a

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.730 
special treats or like it unlocks a

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.910 
special treats or like it unlocks a
special<00:06:20.060> collar<00:06:20.300> or<00:06:20.570> like<00:06:20.720> a<00:06:20.750> new<00:06:21.350> bandana<00:06:21.710> or

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920
