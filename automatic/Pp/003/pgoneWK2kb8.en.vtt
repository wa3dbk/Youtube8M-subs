00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.929
 surprise because the designer and she sang 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.770

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.839

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.600

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.530
 his career 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.090

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.740
 sit on the white chair sitting 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.060
 note because of course in the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.130
 interview because she is a woman who is 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.350
 icon of elegance in our country and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.750
 also in the world but I know girls 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.750

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.460

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.129
 in the ba that is about to begin 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:39.120
 parade clear and I just want to ask 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.120
 before 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.180
 but good but it gives you little emotion that 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.219
 we would win the new guy three times by 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.439

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:57.459

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.660
 to see it we are going to have some 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.060
 good impression after we talk after 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.420
 of the parade about if not here they tell me that 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.420

 [Music] 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.860
 I saw you applauding a lot when it appeared 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.860
 a little 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:51.600
 They are very cute and the truth is very nice 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.760
 all good I do not want to ask you so much 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.440
 fashionable but you know I'm in Paris 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.550
 I was happy that I was going to see you play 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.150
 against the barça in which you injure yourself 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.600
 [Music] 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.920
 I was already injured when I really 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.930
 lessons now 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.020
 I can not play this game anymore 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.510
 that nothing to recover well to return 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.310
 the sooner it's good how you lived all 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.230
 humanity during the world 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.450
 the truth that I did not live it at all 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.960
 because we were somewhere else and 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.639
 Y 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.780
 When I returned to Argentina I was little 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.729
 time but I try not to not do or 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.310
 think any of that because for me the 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.800
 true that they are all things that do not have 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.259
 nothing to do with me with the game 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.300
 in football with work is not part 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.660
 of what today is football loves the one that does not 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.090
 I lived I was xanina 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.790
 she should ask her not to 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.620
 congratulations it's a joy to see you and the 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.170
 true that you made us live moments 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.360

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.090

 so that the girls give me lustrums 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.890
 I think so 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.370
 you have to bite 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.370
