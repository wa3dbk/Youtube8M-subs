00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
not quite the best but at least they're

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.010 
not quite the best but at least they're
against<00:00:52.710> real<00:00:53.280> decks<00:00:53.610> or<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.030> one<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.390> which

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
against real decks or this one is which

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.740 
against real decks or this one is which
is<00:00:55.050> something<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.300> mean<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.329> played<00:00:57.600> for

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
is something that I mean I played for

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.119 
is something that I mean I played for
like<00:00:57.840> two<00:00:58.050> hours<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> only

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
like two hours and this is the only

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.819 
like two hours and this is the only
remotely<00:00:59.550> acceptable<00:01:00.329> match<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.110> I<00:01:01.140> took<00:01:01.260> so

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
remotely acceptable match that I took so

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.309 
remotely acceptable match that I took so
it's<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.940> my<00:01:03.329> best<00:01:03.570> upload<00:01:04.079> ever

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:04.319 
it's not going to be my best upload ever

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.989 
it's not going to be my best upload ever
but<00:01:04.649> at<00:01:04.829> least<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.579> to<00:01:05.639> show<00:01:05.819> off<00:01:05.850> some

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:05.999 
but at least it's going to show off some

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:09.199 
but at least it's going to show off some
new<00:01:06.359> stuff<00:01:06.569> so<00:01:07.009> my<00:01:08.009> opponent<00:01:08.399> is<00:01:08.549> playing<00:01:08.579> a

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:09.209 
new stuff so my opponent is playing a

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:12.559 
new stuff so my opponent is playing a
Landorus<00:01:09.899> garbage<00:01:10.399> which<00:01:11.399> is<00:01:11.759> actually<00:01:12.029> I

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
Landorus garbage which is actually I

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:14.629 
Landorus garbage which is actually I
think<00:01:12.869> shaping<00:01:13.499> up<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.829> pretty<00:01:14.249> strong

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:14.639 
think shaping up to be a pretty strong

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:17.179 
think shaping up to be a pretty strong
deck<00:01:15.029> I've<00:01:15.389> tested<00:01:15.959> it<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.529> bit<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.950> still

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
deck I've tested it a little bit I still

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.870 
deck I've tested it a little bit I still
need<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.399> work<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.609> my<00:01:17.670> list<00:01:18.829> but<00:01:19.829> it's<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.849> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
need to work on my list but it's not a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.410 
need to work on my list but it's not a
bad<00:01:21.090> deck<00:01:21.359> by<00:01:21.630> any<00:01:21.810> means<00:01:22.939> so<00:01:23.939> looked<00:01:24.209> like<00:01:24.359> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
bad deck by any means so looked like a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.269 
bad deck by any means so looked like a
real<00:01:24.569> deck<00:01:24.749> and<00:01:25.079> then<00:01:25.229> he<00:01:25.289> pulls<00:01:25.529> out<00:01:25.649> sie<00:01:26.039> doch

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:26.279 
real deck and then he pulls out sie doch

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:29.749 
real deck and then he pulls out sie doch
I<00:01:27.560> don't<00:01:28.560> know<00:01:28.679> I<00:01:28.919> don't<00:01:29.069> know<00:01:29.189> what<00:01:29.369> side<00:01:29.549> ox

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
I don't know I don't know what side ox

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.510 
I don't know I don't know what side ox
doing<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.149> there<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.689> guess<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.770> his<00:01:32.009> counter

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
doing in there I guess it's his counter

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.050 
doing in there I guess it's his counter
to<00:01:32.909> opposing<00:01:33.569> landris<00:01:34.289> because<00:01:35.099> golda<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.849> do

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
to opposing landris because golda can do

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.260 
to opposing landris because golda can do
a<00:01:36.109> 94<00:01:37.109> to<00:01:37.289> waters<00:01:37.709> which<00:01:38.399> would<00:01:38.639> be<00:01:38.849> enough<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
a 94 to waters which would be enough to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.379 
a 94 to waters which would be enough to
take<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:39.599> an<00:01:40.200> opposing<00:01:40.709> landers<00:01:41.039> DX<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.700> maybe

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:42.389 
take out an opposing landers DX so maybe

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:44.510 
take out an opposing landers DX so maybe
that's<00:01:42.659> what's<00:01:42.869> going<00:01:43.169> on<00:01:43.289> here<00:01:43.529> but<00:01:43.709> he<00:01:44.340> gets

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
that's what's going on here but he gets

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.609 
that's what's going on here but he gets
to<00:01:44.639> go<00:01:44.669> first<00:01:44.759> he<00:01:45.569> gets<00:01:45.779> that<00:01:45.929> turn<00:01:46.200> one<00:01:46.349> hammer

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
to go first he gets that turn one hammer

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.249 
to go first he gets that turn one hammer
head<00:01:46.859> which<00:01:47.099> is<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.520> strong<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.239> we<00:01:49.079> see

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
head which is so strong and we see

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.279 
head which is so strong and we see
squirtles<00:01:49.889> ability<00:01:50.249> come<00:01:50.429> into<00:01:50.609> play<00:01:50.789> his

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
squirtles ability come into play his

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.679 
squirtles ability come into play his
shell<00:01:52.289> armor<00:01:52.739> or<00:01:52.979> whatever<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.819> is<00:01:53.939> she'll

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
shell armor or whatever it is she'll

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.870 
shell armor or whatever it is she'll
shield<00:01:54.989> I<00:01:55.229> think<00:01:55.560> maybe<00:01:55.770> prevent<00:01:56.639> him<00:01:56.849> from

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
shield I think maybe prevent him from

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.489 
shield I think maybe prevent him from
taking<00:01:57.059> bench<00:01:57.479> damage<00:01:57.840> which<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.169> kind<00:01:58.349> of<00:01:58.409> a

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
taking bench damage which is kind of a

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:02.599 
taking bench damage which is kind of a
big<00:01:58.619> deal<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:59.599> my<00:02:00.599> turn<00:02:00.929> I<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.619> decide<00:02:02.099> to<00:02:02.369> bench

Blastoise I have that computer search

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.750 
Blastoise I have that computer search
which<00:02:18.050> obviously<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:19.040> lets<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.340> discard

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760

his garb odor up on turn two that's
going<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.930> be<00:02:39.020> a<00:02:39.050> problem<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.970> think<00:02:41.360> he<00:02:41.420> put<00:02:41.570> an

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
going to be a problem I think he put an

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.520 
going to be a problem I think he put an
experienced<00:02:42.170> share<00:02:42.410> on<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:44.410> that's<00:02:45.410> not

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
experienced share on it and that's not

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.260 
experienced share on it and that's not
the<00:02:45.650> ideal<00:02:46.100> tool<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.520> have<00:02:46.670> but<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.120> going

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
the ideal tool to have but it is going

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.670 
the ideal tool to have but it is going
to<00:02:47.360> shut<00:02:47.540> down<00:02:47.570> my<00:02:47.810> powers<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.410> means<00:02:48.560> I

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
to shut down my powers that means I

adi I think deluge can't use deluge with

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.790 
adi I think deluge can't use deluge with
a<00:03:00.860> Blastoise<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.300> got<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.290> take<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:03.470> guy

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
and now I can computer search I'll

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.200 
and now I can computer search I'll
probably<00:03:27.950> get<00:03:28.160> rid<00:03:28.220> of<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.460> super<00:03:28.790> scoop<00:03:29.030> up

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
you know it's nice to play an actual

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.110 
you know it's nice to play an actual
game<00:03:45.070> against<00:03:46.070> an<00:03:46.190> opposing<00:03:46.430> deck<00:03:46.790> rather

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
game against an opposing deck rather

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.880 
game against an opposing deck rather
than<00:03:47.330> one<00:03:47.630> person<00:03:47.840> just<00:03:48.140> drawing<00:03:48.440> dead<00:03:48.620> for

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
than one person just drawing dead for

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.440 
than one person just drawing dead for
the<00:03:48.980> entire<00:03:49.250> game<00:03:49.520> but<00:03:49.580> I<00:03:49.910> think<00:03:50.180> he<00:03:50.300> just

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
the entire game but I think he just

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.120 
the entire game but I think he just
wasn't<00:03:50.660> ready<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.110> handle<00:03:51.350> Blastoise<00:03:51.830> which

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
wasn't ready to handle Blastoise which

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.570 
wasn't ready to handle Blastoise which
is<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.970> really<00:03:53.240> stupid<00:03:53.570> mistake<00:03:54.020> to<00:03:54.170> make

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
is a really stupid mistake to make

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.500 
is a really stupid mistake to make
because<00:03:55.580> everyone<00:03:56.000> is<00:03:56.120> going<00:03:56.240> to<00:03:56.300> be<00:03:56.390> playing

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
because everyone is going to be playing

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.370 
because everyone is going to be playing
it<00:03:56.780> it's<00:03:56.990> the<00:03:57.230> new<00:03:57.460> the<00:03:58.460> new<00:03:58.490> thing<00:03:58.970> yeah<00:03:59.780> so<00:04:00.080> he

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
it it's the new the new thing yeah so he

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.560 
it it's the new the new thing yeah so he
only<00:04:00.500> benched<00:04:00.920> one<00:04:01.130> trubbish<00:04:01.550> which<00:04:02.270> means

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
only benched one trubbish which means

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.120 
only benched one trubbish which means
I'm<00:04:02.870> just<00:04:03.200> able<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.470> catch<00:04:03.650> her<00:04:03.800> up<00:04:03.830> and

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
I'm just able to catch her up and

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.730 
I'm just able to catch her up and
obliterate<00:04:04.790> garbodor<00:04:05.210> with<00:04:05.780> Mewtwo<00:04:06.290> another

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
obliterate garbodor with Mewtwo another

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.060 
obliterate garbodor with Mewtwo another
great<00:04:07.610> reason<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:08.030> play<00:04:08.240> in<00:04:08.300> v2<00:04:08.570> in<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:08.810> deck

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
great reason to play in v2 in this deck

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.020 
great reason to play in v2 in this deck
as<00:04:10.630> good<00:04:11.630> as<00:04:11.780> garbage<00:04:12.020> man<00:04:12.410> is<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:13.040> think<00:04:13.700> having

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
as good as garbage man is I think having

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.850 
as good as garbage man is I think having
Scylla<00:04:14.600> in<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.780> format<00:04:15.080> really<00:04:15.440> hurts<00:04:15.650> him

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
Scylla in the format really hurts him

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.800 
Scylla in the format really hurts him
because<00:04:16.280> it's<00:04:16.489> going<00:04:16.640> to<00:04:16.700> mean<00:04:17.090> finding<00:04:17.690> the

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
because it's going to mean finding the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.720 
because it's going to mean finding the
catcher's<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.530> kill<00:04:18.890> him<00:04:19.100> is<00:04:19.340> a<00:04:19.400> lot<00:04:19.700> easier

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
catcher's to kill him is a lot easier

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.540 
catcher's to kill him is a lot easier
you<00:04:20.450> know<00:04:20.570> darkrai<00:04:21.190> handles<00:04:22.190> them<00:04:22.310> pretty

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
you know darkrai handles them pretty

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.720 
you know darkrai handles them pretty
well<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.780> obviously<00:04:24.250> Blastoise<00:04:25.250> is<00:04:25.460> always

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
well and obviously Blastoise is always

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.440 
well and obviously Blastoise is always
going<00:04:25.820> to<00:04:25.880> be<00:04:25.940> playing<00:04:26.150> me

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
going to be playing me

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.300 
going to be playing me
so<00:04:26.930> Mewtwo<00:04:27.290> takes<00:04:27.530> him<00:04:27.650> out<00:04:27.740> pretty<00:04:27.980> quickly

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
so Mewtwo takes him out pretty quickly

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.940 
so Mewtwo takes him out pretty quickly
and<00:04:28.750> now<00:04:29.750> that<00:04:29.930> I've<00:04:30.020> taken<00:04:30.170> out<00:04:30.440> his<00:04:30.740> uh<00:04:30.770> his

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
and now that I've taken out his uh his

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.860 
and now that I've taken out his uh his
key<00:04:33.950> to<00:04:34.280> his<00:04:34.430> deck<00:04:34.700> I<00:04:35.000> just<00:04:35.450> have<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.600> kill

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
key to his deck I just have to kill

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.810 
key to his deck I just have to kill
these<00:04:36.020> landraces<00:04:36.530> which<00:04:36.890> is<00:04:37.160> not<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.460> big<00:04:37.670> deal

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
these landraces which is not a big deal

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.030 
these landraces which is not a big deal
for<00:04:38.090> Blastoise<00:04:39.020> obviously<00:04:39.560> I<00:04:39.590> have<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.860> type

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
for Blastoise obviously I have the type

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.170 
for Blastoise obviously I have the type
advantage<00:04:40.490> that's<00:04:40.670> going<00:04:40.850> to<00:04:40.910> make<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:41.150> very

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
advantage that's going to make it very

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.940 
advantage that's going to make it very
easy<00:04:41.770> 3<00:04:42.770> energy<00:04:43.100> on<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> Keldeo<00:04:43.880> will<00:04:44.620> just<00:04:45.620> wipe

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
easy 3 energy on a Keldeo will just wipe

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.190 
easy 3 energy on a Keldeo will just wipe
any<00:04:46.310> land<00:04:46.670> dress<00:04:46.910> off<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.300> board<00:04:47.540> regardless

any land dress off the board regardless

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.160 
any land dress off the board regardless

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
of avaya light or not it's going to do a

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.600 
of avaya light or not it's going to do a
110<00:04:51.670> base<00:04:52.670> which<00:04:53.180> will<00:04:53.330> put<00:04:53.510> it<00:04:53.600> at<00:04:53.690> 220<00:04:54.610> more

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
110 base which will put it at 220 more

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.120 
110 base which will put it at 220 more
than<00:04:55.760> enough<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.120> kill<00:04:56.300> any<00:04:56.450> landris<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.110> he<00:04:57.800> is

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
than enough to kill any landris so he is

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.370 
than enough to kill any landris so he is
going<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.640> catch<00:04:58.850> her<00:04:59.000> up<00:04:59.150> keldeo<00:04:59.840> here<00:05:00.200> which

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
going to catch her up keldeo here which

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.770 
going to catch her up keldeo here which
is<00:05:00.530> not<00:05:00.740> a<00:05:00.770> bad<00:05:00.890> move<00:05:01.280> since<00:05:01.940> I<00:05:02.030> only<00:05:02.180> have<00:05:02.330> one

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
is not a bad move since I only have one

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.550 
is not a bad move since I only have one
on<00:05:03.410> the<00:05:04.250> bench<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:05.360> means<00:05:05.660> that<00:05:05.870> I<00:05:05.900> can't<00:05:06.200> rush

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
on the bench it means that I can't rush

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.220 
on the bench it means that I can't rush
in<00:05:06.920> when<00:05:07.550> I'm<00:05:07.670> already<00:05:07.910> stuck<00:05:08.210> active<00:05:08.690> so<00:05:08.960> that

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
in when I'm already stuck active so that

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.890 
in when I'm already stuck active so that
was<00:05:09.320> actually<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.650> right<00:05:09.860> play<00:05:10.040> on<00:05:10.190> his<00:05:10.370> part

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
was actually the right play on his part

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.810 
was actually the right play on his part
you<00:05:11.900> know<00:05:12.020> hammerhead<00:05:12.670> doesn't<00:05:13.670> really

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
you know hammerhead doesn't really

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.520 
you know hammerhead doesn't really

water energy so that is going to be the

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.540 
water energy so that is going to be the
three<00:05:26.180> energy<00:05:26.510> I<00:05:26.540> needed<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:27.170> start

three energy I needed to start

really strong and so having something

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.810 
really strong and so having something
like<00:05:53.240> heavy<00:05:53.660> ball<00:05:53.900> in<00:05:54.110> my<00:05:54.740> deck<00:05:55.010> means<00:05:55.340> that<00:05:55.580> if

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
like heavy ball in my deck means that if

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.890 
like heavy ball in my deck means that if
I<00:05:55.940> have<00:05:56.090> a<00:05:56.120> rare<00:05:56.330> candy<00:05:56.780> I<00:05:57.100> can<00:05:58.100> just<00:05:58.690> scale<00:05:59.690> up

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
I have a rare candy I can just scale up

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.110 
I have a rare candy I can just scale up
for<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.260> level<00:06:00.590> heavy<00:06:01.070> ball<00:06:01.280> as<00:06:01.460> opposed<00:06:01.880> to

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
for the level heavy ball as opposed to

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.580 
for the level heavy ball as opposed to
being<00:06:02.390> forced<00:06:02.780> to<00:06:02.870> go<00:06:02.960> for<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:03.140> ultra<00:06:03.440> bowl

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
being forced to go for the ultra bowl

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.090 
being forced to go for the ultra bowl
and<00:06:03.830> discard<00:06:04.340> two<00:06:04.550> cards<00:06:04.580> so<00:06:05.150> I<00:06:05.360> think<00:06:06.100> things

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
and discard two cards so I think things

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.370 
and discard two cards so I think things
like<00:06:07.220> heavy<00:06:07.460> oil<00:06:07.700> level<00:06:08.120> ball<00:06:08.270> and<00:06:08.600> energy

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
like heavy oil level ball and energy

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.860 
like heavy oil level ball and energy

the<00:07:04.700> biggest<00:07:04.880> problem<00:07:05.030> with<00:07:05.510> landris<00:07:05.930> for<00:07:06.170> me

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
the biggest problem with landris for me

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.490 
the biggest problem with landris for me
is<00:07:06.530> lack<00:07:06.830> of<00:07:06.980> energy<00:07:07.100> acceleration<00:07:08.500> obviously

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 
is lack of energy acceleration obviously

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.930 
is lack of energy acceleration obviously
we<00:07:09.590> were<00:07:09.680> supposed<00:07:09.920> to<00:07:10.040> get<00:07:10.130> ether<00:07:10.490> in<00:07:10.610> the<00:07:10.640> set

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
we were supposed to get ether in the set

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.460 
we were supposed to get ether in the set
but<00:07:11.330> we<00:07:11.480> didn't<00:07:11.840> and<00:07:11.990> I<00:07:12.110> think<00:07:12.320> that<00:07:12.440> really

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:12.470 
but we didn't and I think that really

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.270 
but we didn't and I think that really
weakens<00:07:13.130> him<00:07:13.310> which<00:07:14.210> is<00:07:14.360> fine<00:07:14.600> I<00:07:14.930> you<00:07:15.920> know<00:07:16.040> it

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
weakens him which is fine I you know it

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.340 
weakens him which is fine I you know it
gives<00:07:16.460> set<00:07:16.820> up<00:07:16.940> Dex<00:07:17.210> like<00:07:17.420> Blastoise<00:07:17.960> a<00:07:17.990> chance

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.350 
gives set up Dex like Blastoise a chance

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.830 
gives set up Dex like Blastoise a chance
as<00:07:19.220> opposed<00:07:19.610> to<00:07:19.850> just<00:07:19.880> landris<00:07:20.600> kills

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840 
as opposed to just landris kills

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.990 
as opposed to just landris kills
everything<00:07:21.140> which<00:07:22.070> isn't<00:07:22.340> a<00:07:22.370> really<00:07:22.490> fun<00:07:22.760> deck

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 
everything which isn't a really fun deck

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.470 
everything which isn't a really fun deck
but<00:07:23.930> anyhow<00:07:24.230> yeah<00:07:24.620> I<00:07:24.890> you<00:07:25.760> know<00:07:25.880> we<00:07:26.030> both<00:07:26.180> set

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:26.480 
but anyhow yeah I you know we both set

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.260 
but anyhow yeah I you know we both set
up<00:07:26.630> but<00:07:26.810> i<00:07:26.870> think<00:07:27.110> my<00:07:27.260> deck<00:07:27.440> was<00:07:27.710> just<00:07:28.060> built<00:07:29.060> to

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.270 
up but i think my deck was just built to

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:34.330 
up but i think my deck was just built to
kill<00:07:29.450> his<00:07:29.660> he<00:07:30.320> didn't<00:07:30.620> have<00:07:31.490> any<00:07:31.850> plan<00:07:32.419> for<00:07:33.340> a

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:34.340 
kill his he didn't have any plan for a

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.430 
kill his he didn't have any plan for a
Blastoise<00:07:35.150> at<00:07:35.360> all<00:07:35.540> which<00:07:35.900> ended<00:07:36.290> up<00:07:36.380> being

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 
Blastoise at all which ended up being

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.460 
Blastoise at all which ended up being
his<00:07:36.710> downfall<00:07:36.980> so<00:07:37.720> hopefully<00:07:38.720> you<00:07:38.780> guys<00:07:38.870> liked

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:39.470 
his downfall so hopefully you guys liked

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.170
