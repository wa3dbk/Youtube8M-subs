00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.599
 hi dear friend are you watching a video 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:23.230
 channel apart today dismantled 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:24.380
 I disassemble the display of the laptop hp envy 17 and 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.230
 18 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.230
 laptop nothing else is written 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.180
 I take this opportunity to share 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.180
 subtleties 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.640
 dismemberment of these displays 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.010
 then what should you start with if you 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.629
 itch to change the display on such 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.420
 a laptop 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:50.809
 it is worth knowing that the whole frame 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.410
 glued to the perimeter i started with this 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:58.160
 sides with the left and not just your hands if 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:03.039
 no back get back all the latches it 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.039
 it looked like this very much 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.890
 non-dangerous think this way to pry 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.960
 she moves away very easily desirable 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.850
 of course if you will have 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.850
 some plastic spatula 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.360
 who will not cheat I managed 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.360
 without him 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:29.160
 all double sided tape went all over 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.380
 perimeter live carefully enough i 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.370
 I think plastic is so malleable 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.860
 soft to break his risk no big but 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.580
 nonetheless here's the entire perimeter 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.300
 be careful this tape is not much 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:50.000
 jerk it will be only problems and 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:53.520
 further here under the decorative sticker 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.340
 cog if the sides respectively too 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.340
 the thing with the spatula and here 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.680
 screws that unscrew nothing else 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.170
 does not hold can freely remove for 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.840
 order to unscrew the display itself to us 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.840
 need to free two guides 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:41.330
 need to 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:44.750
 to all five a little weaken to 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:52.340
 easier it did not work itself directing 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:58.150
 slightly moved this display lids 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.170
 and unscrew the screws on the guide 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:07.540
 there are only 2 of them here 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.540
 and the same thing from that side for sure 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.850
 we leave charge twisted 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.170
 loosen you drank now a little away 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.170
 guides 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.830
 it turns out to be awkward 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:08.110
 and that's all we have matrix now 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:10.150
 hands model matrix we have lp 173 wd1 with 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.670
 spruce tips g2 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.120
 This is for those who will search 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.120
 by myself 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.000
 for sure there are the same matrices that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.970
 supports full hd 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.400
 this is not a fuji matrix extracted plume 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.610
 matrix itself 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.340
 reverse algorithm i think that concept 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.650
 Matrices will be twisted first. 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.110
 guides then loop and fix 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.090
 frame with two screws on the sides hope my 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.340
 the video was helpful if not 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.830
 be lazy and like to subscribe 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.699
 on our channel 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.680
 come on a lot of interesting things 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.680
 thank you for your attention enough
