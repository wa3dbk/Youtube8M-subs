00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.800
 but up above 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.440
 and the eye is not true 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.860
 they already saw the machine and guessed in 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.860
 where I am 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.110
 we are on your plate and we are here with 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.740
 our little friends who invited us to 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.760
 his grandfather workshop truth goes us 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.760
 invite to know 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.810
 Well, we're already here in the workshop 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.729
 of Don Mariano and now yes that his grandchildren 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 they are going to explain a little about the size 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.950
 of true mascaritas 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.189
 it's a good wood full house and cedar 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.740
 after it is no longer measured after 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.259
 it's not going to be good or that emptying is 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.039
 remove all the shell of all the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.759
 Cascarita in to good and after 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:42.440
 empty that follows with the English saw 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.540
 with the unknown face 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.540
 good hey and where are the templates 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.030
 those are the ones we can see this is for 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.120
 the masks for mask parachicos 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.140
 and see see now see the satire that 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:04.970
 have the tiger players for 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.700
 trace them look there is there is the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.800
 secret to see then a mask of 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.830
 parachico for example has several 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.600
 templates is not a single mind for 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.250
 example this template the sva in the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.260
 top part to see puts in the part 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.239
 from above is already seen 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.239
 to see and another for template out there 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.860
 yes it's worth 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:36.020
 and so begins the detailed process and in 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:39.290
 the good forms and what are the 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.440
 irons that are used these know sample 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.180
 it is to mark the eyes paw of goat 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.180
 for and in for region to all 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.800
 for this to get this 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.290
 that he has inside a person's face 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.160
 a donkey with that they take what he has 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.160
 inside the face of the person 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.879
 and then do that process that is very 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.519
 important because it's almost almost the 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.890
 principle let's go to empty a piece 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.989
 of trunk leaves process to whoever carries 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.989
 the ball with your friend pepe you kill 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.860
 ah 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:36.010
 but not 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.640
 with the legs did the emptying when 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.860
 see we're going to teach right now one 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.720
 little bit the good of constancy the way 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.489
 traditional and back there are 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.489
 doing it already with a press comes out 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.530
 well then here we continue with the 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.009
 process and after we empty it that 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.380
 continue like this we do not start the form 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.949
 with the saw because it can reach bouquets 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.949
 the turbid 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.660
 as a good man to see first 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.400
 first gives it the shape with the saw 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.320
 how is the shape with the saw 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.140
 First 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.280
 ok still we almost twinned to her medium 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.280
 you see the way true 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.270
 they leave well then already after that 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.540
 we did those those because we did it 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.770
 is carved with the bust that goes on like this 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.770
 I was 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.760
 everything is well done and that to see 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.430
 Where is 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.430
 and is here to see 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.430
 Y 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.400
 Well we are already seeing that going 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:29.190
 finishing filling truly is already 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:33.520
 ready to see to see sampling the view and 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:36.130
 the eyes because the arguments cast him 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:41.860
 exam first you have left you pass 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:43.389
 after taking given here and good 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.039
 they saw good so let's continue with the 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.530
 process here from the mascaritas and 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.070
 we return here to your plate just the 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.070
 neighborhood of the daisies 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.639
 Well, little friends, we finished the 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:03.780
 truth process to see what was the part 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.780
 final explain me a little 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.860
 well after they have eyes already true 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.840
 It's all over but that's it 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.060
 seeing that they put fabric down truth yes 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.080
 the neck to see can be lifted 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.389
 little to see them is already seen very well 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.310
 that also brings language and truth 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:29.590
 today I am also seeing that they have 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.870
 others of other things there that can us 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.120
 show that mask that is good of 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.449
 be more expensive and if they call thailand not 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.940
 this is two whistling sheds is 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.759
 in the pigeon that represents the soul that 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.860
 the musician who goes to the unit 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:46.479
 Now, listen very well, it's very 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.159
 pretty everything everything you do 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:50.529
 here the masks are also very 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:56.709
 nice ones do not have the suit 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:58.239
 if the one they have and they show good 

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:59.829
 while they go to look for the suit 

00:06:58.239 --> 00:07:03.479
 we are still here in the report 

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:03.479
 of the ball when it comes 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.460
