thing<00:04:42.090> right<00:04:42.420> there<00:04:42.630> it's<00:04:43.440> hard<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.800> get<00:04:43.980> it<00:04:44.100> on

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
thing right there it's hard to get it on

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.870 
thing right there it's hard to get it on
because<00:04:44.580> it's<00:04:44.670> so<00:04:44.910> short<00:04:46.550> and<00:04:47.550> then<00:04:47.640> this

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
because it's so short and then this

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.450 
because it's so short and then this
looks<00:04:48.360> like<00:04:48.570> it<00:04:48.780> was<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.560> little<00:04:50.010> knob<00:04:50.250> at<00:04:50.430> the

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
looks like it was a little knob at the

looks like it was a little knob at the
bottom<00:04:50.700> looks<00:04:51.270> like<00:04:51.450> it<00:04:51.570> was<00:04:51.750> where<00:04:52.170> it<00:04:52.440> would

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
bottom looks like it was where it would

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.630 
bottom looks like it was where it would
sit<00:04:53.160> on<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.400> sand<00:04:53.700> cuz<00:04:54.000> if<00:04:54.240> you've<00:04:54.990> played<00:04:55.200> on

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
looks just looks looks like a pipe like

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.700 
looks just looks looks like a pipe like
that<00:05:22.490> so<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:24.270> detail<00:05:24.660> on<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:25.140> thing<00:05:25.320> is<00:05:25.440> weird

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
that so the detail on the thing is weird

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.370 
that so the detail on the thing is weird
I<00:05:26.040> don't<00:05:26.370> really<00:05:26.490> get<00:05:26.700> it<00:05:26.760> but<00:05:27.200> then<00:05:28.200> there's

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
I don't really get it but then there's

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.780 
I don't really get it but then there's
also<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.650> ammo<00:05:28.890> box<00:05:29.250> which<00:05:29.490> is<00:05:29.520> really

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
also the ammo box which is really

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.080 
also the ammo box which is really
awesome<00:05:29.880> I<00:05:31.190> don't<00:05:32.190> think<00:05:32.400> it<00:05:32.520> can<00:05:32.700> be<00:05:32.730> removed

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
awesome I don't think it can be removed

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.860 
awesome I don't think it can be removed
i<00:05:33.330> actually<00:05:33.660> haven't<00:05:33.840> tried<00:05:35.510> almost<00:05:36.510> dropped

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
i actually haven't tried almost dropped

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.180 
i actually haven't tried almost dropped
it<00:05:37.020> oh<00:05:38.510> wait<00:05:39.510> no<00:05:39.750> no<00:05:39.960> this<00:05:40.200> wasn't<00:05:40.470> where<00:05:40.860> it

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
it oh wait no no this wasn't where it

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.700 
it oh wait no no this wasn't where it
will<00:05:41.610> go<00:05:41.640> understand<00:05:42.360> there's<00:05:43.080> another<00:05:43.380> peg

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
will go understand there's another peg

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.030 
will go understand there's another peg
right<00:05:44.010> here<00:05:45.200> so<00:05:46.200> that<00:05:46.500> would<00:05:46.620> make<00:05:46.770> more<00:05:46.980> sense

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
right here so that would make more sense

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.590 
right here so that would make more sense
instead<00:05:47.610> of<00:05:47.730> it<00:05:47.850> being<00:05:47.880> on<00:05:48.090> the<00:05:48.150> way<00:05:48.240> back<00:05:48.390> and

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
instead of it being on the way back and

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.350 
instead of it being on the way back and
be<00:05:48.720> right<00:05:49.560> there<00:05:49.910> does<00:05:50.910> that<00:05:51.000> make<00:05:51.180> more<00:05:51.360> sense

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
be right there does that make more sense

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.670 
be right there does that make more sense
yeah<00:05:55.280> so<00:05:56.360> that's<00:05:57.360> the<00:05:57.479> gun<00:05:57.720> it's<00:05:58.290> kind<00:05:58.470> of<00:05:58.500> hard

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
yeah so that's the gun it's kind of hard

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.150 
yeah so that's the gun it's kind of hard
for<00:05:58.830> him<00:05:58.919> to<00:05:58.950> hold<00:06:00.229> and<00:06:01.229> the<00:06:01.440> backhand<00:06:01.680> goes

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
for him to hold and the backhand goes

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.800 
for him to hold and the backhand goes
