00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello to all the boys that laugh 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.500
 welcome to this brand new video 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.319
 tutorial 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.940
 today I want to show you how to install 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.380
 game that for me is liked 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.910
 particularly a game of 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.780
 playstation one which is called julio for 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.400
 being there memories 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.809
 probably many know it not 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.720
 they already know 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.240
 this game claims to say use 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.820
 of an emulator so this case I have 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.960
 chose her left and because in my opinion the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:32.130
 better than the iso file you download 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.760
 from google very easily maybe there 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.829
 lascer linking description then the links 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.140
 this is what the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.899
 of the emulator is this which is to 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.270
 you and I just leave it in 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:51.719
 description, however, once downloaded 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:55.440
 the pious v visco will come the zip 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.449
 then the 9 to extract and then wait 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.410
 a bit for the stars and the ISO will be released 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.449
 let's say what makes the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.729
 game would be the file that yes 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.260
 should put on the cd of the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:14.330
 playstation 1 however once that 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.330
 I was on the streets waiting for a second 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:24.290
 you have to use psx so turn on no 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.930
 this is version 1.7.0 which is 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.689
 the last though from a bit of problems 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.240
 then about some games like metal 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.369
 gear that gives a little trouble because not 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.079
 you can change the disc because it is reality 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.860
 ie change disk, however, does not work 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.380
 a kind of bam works anyway 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.759
 once he has finished 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:55.100
 giulio here it is, you don't have to mount it 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.810
 with damon tools even if there is the sign 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.340
 because I used it as a program 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.229
 default to have these enzo 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.229
 however teheran iso does 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:12.270
 to me this is my ps ci directory 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.720
 are the various box one ratio metal games 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.140
 gear 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.370
 ok however went into the purpose like 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:25.340
 you have put it click double click on 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:30.180
 this and the game will start nothing 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.120
 we say this is all we see 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:38.100
 in the next video maybe I'll show you a 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.930
 bit like how to configure psx 15 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.280
 let's see in the next video and give 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.280
 beautiful tapestry
