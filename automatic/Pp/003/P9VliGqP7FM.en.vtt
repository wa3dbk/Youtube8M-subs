primarily started as a way to keep
learning<00:00:23.390> I<00:00:23.780> think<00:00:24.230> it's<00:00:24.350> also<00:00:24.500> developed<00:00:25.130> is

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
learning I think it's also developed is

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.310 
learning I think it's also developed is
just<00:00:25.490> a<00:00:25.670> social<00:00:26.180> place<00:00:26.600> for<00:00:26.869> people<00:00:27.020> to<00:00:27.140> get

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
conferences together also you know I

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.969 
conferences together also you know I
think<00:00:34.999> it<00:00:35.239> started<00:00:35.539> is<00:00:35.989> a<00:00:36.019> group<00:00:36.620> of<00:00:36.769> people

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:36.979 
think it started is a group of people

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.340 
think it started is a group of people
with<00:00:37.280> a<00:00:37.309> vision<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:37.940> that's<00:00:38.780> always<00:00:39.079> hard

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
with a vision and that's always hard

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.129 
with a vision and that's always hard
when<00:00:39.800> those<00:00:40.639> people<00:00:41.059> who<00:00:41.210> have<00:00:41.389> an<00:00:41.510> idea<00:00:41.809> what

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:42.139 
when those people who have an idea what

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:44.709 
when those people who have an idea what
it's<00:00:42.319> going<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:42.649> be<00:00:42.999> leave<00:00:43.999> and<00:00:44.510> for<00:00:44.629> other

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
it's going to be leave and for other

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.930 
it's going to be leave and for other
people<00:00:45.079> to<00:00:45.170> kind<00:00:45.319> of<00:00:45.440> take<00:00:45.649> it<00:00:45.800> on<00:00:45.920> I<00:00:46.280> think

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
people to kind of take it on I think

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.459 
people to kind of take it on I think
every<00:00:47.179> group<00:00:47.449> has<00:00:47.479> to<00:00:47.870> create<00:00:48.260> their<00:00:48.409> own

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
every group has to create their own

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.289 
every group has to create their own
vision<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.219> decide<00:00:49.549> what<00:00:49.760> they<00:00:49.879> want<00:00:49.909> it<00:00:50.179> to

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:50.299 
vision and decide what they want it to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.719 
vision and decide what they want it to
be<00:00:50.510> about<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.350> I<00:00:51.530> think<00:00:51.739> over<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.039> years<00:00:52.069> it's

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
be about so I think over the years it's

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.000 
be about so I think over the years it's
really<00:00:53.260> changed<00:00:54.260> in<00:00:54.440> terms<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.799> what<00:00:54.979> people

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
really changed in terms of what people

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.500 
really changed in terms of what people
wanted<00:00:55.670> out<00:00:55.819> of<00:00:55.850> it

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.820 

in<00:01:02.510> my<00:01:02.780> opinion<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.290> collective<00:01:04.040> is<00:01:04.460> about

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
in my opinion the collective is about

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.050 
in my opinion the collective is about
making<00:01:06.830> connections<00:01:07.100> with<00:01:07.610> other<00:01:07.880> n

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
making connections with other n

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.170 
making connections with other n
therapist<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:09.440> also<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.490> make<00:01:10.760> a<00:01:10.790> connection

got my internship and I like help with
that<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.280> good<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.580> know<00:02:54.000> kind<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.630> what's

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
that so it's good to know kind of what's

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.500 
that so it's good to know kind of what's
going<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.830> don't<00:02:56.790> think<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.209> should<00:02:57.360> be

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
going on I don't think that it should be

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.750 
going on I don't think that it should be
more<00:02:57.720> one<00:02:58.050> all<00:02:58.349> just<00:02:59.010> sample<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.370> person

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
more one all just sample in person

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.339 
more one all just sample in person
because<00:02:59.910> that's<00:03:00.150> ridiculous<00:03:00.810> yeah<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.170> think

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
because that's ridiculous yeah I think

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.720 
because that's ridiculous yeah I think
we<00:03:01.590> should<00:03:01.769> probably<00:03:01.950> i'll<00:03:02.280> try<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.610> work

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
we should probably i'll try and work

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.400 
we should probably i'll try and work
together<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.300> know<00:03:03.420> it's<00:03:03.630> hard<00:03:03.750> because<00:03:03.989> a

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
together and I know it's hard because a

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.550 
together and I know it's hard because a
lot<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.160> us<00:03:05.340> work<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:07.080> lot<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.260> us<00:03:07.410> have

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
lot of us work and a lot of us have

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.190 
lot of us work and a lot of us have
crazy<00:03:07.830> schedules<00:03:08.370> but<00:03:08.700> just<00:03:09.209> trying<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.049> like

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
crazy schedules but just trying to like

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.559 
crazy schedules but just trying to like
make<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.769> come<00:03:11.069> together<00:03:11.250> probably<00:03:11.970> be<00:03:12.330> more

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
make it come together probably be more

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.150 
make it come together probably be more
helpful

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.920 

I<00:03:49.159> think<00:03:49.700> it's<00:03:49.819> a<00:03:49.879> really<00:03:50.060> great<00:03:50.360> goal<00:03:50.599> to<00:03:50.810> try

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
I think it's a really great goal to try

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.509 
I think it's a really great goal to try
to<00:03:51.019> figure<00:03:51.230> out<00:03:51.379> ways<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.680> first<00:03:52.129> years<00:03:52.370> and

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
to figure out ways that first years and

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.280 
to figure out ways that first years and
second<00:03:52.790> years<00:03:52.940> can<00:03:53.180> get<00:03:53.360> together<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.110> try

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
second years can get together and to try

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.559 
second years can get together and to try
to<00:03:54.319> figure<00:03:54.530> out<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:54.950> time<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.489> do<00:03:55.610> it<00:03:55.790> and

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
to figure out that time to do it and

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.789 
to figure out that time to do it and
figure<00:03:56.870> out<00:03:56.930> you<00:03:57.260> know<00:03:57.290> what<00:03:57.530> would<00:03:57.650> be<00:03:57.680> the

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
figure out you know what would be the

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.920 
figure out you know what would be the
best<00:03:58.040> time<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.459> do<00:03:58.580> that<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.180> when<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.510> happens

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
best time to do that and when it happens

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.259 
best time to do that and when it happens
I<00:04:00.049> think<00:04:00.260> everybody<00:04:00.680> really<00:04:01.549> can<00:04:01.730> gain<00:04:01.940> from

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
I think everybody really can gain from

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.850 
I think everybody really can gain from
it<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.659> mean<00:04:03.049> I<00:04:03.110> think<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.409> can<00:04:03.560> make<00:04:03.709> it

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
it I mean I think you can make it

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.440 
it I mean I think you can make it
whatever<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.190> want<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.580> to<00:04:04.610> be<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.030> then<00:04:05.150> the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
whatever you want it to be and then the

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.229 
whatever you want it to be and then the
next<00:04:05.629> group<00:04:06.019> can<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:07.370> know<00:04:07.489> really<00:04:07.760> needs<00:04:08.120> to

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
next group can you know really needs to

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.509 
next group can you know really needs to
think<00:04:08.450> about<00:04:08.660> what<00:04:08.959> is<00:04:09.170> going<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.560> be<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.799> most

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
think about what is going to be the most

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.299 
think about what is going to be the most
meaningful<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.180> them
