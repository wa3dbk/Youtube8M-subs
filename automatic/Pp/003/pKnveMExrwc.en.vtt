00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.330
 so friends all the good time of day in 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.109
 I would like to tell a little about this video 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.920
 about 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.080
 minitractor hinge and about power so 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.350
 let's say the transfer and rather all 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.109
 driveline to the rear axle from 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.270
 what we have done but classic 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.230
 all use for these types of types 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.519
 tractors with such 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.890
 frame this is for the hinge main device 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.769
 the main element we use is 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:37.170
 the front hub of the car vaz here 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:41.579
 I use it here too 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.460
 I have problems built into that 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.260
 Cardan transfer need to do so 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.500
 so that it had a slotted part 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.530
 so say the spline joint is sliding 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.870
 because when folding frames then we 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.100
 transmissions are more true than cardan transmission with 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.710
 bridges she either lengthen either this or 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.030
 shortened or lengthened for this 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.229
 and need a spline part 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.040
 sliding that I took for this here 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.650
 part was 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.689
 nominally taken from Muscovite hellish cardan in 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.200
 her inside here here in the tubular part 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:27.390
 this part was a war ratchet here 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.930
 cars vas and shaft itself which goes u 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.540
 us from the hook to the rear axle 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:39.240
 I have made of VAZ semi-axis 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.159
 gloss was taken flesh is needed 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.140
 it took exactly its slotted part 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.130
 that is, what happens is that inside 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.600
 this part of the cardan 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.680
 we have a spline connection 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:56.180
 gliding as well as many 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:00.659
 face such a problem how to make 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.210
 duster the most big-eyed semi from sense 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.899
 st Azov nave to not get there 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.750
 dirt to the thrust bearing I did it 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.000
 just this cap in it just in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.610
 Exactly included Moskvitch cardan by 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.450
 diameter 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.660
 there even behind dangers and millimeters here 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.390
 I cut this gimbal something like this 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.480
 that is, that's about one and a half 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.030
 centimeters on 2 even I have a gimbal 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.440
 Omsk clear enters the cap and 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.190
 this compound is obtained as in the form 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.420
 anther grief plot does not fall 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.990
 it doesn't hurt anything 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.650
 everything is spinning clearly spinning so well 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:45.040
 friends but it is probably so far all of the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:49.209
 transmissions further in more detail 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.790
 I'll tell you and the device a little later so 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.870
 thank you all for watching all health 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.870
 good luck to all
