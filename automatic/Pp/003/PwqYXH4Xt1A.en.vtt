00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.900
 I want you to talk about women. 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.500
 Oh, I like women. 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.200
 A woman could trust me. Until her interests interfere with mine. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE FILM DEATHING PAST AND THE OFFER OF THE SUB 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.800
 This image is worth 100 million bucks! 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.600
 They closed the air supply to drive away the tourists. 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.900
 Then they lowered the bars to keep everyone out. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200
 Distraction. Make a noise over there. 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.700
 To take 100 million from the wall in this room and leave the main entrance. 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.600
 - So it is well. - Oh yes. 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.800
 - Do we know each other? - Not yet, my name is Catherine Banning. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.500
 And whose head are you going? 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.800
 After yours. 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.000
 You're enjoying something. 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.800
 And what am I? 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 Entertainment. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.600
 Do you really think I'm going to sleep with the man I work with? 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 - You always get the guy you go after? - Yes. 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.800
 Do you think you'll get me? 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.200
 I hope so. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 - Here they must be used. - With whom? 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.300
 - Anyone you bring. - I'm not bringing anyone here. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.900
 Do you have your hands tied, how do you get out of it? 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.600
 You don't think you can trust me, do you? 

00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:21.700
 You are moving property. You're getting ready to run. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.900
 Let's say yes, what would you have left? 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.800
 No picture, 5 million, not me either. 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.300
 GET READY 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.200
 ON AFRICA 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.800
 Do you want to dance? Or dance? 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.000
 I want you to do your job. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.300
 Because now you're acting like a junkie. 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.600
 - This is about money. - It's not about money. 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.500
 She likes going somebody. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.800
 I can leave tomorrow. So do you! 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.200
 Thomas! 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.900
 How could I trust you? 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.900
 But I will trust you. 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.900
