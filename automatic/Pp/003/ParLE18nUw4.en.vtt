00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
very small package it's not exactly the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.940 
very small package it's not exactly the
smallest<00:00:12.210> 720p<00:00:12.540> camera<00:00:13.110> we've<00:00:13.320> ever<00:00:13.500> seen<00:00:13.710> but

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
smallest 720p camera we've ever seen but

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.010 
smallest 720p camera we've ever seen but
it's<00:00:14.040> pretty<00:00:14.160> close<00:00:14.599> it's<00:00:15.599> primarily

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
it's pretty close it's primarily

it's pretty close it's primarily
intended<00:00:16.379> for<00:00:16.740> helmet<00:00:17.039> mount<00:00:17.250> design<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.970> it

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
intended for helmet mount design and it

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.359 
intended for helmet mount design and it
relies<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.960> little<00:00:19.140> disk<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:19.920> for

relies on this little disk here for
doing<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:21.210> got<00:00:21.420> grooves<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.020> here<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380

grooves in here simply slide that
through<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.470> will<00:00:25.590> go<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.740> either<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.310> left<00:00:26.490> or

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
through it will go on either the left or

through it will go on either the left or
the<00:00:26.730> right<00:00:26.789> side<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.359> then<00:00:28.050> it'll<00:00:28.800> pop<00:00:29.070> onto

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
the right side and then it'll pop onto

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.890 
the right side and then it'll pop onto
one<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> few<00:00:29.849> different<00:00:30.150> mounts<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.630> this

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
one of the few different mounts in this

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.440 
one of the few different mounts in this
case<00:00:31.109> we're<00:00:31.349> using<00:00:31.820> one<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.940> relies<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
case we're using one that relies on the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.020 
case we're using one that relies on the
double-sided<00:00:33.899> adhesive<00:00:34.140> pad<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.280> connect<00:00:35.640> to

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
double-sided adhesive pad to connect to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.810 
double-sided adhesive pad to connect to
our<00:00:36.420> visored<00:00:37.020> helmet<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.950> pops<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.430> there<00:00:38.579> with

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
our visored helmet it pops on there with

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.299 
our visored helmet it pops on there with
Velcro<00:00:39.270> effectively<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.649> got<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.070> little

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
Velcro effectively and it's got a little

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.060 
Velcro effectively and it's got a little
tether<00:00:42.030> here<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.570> use<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:43.079> backup

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
tether here that you can use for backup

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.400 
tether here that you can use for backup
and<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:45.120> seems<00:00:45.329> kind<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.750> flimsy<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.289> we

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and this seems kind of flimsy but we

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.959 
and this seems kind of flimsy but we
tested<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.920> add<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.280> 80<00:00:47.489> miles<00:00:47.700> an<00:00:47.850> hour

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
tested it it add up to 80 miles an hour

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.930 
tested it it add up to 80 miles an hour
and<00:00:48.210> had<00:00:48.300> no<00:00:48.480> shoes<00:00:48.690> at<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.789> works

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and had no shoes at all so it works

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.810 
and had no shoes at all so it works
quite<00:00:51.270> well<00:00:51.710> believe<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.770> or<00:00:52.800> not<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.699> any

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
quite well believe it or not for any

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.229 
quite well believe it or not for any
sports<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.360> use<00:00:55.079> goggles<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:56.239> downhill

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.149> use<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.480> mount<00:01:00.809> which<00:01:00.960> clips<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
you can use this mount which clips on to

handlebar mount as well if you're into
mountain<00:01:42.390> biking<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.810> again<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.079> should<00:01:43.170> be

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
mountain biking but again you should be

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.270 
mountain biking but again you should be
wearing<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> helmet<00:01:43.680> when<00:01:43.860> you're<00:01:44.009> doing<00:01:44.189> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
wearing a helmet when you're doing that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.270 
wearing a helmet when you're doing that
anyway<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.259> again<00:01:46.259> we're<00:01:46.500> seeing<00:01:46.890> primarily

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
anyway so again we're seeing primarily

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.770 
anyway so again we're seeing primarily
helmet-mounted<00:01:47.610> use<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.149> other<00:01:48.270> reason<00:01:48.630> that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
helmet-mounted use the other reason that

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.420 
helmet-mounted use the other reason that
we're<00:01:48.899> thinking<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.680> because<00:01:49.829> at

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
we're thinking of that is because at

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.600 
we're thinking of that is because at
speeds<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:52.140> over<00:01:52.799> about<00:01:52.979> 30<00:01:53.189> miles<00:01:53.430> an

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
speeds up to or over about 30 miles an

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.240 
speeds up to or over about 30 miles an
hour<00:01:54.049> wind<00:01:55.049> noise<00:01:55.229> becomes<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.770> definite

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
hour wind noise becomes a definite

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.469 
hour wind noise becomes a definite
problem<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.759> you'll<00:01:56.909> see<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.180> some<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
problem as you'll see in some of the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.260 
problem as you'll see in some of the
videos<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.930> we've<00:01:58.049> included<00:01:59.030> it's<00:02:00.030> really

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
videos that we've included it's really

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.850 
videos that we've included it's really
hard<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> hear<00:02:00.600> anything<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.500> whistling

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
hard to hear anything but the whistling

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.240 
hard to hear anything but the whistling
of<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.100> wind<00:02:02.750> in<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:04.049> thing<00:02:04.259> again<00:02:05.100> it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
of the wind in this thing again it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.380 
of the wind in this thing again it
stayed<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.579> helmet<00:02:05.820> at<00:02:05.939> any<00:02:06.060> miles<00:02:06.240> now

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
stayed on the helmet at any miles now

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.130 
stayed on the helmet at any miles now
but<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.659> couldn't<00:02:06.810> really<00:02:06.869> hear<00:02:07.079> anything

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
but you couldn't really hear anything

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.309 
but you couldn't really hear anything
else<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:07.890> allowed<00:02:08.550> wish<00:02:08.879> terms<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:10.020> ease<00:02:10.170> of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.110 
know how much space you have left on
your<00:02:51.239> memory<00:02:51.419> card<00:02:51.689> and<00:02:52.489> perhaps<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.819> coolest

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
your memory card and perhaps the coolest

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.000 
your memory card and perhaps the coolest
feature<00:02:54.299> is<00:02:54.689> that<00:02:54.719> the<00:02:54.930> entire<00:02:55.290> body<00:02:55.650> itself

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
feature is that the entire body itself

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.420 
feature is that the entire body itself
rotates<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:58.109> twist<00:02:58.409> this<00:02:58.709> 90<00:02:59.099> degrees

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
rotates so you can twist this 90 degrees

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.539 
rotates so you can twist this 90 degrees
either<00:02:59.760> left<00:03:00.060> or<00:03:00.359> to<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:00.959> right<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.430> if

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
either left or to the right so that if

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.979 
either left or to the right so that if
you<00:03:02.639> do<00:03:02.760> need<00:03:02.909> to<00:03:02.939> mount<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.389> horizontally

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
you do need to mount this horizontally

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.689 
you do need to mount this horizontally
for<00:03:04.139> any<00:03:04.290> reason<00:03:04.650> you'll<00:03:04.889> still<00:03:05.129> get<00:03:05.280> pictures

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:05.699 
for any reason you'll still get pictures

for any reason you'll still get pictures
that<00:03:05.879> are<00:03:06.000> upright<00:03:06.299> or<00:03:06.540> if<00:03:07.109> you<00:03:07.199> want<00:03:07.379> to<00:03:07.469> add<00:03:07.560> a

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
that are upright or if you want to add a

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.280 
that are upright or if you want to add a
cool<00:03:07.799> angle<00:03:08.159> you<00:03:08.250> can<00:03:08.370> do<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.639> too<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.290> these

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
cool angle you can do that too and these

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.990 
cool angle you can do that too and these
two<00:03:10.560> points<00:03:10.889> that<00:03:11.189> you<00:03:11.219> see<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:11.519> either<00:03:11.639> side

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000

where the camera is pointed a big help

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.719 
where the camera is pointed a big help
