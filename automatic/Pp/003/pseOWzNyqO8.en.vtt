00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
think the best findable weapon I think

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.859 
think the best findable weapon I think
you<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.460> create<00:01:56.700> Daedric<00:01:57.360> weapons<00:01:57.719> and

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
you have to create Daedric weapons and

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.999 
you have to create Daedric weapons and
everything<00:01:57.960> so<00:02:00.229> yeah<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.259> tried<00:02:01.560> looking<00:02:01.920> at

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
everything so yeah I tried looking at

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.789 
everything so yeah I tried looking at
how<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> get<00:02:02.549> day-trip<00:02:03.000> weapons<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.229> armors<00:02:04.619> I

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
how to get day-trip weapons and armors I

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.050 
how to get day-trip weapons and armors I
thought<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.280> would<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> cool<00:02:05.790> thing<00:02:05.820> to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
thought that would be a cool thing to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.229 
thought that would be a cool thing to
like<00:02:06.360> make<00:02:06.659> walkthroughs<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.369> but<00:02:08.369> actually

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
like make walkthroughs on but actually

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.540 
like make walkthroughs on but actually
there<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.140> don't<00:02:10.410> think<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.979> find<00:02:11.370> them

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
there I don't think you can find them

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.130 
there I don't think you can find them
you<00:02:11.580> have<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.940> create<00:02:12.239> them<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.690> I

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
you have to create them and I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.809 
you have to create them and I
don't<00:02:13.260> really<00:02:13.470> enjoy<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.160> smithing<00:02:14.670> or

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
don't really enjoy the smithing or

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.700 
don't really enjoy the smithing or
armour<00:02:15.240> making<00:02:15.630> at<00:02:15.750> all<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.140> think<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.530> kind

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
armour making at all I think it's kind

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.640 
armour making at all I think it's kind
of<00:02:16.830> just<00:02:17.600> boring<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:20.240> like<00:02:21.240> exploring<00:02:21.660> finding
