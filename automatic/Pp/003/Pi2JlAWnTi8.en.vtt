00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:17.930
 finally my gopro three arrived 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.029
 So hd hero 3 silver edition 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.820
 I have been here now, I was like that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.490
 Bloodless was now unpacked yes 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.320
 Included is this case so 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.330
 This cover is waterproof up to 60 meters 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.969
 and can become one too 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.370
 possible junk use 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:39.050
 yes these feet in principle and stop 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.680
 any amount of these turned parts 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.379
 instruction manual and error message 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.300
 you have to either download or 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.460
 somehow think at that time 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.800
 then there are two at this one 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.870
 normal silver edition two such 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.940
 adhesive parts one for straight surfaces, the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.789
 may just come quite so completely 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.520
 good view and one for round surfaces 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.600
 I have already glued it on, I show 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.309
 short times look short talk 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.470
 I can do it now says it can 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.909
 first off here on the helmet I have that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.640
 format ron glued there you can the coop 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.479
 or on it here in the place 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.400
 and then you can fall reasonable 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.450
 the ride with films show the same 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.280
 that's exactly what the gopro is like 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.450
 couple of sticky tyler those poor diego 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.600
 has seen were there 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.479
 then there is a usb cable to us 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.740
 are principle normal mini usb with the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.229
 gopro is ok on it and one 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.390
 second back there is the has here 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.619
 two holes for better sound 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.950
 just no waterproof one needs 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:55.530
 couple hero three stickers and that's it 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.299
 such try hero on glue that what 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.549
 in principle, as always, will stop too 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.530
 This go can praise in the beautiful 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.450
 bowl delivered where then that in there 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.530
 That's common with gopro 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.450
 that we actually need right now 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.429
 I will not go to the bicycle somewhere 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.730
 turn it on 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.540
 because I've already done that 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.239
 For a moment, just forget what it looks like 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.409
 our turn is that I can do that now 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.180
 for example, on a normal 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.180
 Tripod with it on it in principle 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:34.099
 then the gopro one can then 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:35.659
 Just look at it like that 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.760
 stuck on it 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.680
 Therefore, put which way you want to have 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.959
 I took the iphone for that extra 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.169
 a spirit level to watch 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.669
 kwg optimally everything is possible right there 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.079
 you can do it a bit firmer 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.510
 screw it naturally and then that fits 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.650
 the sticker has very good so I have 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.409
 now contracted and if we 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.849
 no wobbling on it though 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.669
 the glue is just a bit 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.669
 I probably have to cure 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.980
 I took off when I had the 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.819
 ordered I have read everywhere yes 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.480
 then you have to first software update 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.280
 do 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.719
 I can get out now 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.010
 Most software update do with it 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.379
 this wireless function 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.419
 one could indeed with the gopro hero 2 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.870
 But then you need it 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.870
 extra way 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.680
 you did not have to do that 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.940
 So I have no gambling software update 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.590
 but still wonderful 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.479
 about the iphone, image rate control everything 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.489
 possible settings can be up to 11 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:31.310
 mix photos with others and make up 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.560
 to 1080p videos the exact ones with one 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.780
 frame rate of 30 frames per second and 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.530
 but you can also on a small scale 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.989
 low grades go down 960 720p 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.639
 whatever there is always there 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.379
 higher frames condition so you can do more 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.109
 record frames per second for beautiful 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:51.379
 slow motion a maximum of 120 frames in such a 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:53.060
 something strange wm woman something format 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.819
 and let's not see that either 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.739
 Tried exactly this wireless 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.870
 function is standard by default 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.329
 built-in so you have one here 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.459
 button that looks like sonja this 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.989
 wlan in principle 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.189
 that's what you notice all over here 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.919
 is trigger 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:11.109
 here is on and as the two buttons 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:14.180
 he says for the menu 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:18.400
 responsible exactly otherwise one can 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.150
 here on one side the micro sd xc 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.660
 introduce 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.500
 the mini usb and a hdmi the micro there 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.150
 apparently not everyone is 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.650
 memory card is the memory card 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.449
 Today , the heads of yesterday come 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.270
 and I already have another mini sd 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.520
 xc tried and it does not work 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.620
 Apparently you have to be there anyway 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.870
 case the class has class 10 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.400
 and the channel 9 I liked to have 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.669
 Such a fork from old cellphone 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.770
 that was definitely not the case 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.720
 otherwise there are spring-loaded buttons 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.919
 push for us to use as well 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.680
 But you can just stop it 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.419
 do everything about the wlan function if 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.419
 you can still have them as a further one 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:00.020
 turn it on again and so on 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.880
 I am now again a microphone 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.360
 extra she does not have an exit yet 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.030
 but there is something extra in the back 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.039
 Man should be up to so if that 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.510
 wind speed the one at the one 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.210
 Quali all films in the car, for example 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.979
 is higher than not in the car 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.070
 outside the car is higher than 100 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.780
 times per hour but please the 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.160
 Closed casement otherwise that is 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.960
 for better sound quality if you do not have one 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.000
 waterproof needs just the open 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.650
 case to advise this other here 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.599
 you can exchange many more 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.949
 parts such as mooring to helmet or 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.910
 bike somehow not 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.909
 I found it a bit sad 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.440
 somehow is not the bringer now 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:42.110
 because you just do not feel so good everywhere 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.190
 but I could fix that 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.580
 see if I in we on a tripod 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.870
 on it war and then reasonable meal 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.210
 recordings can do that and then 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.900
 can report it 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.250
 that would be in any case as in 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.330
 in the future the videos are done on so 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.099
 will now also be back 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.389
 We have a little more summer to do 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.680
 the bikes and so on if even 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.900
 has not seen just below the 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.280
 channel broadcast status 1 or just 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.039
 watch and youtube and as always 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.849
 search 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.990
 and that's why we're going to do it now 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.729
 make some movies again, of course 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.639
 synonymous another camera but the 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.500
 future helmet camera and that will be 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.510
 then give it over in spring 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.310
 ok if somehow has questions or 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.110
 for example to the software because he gave 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.300
 also a little confusion just once 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.830
 Write and otherwise I want you 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.830
 have fun with the upcoming videos
