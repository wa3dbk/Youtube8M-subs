all these really important structures

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.529 
all these really important structures
now<00:02:07.289> after<00:02:07.740> repetitive<00:02:08.340> motion<00:02:08.729> what<00:02:09.209> happens

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
now after repetitive motion what happens

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.540 
now after repetitive motion what happens
to<00:02:09.750> your<00:02:09.899> wrist<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.380> that<00:02:10.649> little<00:02:11.069> script

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
to your wrist is that little script

all<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.550> blood<00:02:14.819> vessels<00:02:15.209> go<00:02:15.510> get<00:02:16.140> smaller<00:02:16.500> and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
all the blood vessels go get smaller and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.280 
all the blood vessels go get smaller and
smaller<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.150> aggravates<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.959> area

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
smaller and then it aggravates that area

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.670 
smaller and then it aggravates that area
to<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.620> point<00:02:19.950> where<00:02:20.100> swelling<00:02:20.880> appears<00:02:21.000> and

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
to the point where swelling appears and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.470 
to the point where swelling appears and
point<00:02:22.680> where<00:02:22.799> every<00:02:23.069> single<00:02:23.430> touch<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.940> very

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
point where every single touch is very

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.140 
point where every single touch is very
painful<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.650> stretching<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.519> exercising

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
painful so stretching and exercising

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.570 
painful so stretching and exercising
would<00:02:28.049> actually<00:02:28.440> help<00:02:28.620> alleviate<00:02:28.920> those

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
would actually help alleviate those

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.059 
would actually help alleviate those
muscles<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.569> risk<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.500> movements<00:02:31.950> of

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
muscles now the risk the movements of

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.830 
muscles now the risk the movements of
the<00:02:32.130> risk<00:02:32.459> they<00:02:32.970> only<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> couple<00:02:33.510> of

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
the risk they only do a couple of

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.580 
the risk they only do a couple of
movements<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.380> first<00:02:34.650> one<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.959> extension<00:02:36.959> so

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
movements the first one is extension so

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.050 
movements the first one is extension so
they<00:02:37.709> extend<00:02:38.069> your<00:02:38.220> hand<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.640> other<00:02:38.880> one

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
they extend your hand and the other one

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.380 
they extend your hand and the other one
is<00:02:39.090> reflection<00:02:39.780> with<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> flat<00:02:40.620> flex<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:42.269> other

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
is reflection with a flat flex the other

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.120 
is reflection with a flat flex the other
couple<00:02:42.780> movements<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.319> called<00:02:43.590> radial

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
couple movements is called radial

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.090 
couple movements is called radial
deviation<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:45.030> ulnar<00:02:45.780> deviation<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.680> those

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
deviation and ulnar deviation and those

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.410 
deviation and ulnar deviation and those
are<00:02:47.250> important<00:02:47.610> movements<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.060> know<00:02:48.209> because

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
are important movements to know because

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.569 
are important movements to know because
those<00:02:48.720> ones<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.799> want<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:50.070> do<00:02:50.220> when<00:02:50.430> you

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
those ones that you want to do when you

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.840 
those ones that you want to do when you
stretch<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.239> when<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.570> exercise<00:02:52.230> your<00:02:52.530> risk

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
stretch and when you exercise your risk

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.030 
stretch and when you exercise your risk
now<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:54.180> also<00:02:54.810> want<00:02:55.109> to<00:02:55.170> spend<00:02:55.680> some<00:02:55.859> time

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
now I also want to spend some time

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.620 
now I also want to spend some time

talking about the thumb the thumb is
very<00:02:57.840> specific<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.829> it<00:02:59.190> as<00:02:59.489> his<00:02:59.609> own<00:02:59.760> movements

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
very specific of it as his own movements

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.090 
very specific of it as his own movements
is<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:00.780> earth<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:03.170> get<00:03:04.170> some<00:03:04.470> information

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
is on earth that it get some information

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.990 
is on earth that it get some information
from<00:03:05.609> now<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.810> thumb<00:03:07.109> can<00:03:07.350> also<00:03:07.680> extend<00:03:08.579> and

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
from now the thumb can also extend and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.710 
from now the thumb can also extend and
flex<00:03:09.030> but<00:03:09.840> i<00:03:09.870> can<00:03:10.140> also<00:03:10.640> your<00:03:11.640> opposing<00:03:12.239> thumb

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720

who's very deep to madness that they're

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.060 
who's very deep to madness that they're
specifically<00:03:15.329> humans<00:03:15.780> now<00:03:16.410> these<00:03:16.590> ones<00:03:16.920> will

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
specifically humans now these ones will

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.800 
specifically humans now these ones will
come<00:03:17.280> into<00:03:17.430> play<00:03:17.670> because<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:18.239> lot<00:03:18.780> of

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
come into play because a lot of

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.900 
come into play because a lot of
repetitive<00:03:19.140> motions<00:03:19.709> like<00:03:20.100> typing<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:20.670> done

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
repetitive motions like typing is done

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.910 
repetitive motions like typing is done
through<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.540> done<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.530> puts<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.859> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
through the done and it puts it a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.740 
through the done and it puts it a
million<00:03:23.190> comfortable<00:03:23.730> position<00:03:24.120> where<00:03:24.600> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
million comfortable position where the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.960 
million comfortable position where the
carpal<00:03:25.200> tunnel<00:03:25.590> actually<00:03:25.980> with<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.730> bridge

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
carpal tunnel actually with the bridge

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.540 
carpal tunnel actually with the bridge
the<00:03:27.390> opening<00:03:27.930> it's<00:03:28.859> actually<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.400> Gateway<00:03:29.760> so

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
the opening it's actually the Gateway so

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.940 
the opening it's actually the Gateway so
I<00:03:30.610> said<00:03:30.940> so<00:03:31.330> okay<00:03:31.360> that<00:03:32.320> was<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.530> little<00:03:32.620> more

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
I said so okay that was a little more

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.040 
I said so okay that was a little more
information<00:03:33.550> that<00:03:33.700> guess<00:03:33.940> wanna<00:03:34.510> know<00:03:34.720> about

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
information that guess wanna know about

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.470 
information that guess wanna know about
carpal<00:03:35.740> tunnel<00:03:35.980> syndrome<00:03:36.130> but<00:03:36.880> I<00:03:36.910> think<00:03:37.330> it's

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
carpal tunnel syndrome but I think it's

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.990 
carpal tunnel syndrome but I think it's
beneficial<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:38.350> know<00:03:38.500> exactly<00:03:38.920> what<00:03:39.430> costed

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
beneficial to know exactly what costed

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.280 
beneficial to know exactly what costed
and<00:03:40.150> what<00:03:40.480> are<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.690> revenues<00:03:40.840> to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
and what are the revenues to

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.470 
and what are the revenues to
rehabilitate<00:03:42.220> carpal<00:03:42.580> tunnel<00:03:42.820> syndrome<00:03:42.940> now

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
rehabilitate carpal tunnel syndrome now

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.180 
rehabilitate carpal tunnel syndrome now
let's<00:03:43.990> get<00:03:44.170> started<00:03:44.470> with<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.680> one

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.430 

all<00:03:50.850> right<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.570> first<00:03:51.750> thing<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.140> do<00:03:52.410> is

all right the first thing you do is

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.020 
all right the first thing you do is
you're<00:03:52.770> going<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.920> perform<00:03:53.280> wrist<00:03:53.700> circles

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
you're going to perform wrist circles

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.410 
you're going to perform wrist circles
clockwise<00:03:54.950> now<00:03:55.950> you're<00:03:56.850> going<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.060> have<00:03:57.210> your

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
clockwise now you're going to have your

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.750 
clockwise now you're going to have your
hand<00:03:57.660> rested<00:03:58.260> against<00:03:58.650> your<00:03:58.770> knee<00:03:58.950> or<00:03:59.190> just
