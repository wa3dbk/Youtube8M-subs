have the original finish on them I had
to<00:00:54.090> replace<00:00:54.390> some<00:00:54.899> things<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.070> the

cross drive belt and so on I had some

cross drive belt and so on I had some
issues<00:01:00.780> initially<00:01:01.379> setting<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the cross drive to get it to work

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.700 
the cross drive to get it to work
correctly<00:01:05.750> one<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> other<00:01:07.080> problems<00:01:07.619> that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
correctly one of the other problems that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.399 
correctly one of the other problems that
this<00:01:07.979> had<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.790> did<00:01:09.180> didn't<00:01:09.750> realize<00:01:10.080> until

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
this had that I did didn't realize until

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.460 
this had that I did didn't realize until
later<00:01:10.619> because<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.189> couldn't<00:01:11.520> find<00:01:11.900> why<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
later because I couldn't find why is the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
later because I couldn't find why is the
transmission<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.430> covered<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.000> oil<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
transmission so covered in oil and I

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.499 
transmission so covered in oil and I
could<00:01:15.990> never<00:01:16.590> leaked<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.939> was<00:01:18.090> never<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
could never leaked there was never a

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.370 
could never leaked there was never a
drop<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.840> oil<00:01:19.140> anywhere<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.790> seemed<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
drop of oil anywhere and it seemed that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.080 
drop of oil anywhere and it seemed that
I<00:01:22.380> was<00:01:22.740> never<00:01:22.890> going<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.310> able<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.549> find<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
I was never going to be able to find it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.200 
I was never going to be able to find it
but<00:01:24.380> luck<00:01:25.380> would<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.610> pulley

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
but luck would have it that this pulley

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.710 
but luck would have it that this pulley
got<00:01:28.080> loose<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.400> when<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.939> came<00:01:30.150> loose<00:01:30.450> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
got loose here and when it came loose it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
got loose here and when it came loose it
became<00:01:31.049> obvious<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> backside<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
became obvious that the backside of the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.440 
became obvious that the backside of the
pulley<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.689> covered<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.380> oil<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.180> all

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
pulley was covered in oil so it's all

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.620 
pulley was covered in oil so it's all
coming<00:01:36.659> from<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.680> oil<00:01:37.920> seal<00:01:38.630> right

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
coming from and the oil seal right

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.160 
coming from and the oil seal right
behind<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.680> was<00:01:40.860> acting<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> slinger

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
behind so this was acting as a slinger

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.450 
behind so this was acting as a slinger
once<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.439> bit<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.860> oil<00:01:43.979> would<00:01:44.220> come<00:01:44.430> out

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
once a little bit of oil would come out

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
once a little bit of oil would come out
it<00:01:45.090> would<00:01:45.240> sling<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:45.840> over<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> place<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
it would sling it all over the place and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.670 
it would sling it all over the place and
you<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.890> see<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:47.780> this<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.229> bount<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:49.590> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
you can see here this this bount if you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.289 
you can see here this this bount if you
can<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:51.000> pattern<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.659> oil<00:01:53.299> on

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
can really see it this pattern of oil on

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.230 
can really see it this pattern of oil on
the<00:01:54.570> bottom<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.880> seat<00:01:57.090> pan<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:59.640> bgb

really<00:02:23.070> appeals<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.700> me<00:02:23.790> besides<00:02:24.570> its<00:02:25.170> sort<00:02:25.980> of

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
really appeals to me besides its sort of

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.600 
really appeals to me besides its sort of
looks<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.570> it's<00:02:27.930> um<00:02:28.520> just<00:02:29.520> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
looks and so on is that it's um just the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.790 
looks and so on is that it's um just the
right<00:02:29.820> size<00:02:30.120> for<00:02:30.150> my<00:02:30.690> yard<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:31.590> very

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
right size for my yard and it's very

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.950 
right size for my yard and it's very
nimble<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.550> terms<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.150> getting<00:02:33.300> into<00:02:33.660> spaces

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
nimble in terms of getting into spaces

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.800 
nimble in terms of getting into spaces
and<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:34.950> what's<00:02:35.580> also<00:02:35.760> very<00:02:35.970> nice<00:02:36.480> it's

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
and so on and what's also very nice it's

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.800 
and so on and what's also very nice it's
a<00:02:36.960> super<00:02:37.470> comfortable<00:02:38.130> tractor<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.910> drive<00:02:39.210> it

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
a super comfortable tractor to drive it

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.580 
a super comfortable tractor to drive it
has<00:02:40.080> virtually<00:02:40.380> no<00:02:40.920> vibration<00:02:41.990> of<00:02:42.990> any<00:02:43.230> kind

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
has virtually no vibration of any kind

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.290 
has virtually no vibration of any kind
and<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:45.630> drives<00:02:45.960> like<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.170> Cadillac<00:02:47.270> also<00:02:48.270> I

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
and it drives like a Cadillac also I

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.950 
and it drives like a Cadillac also I
found<00:02:48.720> out<00:02:48.930> over<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.500> winter<00:02:50.300> that<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.720> the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
found out over this winter that the the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.990 
found out over this winter that the the
drive<00:02:52.290> set<00:02:52.620> up<00:02:52.740> on<00:02:52.920> these<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.340> really<00:02:53.700> unusual

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
drive set up on these is really unusual

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.200 
drive set up on these is really unusual
and<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.780> took<00:02:54.930> me<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.370> little<00:02:56.370> while<00:02:56.520> to<00:02:56.700> sort<00:02:57.090> of

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
and it took me a little while to sort of

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.770 
and it took me a little while to sort of
wrap<00:02:57.420> my<00:02:57.690> head<00:02:57.960> around<00:02:57.990> how<00:02:58.380> does<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.070> whole

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
wrap my head around how does this whole

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.720 
wrap my head around how does this whole
transaxle<00:03:00.780> setup<00:03:01.260> work<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.520> if<00:03:02.610> you'll

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
transaxle setup work and if you'll

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.820 
transaxle setup work and if you'll
notice<00:03:03.000> down<00:03:03.360> here<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.910> big<00:03:06.830> circle

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
notice down here this this big circle

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.960 
notice down here this this big circle
here<00:03:08.040> that's<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.990> differential<00:03:09.990> and<00:03:10.970> what

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
here that's the differential and what

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.710 
here that's the differential and what
the<00:03:12.420> way<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.720> simplicity<00:03:13.170> drive<00:03:13.680> works<00:03:14.070> is

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
the way the simplicity drive works is

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.699 
the way the simplicity drive works is
that<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.170> drive<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.880> transmission<00:03:18.660> ends<00:03:19.590> up

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
that the drive the transmission ends up

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.520 
that the drive the transmission ends up
driving<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:21.000> tube<00:03:21.450> we<00:03:21.989> come<00:03:22.200> around<00:03:22.290> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
driving this tube we come around the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.240 
driving this tube we come around the
other<00:03:22.560> side

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.560 

transmission<00:03:26.250> actually<00:03:26.610> drives<00:03:26.910> this

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
transmission actually drives this

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.430 
transmission actually drives this
outside<00:03:28.320> tube<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.540> when<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:30.780> tube<00:03:31.050> drives

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
outside tube and when this tube drives

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.320 
outside tube and when this tube drives
it<00:03:31.650> drives<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:32.250> differential<00:03:32.940> the

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
it drives a differential the

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.590 
it drives a differential the
differential<00:03:34.080> in<00:03:34.260> turn<00:03:35.060> engages<00:03:36.060> with<00:03:36.420> the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
differential in turn engages with the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.949 
differential in turn engages with the
axle<00:03:37.640> over<00:03:38.640> here<00:03:38.940> which<00:03:39.120> runs<00:03:39.420> through<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
axle over here which runs through the

axle over here which runs through the
entire<00:03:39.989> unit<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.890> drives<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.640> other<00:03:41.760> wheel

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
entire unit and drives the other wheel

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.850 
entire unit and drives the other wheel
these<00:03:43.080> there<00:03:43.560> two<00:03:43.860> bolts<00:03:44.790> right<00:03:45.709> here<00:03:46.709> I'm<00:03:46.830> not

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
these there two bolts right here I'm not

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.180 
these there two bolts right here I'm not
sure<00:03:47.100> if<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.280> can<00:03:47.459> see<00:03:47.670> them<00:03:48.440> those<00:03:49.440> bolts<00:03:50.010> are

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
sure if you can see them those bolts are

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.100 
sure if you can see them those bolts are
actually<00:03:50.580> what<00:03:50.730> controlled<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.870> degree

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
actually what controlled the the degree

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.009 
actually what controlled the the degree
of<00:03:52.320> lockup<00:03:52.709> between<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.459> two<00:03:53.670> wheels

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
of lockup between the two wheels

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.280 
of lockup between the two wheels
I<00:03:56.150> really<00:03:57.150> haven't<00:03:57.360> pulled<00:03:57.690> with<00:03:57.900> them<00:03:58.050> at<00:03:58.140> all

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
I really haven't pulled with them at all

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.130 
I really haven't pulled with them at all
but<00:03:58.950> I<00:03:59.010> noticed<00:03:59.519> one<00:04:00.090> day<00:04:00.360> when<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.630> took<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.930> out

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
but I noticed one day when I took it out

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.160 
but I noticed one day when I took it out
of<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.410> garage<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.739> there<00:04:02.280> was<00:04:02.459> heavy<00:04:02.700> snow

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
of the garage and there was heavy snow

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.300 
of the garage and there was heavy snow
onyx<00:04:04.170> I<00:04:04.230> needed<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.560> make<00:04:04.709> room<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.160> get<00:04:05.250> my

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
onyx I needed to make room to get my

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.020 
onyx I needed to make room to get my
snow<00:04:05.700> blower<00:04:05.970> out<00:04:06.769> both<00:04:07.769> wheels<00:04:08.220> would<00:04:08.700> really

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
snow blower out both wheels would really

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.780 
snow blower out both wheels would really
dig<00:04:09.390> into<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.780> snow<00:04:09.930> trying<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.100> trying<00:04:11.670> to

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
dig into the snow trying to trying to

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.170 
dig into the snow trying to trying to
drive<00:04:12.090> these<00:04:12.810> rollers<00:04:13.350> into<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.830> snow<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.430> it

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
drive these rollers into the snow and it

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.330 
drive these rollers into the snow and it
was<00:04:15.420> remarkable<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.410> see<00:04:16.590> how<00:04:16.769> well<00:04:17.010> that

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
was remarkable to see how well that

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.000 
was remarkable to see how well that
worked

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.010 

other<00:04:21.790> things<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:25.360> I've<00:04:25.510> been<00:04:25.630> trying

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
other things that that I've been trying

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.950 
other things that that I've been trying
to<00:04:26.170> do<00:04:26.320> is<00:04:26.590> trying<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.490> save<00:04:27.970> this<00:04:28.330> white<00:04:28.630> paint

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
to do is trying to save this white paint

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.930 
to do is trying to save this white paint
I<00:04:29.260> don't<00:04:29.770> know<00:04:29.860> what<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:30.190> is<00:04:30.340> about<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.730> nature

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
I don't know what it is about the nature

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.400 
I don't know what it is about the nature
of<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.330> white<00:04:31.540> paint<00:04:31.840> that's<00:04:32.080> on<00:04:32.260> these

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
of the white paint that's on these

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.650 
of the white paint that's on these
consoles<00:04:32.980> but<00:04:33.400> I've<00:04:33.820> noticed<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.330> just<00:04:34.540> about

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
consoles but I've noticed on just about

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.130 
consoles but I've noticed on just about
every<00:04:35.320> tractor<00:04:35.890> of<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:36.910> age<00:04:37.180> these<00:04:37.810> things

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
every tractor of this age these things

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.130 
every tractor of this age these things
tend<00:04:38.410> to<00:04:38.620> rust<00:04:39.160> out<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.400> lot<00:04:39.730> and<00:04:40.090> look<00:04:40.960> like

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
tend to rust out a lot and look like

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.770 
tend to rust out a lot and look like
crap<00:04:41.530> I<00:04:41.890> really<00:04:42.700> don't<00:04:42.910> want<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.180> repaint<00:04:43.630> it

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
crap I really don't want to repaint it
