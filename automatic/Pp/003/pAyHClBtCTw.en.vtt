00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.300
 the recipe is very simple is very fast 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.270
 of preparing the ingredients are very 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.400
 easy to get information and good 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.650
 let's cook for the oriental 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.010
 we need cambray onion stems 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.050
 chopped ginger grated mushrooms 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.960
 laminated but that is not so 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.450
 thin that long we also need 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.610
 Rice noodles are found in all 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.059
 the supermarkets is not expensive 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.340
 also some soy sauce oil 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.010
 of sesame if you do not want to buy oil 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.800
 of sesame seeds or can not find it 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.270
 use vegetable oil of which already 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.030
 they have there at home and also 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.649
 we need chicken broth well since 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.480
 on the stove I think we have to 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.809
 do is put some oil 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.379
 sesame vegetable oil that they have 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.670
 at home then we are going to add the 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.670
 onion stems chamray 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.030
 in cash and grated 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.140
 and the mushrooms 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.940
 and black literally all the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.230
 ingredients 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.230
 we lower the fire 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.050
 and we will leave them for 5 minutes 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.510
 almost without moving unless they see 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.850
 that some mushroom is burning like that 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.850
 they can start moving three or four 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.060
 minutes later I'm going to add sauce 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.060
 soy 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.800
 and the chicken broth 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.490
 we cover and raise the fire 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.689
 and let's let it boil for five 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.539
 minutes five minutes after being 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.200
 boiling the broth we will add the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.200
 rice noodles 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.570
 here we leave them for seven to ten 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:25.030
 minutes alone will be letting go and 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.760
 they're just going to get softer 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.270
 here we just move a little bit to 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.270
 open them 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.920
 there it is, we cover again 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.189
 we lower the fire back to the minimum and what 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.189
 we left 10 minutes and this is ready 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:50.400
 oriental broth between seven and ten 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:54.359
 minutes later these noodles are already 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.819
 soft and this broth is now ready to 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:00.239
 plating is good to place what 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.490
 let's do is take a little of these 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.140
 noodles 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.140

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:17.550

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.550
 onion stem chambray 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.140
 we bathe them with the broth 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.260
 and they are like me who likes the spicy 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.620

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.069
