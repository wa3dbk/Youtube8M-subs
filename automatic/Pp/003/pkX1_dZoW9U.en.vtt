00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
your first bottle from the zombie piles

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.080 
your first bottle from the zombie piles
will<00:01:38.649> only<00:01:38.799> count<00:01:39.100> as<00:01:39.310> your<00:01:39.399> fifth<00:01:39.789> so<00:01:39.969> you

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
will only count as your fifth so you

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.849 
will only count as your fifth so you
won't<00:01:40.240> actually<00:01:40.390> be<00:01:40.630> given<00:01:40.929> a<00:01:41.020> sick<00:01:41.289> it<00:01:41.590> will

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:41.859 
won't actually be given a sick it will

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:43.620 
won't actually be given a sick it will
just<00:01:41.890> kind<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.549> counter<00:01:42.909> that<00:01:43.060> fifth<00:01:43.359> stop

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
just kind of counter that fifth stop

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.690 
just kind of counter that fifth stop
which<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.899> already<00:01:44.079> have<00:01:44.409> one<00:01:44.590> in<00:01:44.799> they<00:01:45.579> are

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
which you already have one in they are

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.969 
which you already have one in they are
pretty<00:01:45.909> evenly<00:01:46.240> spread<00:01:46.810> across<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.140> map<00:01:47.469> so

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
pretty evenly spread across the map so

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.260 
pretty evenly spread across the map so
you<00:01:48.039> basically<00:01:48.310> just<00:01:48.549> have<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.850> run<00:01:49.149> around

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
you basically just have to run around
