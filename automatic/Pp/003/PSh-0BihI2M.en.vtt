Darth Vader one and out of all of them
this<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.480> most<00:00:15.690> different<00:00:16.170> because<00:00:16.500> it

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
this is the most different because it

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.849 
this is the most different because it
comes<00:00:16.980> with<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.250> red<00:00:17.430> blade<00:00:17.779> but<00:00:18.779> let<00:00:19.560> me<00:00:19.650> get

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
comes with the red blade but let me get

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.090 
comes with the red blade but let me get
you<00:00:20.340> some<00:00:20.609> details<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.560> so<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.740> guy<00:00:23.039> is

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
you some details on this so this guy is

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.839 
you some details on this so this guy is
very<00:00:23.730> similar<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.480> Anakin<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.519> as<00:00:26.519> far<00:00:26.730> as

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
very similar to the Anakin one as far as

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.650 
very similar to the Anakin one as far as
design<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.240> concerned<00:00:27.449> any<00:00:28.230> fan<00:00:29.010> knows<00:00:29.310> that

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
design is concerned any fan knows that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.820 
design is concerned any fan knows that
they<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.929> these<00:00:31.080> ridges<00:00:31.289> here<00:00:31.650> that

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
they do have these ridges here that

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.180 
they do have these ridges here that
differs<00:00:32.189> from<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.880> does<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:34.190> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
differs from it but it does have the the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.510 
differs from it but it does have the the
pseudo<00:00:35.579> rubber<00:00:36.230> kind<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.410> hand<00:00:37.860> grip<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.340> is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
pseudo rubber kind of hand grip this is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.180 
pseudo rubber kind of hand grip this is
plastic<00:00:38.940> obviously<00:00:39.649> it<00:00:40.649> does<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> same

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
plastic obviously it does have the same

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.420 
plastic obviously it does have the same
shine<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> other<00:00:42.989> sabers<00:00:43.559> something

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
shine as with the other sabers something

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.860 
shine as with the other sabers something
I<00:00:44.489> forgot<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> mention<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> other<00:00:45.539> ones

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I forgot to mention with the other ones

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.680 
I forgot to mention with the other ones
you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:46.890> tell<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.640> they<00:00:47.969> glued<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> pieces

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
you can tell that they glued the pieces

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.410 
you can tell that they glued the pieces
together<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.760> similar<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> ultimate

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
together here similar to the ultimate

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.100 
together here similar to the ultimate
effects<00:00:51.780> which<00:00:52.140> kind<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.770> takes<00:00:52.949> away<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
effects which kind of takes away the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.619 
effects which kind of takes away the
authenticity<00:00:55.110> obviously<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.579> mean<00:00:57.420> it's

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
authenticity obviously but I mean it's

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.830 
authenticity obviously but I mean it's
the<00:00:57.899> best<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:59.129> ten<00:00:59.340> dollar

and you can use this saber for fighting

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.780 
and you can use this saber for fighting
and<00:01:27.979> that's<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.729> just

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and that's what I like to do just

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.359 
and that's what I like to do just
practice<00:01:30.329> with<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.560> has<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.770> Bell<00:01:32.100> took

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
practice with it has this Bell took

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.109 
practice with it has this Bell took
because<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.680> original<00:01:34.680> trilogy<00:01:35.280> has<00:01:35.850> these

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
because the original trilogy has these

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.609 
because the original trilogy has these
kind<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.509> bell<00:01:36.689> hooks<00:01:36.869> instead<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> ones

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
kind of bell hooks instead of the ones

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.679 
kind of bell hooks instead of the ones
that<00:01:37.770> snap<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.909> know<00:01:38.970> what<00:01:39.180> I'm<00:01:39.270> talking

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
that snap you know what I'm talking

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.520 
that snap you know what I'm talking
about<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:41.810> also<00:01:42.810> has<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> caution<00:01:43.649> tape<00:01:43.680> here

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
about so also has the caution tape here

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.200 
about so also has the caution tape here
but<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:46.979> connects<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.909> belt<00:01:48.090> hook

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
but this one connects like the belt hook

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.910 
but this one connects like the belt hook
to<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.689> would<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:48.869> been<00:01:49.110> cool<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:49.710> had

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
to it would have been cool if they had

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.100 
to it would have been cool if they had
some<00:01:50.220> kind<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.700> mechanism<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.630> make<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.990> more

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
some kind of mechanism to make it more

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.770 
some kind of mechanism to make it more
authentic<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.890> wouldn't<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.780> but

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
authentic so we wouldn't have this but

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810 
authentic so we wouldn't have this but
it's<00:01:55.259> okay<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.920> kind<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.219> concealed<00:01:56.610> when

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
it's okay it's kind of concealed when

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.700 
it's okay it's kind of concealed when
you<00:01:56.939> put<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.390> your<00:01:57.570> waist<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.140> I'll<00:01:58.560> show

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
you put it on your waist and I'll show

color
to<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:15.350> if<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.470> forgot<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.980> mention<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.880> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
to it if I forgot to mention with the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.390 
to it if I forgot to mention with the
other<00:02:18.330> Sabres<00:02:18.840> none<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.890> them<00:02:20.040> are<00:02:20.220> really

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
other Sabres none of them are really

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.720 
other Sabres none of them are really
like<00:02:21.390> completely<00:02:21.990> straight<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:23.400> might<00:02:23.610> be

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
like completely straight this might be

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.040 
like completely straight this might be
just<00:02:23.970> my<00:02:24.090> OCD<00:02:24.600> but<00:02:24.950> they're<00:02:25.950> kind<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.400> been

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
just my OCD but they're kind of been

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.350 
just my OCD but they're kind of been
bent<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.350> like<00:02:28.710> if<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.220> go<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.640> store<00:02:29.940> all

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
bent and like if you go to the store all

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.630 
bent and like if you go to the store all
of<00:02:30.420> them<00:02:30.750> are<00:02:30.900> like<00:02:30.990> that<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.560> that's<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.370> one

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
of them are like that so that's like one

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.100 
of them are like that so that's like one
complaint<00:02:33.120> also<00:02:35.390> but<00:02:36.390> yeah<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.570> do<00:02:36.750> like<00:02:36.990> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
complaint also but yeah I do like the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.620 
complaint also but yeah I do like the
colors<00:02:37.410> on<00:02:37.530> all<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.800> Sabres<00:02:38.280> if<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.450> play

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
colors on all the Sabres if you play

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.090 
colors on all the Sabres if you play
around<00:02:39.870> with<00:02:40.020> them<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.470> don't<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.860> worry

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
around with them you don't have to worry

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.950 
around with them you don't have to worry
about<00:02:41.280> like<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.030> paint<00:02:42.270> coming<00:02:42.480> off<00:02:42.720> unless

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
about like the paint coming off unless

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.290 
about like the paint coming off unless
you<00:02:43.260> really<00:02:43.470> go<00:02:43.740> at<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:43.950> but<00:02:44.880> if<00:02:45.030> you're<00:02:45.150> just

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
you really go at it but if you're just

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.080 
you really go at it but if you're just
playing<00:02:45.570> around<00:02:45.720> shouldn't<00:02:46.650> be<00:02:46.740> too<00:02:46.890> bad<00:02:47.040> as<00:02:47.970> I

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
playing around shouldn't be too bad as I

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.360 
playing around shouldn't be too bad as I
said<00:02:48.300> earlier<00:02:48.690> it's<00:02:49.110> similar<00:02:49.710> length<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
said earlier it's similar length to the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.910 
said earlier it's similar length to the
ultimate<00:02:50.760> effects<00:02:51.120> as<00:02:51.900> far<00:02:52.140> as<00:02:52.230> hilt<00:02:52.470> size<00:02:52.680> go

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
ultimate effects as far as hilt size go

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.850 
ultimate effects as far as hilt size go
which<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.190> didn't<00:02:53.400> really<00:02:53.490> get<00:02:53.670> into<00:02:54.710> it<00:02:55.710> could

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
which I didn't really get into it could

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.190 
which I didn't really get into it could
just<00:02:56.070> be<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.400> design<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.030> Darth<00:02:57.270> Maul<00:02:57.930> one

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
just be the design of the Darth Maul one

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
just be the design of the Darth Maul one
but<00:02:58.530> these<00:02:59.190> are<00:02:59.460> a<00:02:59.490> bit<00:02:59.790> shorter<00:03:00.710> as<00:03:01.710> far<00:03:02.040> as

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
but these are a bit shorter as far as

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.390 
but these are a bit shorter as far as
the<00:03:02.400> hand<00:03:02.670> grip<00:03:02.910> these<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.320> forgot<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.100> mention

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
the hand grip these I forgot to mention

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.720 
the hand grip these I forgot to mention
this<00:03:05.670> too<00:03:05.910> but<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:06.750> more<00:03:06.930> authentic<00:03:07.730> it's

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
this too but this is more authentic it's

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.490 
this too but this is more authentic it's
supposed<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.060> be<00:03:09.210> this<00:03:09.360> small<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:09.870> far<00:03:10.140> as<00:03:10.290> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
supposed to be this small as far as the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.830 
supposed to be this small as far as the
width<00:03:10.740> of<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.040> hilt<00:03:11.280> or<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.180> diameter<00:03:12.540> of

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
width of the hilt or that diameter of

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.640 
width of the hilt or that diameter of
the<00:03:12.930> hill<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.590> speak<00:03:15.050> these<00:03:16.050> do<00:03:16.350> feel

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
the hill so to speak these do feel

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.340 
the hill so to speak these do feel
really<00:03:16.950> nice<00:03:17.160> when<00:03:17.700> you're<00:03:17.850> holding<00:03:18.209> them<00:03:18.390> so

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
really nice when you're holding them so

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.470 
really nice when you're holding them so
that's<00:03:19.770> another<00:03:20.130> incentive<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.910> buying<00:03:21.180> it

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
that's another incentive to buying it

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.750 
that's another incentive to buying it
well<00:03:22.290> that's<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.709> for<00:03:22.890> my<00:03:23.010> basic<00:03:23.220> lightsaber

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
well that's it for my basic lightsaber

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.460 
well that's it for my basic lightsaber
