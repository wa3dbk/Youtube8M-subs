00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
about what we've installed here this is

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.290 
about what we've installed here this is
our<00:00:43.890> garden<00:00:44.100> mulch<00:00:44.370> compost<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.180> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
our garden mulch compost it's a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
that comes into our yard debris

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.740 
that comes into our yard debris
recycling<00:00:53.760> centers<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.240> it's<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.480> little<00:00:54.630> more

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
recycling centers so it's a little more

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.540 
recycling centers so it's a little more
nutritious<00:00:55.440> better<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.070> plants<00:00:56.400> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
nutritious better for your plants and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.370 
nutritious better for your plants and
soils<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:56.940> maybe<00:00:57.150> a<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.570> traditional<00:00:57.780> bark

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
soils and maybe a more traditional bark

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.190 
soils and maybe a more traditional bark
dust<00:00:58.650> which<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.610> tendency<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.150> use<00:01:00.450> a<00:01:00.480> pull

been real prevalent there's lots of it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.899 
been real prevalent there's lots of it
in<00:01:13.619> our<00:01:13.740> area<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.130> has<00:01:14.310> been<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> past

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
in our area or has been in the past

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.580 
in our area or has been in the past
things<00:01:15.720> are<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.899> little<00:01:16.020> different<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.530> year

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
things are a little different this year

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.190 
things are a little different this year
there's<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.490> mills<00:01:17.729> are<00:01:17.969> down<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.719> housings

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
there's the mills are down the housings

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.379 
there's the mills are down the housings
slowed<00:01:20.069> down<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.549> there's<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> lot<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.149> bark

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:21.389 
slowed down so there's not a lot of bark

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:22.520 
slowed down so there's not a lot of bark
dust<00:01:21.569> around<00:01:21.899> this<00:01:21.990> year<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.350> gonna<00:01:22.439> be

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
dust around this year and it's gonna be

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
dust around this year and it's gonna be
really<00:01:22.679> hard<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> find<00:01:23.100> these<00:01:23.429> fresher<00:01:23.759> more

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
really hard to find these fresher more

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.999 
really hard to find these fresher more
traditional<00:01:24.840> bark<00:01:25.079> dust<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.649> it<00:01:25.740> might<00:01:25.859> be<00:01:25.920> a

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
traditional bark dust so it might be a

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.139 
traditional bark dust so it might be a
good<00:01:26.159> idea<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:26.700> about<00:01:26.909> something

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
good idea to think about something

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.730 
good idea to think about something
different<00:01:27.420> than<00:01:27.810> that's<00:01:28.109> more<00:01:28.319> available

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
different than that's more available

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.919 
different than that's more available
yeah<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.999> garden<00:01:30.270> mulch<00:01:30.389> is<00:01:30.539> a<00:01:30.569> good<00:01:30.749> way

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
yeah and the garden mulch is a good way

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:31.429 
yeah and the garden mulch is a good way
to<00:01:30.990> go

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
to go

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.469 
to go
and<00:01:31.859> now<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.249> one<00:01:32.459> looks<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.909> little<00:01:33.060> bit<00:01:33.329> more

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
and now this one looks a little bit more

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.910 
and now this one looks a little bit more
stringy<00:01:33.929> it's<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.319> little<00:01:34.560> bit<00:01:34.679> lighter

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
stringy it's a little bit lighter

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.010 
stringy it's a little bit lighter
looking<00:01:35.399> what<00:01:35.579> kind<00:01:35.789> of<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.060> well<00:01:36.749> this<00:01:36.899> is

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
looking what kind of this well this is

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.169 
looking what kind of this well this is
our<00:01:37.200> hemlock<00:01:37.770> bark<00:01:38.009> dust<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.490> fresh<00:01:38.759> hemlock

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.590 
bark dust the advantage of the hemlock
is<00:01:41.279> it<00:01:41.429> doesn't<00:01:41.609> have<00:01:41.729> slivers<00:01:42.179> like<00:01:42.359> you<00:01:42.450> get

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
is it doesn't have slivers like you get

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.149 
is it doesn't have slivers like you get
from<00:01:42.749> the<00:01:42.869> fir<00:01:43.049> bark<00:01:43.319> dust<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.770> people<00:01:44.069> with

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
from the fir bark dust so people with

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.069 
from the fir bark dust so people with
kids<00:01:44.429> or<00:01:44.670> people<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.299> work<00:01:46.020> with

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
kids or people that like to work with

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.739 
kids or people that like to work with
the<00:01:46.490> garden<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.579> their<00:01:47.729> hands<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.029> lot<00:01:48.179> have<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749 
the garden with their hands a lot have a

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:51.980 
the garden with their hands a lot have a
tendency<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.200> go<00:01:49.469> with<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.179> hemlocks<00:01:51.179> this<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
tendency to go with the hemlocks this is

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.840 
tendency to go with the hemlocks this is
the<00:01:52.109> coarse<00:01:52.350> hemlock<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:53.340> kind<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.670> hard<00:01:53.819> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the coarse hemlock it's kind of hard to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.730 
the coarse hemlock it's kind of hard to
come<00:01:53.999> by<00:01:54.179> also<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.810> more<00:01:54.959> for<00:01:55.139> pathways<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
come by also it's more for pathways and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.169 
come by also it's more for pathways and
stuff<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.069> that<00:01:56.279> although<00:01:56.459> some<00:01:56.789> people<00:01:56.909> do

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
stuff like that although some people do

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.539 
stuff like that although some people do
use<00:01:57.359> it<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.630> ground<00:01:57.810> cover<00:01:57.990> okay<00:01:58.709> and<00:01:59.159> then

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
use it for ground cover okay and then

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.879 
use it for ground cover okay and then
you're<00:01:59.700> kind<00:01:59.849> of<00:01:59.969> going<00:02:00.149> into<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.659> more<00:02:01.020> broken

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:01.889 
you're kind of going into a more broken

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.859 
you're kind of going into a more broken
down<00:02:02.069> one<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:02.939> yeah<00:02:03.539> these<00:02:03.689> are

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
down one like this one yeah these are

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.440 
down one like this one yeah these are
the<00:02:03.959> aged<00:02:04.079> barked<00:02:04.649> us<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.219> that's<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.240> aged

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the aged barked us and that's the aged

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.870 
the aged barked us and that's the aged
hemlock<00:02:06.990> bark<00:02:07.259> dust<00:02:07.590> same<00:02:08.399> thing<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:08.729> this

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
hemlock bark dust same thing as this

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.279 
hemlock bark dust same thing as this
it's<00:02:09.149> just<00:02:09.270> been<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.599> stockpile<00:02:10.050> for<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
it's just been in the stockpile for a

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.170 
it's just been in the stockpile for a
little<00:02:10.470> while<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:10.920> turned<00:02:11.099> dark<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.060> we

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
little while so it's turned dark so we

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.089 
little while so it's turned dark so we
have<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> aged<00:02:12.650> hemlocks<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.920> same<00:02:14.069> thing

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
have the aged hemlocks and same thing

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.949 
have the aged hemlocks and same thing
with<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> firs<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.970> aged<00:02:15.120> firs<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.480> then<00:02:15.870> you

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
with the firs the aged firs and then you

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.420 
with the firs the aged firs and then you
can<00:02:16.080> get<00:02:16.170> them<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.410> fine<00:02:16.620> grind<00:02:17.010> or<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
can get them in a fine grind or the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.869 
can get them in a fine grind or the
medium<00:02:17.760> grinds<00:02:18.030> okay<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:18.959> know<00:02:19.140> marked

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
medium grinds okay so I know marked

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.370 
medium grinds okay so I know marked
established<00:02:20.879> garden<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.299> would<00:02:21.420> use<00:02:21.569> these

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
established garden you would use these

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.590 
established garden you would use these
wouldn't<00:02:22.650> pull<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.830> nitrogen<00:02:23.520> as<00:02:23.730> much<00:02:23.970> yeah

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
wouldn't pull the nitrogen as much yeah

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.350 
wouldn't pull the nitrogen as much yeah
you<00:02:25.020> can<00:02:25.200> use<00:02:25.350> them<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.670> got<00:02:26.850> if<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.120> love

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
you can use them if you got if you love

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.270 
you can use them if you got if you love
that<00:02:27.510> red<00:02:27.720> look<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.110> kind<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.800> stuck<00:02:29.010> with<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
that red look you kind of stuck with the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.000 
that red look you kind of stuck with the
fresh<00:02:29.520> hemlock<00:02:30.360> or<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.600> FIR<00:02:30.810> right<00:02:31.410> but<00:02:31.740> it

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
fresh hemlock or the FIR right but it

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.470 
fresh hemlock or the FIR right but it
seems<00:02:32.280> like<00:02:32.370> conditions<00:02:33.000> are<00:02:33.150> going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.390> be

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
seems like conditions are going to be

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.720 
seems like conditions are going to be
maybe<00:02:33.810> pulling<00:02:34.230> us<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> different<00:02:35.070> kind<00:02:35.610> of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
maybe pulling us to a different kind of

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.820 
maybe pulling us to a different kind of
texture<00:02:36.150> now<00:02:36.360> yeah<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.440> next<00:02:37.530> year<00:02:37.800> or

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
texture now yeah for the next year or

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.860 
texture now yeah for the next year or
two<00:02:37.890> US<00:02:38.400> housing<00:02:38.640> shortage<00:02:39.210> in<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> mill

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
two US housing shortage in the mill

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.200 
two US housing shortage in the mill
shutdowns<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:41.400> gonna<00:02:41.520> be<00:02:41.670> hard<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:41.970> find

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
shutdowns it's gonna be hard to find

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.370 
shutdowns it's gonna be hard to find
these<00:02:42.330> materials<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:42.960> people<00:02:43.110> are<00:02:43.290> gonna

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
these materials and people are gonna

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.320 
these materials and people are gonna
have<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.680> tendency<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.820> gravitate

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
have a tendency to have to gravitate

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.030 
have a tendency to have to gravitate
towards<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.720> darker<00:02:46.110> products<00:02:46.620> either<00:02:46.830> the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
towards the darker products either the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.670 
towards the darker products either the
stockpiled<00:02:47.670> stuff<00:02:48.290> overstock<00:02:49.290> for<00:02:49.500> prior

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
stockpiled stuff overstock for prior

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.070 
stockpiled stuff overstock for prior
years<00:02:49.710> or<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.400> compost<00:02:50.880> well<00:02:51.570> but<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.810> think<00:02:51.870> a

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
years or the compost well but I think a

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.780 
years or the compost well but I think a
compost<00:02:52.560> might<00:02:52.710> be<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.860> good<00:02:53.040> way<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.190> go<00:02:53.460> it's

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
compost might be a good way to go it's

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.970 
compost might be a good way to go it's
gonna<00:02:53.940> add<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.420> much<00:02:54.510> more<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:55.170> your<00:02:55.290> soils<00:02:55.710> in

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
gonna add so much more to your soils in

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.860 
gonna add so much more to your soils in
your<00:02:56.100> soil<00:02:56.310> structure<00:02:56.760> certainly<00:02:57.330> yeah<00:02:57.540> it's

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
your soil structure certainly yeah it's

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.140 
your soil structure certainly yeah it's
composters<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.010> way<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.190> go<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.670> that<00:03:00.030> way

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
composters is the way to go and that way

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.700 
composters is the way to go and that way
we<00:03:00.270> close<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.690> loop<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.020> bring<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.350> your<00:03:01.470> yard

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
we close the loop you bring in your yard

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.860 
we close the loop you bring in your yard
debris<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.160> one<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.460> our<00:03:02.550> locations<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.360> we'll

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
debris to one of our locations and we'll

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.140 
debris to one of our locations and we'll
compost<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.650> bring<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.070> back<00:03:05.100> out<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:06.090> you

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
compost it and bring it back out so you

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.180 
compost it and bring it back out so you
just<00:03:06.270> um<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.990> bring<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.590> one<00:03:07.770> year<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.130> the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
just um you bring it in one year and the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.680 
just um you bring it in one year and the
next<00:03:08.340> year<00:03:08.460> you<00:03:08.550> bring<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.910> back<00:03:09.060> yeah<00:03:09.420> pretty

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
next year you bring it back yeah pretty

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.580 
next year you bring it back yeah pretty
