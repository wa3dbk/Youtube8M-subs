00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
looks like a standard end repro pretty

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.090 
looks like a standard end repro pretty
much<00:02:49.569> and<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:52.180> buckets<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:53.319> gems<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.950> stuff

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
much and the buckets the gems and stuff

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.580 
much and the buckets the gems and stuff
like<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.330> look<00:02:55.330> pretty<00:02:55.569> much<00:02:55.720> standard<00:02:56.110> so

now<00:02:56.709> i'm<00:02:56.799> going<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:56.980> show<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.250> particles

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
now i'm going to show you the particles

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.039 
now i'm going to show you the particles
first<00:02:58.030> i'm<00:02:58.209> going<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.450> start<00:02:58.630> with<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.900> like

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
first i'm going to start with the like

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.330 
first i'm going to start with the like
Pope<00:02:59.319> article<00:03:01.620> as<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.709> can<00:03:02.799> see<00:03:02.980> it's<00:03:03.130> kind<00:03:03.280> of

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
Pope article as you can see it's kind of

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.340 
Pope article as you can see it's kind of
a<00:03:03.430> scatter<00:03:03.700> reddish<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.420> don't<00:03:05.019> really<00:03:05.170> know

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
a scatter reddish I don't really know

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.170 
a scatter reddish I don't really know
any<00:03:05.530> other<00:03:05.680> text<00:03:06.430> practic<00:03:06.760> uses<00:03:07.060> these

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
any other text practic uses these

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.840 
any other text practic uses these
particles<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:08.470> they're<00:03:08.680> pretty<00:03:08.950> unique<00:03:09.310> at

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
particles so they're pretty unique at

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.030 
particles so they're pretty unique at
least<00:03:10.060> most<00:03:10.269> of<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.510> particles<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.890> our

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
least most of the particles so our

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.750 
least most of the particles so our
carrier<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.760> hit<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.180> it'll<00:03:14.019> go<00:03:14.109> nice<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.760> next

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
carrier to hit it it'll go nice and next

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.330 
carrier to hit it it'll go nice and next
up<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.359> sword<00:03:16.750> particles<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:20.340> create

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
up is the sword particles and create

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:35.809 
up is the sword particles and create
particles

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.119 

and<00:03:36.019> next<00:03:37.019> up<00:03:37.200> we<00:03:37.409> have<00:03:37.439> the<00:03:37.620> lava<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.549> water

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
and next up we have the lava and water

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.729 
and next up we have the lava and water
lava<00:03:41.129> particles<00:03:41.579> look<00:03:41.819> really<00:03:42.090> nice<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.739> the

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
lava particles look really nice and the

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.020 
lava particles look really nice and the
water<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:44.069> clear<00:03:44.489> when<00:03:44.639> you're<00:03:44.760> underwater
