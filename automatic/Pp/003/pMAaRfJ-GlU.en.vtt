 left to do and it's work and 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:00.289
 it's over a quick 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.079
 he hit cold well and split 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:09.409
 with a beautiful right and has nothing to say 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.869

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.690
 who had even been slightly hurt he 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.399
 rang and you know they expected 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.950
 not and on who came from a lace of a 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.530
 great rozoy way is unfortunately not 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.750
 can not judge progress and 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.789
 adaptation work quickly handing over to 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.159
 julien lorcy in the ranks 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.350

 demonstrates there is good it is it is 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.850
 always clear-eyed lucid and 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.550
 that he is effective when he touched 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.190
 it's like he did in this 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.390
 first to the boys he had been less 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.830
 fast during his last fight 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.119
 it was facing jean michel mill he 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.970
 had been developed 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.060
 well, it's a win by ko 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.289
 in the first recovery after less 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.229
 about twenty seconds 7 expeditious 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.739
 and Julien lorcy wins his 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.190
 third success among professionals 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:07.620
 we are waiting for him 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.900
 for next fight ram it's true but 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.180
 what brings you know that the boy 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.980
 cheerfulness in front of him it's on pale masts 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.630
 future world champion that we are 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.300
 completely certain but it's a 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.810
 boy who had been fighting in 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.430
 independent she already had a lot 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:29.490
 and sells there we did not see anything but 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.410
 again watch this change cold 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.960
 that's the work that goes back to 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.870
 phase he touched the body also 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.620
 that's why his opponent had 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.620
 struggling to get up 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.260
 and here it is and so the victory of 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.260
 julien lorcy 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.630
 and after this success, we go right away 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.390
