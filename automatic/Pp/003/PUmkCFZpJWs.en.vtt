that that ability there if people lack
grip<00:01:44.370> risk<00:01:44.700> flexibility<00:01:45.420> or<00:01:45.630> they<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:46.020> just

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
grip risk flexibility or they have just

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.609 
grip risk flexibility or they have just
kind<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:47.060> different<00:01:48.060> structural<00:01:48.960> lengths<00:01:49.470> of

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
kind of different structural lengths of

the<00:01:49.740> humerus<00:01:50.130> versus<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> ulna<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:50.910> radius

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the humerus versus the ulna and radius

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.140 
the humerus versus the ulna and radius
they<00:01:51.930> may<00:01:52.200> need<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.770> use<00:01:52.800> scratch<00:01:53.550> or<00:01:53.940> they<00:01:54.030> may

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
they may need to use scratch or they may

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.060

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
be spines grafts more uncomfortable and

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.550 
be spines grafts more uncomfortable and
so<00:01:56.160> it<00:01:56.250> all<00:01:56.369> turned<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.970> clean<00:01:57.240> grip<00:01:57.560> is

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
so it all turned up to the clean grip is

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.730 
so it all turned up to the clean grip is
to<00:01:59.040> use<00:02:00.000> scraps<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.259> can<00:02:01.440> do<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.649> can
