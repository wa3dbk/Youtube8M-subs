the car in the beginning of the race I

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.830 
the car in the beginning of the race I
had<00:06:14.770> a<00:06:14.800> car<00:06:15.039> that<00:06:15.070> was<00:06:15.400> almost<00:06:15.970> impossible<00:06:16.750> to

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
had a car that was almost impossible to

turn<00:06:17.020> it<00:06:17.229> was<00:06:17.320> just<00:06:17.470> going<00:06:17.650> straight<00:06:17.889> on

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
turn it was just going straight on

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.300 
turn it was just going straight on
everywhere<00:06:18.460> but<00:06:19.409> if<00:06:20.409> the<00:06:20.560> race<00:06:20.710> came<00:06:20.919> to<00:06:21.070> me<00:06:21.190> as

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
everywhere but if the race came to me as

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.680 
everywhere but if the race came to me as
I<00:06:21.460> said<00:06:21.669> it<00:06:21.789> would<00:06:21.880> we<00:06:22.030> had<00:06:22.120> a<00:06:22.150> big<00:06:22.330> problem

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
I said it would we had a big problem

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.879 
I said it would we had a big problem
because<00:06:22.750> we<00:06:22.990> didn't<00:06:23.169> have<00:06:23.260> a<00:06:23.289> radio<00:06:23.620> on<00:06:23.680> the

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
because we didn't have a radio on the

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:25.950 
because we didn't have a radio on the
race<00:06:24.039> so<00:06:24.220> I<00:06:24.250> could<00:06:24.460> not<00:06:24.639> call<00:06:24.880> in<00:06:25.150> but<00:06:25.659> we<00:06:25.810> had

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960
