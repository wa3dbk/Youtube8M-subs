00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.100 
doing the buns if my I have attempted to
twist<00:02:50.770> out<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.280> twist<00:02:51.520> out<00:02:51.700> didn't<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.990> know

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
twist out and twist out didn't you know

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.050 
twist out and twist out didn't you know
cooperate<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.220> look<00:02:54.550> good<00:02:56.100> then<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.640> would

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
cooperate and it look good then I would

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.190 
cooperate and it look good then I would
just<00:02:58.230> default<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.560> barn<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:01.330> hopefully<00:03:01.780> I

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
just default to a barn so hopefully I

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.110 
just default to a barn so hopefully I
think<00:03:02.530> with<00:03:03.130> this<00:03:03.280> like<00:03:03.460> that<00:03:03.610> so<00:03:03.880> we'll<00:03:04.030> be

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
think with this like that so we'll be

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:16.660 
think with this like that so we'll be
able<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:05.460> get<00:03:06.460> up<00:03:06.580> on<00:03:06.730> top<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.240> it

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:04:47.129 

you<00:03:17.209> can<00:03:17.330> also<00:03:17.510> like<00:03:17.840> kind<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:19.150> feel

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.210 

and<00:04:47.259> here's<00:04:48.250> my<00:04:48.400> texture<00:04:48.789> guys<00:04:50.159> well<00:04:51.159> of

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
and here's my texture guys well of

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.110 
and here's my texture guys well of
course<00:04:51.280> they'll<00:04:51.639> fight<00:04:51.789> a<00:04:51.819> little<00:04:52.000> bit

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
course they'll fight a little bit

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.629 
course they'll fight a little bit
different<00:04:52.569> because<00:04:52.689> I've<00:04:53.110> had<00:04:53.560> these<00:04:53.800> twists

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
different because I've had these twists

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:00.420 
different because I've had these twists
but<00:04:56.280> pretty<00:04:57.280> much<00:04:58.409> what<00:04:59.409> it<00:04:59.530> looks<00:04:59.710> like<00:04:59.979> I'll

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
but pretty much what it looks like I'll

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.730 
but pretty much what it looks like I'll
have<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.699> do<00:05:01.030> it<00:05:01.270> one<00:05:01.900> I'll<00:05:02.199> do<00:05:02.379> one<00:05:02.560> like

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
have to do it one I'll do one like

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.499 
have to do it one I'll do one like
southern<00:05:03.189> white<00:05:03.400> with<00:05:03.699> no<00:05:03.819> product<00:05:04.120> is<00:05:04.389> right

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
southern white with no product is right

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.969 
southern white with no product is right
now<00:05:04.659> I've<00:05:04.840> done<00:05:05.080> I've<00:05:05.349> put<00:05:05.710> a<00:05:06.840> leave-in<00:05:07.840> in<00:05:08.409> it

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979
