couple or I got that time so you go and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.219 
couple or I got that time so you go and
find<00:01:48.869> some<00:01:49.110> other<00:01:49.259> couple<00:01:49.619> somewhere<00:01:50.310> else

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
find some other couple somewhere else

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.510 
find some other couple somewhere else
they<00:01:52.229> should<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.590> some<00:01:52.799> more<00:01:53.009> around<00:01:53.220> here

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
they should be some more around here

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.510 
they should be some more around here
think<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:56.570> then<00:01:57.570> once<00:01:58.409> you've<00:01:58.530> got<00:01:58.619> about<00:01:58.799> 20

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
think and then once you've got about 20

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.910 
think and then once you've got about 20
copper<00:01:59.820> ore<00:01:59.969> because<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.259> only<00:02:01.380> show<00:02:01.560> 20

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
copper ore because you can only show 20

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.580 
copper ore because you can only show 20
copper<00:02:02.100> all<00:02:02.310> at<00:02:03.210> once<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.909> auction<00:02:06.270> market

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.400 
copper all at once on the auction market
so<00:02:07.759> obviously<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.270> more<00:02:09.450> than<00:02:09.690> one

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
so obviously you can do more than one

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.880 
so obviously you can do more than one
bit<00:02:10.679> at<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.830> time<00:02:10.860> but

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
