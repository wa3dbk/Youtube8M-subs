00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.160
 I do here we are seeing 

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.800
 that over the years we talked about millions of years nature has been 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.970
 very wise 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.670
 have we have some endemic species in this area we have a climate 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.699
 we have a whole orography 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.289
 that through the millions of years has been conformed 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.960
 and in a few years 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.359
 of what the activity has been 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.769
 anthropological that is the human being when we start in two destroyed 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:25.220
 and here we are seeing 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.950
 We may have generated some works to address genetic issues 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.609
 through this organism 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.040
 of motorcycles that we are doing 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.060
 the drainages and we are destroying everything assist them 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.240
 if we want to make a good exploitation of that 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.700
 we can use sericulture we can use it 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.420
 a series of elements the fight we will not have to debate culture polo type 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.170
 of elements that I had made 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.610
 to make a complete study of the species maintain a natural sanctuary 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.520
 because the climate puteadas account then it is very different city and we are alone 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.800
 leisure of the city 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.120
 but the problem is the aggression that we are giving him instead of ferrero 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.100
 One element that is called sustainable development 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.930
 with which it would be a good place to come what would happen if his favor 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.760
 for crystalline as it happens in many parts of the world 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.570
 we have here we are seeing an outdoor auction 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.570
 we are the only city 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.300
 the main cities of the world have their rivers tenacity 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.550
 when they were together - at a certain moment 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.680
 but they rescued him and here not here what we are doing 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.160
 the simplicity of concentrating everything 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.390
 all this waste through the aquifer 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.660
 ferrer we talk about the barbarians in a time of history 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.660
 and that barbarian who urinated in the river 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.190
 because it is polluting the principle of life to want it 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.360
 this logically 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.690
 there may be some difficulties to perform the work 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.360
 However, the technical capacity is beyond doubt if possible 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.420
 build the archdeacon dam 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.700
 very varied 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.570
 geology studies 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.340
 hydrology studies 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.400
 economic studies and social studies 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 all of them percent and made by specialists 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.089
 what in quito and caron this place 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:10.159
 with mou 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.739
 the most suitable 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.529
 the most convenient where there is the greatest availability of water 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.569
 where there are better logical conditions 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.099
 No interest or skill 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.180
 that allow to guarantee I requested a good water storage for guadalajara 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.519
 and regularize well 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.669
 the flow of the green river that its flow 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:36.189
 that's why rainy weather you have to be crazy to make it useless 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.769
 also of the dry season 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.019
 such geological studies have been made 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.629
 geological studies dresses are certain favorable way with certain 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.799
 recommendations if there are failures if that fails they can be dropped 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.559
 if there is permeabilizar arabs to the ceremony and Peru permeable and also 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:56.769
 you can solve those permeability of a short stretch like that would be this 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.869
 but technically if the long work is feasible 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.989
 it's not the best place in probably many other places that have not been 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.829
 studied in detail how I say in this stretch of about 35 kilometers waters 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.829
 up to get to kartika practically buzzi biolcati 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:15.599
 there the river grows but without 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.769
 many courteous many sections where you could take advantage 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:23.079
 and yes I logically think it was and good conditions 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.670
 It is not convincing to talk about new points of water supply for 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.099
 a performance 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.459
 without taking into account the factors of care and use of it 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.609
 The levels of leakage losses in our country are of the order of 40% 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.609
 while in developed countries they range between 8 and 10% 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.909
 in the metropolitan area 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.680
 it happened for about four months to a year and it was squandered 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.819
 the construction of the dam will not allow points per game 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:57.799
 what will happen then we start as a cover that year 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.129
 together with a court or in austria 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:05.879
 yes, not everything is pending 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.199
 of all 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.489
 not only of the governmental authorities fundamentally of the 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.199
 society of citizens 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:16.099
 who use it let me give you in regards to this 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.639
 the concept of losses in the network 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.139
 there is no system in the world even in developed countries where 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.759
 losses are less than 20 percent 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.759
 we are on the order of 40, which is double 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.860
 percent 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.669
 if we can 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.289
 get down 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.879
 those losses from 40 to 20 ' 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.879
 we would be saving two cubic meters per second 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.629
 with those two cubic meters per second we can not even attend to the 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.400
 deficit that we already have 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.860
 - so 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.360
 stop extracting the chapala water that is part of the long-term objectives 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.300
 that chase arcediano and we would not be having water for the 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.469
 increase 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:01.569
 current and future of Guadalajara 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.800
 This is a subject that must be addressed 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.099
 it is a subject that must be resolved 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.849
 and what to do that reduction 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.409
 of 20 from 40 to 20 percent the losses demand an investment of 5 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:14.889
 one billion pesos in the network
