this<00:00:00.539> Mercedes<00:00:01.020> 300d<00:00:01.500> come<00:00:01.890> in<00:00:02.070> with<00:00:02.280> the

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:03.319 
this Mercedes 300d come in with the

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.950 
this Mercedes 300d come in with the
coolant<00:00:04.319> hose<00:00:04.700> broken<00:00:05.700> leaking<00:00:06.660> coolant<00:00:08.960> so

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
coolant hose broken leaking coolant so

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.339 
coolant hose broken leaking coolant so
what<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.290> found<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:11.160> up<00:00:11.460> here<00:00:12.139> inside<00:00:13.139> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
what we found is up here inside the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.650 
what we found is up here inside the
brake<00:00:13.559> booster<00:00:13.820> there's<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.940> plastic<00:00:15.210> live

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
brake booster there's a plastic live

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.660 
brake booster there's a plastic live
pipe<00:00:16.340> this<00:00:17.340> goes<00:00:19.010> to<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.100> heater<00:00:20.279> core<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
pipe this goes to the heater core of the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.189 
pipe this goes to the heater core of the
car<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.150> goes<00:00:21.359> out<00:00:21.570> here<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.869> cylinder

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
car this goes out here to the cylinder

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.439 
car this goes out here to the cylinder
head<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.560> then<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.800> see<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.130> other<00:00:23.449> port

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
head and then you see this other port

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.570 
head and then you see this other port
off<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.529> bottom<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.010> runs<00:00:28.279> runs<00:00:29.279> over<00:00:29.550> to

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
off the bottom that runs runs over to

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.400 
off the bottom that runs runs over to
exit<00:00:30.330> water<00:00:30.630> pump<00:00:30.869> which<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> other

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
exit water pump which is on the other

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.490 
exit water pump which is on the other
side<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> car<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.360> anyway<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:34.110> reattach

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
side of the car so anyway we reattach

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.000 
side of the car so anyway we reattach
this<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.890> was<00:00:35.010> here<00:00:36.170> that<00:00:37.170> was<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.829> main

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
this I was here that was the the main

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.319 
this I was here that was the the main
culprit<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.640> was<00:00:38.760> course<00:00:39.000> leaking

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
culprit and it was course leaking

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.729 
culprit and it was course leaking
coolant<00:00:39.510> all<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.079> area<00:00:40.410> around<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
coolant all in this area around the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.310 
coolant all in this area around the
brake<00:00:40.890> booster<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.390> what<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.660> found<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.110> once

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
brake booster so what we found is once

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.139 
brake booster so what we found is once
we've<00:00:43.440> got<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.739> together<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.399> got<00:00:45.000> that

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
we've got this together I got that

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.410 
we've got this together I got that
repaired<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:47.010> car<00:00:47.190> was<00:00:47.370> still<00:00:47.550> overheating

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
repaired the car was still overheating

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.209 
repaired the car was still overheating
like<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.260> was<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.590> way<00:00:49.800> too<00:00:49.860> warm

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
like it was it was going way too warm

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.970 
like it was it was going way too warm
especially<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> a/c<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.590> so<00:00:52.590> here's<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
especially with the a/c on so here's the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.340 
especially with the a/c on so here's the
fuse<00:00:53.190> box<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:55.219> we<00:00:56.219> remove<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:57.109> filled<00:00:58.109> box

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
fuse box here we remove this filled box

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.290 
fuse box here we remove this filled box
cover<00:00:58.649> there's<00:00:59.190> another<00:00:59.430> cover<00:00:59.730> we<00:01:00.059> remove

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
cover there's another cover we remove

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.819 
cover there's another cover we remove
this<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.690> well<00:01:00.840> there's<00:01:01.109> more<00:01:01.289> relays<00:01:01.620> back

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
this as well there's more relays back

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.860 
this as well there's more relays back
here<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.219> couple<00:01:02.399> fuses<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.480> found<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
here in couple fuses we found the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.200 
here in couple fuses we found the
auxiliary<00:01:04.650> fan<00:01:04.979> or<00:01:05.280> cooled<00:01:05.549> condenser<00:01:06.030> fan

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
auxiliary fan or cooled condenser fan

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.450 
auxiliary fan or cooled condenser fan
relay<00:01:06.720> has<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.470> fuse<00:01:07.770> attached<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
relay has a fuse attached to it that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.070 
relay has a fuse attached to it that
fuse<00:01:08.790> was<00:01:08.939> blown<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.560> replace<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> fuse

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
fuse was blown so we replace the fuse

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.620 
fuse was blown so we replace the fuse
then<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> condenser<00:01:13.680> fans<00:01:13.950> were<00:01:14.130> running

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
then the condenser fans were running

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.899 
then the condenser fans were running
which<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.780> there's<00:01:15.960> two<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:17.189> one<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.790> each

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
which is there's two one for one on each

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.929 
which is there's two one for one on each
side<00:01:18.439> this<00:01:19.439> fan<00:01:19.680> would<00:01:19.860> run<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.729> side

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
side this fan would run but this side

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.170 
side this fan would run but this side
would<00:01:21.150> not<00:01:21.330> run<00:01:22.729> neither<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:23.970> them<00:01:24.119> was

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
would not run neither one of them was

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.260 
would not run neither one of them was
running<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> start<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:26.060> we're<00:01:27.060> going<00:01:27.210> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
running to start with so we're going to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.859 
running to start with so we're going to
replace<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.750> fan<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.970> ultimately

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
replace this fan here so what ultimately

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.249 
replace this fan here so what ultimately
happened<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:32.250> condenser<00:01:32.759> fan<00:01:33.259> quit

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
happened is this condenser fan quit

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.920 
happened is this condenser fan quit
working<00:01:34.439> or<00:01:34.740> seized<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.509> where<00:01:36.509> would<00:01:36.720> not

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
working or seized up where would not

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.719 
working or seized up where would not
even<00:01:37.200> turn<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> off<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:41.159> car<00:01:41.369> more<00:01:41.640> than

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
even turn it off and the car more than

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.690 
even turn it off and the car more than
likely<00:01:41.909> got<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.240> little<00:01:42.509> too<00:01:42.659> warm<00:01:43.700> because

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
likely got a little too warm because

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.270 
likely got a little too warm because
this<00:01:45.090> fan<00:01:45.299> was<00:01:45.420> not<00:01:45.630> working<00:01:45.920> when<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.070> fan

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
this fan was not working when this fan

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.830 
this fan was not working when this fan
having<00:01:47.549> electrical<00:01:47.909> problems<00:01:47.970> blew<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> fuse

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
having electrical problems blew the fuse

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.469 
having electrical problems blew the fuse
for<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.170> fans<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.850> car<00:01:51.060> got<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.270> little

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
for the fans so the car got a little

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.420 
for the fans so the car got a little
warm<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.869> possibly<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.040> found<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> weak

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
warm and possibly just found the weak

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.679 
warm and possibly just found the weak
spot<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.759> coolant<00:01:54.090> system<00:01:54.360> which<00:01:54.509> was

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
spot in the coolant system which was

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.530 
spot in the coolant system which was
that<00:01:55.140> black<00:01:55.350> plastic<00:01:55.820> y<00:01:56.820> connector<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.420> were

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that black plastic y connector we were

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.889 
that black plastic y connector we were
referring<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.899> back<00:01:58.229> up<00:01:58.409> here<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.750> kind

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
referring to back up here so it's kind

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.160 
referring to back up here so it's kind
of<00:02:00.930> there's<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.290> thing<00:02:01.469> led<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.710> another

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
of there's one thing led to another

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.800 
of there's one thing led to another
nikka<00:02:04.170> figured<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.590> out

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.690 

so<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.350> had<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.560> happen<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.829> get<00:02:08.130> these<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
so what had to happen to get these to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.910 
so what had to happen to get these to
get<00:02:08.849> access<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.360> these<00:02:09.450> cooling<00:02:09.750> fans<00:02:10.080> his

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
get access to these cooling fans his

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.559 
get access to these cooling fans his
radiator<00:02:11.489> had<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.790> come<00:02:11.970> out<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.239> know<00:02:12.360> just

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
radiator had to come out you know just

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.500 
radiator had to come out you know just
AC<00:02:12.900> condenser<00:02:13.970> right<00:02:14.970> over<00:02:15.120> here<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.330> right

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
AC condenser right over here is right

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.820 
AC condenser right over here is right
here<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:16.310> had<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.370> pull<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.550> radiator<00:02:17.940> out<00:02:18.830> pull

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
here I had to pull the radiator out pull

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.470 
here I had to pull the radiator out pull
this<00:02:20.330> fan<00:02:21.330> shroud<00:02:21.540> off<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:24.030> gain<00:02:24.239> access

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
this fan shroud off of it to gain access

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.300 
this fan shroud off of it to gain access
to<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.349> wasn't<00:02:25.500> real<00:02:25.709> quick<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.130> easy

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
to it so it wasn't real quick and easy

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.449 
to it so it wasn't real quick and easy
to<00:02:26.459> get<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.930> but<00:02:27.930> one<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.680> color<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.370> guess

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
to get to but one of the color I guess

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.300 
to get to but one of the color I guess
the<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.060> pros<00:02:30.360> about<00:02:30.540> having<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.050> part<00:02:31.410> as

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
the the pros about having this part as

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.780 
the the pros about having this part as
you<00:02:32.489> can<00:02:32.580> see<00:02:32.760> all<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.090> debris<00:02:34.430> down<00:02:35.430> here

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
you can see all the debris down here

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.449 
you can see all the debris down here
that's<00:02:35.940> built<00:02:36.150> up<00:02:36.360> in<00:02:37.319> that<00:02:37.620> fan<00:02:37.830> shroud<00:02:38.040> area

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
that's built up in that fan shroud area

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.710 
that's built up in that fan shroud area
so<00:02:38.670> I'll<00:02:38.850> be<00:02:38.970> able<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.150> clean<00:02:39.360> all<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:39.540> out

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
so I'll be able to clean all that out

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.320 
so I'll be able to clean all that out
before<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.170> clear<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.410> all<00:02:40.470> back<00:02:40.650> together<00:02:40.769> and

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
before I clear it all back together and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.910 
before I clear it all back together and
the<00:02:42.330> AC<00:02:42.480> order<00:02:42.959> cool<00:02:43.140> even<00:02:43.440> better<00:02:43.650> after

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
the AC order cool even better after

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.509 
the AC order cool even better after
that's<00:02:44.400> that's<00:02:44.850> out<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.180> way

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
that's that's out of the way

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.440 
that's that's out of the way
anyway<00:02:47.519> Mercedes<00:02:47.940> 300<00:02:48.420> diesel<00:02:50.000> C<00:02:51.000> once<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.299> got

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
anyway Mercedes 300 diesel C once I got

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.030 
anyway Mercedes 300 diesel C once I got
the<00:02:51.569> fan<00:02:51.750> off<00:02:52.519> see<00:02:53.519> all<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.760> debris<00:02:55.040> shoved

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
the fan off see all the debris shoved

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.860 
the fan off see all the debris shoved
down<00:02:56.130> in<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.519> electrical<00:02:57.180> contacts<00:02:57.660> or

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
down in the electrical contacts or

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.130 
down in the electrical contacts or
electrical<00:02:58.230> area<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.560> fan<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.750> there's<00:03:04.019> a

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
electrical area of the fan and there's a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.400 
electrical area of the fan and there's a
new<00:03:04.260> one<00:03:04.410> here<00:03:05.299> nice<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.330> clean<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:10.140> can<00:03:10.290> see

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
new one here nice and clean you can see

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.289 
new one here nice and clean you can see
how<00:03:10.530> nasty<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.130> one<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:13.640> now<00:03:14.640> where<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.060> fan

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
how nasty this one is now where the fan

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:21.699 
how nasty this one is now where the fan
was<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.660> right<00:03:15.959> here

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.450 

so<00:03:22.189> it<00:03:22.400> definitely<00:03:22.790> needs<00:03:22.909> to<00:03:23.000> be<00:03:23.060> clean
