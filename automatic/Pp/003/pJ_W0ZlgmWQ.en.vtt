00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.490
 We remember in the campaign of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.649
 Battlefield 3 will eventually arrive 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.240
 great earthquake of the hero excited house 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.639
 head and then it's time to relax 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.139
 it is now over after the march 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.510
 fourth dlc for the multiplayer shooter 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.939
 builds on just that earthquake scenario 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.519
 Both on the war parties both clearly 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.410
 struck and sharpened rise 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.160
 out of the rubble for much more 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.170
 to provide more debris 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.759
 8 offers four new maps 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.559
 they are all because of the settings 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.120
 tends to be pretty similar but 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.980
 nothing but the cards are among the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.430
 best because it produces so far 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.230
 has calama hooked reminds here and there 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.870
 a bit to the good old guest 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.149
 Counter strike with its winding 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.149
 Gassen is the map the most compact of the 4 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.260
 in the middle of asadi palace stands 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.620
 Well palace just no idea again 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.620
 called 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.920
 but the palace itself is certainly 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:13.320
 bigger than some app from the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:15.210
 the money will give you that special something 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.979
 but the first dimension is that you 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.340
 offer much more elevation than that 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.380
 remaining battlefields of this size so 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.670
 also the map epicenter already 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.200
 For many a favorite is epicenter 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.090
 offers a lot of hideouts and 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.890
 Covering possibilities so that they though 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.380
 she is actually quite a crowd 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.240
 melee opportunities and offers 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.860
 It also works because of the many part 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.530
 destructible level objects very much 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.659
 credible here it comes as well 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.380
 they can shake regularly 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.149
 ever distract long-range fighters 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.690
 come on epicenter, however, too 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.880
 to shoot who wants to go out right 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.740
 it's good on marketplace monolith 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.840
 lifted the biggest web in the package 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.209
 Here's a helicopter 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.759
 pro team and a few tanks but no 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:07.469
 vehicle overkill aftermath is he 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.759
 Nevertheless, it will be infantry 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.500
 on the bigger maps with less 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.730
 Never play lonely in the congress 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.730
 Flag points are well distributed 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.790
 The rush is different than in work 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.790
 kill nothing to complain about 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.000
 on the maps of afp park three new ones 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.560
 cars of the ryno kampfwagen offers space 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.020
 for four and a gun on the roof 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.000
 but Islam as a moving escape 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.650
 It is worth a lot of drivers though 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.390
 but you should be vulnerable 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.300
 but not just at land next to the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.590
 are crate 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.180
 the cool thing about the rhine is that the 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.180
 bordschütze also the driver is the 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.040
 we have or roddick you have to go for that 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.040
 a maneuver first change the place 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.610
 at the phoenix and its russian 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.270
 kontron barsuk allowed the driver only 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.920
 drive 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.320
 For this, the cars offer two guns 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.830
 the front mw can be 360 ​​degrees 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.810
 rotate 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.530
 The grenade launcher behind it can 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.970
 act only in the semi-forward 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.890
 should with phoenix and base so always 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.360
 keep the butt to the wall as well 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.980
 Do not forget that the gunners 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.000
 sticking out of the cart and 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.920
 are unprotected 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.490
 So long you can do something like this here 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.490
 not do 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.349
 for the Christians there is an eleventh was 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.510
 it's just a new weapon but this 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.109
 actually four in one the silent one 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.109
 crossbow 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.200
 The standard arrow has a lot of buzz, though 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.200
 only a short distance 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.990
 he balanced his hat has a four 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.520
 straight trajectory caused but 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.120
 Do not hurt as much as the standard 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.200
 the spreng because then with one 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.460
 treffer car shoot a roadworthy 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.260
 and then there is the sensor because 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.260
 the opponent in the circle marked 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.400
 the crossbow is available to all classes 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.459
 order and replace the item in 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.810
 Lot 3 at the supporter it is 24 of the sany 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.669
 you can not, for example, medi packs 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:24.780
 but also distribute more 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:26.100
 The sniper can now sneak a bit 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.229
 finally something about vehicles 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.699
 company because also the card 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.410
 may be changed at any time 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.520
 is more often times for each class 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.639
 a bit more flexible 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.530
 this is great for in between 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.539
 is the new scavenger or plunder 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.400
 mode since all players start with only 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.660
 a pistol and hand grenades and 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.210
 need to get better weapons on the 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:51.800
 collect the battlefield when the rattle 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.800
 is empty you have to look for a new one 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:04.020
 alternatively there are ammo boxes like that 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.430
 you play then quite normal congress so 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.960
 it's not normal because it's normal 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.500
 no class skills but there 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.500
 just blared 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.240
 that has its own appeal because 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.009
 one actually notices the other has moment 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.169
 but only a pistol represented 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.509
 but after 1 2 rounds I want to 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.800
 back the classes back for what I have 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.800
 because my poor played freely 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.760
 aphthen minimal errors like in 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.950
 Weidmann also likes to play the main game here 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.270
 to name an object 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.230
 the scavenger is like the team 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.090
 deathmatch ever had a bad 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:41.160
 spawn where to get in the middle of 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.160
 adversaries rumrennt if only for a short time 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.110
 Center can be very easy 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.110
 get stuck somewhere 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.680
 and once again has mitspieler of 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:02.660
 spontaneously develops super powers however 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.680
 Apart from that, first time hits 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.680
 me exactly in the black
