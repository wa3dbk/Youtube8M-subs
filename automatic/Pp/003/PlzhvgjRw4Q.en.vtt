 This is the 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.900
 r with low in hassle and lower and we do 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.200
 well we started the intro that is the same 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.200
 as the guitar just says intro 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.400
 the sun lowered in sharp f 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.899
 my minor 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.500
 do not 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.480
 now the intro begins when it starts to 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.480
 to sing 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.250
 three things had now we went to the 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.250
 querÃ©taro nothing 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.780
 back 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.910
 under a case had 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.910
 two 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:39.330
 sun and now we go to 2 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.120
 the little finger we are 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.120
 to the fourth fret fifth string 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.710
 this would be the common re 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.440
 re greater as and with the little finger 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.610
 we make this game that would be the first 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.610
 rope we make games 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.090
 still back in the last part 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.030

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.469
 Y 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.550
 I go back before doing this 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.550
 part above 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.890
 d 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:50.230
 now we pass what follows 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:54.530
 yes seventh and minor 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:57.790
 we passed the king with low in sharp F 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.790
 we passed to 2 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.129
 start back in seventh 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.890

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.890
 yes seventh minor 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.170

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.990
 two 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.269
 Y 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.870
 and everything counts 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.260
 nothing 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:24.300
 the chorus with two good we keep on 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.300
 sun previously 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.900
 when we passed something 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.190
 to sun last passed back 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.900
 now we spend like this seventh face 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.810
 the same as the previous 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:06.159

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.690
 pitcher 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.140
 and now we count on 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.449
 all right 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.940
 and 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.210

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.430
