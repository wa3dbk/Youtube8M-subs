00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.430
 you know my name is isaac 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.550
 the reason why he can not go up life 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.700
 to this week are these two teams that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.610
 I'm going to introduce you as the truth 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.060
 I'm happy because we're going to 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.279
 improve many things both us 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.830
 as the explanation as you in 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.960
 to understand it and be able to put it in 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.080
 practice one of the teams that we're going to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.600
 to be using is this which is the sj 4000 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.120
 from sj cam the truth was made us a 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.549
 bit difficult to find here the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.199
 original but we already have it with this 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:52.110
 team we will be able to achieve better 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.350
 you take better picture so that you 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.820
 can better appreciate the environment of 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.430
 explanations of the following videos 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.530
 the other team that the truth also 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.050
 I'm happy with him because we were 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.979
 You can also find it difficult to see and 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.750
 we have it here are these lenses 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.190
 then tiresome to see are some lenses 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:19.630
 spy they have camera aside and 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.720
 these lenses are going to be used so that 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.190
 you can see what I see at 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.979
 moment of life you can give 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.780
 explanation when making the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.700
 speed changes moments in the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.890
 changes of lane and other videos that 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.820
 come I was very interested in you 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.250
 could see what what I achieve 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.770
 see and it was not achieved with any master 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.509
 with these lenses that have a camera 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.750
 included then we will be using 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:50.080
 these two teams in order to 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.330
 that you can learn better and 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.300
 better appreciate each of the videos 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.700
 that we are going to go up and explaining 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.490
 so then they go an apology for not 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.260
 upload videos but the reason was this and 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.570
 Well, since we have them, we can 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.910
 continue with our series with a 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.130
 better accuracy in terms of 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.110
