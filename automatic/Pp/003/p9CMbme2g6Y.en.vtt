00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.500
 well friends is a week i am a 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.380
 walk with my faithful panda and today 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.240
 while I was at the beach enjoying sun ad 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.580
 admire the sea with its waves in 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.790
 movement thousand thoughts turn into the 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.270
 my head I understood at least in part what 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.830
 it means to be able to do a full time 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.930
 little known term in Italy and 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.600
 basically means those people who 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.520
 living in the house I don't talk about those 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.800
 people who by necessity are 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.570
 I wish them that with the year 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.120
 new things can get better 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.379
 but of those who choose it for what it is 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.510
 they have the possibility 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.330
 or they are looking for something in their lives 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.850
 but maybe I'm looking for it below 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.650
 me too that something from what I have 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.170
 understood from my little experience 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.839
 is the fact that time is not dictated by 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.540
 a watch but from my body that 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.010
 I give examples of the fact of 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.020
 get up when you want 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.110
 and almost always with the sun's rays for 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.670
 they affect my eating that happens 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.130
 I also have lunch almost a 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.500
 afternoon without even exaggerating and the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.329
 let's just say and then I dedicate all of mine 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.990
 time to the activity I prefer to do 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.060
 video photos and especially browse around 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.549
 tour to discover new places e 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.200
 why not meet people anyway 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.420
 leaving everything to chance without 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.700
 schedule anything 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.189
 then the fact of living inside one 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.100
 old panda where I eat I relax 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.439
 I work with my technologies and I sleep not 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.509
 it poses me no problem because 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.170
 finally makes me free from everything and 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.600
 all 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.690
 I admit that a van from Campania gave 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.759
 4x4 or not is in my thoughts of every 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.220
 day and most likely in the 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.320
 the near future will come but in the meantime me 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.409
 I enjoy and live these emotions to say the least 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.720
 fantastic and important to me 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.500
 taking up my time where in life 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.840
 everyday 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.479
 I lost from a bit of a company that a 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.700
 to say the least is messed up anyway 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.380
 case deserves the lucky coupon because 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.569
 I do what I like and I hope 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.640
 to continue to do so always in the future 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.100
 I send you a greeting and I thank you 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.030
 giving you an appointment at the next video 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.030
 bye Bye
