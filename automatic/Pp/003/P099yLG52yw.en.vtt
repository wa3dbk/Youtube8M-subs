gonna<00:00:30.300> wait<00:00:30.510> for<00:00:30.539> many<00:00:30.840> hours<00:00:31.489> and<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.940> thought

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.290 
gonna wait for many hours and I thought
I'll<00:00:33.750> do<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.110> whilst<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.670> weather<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.090> nice

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
hence the bike is a bit wet right

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.770 
hence the bike is a bit wet right

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
what can I say I've been using it for

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.790 
what can I say I've been using it for
the<00:00:48.910> past<00:00:49.120> two<00:00:49.300> months<00:00:49.469> I've<00:00:50.469> only<00:00:50.620> had<00:00:50.739> one

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
the past two months I've only had one

the past two months I've only had one

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
false alarm by slamming my front door

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.200 
false alarm by slamming my front door
shut<00:00:53.769> with<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.190> bike<00:00:54.370> being<00:00:54.640> next<00:00:54.879> to<00:00:55.089> it

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
shut with the bike being next to it

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.660 
shut with the bike being next to it
which<00:00:55.390> obviously<00:00:55.780> moved<00:00:56.170> it<00:00:56.350> somehow<00:00:56.670> it's

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
which obviously moved it somehow it's

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.860 
which obviously moved it somehow it's
got<00:00:57.879> a<00:00:57.910> solid<00:00:58.300> body<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.940> can't<00:01:01.180> get<00:01:01.420> this<00:01:01.600> bit

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
got a solid body you can't get this bit

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.930 
got a solid body you can't get this bit
off<00:01:01.989> from<00:01:02.199> the<00:01:02.289> outside<00:01:02.649> this<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:02.920> metal<00:01:03.370> as

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
off from the outside this is metal as

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.380 
off from the outside this is metal as
well<00:01:04.119> and<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:06.070> battery<00:01:06.490> sits<00:01:06.820> in<00:01:07.180> that

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
well and the battery sits in that

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.590 
well and the battery sits in that
plastic<00:01:08.380> bit<00:01:09.280> in<00:01:09.820> here<00:01:12.090> what<00:01:13.090> can<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.299> say<00:01:13.479> it's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
plastic bit in here what can I say it's

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.789 
plastic bit in here what can I say it's
very<00:01:13.659> secure<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.409> gap<00:01:14.649> between<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.970> pin<00:01:16.799> to

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
very secure the gap between the pin to

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.669 
very secure the gap between the pin to
get<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.159> pin<00:01:18.399> is<00:01:18.880> very<00:01:19.330> very<00:01:19.780> small<00:01:20.170> so

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
get to the pin is very very small so

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:21.930 
get to the pin is very very small so
when<00:01:20.950> it's<00:01:21.100> on<00:01:21.280> your<00:01:21.460> desk

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
when it's on your desk

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.649 
when it's on your desk
I'll<00:01:22.210> show<00:01:22.479> you<00:01:22.740> yeah<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.770> do<00:01:27.610> have<00:01:27.880> wavy<00:01:28.149> disks

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
I'll show you yeah I do have wavy disks

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.600 
I'll show you yeah I do have wavy disks
which<00:01:28.869> is<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.380> bit<00:01:29.619> annoying<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:30.130> actually<00:01:30.429> get

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
which is a bit annoying to actually get

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.850 
which is a bit annoying to actually get
it<00:01:30.700> on<00:01:31.030> in<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.810> right<00:01:31.929> position<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:32.470> has<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.710> be

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
it on in the right position it has to be

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.719 
it on in the right position it has to be
over<00:01:33.100> one<00:01:33.399> of<00:01:33.520> these<00:01:33.899> bits<00:01:34.899> here<00:01:35.350> ideally<00:01:36.340> at

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
over one of these bits here ideally at

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.149 
over one of these bits here ideally at
the<00:01:36.880> bottom<00:01:37.330> if<00:01:38.259> I<00:01:38.409> put<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.679> on<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:38.979> the

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
the bottom if I put it on that the

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.809 
the bottom if I put it on that the
sensor<00:01:39.580> won't<00:01:39.789> pick<00:01:40.330> up<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:41.580> fact<00:01:42.580> that<00:01:42.670> the

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
sensor won't pick up the fact that the

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.880 
sensor won't pick up the fact that the
disk<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.149> in<00:01:43.210> there<00:01:43.539> and<00:01:44.050> it<00:01:44.229> will<00:01:44.409> not<00:01:45.130> harm

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
disk is in there and it will not harm

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.789 
disk is in there and it will not harm
but<00:01:47.890> yeah<00:01:48.580> it's<00:01:49.450> I've<00:01:50.050> dropped<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.409> a<00:01:50.440> few

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
but yeah it's I've dropped it a few

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.240 
but yeah it's I've dropped it a few
times<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:53.380> not<00:01:53.530> really<00:01:53.770> scuffed<00:01:54.100> or

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
times but it's not really scuffed or

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.789 
times but it's not really scuffed or
anything<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:54.759> still<00:01:54.969> works

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
anything and it still works

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.530 
anything and it still works
so<00:01:56.799> it's<00:01:57.399> quite<00:01:57.640> simple

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
so it's quite simple

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.620 
so it's quite simple
you<00:01:58.689> just<00:01:58.840> put<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.079> on<00:01:59.880> wait<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.939> little<00:02:01.240> bit<00:02:01.420> and

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
you just put it on wait a little bit and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.940 
you just put it on wait a little bit and
it<00:02:01.719> will<00:02:01.780> arm<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:05.020> we<00:02:05.110> go<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.590> is<00:02:05.680> very

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
it will arm there we go and it is very

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.370 
it will arm there we go and it is very
loud<00:02:06.189> and<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:07.360> mean<00:02:07.570> very<00:02:07.960> loud<00:02:09.149> stick<00:02:10.149> Ian<00:02:10.690> undo

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
loud and I mean very loud stick Ian undo

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.940 
loud and I mean very loud stick Ian undo
it<00:02:11.820> there<00:02:12.820> we<00:02:12.940> go<00:02:13.350> I've<00:02:14.350> bought<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.709> for<00:02:14.920> I

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
it there we go I've bought it for I

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.970 
it there we go I've bought it for I
think<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.459> was<00:02:15.489> 39<00:02:16.030> pounds<00:02:17.019> it<00:02:17.410> doesn't<00:02:17.799> come

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
think it was 39 pounds it doesn't come

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.340 
think it was 39 pounds it doesn't come

think<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.239> my<00:02:28.359> opinion<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:29.100> don't<00:02:30.100> need<00:02:30.280> a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
think in my opinion I don't need a

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.670 
think in my opinion I don't need a
bigger<00:02:30.609> pin<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:33.420> would<00:02:34.470> recommend<00:02:35.470> this

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
bigger pin and I would recommend this

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.120 
bigger pin and I would recommend this
because<00:02:36.239> for<00:02:37.239> me<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.750> parked<00:02:38.320> my<00:02:38.380> bike<00:02:38.500> in<00:02:38.980> my

tried to steal my bike while I'm at work

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.690 
tried to steal my bike while I'm at work
people<00:02:59.170> would<00:02:59.379> be<00:02:59.560> able<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.950> hear<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:00.310> going

people would be able to hear this going

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.130 
people would be able to hear this going
off<00:03:01.440> because<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.739> is<00:03:03.420> 120<00:03:04.420> decibels

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
off because it is 120 decibels

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.210 
off because it is 120 decibels
I<00:03:05.319> believe<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:07.720> regards<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.290> rain<00:03:08.590> yeah<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.099> is

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
I believe in regards to rain yeah it is

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.850 
I believe in regards to rain yeah it is
20<00:03:09.819> decibels<00:03:10.000> there<00:03:10.450> we<00:03:10.510> go<00:03:10.660> in<00:03:11.470> regards<00:03:11.830> to

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
20 decibels there we go in regards to

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.949 
20 decibels there we go in regards to
rain<00:03:12.160> getting<00:03:12.519> on<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.879> what<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.300> try<00:03:13.629> and<00:03:13.690> do

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
rain getting on it what I try and do

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.530 
rain getting on it what I try and do
just<00:03:14.530> as<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.730> recommendation<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.300> try<00:03:16.510> and

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
just as a recommendation is I try and

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.610 
just as a recommendation is I try and
clip<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.900> underneath<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.739> swing<00:03:18.489> arm<00:03:18.780> here<00:03:19.780> so

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
clip it underneath the swing arm here so

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.600 
clip it underneath the swing arm here so
that<00:03:20.800> obviously<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.760> doesn't<00:03:21.959> get<00:03:22.959> in<00:03:23.110> between

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
that obviously it doesn't get in between

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.100 
that obviously it doesn't get in between
the<00:03:24.610> gap<00:03:24.880> where<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.150> disc<00:03:25.450> lock<00:03:25.630> is<00:03:25.780> meant<00:03:25.959> to

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
the gap where the disc lock is meant to

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.670 
the gap where the disc lock is meant to
go<00:03:27.629> you<00:03:28.629> can't<00:03:28.870> put<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.049> on<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.230> front<00:03:29.470> as<00:03:29.650> well

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
go you can't put it on the front as well

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.160 
go you can't put it on the front as well
but<00:03:30.610> my<00:03:30.790> disc<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.540> front<00:03:31.750> is<00:03:31.870> on<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.019> other

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
but my disc on the front is on the other

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.380 
but my disc on the front is on the other
side<00:03:32.410> but<00:03:33.220> again<00:03:33.489> I'll<00:03:33.640> try<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.000> put<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.239> near

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
side but again I'll try and put it near

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.539 
side but again I'll try and put it near
the<00:03:34.480> bottom<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.200> any<00:03:35.769> water<00:03:36.069> will<00:03:36.370> drip

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
the bottom so that any water will drip

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.210 
the bottom so that any water will drip
onto<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:38.019> miss<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.590> disc<00:03:38.799> lock<00:03:38.980> he'll

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
onto that and miss the disc lock he'll

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.289 
onto that and miss the disc lock he'll
also<00:03:39.880> got<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:41.110> mud<00:03:41.769> guard<00:03:42.069> which<00:03:42.819> directly

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
also got the mud guard which directly

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.820 
also got the mud guard which directly
from<00:03:43.450> above<00:03:43.810> would<00:03:44.049> cover<00:03:44.290> it

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.830 

second<00:03:48.830> thing<00:03:49.069> is<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.640> bike<00:03:49.880> itself<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.630> bike

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
second thing is the bike itself the bike

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.110 
second thing is the bike itself the bike
itself<00:03:51.080> is<00:03:51.260> fine<00:03:51.590> apart<00:03:52.130> from<00:03:52.310> two<00:03:52.700> little

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
itself is fine apart from two little

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.460 
itself is fine apart from two little
tiny<00:03:53.480> things<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.950> yes<00:03:55.130> it<00:03:55.250> is<00:03:55.340> raining<00:03:56.470> the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
tiny things and yes it is raining the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.400 
tiny things and yes it is raining the
first<00:03:57.739> thing<00:03:57.980> is<00:03:58.160> we're<00:03:58.400> not<00:03:59.080> riding<00:04:00.080> along

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
first thing is we're not riding along

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.460 
first thing is we're not riding along
something<00:04:00.890> is<00:04:01.010> vibrating<00:04:01.819> and<00:04:02.000> it's<00:04:02.840> coming

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
something is vibrating and it's coming

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.400 
something is vibrating and it's coming
from<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.980> there<00:04:04.780> which<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:05.810> where<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.140> chain

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
from in there which is where the chain

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.670 
from in there which is where the chain
goes<00:04:06.709> it's<00:04:07.220> either<00:04:07.459> in<00:04:07.610> there<00:04:07.850> or<00:04:08.180> in<00:04:08.390> there

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
goes it's either in there or in there

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.550 
goes it's either in there or in there
none<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.800> those<00:04:09.920> things<00:04:10.400> should<00:04:10.790> be<00:04:11.780> vibrating

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
none of those things should be vibrating

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.790 
none of those things should be vibrating
I<00:04:13.690> can't<00:04:14.690> figure<00:04:14.900> out<00:04:15.140> what<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:15.349> is<00:04:15.410> there's<00:04:15.650> no

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
I can't figure out what it is there's no

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.430 
I can't figure out what it is there's no
loose<00:04:16.010> panels<00:04:16.519> I<00:04:16.760> tried<00:04:17.239> holding<00:04:17.450> my<00:04:17.959> hand<00:04:18.169> and

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
loose panels I tried holding my hand and

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.760 
loose panels I tried holding my hand and
everything<00:04:18.709> was<00:04:18.979> moving<00:04:20.709> it<00:04:21.709> doesn't<00:04:22.450> do<00:04:23.450> it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
everything was moving it doesn't do it

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.530 
everything was moving it doesn't do it
while<00:04:24.770> it's<00:04:24.889> idling<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:25.760> Stan<00:04:26.030> Stan<00:04:26.270> Lee<00:04:26.389> only

while it's idling and Stan Stan Lee only
does<00:04:26.750> it<00:04:26.780> were<00:04:26.990> moving<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.940> second<00:04:29.389> thing<00:04:29.570> so

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
does it were moving the second thing so

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.490 
does it were moving the second thing so
far<00:04:30.260> is<00:04:30.610> that<00:04:31.610> using<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.780> choke<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.169> start<00:04:33.410> the

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
far is that using the choke to start the

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.960 
far is that using the choke to start the
bike<00:04:33.680> from<00:04:33.830> cold<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:35.780> doesn't<00:04:36.380> like<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.040> idle

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
bike from cold it doesn't like to idle

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.430 
bike from cold it doesn't like to idle
it<00:04:38.960> will<00:04:39.139> cut<00:04:39.470> out<00:04:39.880> example<00:04:40.880> I<00:04:41.090> got<00:04:42.050> back<00:04:42.260> from

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
it will cut out example I got back from

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.460 
it will cut out example I got back from
work<00:04:42.650> about<00:04:42.860> an<00:04:43.820> hour<00:04:44.030> and<00:04:44.180> a<00:04:44.210> half<00:04:44.360> ago<00:04:44.540> so
