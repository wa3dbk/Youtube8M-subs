00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.540
 channel on yutyube all-all ru and now 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.710
 We will solve the problem at number 224 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.389
 find the value of the expression 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:20.880
 and see what we under the letter a is written 2 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:25.019
 in degree 3 + 2.6 what is 2 in degree 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.320
 3 here . above it is written little 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.300
 the power of the number that is 2 to the power of 3 is 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:38.149
 it means 2 times 2 times 2 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:41.969
 plus 2.6 the number that stands below 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.190
 we multiply it by ourselves so many times 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.969
 what number is on top 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:53.789
 we multiply the two by itself three times 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:55.949
 it's called degree so look 2 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.520
 multiply by 2 will be 4 and even multiplied by 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:04.880
 2 will be 88 plus 2.6 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.900
 8 + 2 integers will be 10 integers 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:17.540
 yes again there are six tenths so 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:22.040
 look further 0.3 to degree 2 that is 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:26.460
 0.3 multiply by itself 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.530
 0.3 multiply by 0.3 how many times twice 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.869
 see your bones our two times a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.270
 where the three stood there inside the mind 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:39.360
 pressed 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:40.729
 yes plus 1.1 let's get 0.3 first y 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.960
 men 0.3 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.970
 let's do it like a bar 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:54.329
 duly 0.3 multiplied by zero 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:02:01.920
 a full three tenths three at 393 per 000 per 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:05.090
 30 and 0 on 0 0 we add here the nine 0 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.849
 to 0 0 and here is zero where we put a comma 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.250
 here, one sign here, one 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.120
 sign means everywhere, it turns out 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.190
 on 2 signs we transfer to 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:22.920
 here, therefore 0.3 times 0.3 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.799
 it will be 0.09 already 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.920
 it's very important not to confuse from 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.360
 must necessarily be 9 hundredths here, 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.510
 on one sign here on one sign in 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.690
 therefore, by 2 digits, therefore, 900 and more 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.739
 plus 1.1 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.940
 nu eau de sisley was in the column 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:48.370
 add see 1.1 plus zero integer 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:52.660
 , zero nine hundredths nine remains 1 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:03:00.549
 to 0 1 1 to 0 1 and, here it turns out 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:05.620
 equals one whole, 19 acres 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:14.319
 the number is obtained make no mistake so go 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:16.359
 further under the letter v see us in 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.030
 some action in brackets and then in 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.930
 degrees as we know we are already doing first 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.930
 what's inside the brackets 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:34.660
 if and for 1.6 subtract 7 tenths 1.67 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:39.430
 out of six we cannot teach the seven 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:42.040
 from 16 7 we calculate it turns out 9 Odessa 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.400
 from edinichki already occupied remained 0 0 minus 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.470
 zero is zero zero point nine 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.930
 brackets get 0.9 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.690
 and the bracket then we had a square 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:58.359
 correctly we inside counted inside 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.349
 it turned out 0.9 and now 0.9 zero point 9 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.620
 x squared 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:08.190
 to squared because we multiply 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:11.859
 let's count on you too 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:16.810
 0.9 multiplied by zero point nine 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:20.829
 tenths nine to 981 one we write 8 you 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:27.629
 9 to 0 0 and eight more in our minds 81 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:31.469
 our way further 0 to 900 0 0 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:34.599
 again here 8 fold and here but 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:37.840
 here, one sign here, one 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:40.680
 sign in the end comma is transferred to 2 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.009
 two-digit mark here 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.780
 it turns out 0.9 multiplied by zero integer 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:53.789
 nine-tenths will be 0 wholes, 81 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.789
 100 so 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:03.060
 let's count here too first 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.840
 we consider that in brackets correctly 0,6 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:11.240
 multiply by 0.5 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.240
 0.6 multiply by 0.5 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:28.439
 5 to 6 30 0 we write 3 you 5 to 0 0 to 3 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:31.020
 mind 330 0 at 600 0 0 0 3 0 and then we 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:33.650
 we fold, here on the sign and here on 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:42.469
 the sign as a result on 2 signs 1 2 turns out 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:45.120
 0.3 0.3 0.3 plus 0.7 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:49.620
 how much in brackets is obtained here 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.330
 It turned out the product gave 0.3 0.3 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.469
 plus 0.7 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:58.889
 this one that is brackets turns one 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:00.779
 and one to the extent to the third degree 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.180
 that is, his whole bracket was to meet 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:04.339
 degree a in brackets turned out to be one and that 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.529
 one to 3 degrees 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:11.129
 what is 1 in the third degree is 1 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:13.400
 multiply by 1 multiply by 1 unit 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:16.529
 multiply by itself how many times 3 times 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.300
 because fork three years old 1 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:20.699
 multiply by 1 will be 1 and even multiplied by 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:25.219
 1 will be 1 so under the letter g 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:27.029
 the answer is one that's not such a difficult task 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:29.460
 My name is Andrew Andreevich 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:32.870
 my channel on youtube all-all ru learn 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.870
 good bye everyone
