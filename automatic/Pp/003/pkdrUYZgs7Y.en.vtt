can use it on more than other things

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.789 
can use it on more than other things
sometimes<00:01:52.250> like<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.549> outfit<00:01:53.939> well<00:01:54.149> or<00:01:54.799> is

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
sometimes like the outfit well or is

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.730 
sometimes like the outfit well or is
this<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.159> plus<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.060> also<00:01:57.320> get<00:01:58.320> this

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
this one plus you can also get this

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.060 
this one plus you can also get this
separate<00:01:59.670> another<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.049> want<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
separate another one if you want it the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.389 
separate another one if you want it the
same<00:02:02.399> voltage<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:03.090> think<00:02:03.380> just<00:02:04.380> these<00:02:05.250> are

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
same voltage I think just these are

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.999 
same voltage I think just these are
higher<00:02:05.579> millions<00:02:06.210> compared<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.290> so

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
higher millions compared to this one so

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.800 
higher millions compared to this one so
this<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.280> eleven<00:02:08.819> hundred<00:02:08.940> million<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.690> this

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
this is eleven hundred million but this

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.260 
this is eleven hundred million but this
is

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
is

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.660 
is
hundred<00:02:10.690> million<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.830> yeah<00:02:12.790> then<00:02:13.690> tires<00:02:14.670> these

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
hundred million so yeah then tires these

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.760 
hundred million so yeah then tires these
tires<00:02:15.970> are<00:02:17.040> horribly<00:02:18.040> worn<00:02:18.340> out<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:21.450> yeah

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
tires are horribly worn out so yeah

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.440 
tires are horribly worn out so yeah
either<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.920> can<00:02:24.070> just<00:02:24.220> get<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.880> then<00:02:25.180> buy

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
either you can just get and then buy

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.560 
either you can just get and then buy
your<00:02:25.630> own<00:02:25.660> or<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.520> want<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.880> get<00:02:28.240> them<00:02:28.420> but

broke while on my my critique and people

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.680 
broke while on my my critique and people
are<00:06:36.260> like<00:06:36.290> oh<00:06:36.500> must<00:06:37.220> be<00:06:37.340> really<00:06:37.610> crappy<00:06:38.180> well

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
are like oh must be really crappy well

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.129 
are like oh must be really crappy well
it's<00:06:38.810> just<00:06:38.930> because<00:06:39.430> this<00:06:40.430> clear<00:06:40.730> plastic

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
it's just because this clear plastic

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.510 
it's just because this clear plastic
lexan<00:06:42.139> stop<00:06:42.410> all<00:06:42.740> this<00:06:42.889> is<00:06:43.130> like<00:06:43.280> a<00:06:43.310> little

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
lexan stop all this is like a little

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.159 
lexan stop all this is like a little
piece<00:06:43.700> of<00:06:43.850> lexan<00:06:44.120> that<00:06:44.270> turns<00:06:44.480> the<00:06:44.600> wheels<00:06:44.780> and

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
piece of lexan that turns the wheels and

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.140 
piece of lexan that turns the wheels and
they<00:06:45.560> fail<00:06:45.770> over<00:06:45.950> time<00:06:46.190> they're<00:06:46.639> cheap<00:06:46.910> you

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
they fail over time they're cheap you

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.640 
they fail over time they're cheap you
can<00:06:47.330> get<00:06:47.419> like<00:06:47.540> 10<00:06:47.780> for<00:06:47.990> like<00:06:48.110> three<00:06:48.290> dollars

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
can get like 10 for like three dollars

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.390 
can get like 10 for like three dollars
so<00:06:49.030> it's<00:06:50.030> nice<00:06:50.240> with<00:06:50.840> the<00:06:50.990> antenna<00:06:51.320> it's<00:06:52.310> in

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
so it's nice with the antenna it's in

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.550 
so it's nice with the antenna it's in
perfect<00:06:52.760> condition<00:06:52.970> I<00:06:53.630> normally<00:06:54.169> tuck<00:06:54.320> in<00:06:54.440> a

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
perfect condition I normally tuck in a

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.860 
perfect condition I normally tuck in a
because<00:06:54.740> I'm<00:06:54.860> a<00:06:54.919> basher<00:06:55.280> with<00:06:55.400> my<00:06:55.520> cars<00:06:55.870> but
