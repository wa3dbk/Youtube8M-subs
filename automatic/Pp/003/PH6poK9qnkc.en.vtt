00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
features of the car cases that we liked

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.680 
features of the car cases that we liked
that<00:00:45.710> were<00:00:46.219> the<00:00:46.460> smaller<00:00:46.789> form<00:00:47.090> factor<00:00:47.510> and

that were the smaller form factor and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.990 
that were the smaller form factor and
just<00:00:47.840> blew<00:00:48.079> it<00:00:48.230> up<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:48.800> make<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.190> for<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.760> size

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
come in four different sizes the creator

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.970 
come in four different sizes the creator
controller<00:00:56.300> cases<00:00:56.719> come<00:00:56.899> in<00:00:56.929> medium<00:00:57.410> large

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
controller cases come in medium large

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.579 
controller cases come in medium large
extra<00:00:58.760> large<00:00:58.789> and<00:00:59.089> extra<00:00:59.570> extra<00:00:59.929> large<00:00:59.960> the

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
extra large and extra extra large the

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.079 
extra large and extra extra large the
smallest<00:01:00.920> can<00:01:01.249> fit<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.760> smallest

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
smallest can fit the smallest

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.479 
smallest can fit the smallest
controllers<00:01:02.660> like<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:02.960> DDJ<00:01:03.410> Wego<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:04.070> the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
controllers like the DDJ Wego and the

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.160 
controllers like the DDJ Wego and the
largest<00:01:04.790> can<00:01:05.059> fit<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.420> bigger<00:01:05.660> controllers

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
largest can fit the bigger controllers

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.540 
largest can fit the bigger controllers
like<00:01:06.290> a<00:01:06.320> DD<00:01:06.620> jsz<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:08.180> numark<00:01:08.540> ns6<00:01:11.560> $60<00:01:12.560> $80

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
like a DD jsz and the numark ns6 $60 $80

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.850 
like a DD jsz and the numark ns6 $60 $80
and<00:01:13.790> then<00:01:14.030> $100<00:01:14.780> at<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:14.990> top<00:01:15.170> of<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.380> spectrum

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
and then $100 at the top of the spectrum

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.380 
and then $100 at the top of the spectrum
so<00:01:16.250> they<00:01:16.370> come<00:01:16.550> in<00:01:16.670> at<00:01:16.760> a<00:01:16.790> really<00:01:17.060> good<00:01:17.180> price

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
so they come in at a really good price

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.020 
so they come in at a really good price
point<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:17.990> they<00:01:18.380> don't<00:01:18.650> sacrifice<00:01:18.950> on<00:01:19.610> the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
point and they don't sacrifice on the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.270 
point and they don't sacrifice on the
reliability<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.990> durability<00:01:21.650> as<00:01:22.040> you

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
reliability and the durability as you

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.120 
reliability and the durability as you
can<00:01:22.430> see<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:22.760> has<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.030> same<00:01:23.200> hard<00:01:24.200> nylon

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
can see it has the same hard nylon

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.900 
can see it has the same hard nylon
durable<00:01:26.110> coating<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:27.530> had<00:01:27.770> for<00:01:28.310> the

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
durable coating that it had for the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.240 
durable coating that it had for the
original<00:01:29.660> hard<00:01:29.870> cases<00:01:30.320> it's<00:01:30.530> also<00:01:30.740> waterproof

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
original hard cases it's also waterproof

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.460 
original hard cases it's also waterproof
so<00:01:31.760> you<00:01:31.790> can<00:01:31.910> get<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:32.330> thing<00:01:32.600> wet<00:01:32.870> we<00:01:33.080> sprayed

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
so you can get this thing wet we sprayed

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.620 
so you can get this thing wet we sprayed
this<00:01:33.680> down<00:01:33.950> we<00:01:34.490> didn't<00:01:34.700> have<00:01:34.820> any<00:01:35.000> leaks<00:01:35.360> with

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
this down we didn't have any leaks with

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.270 
this down we didn't have any leaks with
it<00:01:35.870> everything<00:01:36.410> was<00:01:36.500> nice<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:36.740> dry<00:01:37.070> on<00:01:37.190> the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
it everything was nice and dry on the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.640 
it everything was nice and dry on the
inside<00:01:37.640> we<00:01:37.880> also<00:01:38.060> drop<00:01:38.810> this<00:01:39.020> thing<00:01:39.320> several

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
inside we also drop this thing several

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.460 
inside we also drop this thing several
times<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:40.820> really<00:01:41.060> did<00:01:41.360> hold<00:01:41.660> up<00:01:41.900> and<00:01:42.080> it

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
times and it really did hold up and it

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.470 
times and it really did hold up and it
can<00:01:42.710> withstand<00:01:42.980> the<00:01:43.400> test<00:01:43.430> of<00:01:43.790> punishment<00:01:44.330> as

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
can withstand the test of punishment as

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.480 
can withstand the test of punishment as
you<00:01:44.600> can<00:01:44.750> see<00:01:44.930> we<00:01:45.050> don't<00:01:45.140> have<00:01:45.230> any<00:01:45.380> scrapes<00:01:46.280> or

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
you can see we don't have any scrapes or

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.610 
you can see we don't have any scrapes or
anything<00:01:46.670> like<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:46.880> on<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.450> surface<00:01:47.690> of<00:01:48.110> the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
anything like that on the surface of the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.160 
anything like that on the surface of the
actual<00:01:49.130> case<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.540> really<00:01:50.780> holds<00:01:50.930> up<00:01:51.110> nicely

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
actual case so it really holds up nicely

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.010 
actual case so it really holds up nicely
to<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.070> abuse<00:01:52.460> that<00:01:52.940> a<00:01:53.000> DJ<00:01:53.480> is<00:01:53.540> going<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.840> put

like they're going to stand up to the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.540 
like they're going to stand up to the
test<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:03.050> time<00:02:03.230> as<00:02:04.010> we<00:02:04.190> turn<00:02:04.400> this<00:02:04.490> thing

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
test of time as we turn this thing

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.310 
test of time as we turn this thing
around<00:02:04.730> you'll<00:02:05.150> notice<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.570> there<00:02:05.810> are<00:02:06.080> no

may want to carry with you so as we put

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.050 
may want to carry with you so as we put
it<00:02:28.519> down<00:02:28.670> on<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.950> right<00:02:30.950> side<00:02:30.980> up<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.640> can<00:02:31.819> see

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
it down on the right side up you can see

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.940 
it down on the right side up you can see
we<00:02:32.239> have<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.720> zippers<00:02:33.290> here<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.650> zippers

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
we have the zippers here and the zippers

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.500 
we have the zippers here and the zippers
can<00:02:34.099> be<00:02:34.220> put<00:02:34.400> together<00:02:34.550> so<00:02:35.000> that<00:02:35.030> way<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.360> can

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
can be put together so that way you can

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.449 
can be put together so that way you can
lock<00:02:35.780> them<00:02:35.959> together<00:02:36.140> there's<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.560> little<00:02:36.800> hole

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
lock them together there's a little hole

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.009 
lock them together there's a little hole
in<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.819> middle<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.180> them<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.569> can<00:02:38.599> slide<00:02:38.989> a

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
in the middle of them so you can slide a

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.470 
in the middle of them so you can slide a
little<00:02:39.200> lock<00:02:39.470> in<00:02:39.650> there<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.459> they<00:02:40.940> feel<00:02:41.209> very

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
little lock in there and they feel very

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.960 
little lock in there and they feel very
very<00:02:41.720> durable<00:02:41.959> as<00:02:42.319> well<00:02:42.349> and<00:02:43.010> they<00:02:43.459> also<00:02:43.700> did

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
very durable as well and they also did

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.119 
very durable as well and they also did
not<00:02:44.000> leak<00:02:44.330> any<00:02:44.450> water<00:02:44.780> into<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.379> unit<00:02:45.709> when

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
not leak any water into the unit when

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.880 
not leak any water into the unit when
we're<00:02:46.400> doing<00:02:46.640> our<00:02:46.819> testing<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:47.989> once<00:02:48.470> we<00:02:48.590> open

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
we're doing our testing so once we open

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.309 
we're doing our testing so once we open
this<00:02:48.980> up<00:02:49.569> this<00:02:50.569> is<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.840> large<00:02:51.049> size

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
this up this is the large size

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.770 
this up this is the large size
controller<00:02:51.799> by<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.069> way<00:02:52.280> it's<00:02:52.790> made<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.360> fit

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780

right<00:02:57.200> now<00:02:57.349> we<00:02:57.410> have<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.769> Vestax<00:02:58.250> VCI<00:02:58.670> 400

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
right now we have the Vestax VCI 400

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.089 
right now we have the Vestax VCI 400
inside<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.410> rest<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.769> excuse

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
inside of it the rest of that excuse

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.740 
inside of it the rest of that excuse
Agha<00:03:01.310> 400<00:03:01.819> can<00:03:01.940> actually<00:03:02.239> fit<00:03:02.480> in<00:03:02.630> the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
Agha 400 can actually fit in the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.870 
Agha 400 can actually fit in the
medium-size<00:03:03.380> case<00:03:03.739> but<00:03:04.250> we<00:03:04.370> don't<00:03:04.610> have<00:03:04.819> our

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
medium-size case but we don't have our

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.900 
medium-size case but we don't have our
s4<00:03:05.599> mk2<00:03:06.019> with<00:03:06.349> us<00:03:06.500> right<00:03:06.680> now<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:06.920> this<00:03:07.579> was<00:03:07.700> all

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
s4 mk2 with us right now so this was all

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.330 
s4 mk2 with us right now so this was all
we<00:03:08.060> had<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.390> use<00:03:08.599> for<00:03:08.959> this<00:03:09.170> demo<00:03:09.590> but<00:03:10.069> when<00:03:10.250> you

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
we had to use for this demo but when you

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.550 
we had to use for this demo but when you
actually<00:03:10.519> go<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:10.970> get<00:03:11.480> your<00:03:11.690> own<00:03:11.720> controller

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
actually go and get your own controller

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.080 
actually go and get your own controller
hard<00:03:12.829> case<00:03:13.069> it's<00:03:13.340> recommended<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:13.819> you<00:03:13.970> get

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
hard case it's recommended that you get

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.970 
hard case it's recommended that you get
the<00:03:14.299> smallest<00:03:14.629> size<00:03:14.930> available<00:03:15.500> therefore

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
the smallest size available therefore

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.220 
the smallest size available therefore
you<00:03:16.370> won't<00:03:16.489> have<00:03:16.670> any<00:03:16.910> additional<00:03:17.239> room<00:03:17.720> so

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
you won't have any additional room so

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.920 
you won't have any additional room so
your<00:03:18.379> controller<00:03:18.709> can<00:03:18.980> move<00:03:19.160> about<00:03:19.629> inside<00:03:20.629> of

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
your controller can move about inside of
