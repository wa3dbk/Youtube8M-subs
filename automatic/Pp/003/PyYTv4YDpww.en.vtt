00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.080
 hello how about friends virtue of -1 video 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.350
 this time we will learn how to 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.720
 configure the applications or the 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.940
 start of the operating system in this 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.950
 case for us they need video is going to 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.049
 be another noise of how they are made 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.720
 windows 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.180
 7 that is practically absolutely 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.689
 Sunday only here when a little 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.689
 step but then we start 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.470
 good friends once we have 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.530
 started our pc this tutorial goes 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.140
 to serve to configure which files 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.040
 sorry that what programs or what processes 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.379
 they will start automatically and when 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.079
 we train our device 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.039
 our 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.929
 our pc well this so that it works 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.149
 Because there are times that we already have 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.370
 very saturated our pc we have many 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.850
 programs that are loaded at the moment of 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.070
 that we turn on the computer then 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.320
 this causes me to delay a little longer what 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.270
 is the ignition as it is 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.720
 set well to be able to use the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.909
 computer without any problem well for 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.220
 this is going to open this this little window 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.340
 to execute as I opened it and surely 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.530
 press the windows key on your 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.500
 keyboard plus the r key at the same time 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.330
 are to open this window we press as 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.420
 well rather we write this command 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.479
 more so you're going to the description 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.299
 video so damask customer and that's it 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.580
 here write for our skin we put in 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:46.560
 that border then in amos center 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:50.660
 and it's not going to open this little window that says 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.660
 system configuration here we go 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.020
 I have 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.030
 do not move because they can damage the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.980
 system ok let's go here at the beginning of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.990
 windows and we're going to click on these 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.750
 statements perhaps great desire for tasks 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.780
 we press and they give us all 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.870
 processes that we have enabled in this 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.880
 concrete case at 15 minutes if I do not 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.370
 I want it to start when we are in the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.350
 we press them we already know 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.440
 right disable one more to do 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.780
 come on and let's go here a disable button 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.720
 Some state has changed us not 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.510
 so he tells us the impact of start 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.940
 high means that the group starts 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.390
 takes rather as the priority that 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.090
 they have 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.459
 well as the team of professions 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.680
 this case here I will leave as well as a 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.650
 more disable this to make it 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.120
 the test ok and once we have everything 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.360
 that simply because we closed 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.490
 we accept him and he with that 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.230
 it is saved in its configurations 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.760
 as in the book positions that arrive 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.230
 suspend those processes or is it a 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.420
 application will not be opened until 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.370
 we talk then this helps 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.190
 to initiate much faster 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.790
 system and well then that we all go 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.790
 to pig
