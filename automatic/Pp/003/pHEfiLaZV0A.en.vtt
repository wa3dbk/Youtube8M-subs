00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
Salem Speedway what I do here usually is

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.160 
Salem Speedway what I do here usually is
try<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> zoom<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:33.300> best<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.690> give<00:00:34.050> up

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
try to zoom in as best I can give up

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.350 
try to zoom in as best I can give up
just<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.440> little<00:00:34.710> gap<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.070> each<00:00:35.190> side<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.850> we

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
just a little gap on each side and we

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.740 
just a little gap on each side and we
get<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> straightaways<00:00:37.079> flat<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.370> I

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
get the straightaways flat as can be I

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.180 
get the straightaways flat as can be I
know<00:00:39.750> some<00:00:40.050> tracks<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.800> know<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.010> gonna

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
know some tracks it's you know not gonna

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.240 
know some tracks it's you know not gonna
be<00:00:41.280> possible<00:00:41.760> but<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:43.079> track<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.710> think

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
be possible but for this track I think

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.190 
be possible but for this track I think
this<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.700> good<00:00:44.910> enough<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.390> will<00:00:45.539> go<00:00:45.719> up<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
this is good enough I will go up here to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.920 
this is good enough I will go up here to
edit<00:00:46.489> copy<00:00:47.489> image<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:49.460> then<00:00:50.460> paste<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.270> into

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.840 

Photoshop<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.410> now<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.680> know<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.280> doesn't<00:00:56.489> fit

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
Photoshop here now I know it doesn't fit

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.760 
Photoshop here now I know it doesn't fit
and<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.899> where<00:00:58.170> I'm<00:00:58.770> talking<00:00:59.219> about<00:01:00.770> not

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and this is where I'm talking about not

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.280 
and this is where I'm talking about not
just<00:01:02.100> dragging<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.059> side<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
just dragging one side in to get it to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.420 
just dragging one side in to get it to
fit<00:01:05.060> so<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.450> need<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.720> resize<00:01:07.200> now<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.159> can

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
fit so we need to resize now you can

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.859 
fit so we need to resize now you can
drag<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.880> side<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.659> get<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> fit<00:01:11.869> but

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
drag the side in to get it to fit but

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.980 
drag the side in to get it to fit but
this<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.229> what<00:01:13.409> else<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.710> need<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.979> do

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.000 

okay<00:01:20.650> so<00:01:20.830> we<00:01:21.130> dragged<00:01:21.400> it<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.729> fit<00:01:21.909> their

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
okay so we dragged it in to fit their

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.320 
okay so we dragged it in to fit their
61.5<00:01:24.010> so<00:01:24.400> we<00:01:24.490> need<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.700> do<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:24.940> height<00:01:25.119> at

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
61.5 so we need to do the height at

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.020 
61.5 so we need to do the height at
sixty<00:01:25.630> one<00:01:25.780> point<00:01:26.020> five

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.450 

so<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:31.720> way<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:32.050> keeps<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.680> dimension<00:01:33.280> of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
so that way it keeps the dimension of

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.700 
so that way it keeps the dimension of
the<00:01:34.450> track<00:01:34.690> if<00:01:35.020> I<00:01:35.170> would<00:01:35.290> have<00:01:35.350> done<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.620> the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
the track if I would have done it the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.920 
the track if I would have done it the
other<00:01:35.740> way<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.160> track<00:01:36.750> obviously<00:01:37.750> did<00:01:37.870> the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
other way the track obviously did the

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.110 
other way the track obviously did the
shape<00:01:38.170> would<00:01:38.350> have<00:01:38.470> been<00:01:38.560> off<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:39.610> but<00:01:39.940> I<00:01:40.090> know

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
shape would have been off so but I know

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.880 
shape would have been off so but I know
there's<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.510> lot<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.750> white<00:01:40.930> but<00:01:41.320> for<00:01:41.650> what

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
there's a lot of white but for what

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.469 
there's a lot of white but for what
we're<00:01:42.040> using<00:01:42.250> it<00:01:42.490> for<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:42.820> can<00:01:42.940> always<00:01:43.150> trim

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
we're using it for you can always trim

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.840 
we're using it for you can always trim
it<00:01:43.540> after<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:44.170> fact<00:01:44.410> if<00:01:44.920> you're<00:01:45.430> really<00:01:45.580> that

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
anal but for me not that big of a deal

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.900 
anal but for me not that big of a deal
just<00:01:50.440> save<00:01:50.680> it<00:01:50.740> as<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.890> JPEG<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.640> we'll<00:01:51.729> call<00:01:51.850> it

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
just save it as a JPEG and we'll call it

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.930

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
let's drag it there we now need to size

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.610 
let's drag it there we now need to size
the<00:02:44.420> plane<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.049> let's<00:02:45.200> go<00:02:45.290> back<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.590> Google

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
the plane so let's go back to Google

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.000 
the plane so let's go back to Google
Earth<00:02:45.970> click<00:02:46.970> on<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.209> measure<00:02:47.450> tool<00:02:48.010> already

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
Earth click on the measure tool already

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.610 
Earth click on the measure tool already
in<00:02:49.099> meters<00:02:49.840> now<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.049> just<00:02:51.200> need<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.500> decide

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
in meters now you just need to decide

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.470 
in meters now you just need to decide
basically<00:02:52.610> two<00:02:53.060> points<00:02:54.069> from<00:02:55.069> here<00:02:55.610> I'm<00:02:56.180> gonna

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
basically two points from here I'm gonna

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.149 
basically two points from here I'm gonna
say<00:02:56.659> that<00:02:56.840> middle<00:02:57.080> of<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.260> X<00:02:57.470> of<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.799> infield

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
say that middle of the X of the infield

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:07.670 
say that middle of the X of the infield
Oval<00:02:58.549> will<00:02:59.269> work<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:02.720> looks<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.200> be<00:03:03.349> about

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.750 

22<00:03:08.680> metres<00:03:09.130> we'll<00:03:09.370> say<00:03:09.640> Oh<00:03:12.330> 22<00:03:13.330> metres<00:03:14.760> so

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
22 metres we'll say Oh 22 metres so

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.790 
22 metres we'll say Oh 22 metres so
let's<00:03:15.880> go<00:03:15.970> back<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.240> max<00:03:16.620> I'll<00:03:17.620> create<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.950> box

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.660 

and<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.670> will<00:03:23.910> do<00:03:24.800> 22<00:03:25.800> meters

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.520 

let's<00:03:31.270> select<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.780> plane<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.960> just<00:03:34.960> line<00:03:35.290> her

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
let's select the plane and just line her

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.760 
let's select the plane and just line her
up

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:51.430 

a<00:03:41.860> little<00:03:42.400> bit<00:03:42.550> more

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.540 

so<00:03:52.010> you<00:03:52.220> measured<00:03:52.550> it

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.480 

that's<00:03:56.210> pretty<00:03:56.630> close<00:03:56.900> now<00:03:57.530> just<00:03:57.950> a<00:03:58.190> good

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
that's pretty close now just a good

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.820 
that's pretty close now just a good
double-check

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
double-check

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.440 
double-check
put<00:04:00.830> bead<00:04:01.070> pick<00:04:01.400> maybe<00:04:01.610> two<00:04:01.850> other<00:04:01.970> points

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
put bead pick maybe two other points

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:15.800 
put bead pick maybe two other points
oops<00:04:05.800> let's<00:04:06.800> just<00:04:07.010> say<00:04:07.220> from<00:04:07.700> here

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:29.840 

so<00:04:16.380> what<00:04:16.500> is<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.970> 97.3

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.840 

looks<00:04:30.390> pretty<00:04:30.540> good<00:04:30.660> to<00:04:30.840> me<00:04:31.400> see<00:04:32.400> by<00:04:32.580> keeping

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
looks pretty good to me see by keeping

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.230 
looks pretty good to me see by keeping
the<00:04:33.090> texture<00:04:33.510> square<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.230> plain<00:04:34.590> square

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
the texture square and the plain square

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.180 
the texture square and the plain square
all<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.540> have<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.810> do<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.260> set<00:04:37.800> those<00:04:37.980> two

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
all you have to do is set those two

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.250 
all you have to do is set those two
points<00:04:38.640> and<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.880> rest<00:04:39.060> of<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.210> track<00:04:39.480> should

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
points and the rest of the track should

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.120 
points and the rest of the track should
be<00:04:40.670> pretty<00:04:41.670> close<00:04:42.000> dimension<00:04:42.750> wise<00:04:43.130> sometimes

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
be pretty close dimension wise sometimes

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.230 
be pretty close dimension wise sometimes
you<00:04:44.250> might<00:04:44.340> have<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.550> make<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.700> few<00:04:45.000> minor

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
you might have to make a few minor

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.780 
you might have to make a few minor
tweaks<00:04:45.630> but<00:04:46.110> overall<00:04:46.710> it's<00:04:47.130> it's<00:04:47.520> going<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:47.730> be

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
tweaks but overall it's it's going to be

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.780 
tweaks but overall it's it's going to be
very<00:04:47.940> close<00:04:48.680> now<00:04:49.680> we<00:04:49.740> can<00:04:49.980> zoom<00:04:50.160> out<00:04:50.310> here<00:04:50.370> and

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
very close now we can zoom out here and

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.330 
very close now we can zoom out here and
you<00:04:50.880> can<00:04:51.030> see<00:04:51.590> it's<00:04:52.590> just<00:04:52.830> like<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.310> other

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
you can see it's just like the other

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.330 
you can see it's just like the other
plane<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:53.790> had<00:04:54.060> on<00:04:54.240> there<00:04:54.480> now<00:04:54.900> it's<00:04:55.200> all<00:04:55.830> set<00:04:56.220> up

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
plane I had on there now it's all set up

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.760 
plane I had on there now it's all set up
and<00:04:56.520> ready<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.180> go<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.600> would<00:04:57.960> save<00:04:58.320> this<00:04:58.500> max

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
and ready to go I would save this max

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.950 
and ready to go I would save this max
filed<00:04:59.070> do<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.640> file<00:04:59.910> save<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.510> then<00:05:00.630> do<00:05:00.720> a<00:05:00.750> file

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
filed do a file save and then do a file

filed do a file save and then do a file
save<00:05:00.990> it<00:05:01.230> you<00:05:01.380> know<00:05:01.440> like<00:05:01.560> track<00:05:01.800> 1<00:05:02.010> and<00:05:02.250> then

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
save it you know like track 1 and then

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.680 
save it you know like track 1 and then
save<00:05:03.480> as<00:05:03.690> track<00:05:04.050> 2<00:05:04.290> so<00:05:05.010> if<00:05:05.370> you're<00:05:05.550> working<00:05:06.540> on

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
save as track 2 so if you're working on

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.000 
save as track 2 so if you're working on
your<00:05:06.870> mesh<00:05:06.990> working<00:05:07.350> on<00:05:07.440> your<00:05:07.560> mesh<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:07.980> you

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
your mesh working on your mesh and you

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.370 
your mesh working on your mesh and you
screw<00:05:08.340> it<00:05:08.460> up<00:05:08.610> at<00:05:09.120> least<00:05:09.540> you<00:05:09.810> can<00:05:09.990> come<00:05:10.200> back

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
screw it up at least you can come back

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.300 
screw it up at least you can come back
