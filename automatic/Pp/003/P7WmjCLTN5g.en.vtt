these are menus for trick shots in fact
I<00:00:16.049> think<00:00:16.109> they're<00:00:16.350> only<00:00:16.500> used<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:16.890> trick

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039

first<00:00:19.710> I'm<00:00:19.920> gonna<00:00:20.100> do<00:00:21.020> craw

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
first I'm gonna do craw

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.990 
first I'm gonna do craw
it's<00:00:22.949> basically<00:00:23.310> what<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.519> need<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.789> floors

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
it's basically what you need for floors

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.470 
it's basically what you need for floors
just<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.359> normal<00:00:24.750> controller<00:00:26.000> no<00:00:27.000> modding<00:00:27.359> or

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
just a normal controller no modding or

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.700 
just a normal controller no modding or
anything<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.960> don't<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.349> motor<00:00:28.560> controller

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
anything I don't have a motor controller

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.179 
anything I don't have a motor controller
as<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:29.789> see<00:00:30.060> um<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> normal<00:00:32.040> position

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
as you can see um so the normal position

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.850 
as you can see um so the normal position
would<00:00:32.550> be<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.030> with<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.690> thumb

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
would be like that with your thumb

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.700 
would be like that with your thumb
controlling<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:35.880> analog<00:00:36.300> stick<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.870> then

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
controlling the analog stick and then

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.490 
controlling the analog stick and then
that<00:00:37.950> finger<00:00:38.600> using<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> trigger<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.320> then

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that finger using the trigger and then

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.260 
that finger using the trigger and then
this<00:00:40.680> one<00:00:40.860> doing<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.190> as<00:00:41.340> well<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.910> find

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
this one doing that as well so I find

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.389 
this one doing that as well so I find
this<00:00:42.420> quite<00:00:43.110> hard<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> play<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.219> pass

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
this quite hard to play but I can pass

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.029 
this quite hard to play but I can pass
some<00:00:44.670> nice<00:00:44.850> trick<00:00:45.059> shots<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.450> that

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
some nice trick shots with that

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.420 
some nice trick shots with that
and<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.190> claw<00:00:48.920> basically<00:00:49.920> you're<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.190> here

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and now claw basically you're from here

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.510 
and now claw basically you're from here
and<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.910> use<00:00:51.420> your<00:00:51.449> index<00:00:51.870> finger<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.520> control

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
and you use your index finger to control

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.389 
and you use your index finger to control
the<00:00:53.820> Xbox<00:00:54.390> button<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.800> that's

the Xbox button here and that's

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.939 
the Xbox button here and that's
basically<00:00:56.910> how<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.090> use<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.500> your

go<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.840> stretch<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.530> don't<00:01:31.799> play<00:01:32.009> stretch

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
go on to stretch I don't play stretch

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.789 
go on to stretch I don't play stretch
well<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.670> find<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> really<00:01:33.210> hard<00:01:33.439> I'm<00:01:34.439> trying<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
well I find it really hard I'm trying to

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.200 
well I find it really hard I'm trying to
get<00:01:34.890> used<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.759> I'll

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
get used to it that you know I'll

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.780 
get used to it that you know I'll
probably<00:01:36.299> won't<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.750> any<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:37.020> at<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.790> I'm

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
probably won't be any good at it so I'm

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.450 
probably won't be any good at it so I'm
again<00:01:39.420> normal<00:01:39.810> position<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
again normal position is just that and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.539 
again normal position is just that and
then<00:01:42.350> stretch<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.829> called<00:01:44.070> stretch<00:01:44.369> because

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
then stretch it's called stretch because

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.200 
then stretch it's called stretch because
you<00:01:44.640> stretch<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.890> thumb<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> analog

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
you stretch your thumb on to the analog

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.149 
you stretch your thumb on to the analog
stick<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.780> spinning<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.649> spinning<00:01:49.920> stick

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
stick with a spinning the spinning stick

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.429 
stick with a spinning the spinning stick
if<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:52.020> one's<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
if you like and this one's for the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.999 
if you like and this one's for the
buttons<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.950> think<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:54.470> yes<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.829> use

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
buttons I think and yes you can just use

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.679 
buttons I think and yes you can just use
this<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.520> spin<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.060> don't<00:01:57.869> use<00:01:58.049> them<00:01:59.659> stretch<00:02:00.659> a

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
this to spin I don't use them stretch a

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.510 
this to spin I don't use them stretch a
lot<00:02:00.990> because<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.380> find<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.680> really<00:02:01.860> hard<00:02:02.009> so

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
lot because I find it really hard so

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.920 
lot because I find it really hard so
that's<00:02:02.759> basically<00:02:03.180> well<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.420> don't<00:02:03.630> use<00:02:03.750> that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
that's basically well I don't use that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.350 
that's basically well I don't use that
and<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.070> think<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.430> guess<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.880> can<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.270> like

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
and I think I guess you can have it like

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.730 
and I think I guess you can have it like
that<00:02:06.540> I'm<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:06.810> really<00:02:06.930> sure<00:02:07.200> because<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.560> don't

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that I'm not really sure because I don't

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.449 
that I'm not really sure because I don't
play<00:02:07.950> stretch<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> lot<00:02:08.840> Milius<00:02:09.840> we'll<00:02:09.989> find<00:02:10.200> out
