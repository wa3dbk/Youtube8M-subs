hello<00:00:11.080> my<00:00:11.770> name<00:00:12.040> is<00:00:12.070> Sean<00:00:12.430> Walker<00:00:12.970> and<00:00:13.120> today

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
hello my name is Sean Walker and today

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.090 
hello my name is Sean Walker and today
we<00:00:13.630> will<00:00:13.750> be<00:00:13.960> talking<00:00:14.200> about

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
we will be talking about

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.150 
we will be talking about
if<00:00:15.160> nature<00:00:15.610> of<00:00:15.790> light<00:00:16.059> it<00:00:17.020> just<00:00:17.080> so<00:00:17.500> turns<00:00:17.830> out

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
if nature of light it just so turns out

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.800 
if nature of light it just so turns out
that<00:00:18.490> we<00:00:18.640> can<00:00:18.820> describe<00:00:19.120> much<00:00:19.540> of<00:00:19.720> the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
that we can describe much of the

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:29.390 
that we can describe much of the
behavior<00:00:20.260> of<00:00:20.290> light<00:00:20.440> as<00:00:21.160> that<00:00:21.520> of<00:00:21.640> a<00:00:21.730> wave<00:00:27.810> um

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
behavior of light as that of a wave um

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.540 
behavior of light as that of a wave um
maybe<00:00:30.400> not<00:00:30.640> quite<00:00:31.420> like<00:00:31.870> that<00:00:32.200> first<00:00:33.160> let's

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
maybe not quite like that first let's

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.100 
maybe not quite like that first let's
look<00:00:33.820> at<00:00:33.940> a<00:00:34.000> couple<00:00:34.150> of<00:00:34.390> things<00:00:34.450> that<00:00:34.720> can<00:00:34.930> also

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
look at a couple of things that can also

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.700 
look at a couple of things that can also
be<00:00:35.379> described<00:00:35.830> as<00:00:36.010> waves<00:00:36.450> ripples<00:00:37.450> on<00:00:37.660> a<00:00:37.690> pond

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
be described as waves ripples on a pond

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.670 
be described as waves ripples on a pond
perhaps<00:00:39.100> sound<00:00:39.550> waves<00:00:39.820> now<00:00:40.720> well<00:00:41.290> these<00:00:41.470> are

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
perhaps sound waves now well these are

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.580 
perhaps sound waves now well these are
fine<00:00:42.010> examples<00:00:42.040> of<00:00:43.000> waves<00:00:43.300> they<00:00:43.989> do<00:00:44.050> have<00:00:44.559> a

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
fine examples of waves they do have a

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.390 
fine examples of waves they do have a
major<00:00:44.980> difference<00:00:45.580> between<00:00:45.730> them<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.480> light

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
major difference between them and light

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.160 
major difference between them and light
the<00:00:48.400> waves<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.879> just<00:00:49.150> described<00:00:49.690> are<00:00:49.930> what<00:00:50.050> is

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
the waves I just described are what is

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.740 
the waves I just described are what is
known<00:00:50.379> as<00:00:50.559> physical<00:00:51.129> waves<00:00:51.309> that<00:00:52.120> is<00:00:52.180> that

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
known as physical waves that is that

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.960 
known as physical waves that is that
they<00:00:52.900> need<00:00:53.140> to<00:00:53.280> some<00:00:54.280> sort<00:00:54.519> of<00:00:54.610> physical

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
they need to some sort of physical

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.479 
they need to some sort of physical
medium<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.690> travel<00:00:56.110> through<00:00:56.379> in<00:00:56.589> other<00:00:57.190> words

the wave travels through stuff light is

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.380 
the wave travels through stuff light is
different<00:01:02.370> light<00:01:03.370> is<00:01:03.610> an<00:01:03.940> electromagnetic

different light is an electromagnetic

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.610 
different light is an electromagnetic
wave<00:01:04.950> this<00:01:05.950> means<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.549> it<00:01:06.700> is<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:06.850> series<00:01:07.390> of

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.060 
physical and electromagnetic waves let's
try<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.190> following<00:01:18.700> thought<00:01:18.970> experiment

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
try the following thought experiment

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.499 
try the following thought experiment
let's<00:01:21.070> say<00:01:21.310> we<00:01:21.490> pumped<00:01:21.789> all<00:01:21.969> the<00:01:22.090> air<00:01:22.240> out<00:01:22.270> of

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
let's say we pumped all the air out of

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.469 
let's say we pumped all the air out of
this<00:01:22.689> room<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:24.369> would<00:01:24.520> no<00:01:24.700> longer<00:01:24.729> to<00:01:25.270> have

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
this room we would no longer to have

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.139 
this room we would no longer to have
have<00:01:25.869> any<00:01:26.049> medium<00:01:26.590> for<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.430> physical<00:01:27.909> waves

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
have any medium for the physical waves

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:42.990 
have any medium for the physical waves
to

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.350 

don't<00:01:43.600> worry<00:01:43.810> I'm<00:01:44.110> okay<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.820> was<00:01:45.940> supposed<00:01:46.240> to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
don't worry I'm okay it was supposed to

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.130 
don't worry I'm okay it was supposed to
be<00:01:46.510> a<00:01:46.540> thought<00:01:46.990> experiment<00:01:48.780> here's<00:01:49.780> here's<00:01:50.080> a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
be a thought experiment here's here's a

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.220 
be a thought experiment here's here's a
safety<00:01:50.770> tip<00:01:50.950> for<00:01:51.250> anyone<00:01:51.550> curious<00:01:52.300> about<00:01:52.750> the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
safety tip for anyone curious about the

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.870 
safety tip for anyone curious about the
difference<00:01:53.560> between<00:01:53.920> physical<00:01:54.130> waves<00:01:54.550> and

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
difference between physical waves and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.450 
difference between physical waves and
electromagnetic<00:01:55.750> waves<00:01:55.930> do<00:01:56.890> not<00:01:57.130> actually

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
electromagnetic waves do not actually

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.310 
electromagnetic waves do not actually
remove<00:01:58.360> all<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.780> air<00:01:59.190> from<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.370> room<00:02:00.580> it's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
remove all the air from the room it's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.570 
remove all the air from the room it's
generally<00:02:02.320> bad<00:02:02.890> for<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:04.800> but<00:02:05.800> back<00:02:06.070> back<00:02:06.400> to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
generally bad for you but back back to

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.630 
generally bad for you but back back to
the<00:02:06.700> point<00:02:06.940> that<00:02:07.060> I<00:02:07.120> was<00:02:07.300> trying<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.810> make<00:02:07.990> if

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
the point that I was trying to make if

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.470 
the point that I was trying to make if
we<00:02:09.640> did<00:02:10.800> have<00:02:11.800> an<00:02:12.220> airless<00:02:12.730> room<00:02:13.090> then<00:02:13.330> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
we did have an airless room then the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.390 
we did have an airless room then the
sound<00:02:13.810> would<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.830> no<00:02:15.160> medium<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:16.210> travel<00:02:16.660> on

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
sound would have no medium to travel on

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.040 
sound would have no medium to travel on
so<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.460> could<00:02:18.640> no<00:02:18.820> longer<00:02:18.850> hear<00:02:19.600> me

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
so you could no longer hear me

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.080 
so you could no longer hear me
but<00:02:20.950> since<00:02:21.190> light<00:02:21.460> is<00:02:21.490> an<00:02:21.790> electromagnetic

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
but since light is an electromagnetic

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.350 
but since light is an electromagnetic
wave<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:22.780> doesn't<00:02:23.350> need<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.590> medium<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:25.150> could

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
wave and doesn't need a medium you could

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.590 
wave and doesn't need a medium you could
still<00:02:25.600> see<00:02:25.900> me<00:02:29.430> here<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.640> typical<00:02:31.330> depiction

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
still see me here is a typical depiction

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.710 
still see me here is a typical depiction
of<00:02:31.960> an<00:02:32.140> electromagnetic<00:02:32.590> wave<00:02:33.330> we<00:02:34.330> have<00:02:34.360> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
of an electromagnetic wave we have the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.170 
of an electromagnetic wave we have the
series<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.290> perpendicular<00:02:36.040> electric<00:02:36.970> and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
series of perpendicular electric and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.270 
series of perpendicular electric and
magnetic<00:02:37.300> fields<00:02:38.080> propagating<00:02:39.040> through

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
magnetic fields propagating through

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.570 
magnetic fields propagating through
space<00:02:39.900> being<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:41.110> wave<00:02:41.350> we<00:02:42.070> can<00:02:42.250> then<00:02:42.400> use

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
space being a wave we can then use

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.180 
space being a wave we can then use
things<00:02:42.880> like<00:02:43.000> frequency<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.080> wavelength<00:02:44.530> to

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
things like frequency and wavelength to

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.850 
things like frequency and wavelength to
describe<00:02:45.610> them<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.900> is<00:02:47.080> probably<00:02:47.470> not<00:02:47.650> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
describe them this is probably not the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.910 
describe them this is probably not the
first<00:02:48.130> time<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.610> you've<00:02:48.730> heard<00:02:48.970> these<00:02:49.150> terms

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
first time that you've heard these terms

but is still finite from all this we can
now<00:04:12.909> use<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.180> wave<00:04:13.510> speed<00:04:13.900> equation<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.680> connect

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
now use a wave speed equation to connect

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.430 
now use a wave speed equation to connect
wavelength<00:04:15.849> frequency<00:04:16.269> and<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.139> speed<00:04:17.410> of

now<00:04:19.150> you<00:04:19.209> can<00:04:19.570> figure<00:04:19.840> out<00:04:19.959> just<00:04:20.109> how<00:04:20.560> big<00:04:20.919> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
now you can figure out just how big the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.060 
now you can figure out just how big the
radio<00:04:21.940> waves<00:04:22.330> broadcast<00:04:23.169> by<00:04:23.410> your<00:04:23.590> favorite

radio waves broadcast by your favorite
radio<00:04:24.250> station<00:04:24.940> really<00:04:25.330> are<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:26.080> that's

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
radio station really are and that's

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.260 
radio station really are and that's
pretty<00:04:27.340> nifty<00:04:27.610> stuff<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:29.910> so<00:04:30.910> we<00:04:31.120> now

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
pretty nifty stuff and so we now

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.300 
pretty nifty stuff and so we now
conclude<00:04:31.600> our<00:04:32.169> little<00:04:32.440> discussion<00:04:32.740> on<00:04:33.160> the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
conclude our little discussion on the

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.650 
conclude our little discussion on the
wave<00:04:33.490> nature<00:04:33.760> of<00:04:34.000> light

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
wave nature of light

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.439

to<00:04:35.350> summarize<00:04:35.919> light<00:04:36.729> is<00:04:36.910> an<00:04:37.030> electromagnetic

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
to summarize light is an electromagnetic

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.590 
to summarize light is an electromagnetic
wave<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.530> therefore<00:04:39.520> does<00:04:39.820> not<00:04:39.850> need<00:04:40.270> a

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
wave and therefore does not need a

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.040 
wave and therefore does not need a
physical<00:04:41.169> medium<00:04:41.350> to<00:04:42.010> travel<00:04:42.430> through<00:04:43.050> light

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
has a finite speed and the light that we

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.000 
has a finite speed and the light that we
see<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:47.979> just<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.970> bit<00:04:49.449> part<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.740> much
