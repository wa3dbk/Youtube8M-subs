00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.679 
like a paper then you want to be able to
cut<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.430> off<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.850> then<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:42.270> really

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
cut it on and off and then that's really

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.859 
cut it on and off and then that's really
what<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:42.990> unit<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.350> designed<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.970> Delta

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
what this unit is designed for the Delta

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.200 
what this unit is designed for the Delta
upland<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.280> Delta<00:01:47.490> sport<00:01:48.000> as

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
upland is just like the Delta sport as

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.569 
upland is just like the Delta sport as
far<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.810> majority<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.380> its<00:01:49.680> features<00:01:49.860> this

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
far as the majority of its features this

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.719 
far as the majority of its features this
is<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> Delta<00:01:51.030> upland<00:01:51.630> transmitter<00:01:52.729> several

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
is the Delta upland transmitter several

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.300 
is the Delta upland transmitter several
different<00:01:54.090> parts<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:55.009> you<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.159> your

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
you're on right now I am in a beeper low

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.850 
you're on right now I am in a beeper low
momentary<00:02:38.820> high<00:02:39.090> momentary<00:02:39.630> mode<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.110> so

momentary high momentary mode and so

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.170 
momentary high momentary mode and so
we're<00:02:41.040> going<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.250> show<00:02:41.400> how<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.670> controls<00:02:41.940> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
we're going to show how it controls the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.780 
we're going to show how it controls the
beeper<00:02:42.510> people<00:02:43.440> right<00:02:43.620> now<00:02:43.770> is<00:02:43.950> turned<00:02:44.250> off<00:02:44.490> in

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
beeper people right now is turned off in

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.250 
beeper people right now is turned off in
that<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.230> activated<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.330> is<00:02:48.870> not

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
that it's it's activated but it is not

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.020 
that it's it's activated but it is not
making<00:02:49.470> any<00:02:49.710> sound<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.280> then<00:02:50.460> in<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.640> field<00:02:50.880> I

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
making any sound and then in the field I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.490 
making any sound and then in the field I
want<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.270> turn<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.050> press<00:02:52.320> your

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
want to turn it on so you press your

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.940 
want to turn it on so you press your
button<00:02:52.680> once<00:02:53.960> beepers<00:02:54.960> now<00:02:55.140> turned<00:02:55.410> on<00:02:55.590> and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
button once beepers now turned on and

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.860 
button once beepers now turned on and
it's<00:02:56.190> going<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.340> kick<00:02:56.550> in<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.940> automatically

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
it's going to kick in to automatically

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.510 
it's going to kick in to automatically
into<00:02:58.050> point<00:02:58.320> mode<00:02:58.500> strictly<00:02:58.860> because<00:02:59.010> we<00:02:59.400> are

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
into point mode strictly because we are

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.310 
into point mode strictly because we are
not<00:02:59.640> moving<00:03:00.060> now<00:03:00.900> I'm<00:03:01.050> going<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.260> cut<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.470> off

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
not moving now I'm going to cut it off

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.320 
not moving now I'm going to cut it off
so<00:03:04.320> now<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.530> beepers<00:03:04.860> off<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.250> need<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:06.030> again

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
so now the beepers off I need it again

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.010 
so now the beepers off I need it again
strictly<00:03:06.800> target<00:03:07.800> on<00:03:08.420> goes<00:03:09.420> back<00:03:09.600> into<00:03:09.750> point

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
strictly target on goes back into point

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.380 
strictly target on goes back into point
mode<00:03:12.320> cut<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.410> off<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:14.240> still<00:03:15.240> have

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
mode cut it off and still have

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.470 
mode cut it off and still have
stimulation<00:03:16.640> one<00:03:17.640> other<00:03:17.790> feature<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.330> this

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
stimulation one other feature that this

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.570 
stimulation one other feature that this
this<00:03:18.750> caller<00:03:18.990> has<00:03:19.290> just<00:03:20.190> like<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.400> Delta

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
this caller has just like the Delta

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.310 
this caller has just like the Delta
sport<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.060> also<00:03:21.240> has<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.570> built<00:03:21.900> in<00:03:22.020> bark

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
sport it also has a built in bark

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.590 
sport it also has a built in bark
limiter<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:23.880> using<00:03:24.240> your<00:03:24.270> mode<00:03:24.570> button

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
limiter and so using your mode button

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.490 
limiter and so using your mode button
you<00:03:25.590> move<00:03:25.800> over<00:03:26.070> here<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.840> picture<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.260> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
you move over here to the picture of the

gone from being an e collar to a bark

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.830 
gone from being an e collar to a bark
collar<00:03:34.550> just<00:03:35.550> like<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.790> Delta<00:03:36.060> sport<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.570> is

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
collar just like the Delta sport it is

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.230 
collar just like the Delta sport it is
the<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:38.400> rising<00:03:38.940> stimulation<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:41.010> when<00:03:41.850> when

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
the the rising stimulation so when when

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.390 
the the rising stimulation so when when
the<00:03:42.330> dog<00:03:42.480> barks<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:43.310> increases<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
the dog barks it increases the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.820 
the dog barks it increases the
stimulation<00:03:44.820> as<00:03:45.090> needed<00:03:45.570> what's<00:03:46.560> nice<00:03:46.800> about

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
stimulation as needed what's nice about

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.340 
stimulation as needed what's nice about
these<00:03:47.340> bark<00:03:47.700> collars<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.660> because<00:03:49.230> you

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
these bark collars is that because you

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.050 
these bark collars is that because you
have<00:03:49.470> control<00:03:49.620> from<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:49.980> transmitter<00:03:50.490> when
