00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900 
have any clips recorded because
sometimes<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.860> Clips<00:00:47.190> before<00:00:47.280> I

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
sometimes like it Clips before I

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.869 
sometimes like it Clips before I
actually<00:00:48.719> do<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> day<00:00:49.399> but<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.430> don't<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.730> any

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
actually do the day but I don't have any

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.760 
actually do the day but I don't have any
clips<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.539> I'll<00:00:51.930> probably<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.590> something

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
clips so I'll probably can get something

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.209 
clips so I'll probably can get something
tomorrow<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:54.440> just<00:00:55.440> give<00:00:55.649> me<00:00:55.710> an<00:00:55.800> update<00:00:55.890> what

I'm<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.520> doing<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:57.390> should<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.660> in

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
I'm going to be doing we should be in

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
I'm going to be doing we should be in
some<00:00:57.960> Chinese<00:00:58.170> food<00:00:58.410> soon<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.399> song<00:00:59.640> is

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
some Chinese food soon this song is

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.830 
some Chinese food soon this song is
really<00:00:59.850> where<00:01:00.149> I've<00:01:00.270> never<00:01:00.449> actually<00:01:00.660> been

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
really where I've never actually been

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.490 
really where I've never actually been
outside<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.770> many<00:01:01.949> times<00:01:02.010> before<00:01:03.500> so

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
outside that that many times before so

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.260 
outside that that many times before so
we<00:01:04.799> should<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:05.070> having<00:01:05.189> Chinese<00:01:05.700> food<00:01:05.729> soon

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
like something i know i guess i could

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.539 
like something i know i guess i could
hold<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.290> now<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.310> really

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
hold this for now but it's not really

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.090
