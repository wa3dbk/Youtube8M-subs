00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
some people think that it won't but let

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.739 
some people think that it won't but let
me<00:00:24.189> tell<00:00:24.460> you<00:00:24.550> why<00:00:24.669> I<00:00:24.699> will<00:00:25.029> because<00:00:25.419> this<00:00:25.570> is

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:25.749 
me tell you why I will because this is

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.839 
me tell you why I will because this is
further<00:00:26.019> indication<00:00:26.769> that<00:00:26.980> you<00:00:27.519> don't<00:00:27.730> know

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
further indication that you don't know

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.300 
further indication that you don't know
who<00:00:28.150> what<00:00:28.990> when<00:00:29.259> we<00:00:29.529> win<00:00:30.490> wire<00:00:30.759> how<00:00:32.310> somebody's

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
who what when we win wire how somebody's

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.300 
who what when we win wire how somebody's
cheating<00:00:33.520> you<00:00:34.090> know<00:00:34.210> there's<00:00:34.420> no<00:00:34.570> face<00:00:34.960> to<00:00:35.890> a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
cheating you know there's no face to a

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.960 
cheating you know there's no face to a
cheater<00:00:36.730> and<00:00:37.570> so<00:00:38.470> this<00:00:38.800> is<00:00:38.980> why<00:00:39.190> i<00:00:39.220> think<00:00:40.080> that

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
cheater and so this is why i think that

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.520 
cheater and so this is why i think that
Floyd<00:00:42.970> will<00:00:43.360> strongly<00:00:43.840> strongly<00:00:44.290> push<00:00:45.000> for

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530

the<00:00:47.530> testing<00:00:48.340> all<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.700> way<00:00:48.790> up<00:00:48.970> to<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.360> fight

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the testing all the way up to the fight

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.270 
the testing all the way up to the fight
this<00:00:50.890> will<00:00:51.070> further<00:00:51.280> solidify<00:00:52.060> that<00:00:53.160> into<00:00:54.160> the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
this will further solidify that into the

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.490 
this will further solidify that into the
negotiations<00:00:55.150> I'm<00:00:55.690> not<00:00:55.930> saying<00:00:56.140> that<00:00:56.350> this

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
negotiations I'm not saying that this

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.200 
negotiations I'm not saying that this
was<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:56.710> deal<00:00:57.040> breaker<00:00:57.070> any<00:00:57.610> more<00:00:57.880> than<00:00:58.120> the

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
was a deal breaker any more than the

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.060 
was a deal breaker any more than the
goat<00:00:58.390> edition<00:00:58.570> but<00:00:59.170> if<00:00:59.440> there<00:00:59.620> was<00:00:59.770> a<00:00:59.800> cut-off

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
goat edition but if there was a cut-off

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.020 
goat edition but if there was a cut-off
window<00:01:00.780> by<00:01:01.780> building<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.350> that<00:01:02.710> that<00:01:02.980> is<00:01:03.700> put

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
window by building that that that is put

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.960 
window by building that that that is put
back<00:01:04.239> on<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.659> table<00:01:05.040> um<00:01:06.040> we<00:01:06.580> do<00:01:06.729> know<00:01:06.939> that

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
back on the table um we do know that

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.940 
back on the table um we do know that
Floyd<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.540> talking<00:01:07.900> about<00:01:08.110> no<00:01:08.320> fifty-fifty

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
split and different things like that but

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.669 
split and different things like that but
I<00:01:11.770> think<00:01:12.219> with<00:01:12.429> this<00:01:12.609> test<00:01:13.299> of<00:01:13.539> a<00:01:13.679> high-profile

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
I think with this test of a high-profile

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.410 
I think with this test of a high-profile
guy<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:15.310> guy<00:01:15.999> with<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.270> belt<00:01:16.659> a<00:01:16.990> guy<00:01:17.499> in<00:01:18.429> in<00:01:19.210> the

the<00:01:57.520> brutality<00:01:58.149> that<00:01:58.179> coral<00:01:58.689> suffered<00:01:59.139> we

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
the brutality that coral suffered we

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.789 
the brutality that coral suffered we
automatically<00:02:00.100> thought<00:02:00.399> that<00:02:00.609> and<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.869> would

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
automatically thought that and so would

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.669 
automatically thought that and so would
this<00:02:02.979> be<00:02:03.189> another<00:02:03.490> high-profile<00:02:04.270> fight<00:02:04.679> with

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
this be another high-profile fight with

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.919 
this be another high-profile fight with
boxing<00:02:06.189> being<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.909> brutal<00:02:07.209> sport<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.779> is

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
I think we have to have this testing

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.330 
I think we have to have this testing
done<00:02:12.670> this<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> very<00:02:14.200> very<00:02:14.560> very<00:02:14.709> big<00:02:15.280> issue
