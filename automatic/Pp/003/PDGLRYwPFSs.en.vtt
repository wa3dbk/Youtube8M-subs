that<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.840> think<00:00:13.170> are<00:00:13.290> probably<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.769> top

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
that I think are probably the top

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.880 
that I think are probably the top
contenders<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.179> your<00:00:15.389> pocket<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.650> guys

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
contenders for your pocket and you guys

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.680

can<00:00:17.130> decide<00:00:17.190> for<00:00:17.550> yourselves<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.480> one

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
can decide for yourselves so the one

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.210 
can decide for yourselves so the one
that<00:00:18.869> I'd<00:00:18.990> probably<00:00:19.020> recommend<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.920> most

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
that I'd probably recommend the most

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.179 
that I'd probably recommend the most
would<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.330> google<00:00:21.750> nexus<00:00:22.020> 4<00:00:22.560> not<00:00:23.070> only

you're doing vlogging this is probably

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.240 
you're doing vlogging this is probably
something<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.750> consider<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
something and consider for you and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.360 
something and consider for you and
also<00:02:11.400> runs<00:02:11.640> obviously<00:02:12.210> iOS<00:02:12.720> 6<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.010> iphone

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
also runs obviously iOS 6 so the iphone

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.160 
also runs obviously iOS 6 so the iphone
does<00:02:14.610> have<00:02:14.820> quite<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.120> few<00:02:15.180> advantages<00:02:15.540> over<00:02:16.080> an

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
does have quite a few advantages over an

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
android phone and the android phone at

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.730 
android phone and the android phone at
the<00:02:18.180> other<00:02:18.480> hand<00:02:18.750> will<00:02:18.900> still<00:02:19.200> have<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> lot<00:02:19.710> of

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
the other hand will still have a lot of

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.460 
the other hand will still have a lot of
advantages<00:02:20.310> over<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.670> iphone<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.750> my<00:02:22.140> final

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
advantages over the iphone but my final

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.230 
advantages over the iphone but my final
conclusion<00:02:22.950> would<00:02:23.070> be<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.490> would<00:02:23.520> be<00:02:23.610> based<00:02:24.000> on

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
conclusion would be it would be based on

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.420 
conclusion would be it would be based on
the<00:02:24.600> consumer<00:02:25.110> itself<00:02:25.650> everybody's

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
the consumer itself everybody's

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.560 
the consumer itself everybody's
different<00:02:26.610> everybody<00:02:27.270> would<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.540> a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
different everybody would like a

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.030 
different everybody would like a
different<00:02:27.990> operating<00:02:28.260> system<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.890> it's

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
different operating system so it's

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.920 
different operating system so it's
really<00:02:29.190> up<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.640> try<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.150> out<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.360> deciding

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
really up to you try it out and deciding

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.570 
really up to you try it out and deciding
whether<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.320> would<00:02:31.440> like<00:02:31.620> an<00:02:31.800> iPhone<00:02:32.250> or<00:02:32.520> an

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
whether you would like an iPhone or an

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.060 
whether you would like an iPhone or an
Android<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.140> next<00:02:34.200> phone<00:02:34.590> I'm<00:02:34.860> going<00:02:35.010> to

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.580 
reason why you go for a new nokia lumia
920<00:04:45.040> is<00:04:45.340> because<00:04:45.700> of<00:04:45.820> its<00:04:45.910> camera<00:04:46.300> features<00:04:46.660> it

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
920 is because of its camera features it

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.350 
920 is because of its camera features it
also<00:04:47.710> has<00:04:47.890> a<00:04:47.920> 1.3<00:04:48.550> megapixel<00:04:49.090> front<00:04:49.300> facing

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
also has a 1.3 megapixel front facing

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.900 
also has a 1.3 megapixel front facing
camera<00:04:50.050> so<00:04:50.560> this<00:04:50.800> phone<00:04:51.130> actually<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.610> really

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
camera so this phone actually a really

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.790 
camera so this phone actually a really
good<00:04:52.030> camera<00:04:52.570> it's<00:04:52.780> still<00:04:53.140> probably<00:04:53.410> very

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
good camera it's still probably very

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.290 
good camera it's still probably very
comparable<00:04:54.190> to<00:04:54.520> the<00:04:54.670> other<00:04:54.850> phones<00:04:55.120> on<00:04:55.270> the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
comparable to the other phones on the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.690 
comparable to the other phones on the
market<00:04:55.450> like<00:04:56.170> the<00:04:56.290> samsung<00:04:56.680> galaxy<00:04:57.040> s3<00:04:57.160> or<00:04:57.460> the

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
market like the samsung galaxy s3 or the

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.720 
market like the samsung galaxy s3 or the
iphone<00:04:58.030> 5<00:04:58.420> but<00:04:59.020> in<00:04:59.110> my<00:04:59.260> opinion<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.680> windows<00:05:00.520> 8

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
iphone 5 but in my opinion the windows 8

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.310 
iphone 5 but in my opinion the windows 8
interface<00:05:00.970> is<00:05:01.300> simple<00:05:01.330> but<00:05:01.810> something<00:05:02.140> that<00:05:02.290> i

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
interface is simple but something that i

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.680 
interface is simple but something that i
probably<00:05:02.680> wouldn't<00:05:03.070> use<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:04.330> app<00:05:04.660> store

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
probably wouldn't use and the app store

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.890 
probably wouldn't use and the app store
is<00:05:05.290> quite<00:05:05.980> limited<00:05:06.220> as<00:05:06.610> of<00:05:06.820> now<00:05:07.060> but<00:05:07.630> this<00:05:07.780> is

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
is quite limited as of now but this is

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.300 
is quite limited as of now but this is
definitely<00:05:08.080> an<00:05:08.350> operating<00:05:08.770> system<00:05:08.830> that<00:05:09.190> has

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
definitely an operating system that has

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.280 
definitely an operating system that has
a<00:05:09.340> lot<00:05:09.670> of<00:05:09.730> potential<00:05:10.180> so<00:05:10.510> look<00:05:10.720> out<00:05:10.840> for<00:05:11.110> it<00:05:11.170> in

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
a lot of potential so look out for it in

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.960 
a lot of potential so look out for it in
the<00:05:11.410> future<00:05:11.560> but<00:05:12.280> at<00:05:12.400> this<00:05:12.520> point<00:05:12.700> it<00:05:12.850> won't

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970
