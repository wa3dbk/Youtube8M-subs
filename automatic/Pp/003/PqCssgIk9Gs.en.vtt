00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.230
 [Music] 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.299
 on Sunday if in the match with central 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.280
 an important match in a week 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.510
 short with many matches that go to 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.550
 have to face how they were 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.230
 preparing and how they do to work 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.770
 knowing that they have three commitments in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.240
 7 days if first prepare this which is 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.590
 that for us it is going to be a party 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.900
 important on the difficult court they 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.420
 they do strong local so it's going to be 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.519
 a very dynamic match we will try 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.650
 to manage it ourselves to prove what 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.809
 what we did on the first date 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.750
 to continue in that line that 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.800
 we know that playing like that 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.590
 we had a lot of chance to win the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.760
 match after quickly preparing the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.550
 match one of cross that we're going to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.930
 have a lot of time but but they're going to 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.000
 It's also going to be important because we're going 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.489
 to play from home so I hope it's 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.719
 a favorable week for us 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.480
 you also in defense had a 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.610
 low average surprise the one of maidana like 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.940
 how do you take it 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.980
 a pity because he is a great player of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.480
 a lot of personality the other day 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.850
 good was one of the figures 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.640
 we were we were fine but I think 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.770
 with german 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.870
 he is a player who knows very well that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.250
 position has has many conditions 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.500
 I already show it so let's hope to do 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.320
 another great game in defense for the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.670
 team does not suffer and that we can obviously 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.290
 win the match for moro in 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.820
 conference said he had a very three 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.440
 good heads and name you 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.600
 also between one of them are you with the 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.020
 with the illusion of converting a goal 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.060
 I hope the always there is some 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.720
 corner of a ball in favor one always 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.539
 has the illusion to try to think 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.820
 that you can get to first win not in 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.340
 the rival area later if you can 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.830
 Convert it would be very good so 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.020
 hopefully but as we always talk about that 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.640
 the goal does whatever the subject is going to 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.710
 be in that in which we win starting 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.750
 good they go for rosary as are the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.610
 travels I'll be on is pretty clear 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.929
 with many trips with river like traveling 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.770
 inland with a lot of people who 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.960
 receive is the truth that where we go in 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.149
 this club people behave wonderfully 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.220
 we always get very good there 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.460
 many people in any part of the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.860
 inside that we go 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.080
 let's go to lunch I think I sleep 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.120
 nap after we leave short trips and 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.030
 then good to rest there for the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.470
 party so let's hope we can 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.300
 give a joy to the people who are 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.580
 there and the one that is going to see it on television 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.110
 here also luckily played Saturday to the 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.360
 concentration because yesterday was san 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.470
 valentine how was this celebration well 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.420
 I have the family 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.240
 we take advantage to leave between all and 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.400
 sure in the week we will celebrate the 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.140
 it can be a little more intimate but but fine 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.480
 well we had a nice time so how is 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.610
 My family is one too south 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.280
 It makes you happy because there are your 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.250
 affections so hopefully the week that 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.250
 come on let's be encouraging imagine if 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.140
 always always support good when 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.300
 when they can go to the court and they can 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.160
 come well but unfortunately now 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.480
 as they can not go as a visitor, and 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.500
 well the trips do not go either but 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.500
 they are always there supporting 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.489
