worlds it should only use T 2 gigabytes
of<00:01:54.689> RAM<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.710> launch<00:01:55.979> minecraft<00:01:56.399> now<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.659> a

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
of RAM to launch minecraft now this is a

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.749 
of RAM to launch minecraft now this is a
really<00:01:58.110> really<00:01:58.259> good<00:01:58.469> system<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.340> want<00:01:59.579> it

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
really really good system if you want it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.550 
really really good system if you want it
so<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:02.479> if<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.719> want<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.350> that

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
so that you know if you want it so that

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.550 
so that you know if you want it so that
you<00:02:04.799> only<00:02:05.009> at<00:02:05.490> once<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.540> certain<00:02:07.110> amount<00:02:07.320> of

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
you only at once a certain amount of

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.369 
you only at once a certain amount of
your<00:02:07.770> RAM<00:02:08.129> memory<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.360> used<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> certain

your RAM memory to be used on a certain
thing

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
thing

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.120 
thing
and<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.300> help<00:02:12.599> with<00:02:13.020> within<00:02:13.650> actually

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
and it can help with within actually

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.660 
and it can help with within actually
aiding<00:02:15.080> not<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.319> much<00:02:16.500> lag<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:17.010> your<00:02:17.160> computer

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
aiding not so much lag on your computer

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.640 
aiding not so much lag on your computer
as<00:02:17.880> well<00:02:17.910> because<00:02:18.420> if<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.780> distribute<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
as well because if you distribute the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.360 
as well because if you distribute the
RAM<00:02:20.300> more<00:02:21.590> better<00:02:22.590> than<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.010> actually<00:02:23.130> does

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
RAM more better than it actually does

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.120 
RAM more better than it actually does
with<00:02:23.849> in<00:02:23.970> Minecraft<00:02:24.510> itself<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.650> may<00:02:25.830> turn

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
with in Minecraft itself you may turn

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.190 
with in Minecraft itself you may turn
out<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.340> get<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> bit<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.060> performance<00:02:27.720> boost

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
out to get a bit of a performance boost

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.410 
out to get a bit of a performance boost
now<00:02:28.830> obviously<00:02:29.010> I'm<00:02:29.550> giving<00:02:29.850> good<00:02:30.000> i'll<00:02:30.209> go<00:02:30.360> to

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
now obviously I'm giving good i'll go to

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.990 
now obviously I'm giving good i'll go to
give<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.840> big<00:02:31.230> disclaimer<00:02:31.770> here<00:02:32.250> before<00:02:32.610> i<00:02:32.640> end

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.540 
give a big disclaimer here before i end
the<00:02:33.150> video<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.930> that's<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.290> fact<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.709> i'm

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
the video and that's the fact that i'm

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.600 
the video and that's the fact that i'm
not<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.819> complete<00:02:36.300> expert<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:37.190> ram<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.459> how

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
not a complete expert on ram and how

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.509 
not a complete expert on ram and how
much<00:02:38.790> he<00:02:38.970> uses<00:02:39.420> on<00:02:39.569> minecraft<00:02:40.140> but<00:02:40.860> i<00:02:41.099> just

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
much he uses on minecraft but i just

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.190 
much he uses on minecraft but i just
wanted<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.849> make<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.269> video<00:02:42.450> because<00:02:42.630> this

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
wanted to make this video because this

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.290 
wanted to make this video because this
guy<00:02:43.410> needs<00:02:43.709> as<00:02:43.920> much<00:02:44.100> testers<00:02:44.640> as<00:02:44.790> he<00:02:44.910> can<00:02:45.090> get

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
guy needs as much testers as he can get

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.800 
guy needs as much testers as he can get
so<00:02:46.040> download<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.190> executable<00:02:47.970> test<00:02:48.569> it<00:02:48.720> on

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
so download the executable test it on

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.600 
so download the executable test it on
your<00:02:48.870> computer<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.680> see<00:02:49.920> if<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.190> does<00:02:50.370> make<00:02:50.580> a

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
your computer and see if it does make a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.240 
your computer and see if it does make a
difference<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.510> if<00:02:52.049> it<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.470> actually<00:02:52.709> easier

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
difference and if it is actually easier

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.280
