00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.340
 his inaugural address president 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.559
 Obama actually answered the question of 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.110
 will the us continue the policy of intervention 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.820
 let's listen to him we will strengthen 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.919
 institutions that help us 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.759
 to carry out a crisis settlement by 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.530
 the whole planet 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.740
 because it is the most powerful state 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.140
 most interested in the world we are 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.390
 we will support democracy from asia to 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.530
 Africa from the Americas to 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.840
 middle east 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.180
 because our interests and our conscience 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:37.390
 prompts us to act on behalf of those who 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:39.160
 craves freedom from asia to africa from 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.440
 American continent to the near 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.850
 east in other words all over the world so 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.380
 what can you expect American 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.170
 intrusions at virtually any point 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.950
 statements come to mind on the globe 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.360
 george bush 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.030
 spreading freedom and democracy 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.200
 which the United States carried out mainly with 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.270
 using bombardment 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.309
 Obama's statements however there is nothing 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.870
 strange for those who followed him 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.420
 policies over the last four 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.550
 years without declaring war us took 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.560
 these are involved using the point program 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.390
 types in different countries about foreign 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.250
 politics they made the so-called 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.110
 turn Kazy having increased his military 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.330
 presence in the region to 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.460
 confront the growing influence of china 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.110
 Recently, the topic of so many 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.900
 debates and discussions in the American media 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.240
 became the us foreign policy and further 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.400
 Presidentâ€™s steps in this area almost all 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.560
 believe that the United States will invade there 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.210
 where can this idea in every possible way 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.760
 implanted by the Americans and not even 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.170
 discussed meanwhile the barrack obama every 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.600
 week approves new list 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.060
 candidates for liquidation as well as bases for 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.189
 drones but for some reason these 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.080
 measures are not perceived as aggressive and 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.570
 do not cause complaints from the American 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.460
 citizens, moreover, many say that 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.560
 Obama behaves and half wrong 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.930
 aggressively like george bush or mit romney 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.790
 be they in his place like that bye 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.009
 American soldiers do not land 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.890
 other countries while wars are waged through 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.450
 third countries without direct US participation 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.060
 Americans support such a policy and 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.869
 does not consider her aggressive 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.850
 irresponsible blitzkrieg in Libya 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.950
 succumbed as an example of a successful company 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.530
 true after the death of the American ambassador 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.560
 brag about success and ignore chaos 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.010
 in this country was not an example harder 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.409
 it turns out the main thing is not really 10 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.689
 and the president and his image is obama good 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.760
 says he has a beautiful smile does 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.329
 you can expect him to aggression pursuit 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.129
 image 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:27.939
 that's what the whole american is built on 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.939
 politics let alalia in the cold xr
