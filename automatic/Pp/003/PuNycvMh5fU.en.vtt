00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.760 
capital F again that the uppercase F a
are<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.590> now

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
are and so they know we have now

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.640 
are and so they know we have now
completed<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.670> time<00:01:26.939> now<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.080> looks<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.530> if

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
completed on time now it looks as if

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.109 
completed on time now it looks as if
it's<00:01:28.799> upside<00:01:28.979> down<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:29.460> when<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.729> turn<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
it's upside down but when you turn the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.550 
it's upside down but when you turn the
stick<00:01:30.390> around<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.409> actually

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
stick around like that you can actually

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.880 
stick around like that you can actually
see<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.990> backwards<00:01:33.990> right<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> so

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
see that it is backwards right and so

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.899 
see that it is backwards right and so
