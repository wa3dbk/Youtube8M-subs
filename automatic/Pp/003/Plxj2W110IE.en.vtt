times but that presents some problems

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.269 
times but that presents some problems
when<00:00:27.060> you're<00:00:27.180> dealing<00:00:27.570> with<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.810> various<00:00:28.279> tip

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
when you're dealing with the various tip

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.160 
when you're dealing with the various tip
ups<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.730> first<00:00:30.210> there<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.570> something<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.019> can

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
do with the wind tip oh right yeah there

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.250 
do with the wind tip oh right yeah there
sure<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.000> Doug<00:00:33.420> there's<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> couple<00:00:33.899> things<00:00:34.170> you

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
sure as Doug there's a couple things you

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560 
sure as Doug there's a couple things you
can<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.100> backside<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.910> rocker<00:00:36.149> arm<00:00:36.450> on

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
can do the backside of the rocker arm on

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.389 
can do the backside of the rocker arm on
the<00:00:36.690> windlass<00:00:37.020> actually<00:00:37.620> has<00:00:37.739> two<00:00:37.950> springs

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the windlass actually has two springs

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.850 
the windlass actually has two springs
here<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.270> there's<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.510> light<00:00:39.989> tension<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
here and there's a light tension and a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.100 
here and there's a light tension and a
heavy<00:00:41.070> tension<00:00:41.550> spring<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.540> if<00:00:42.600> using<00:00:42.930> lighter

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
heavy tension spring so if using lighter

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.049 
heavy tension spring so if using lighter
baits<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.950> go<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.399> later<00:00:44.610> spring

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
baits you can go with that later spring

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.360 
baits you can go with that later spring
for<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> heavier<00:00:45.960> baits<00:00:46.260> there's<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.039> heavier

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
for the heavier baits there's a heavier

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.910 
for the heavier baits there's a heavier
calm<00:00:47.879> spring<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.710> big

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
calm spring on here and a really big

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.459 
calm spring on here and a really big
stuff<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.370> we're<00:00:50.550> using<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.960> use<00:00:52.110> both

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
stuff like we're using you can use both

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.110 
stuff like we're using you can use both
springs<00:00:52.890> which<00:00:53.250> really<00:00:53.489> increases<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
springs which really increases the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.029 
springs which really increases the
amount<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.360> tension<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:55.530> another<00:00:55.770> thing

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
amount of tension then another thing

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.970 
amount of tension then another thing
that<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.640> addition<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
that you can do in addition here to

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.229 
that you can do in addition here to
sliding<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> adjustment<00:00:59.520> bracket<00:00:59.879> back<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
sliding the adjustment bracket back and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.599 
sliding the adjustment bracket back and
forth<00:01:00.500> is<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.800> actually<00:01:01.980> turn<00:01:02.340> this

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
forth is you can actually turn this

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.469 
forth is you can actually turn this
adjustment<00:01:03.120> bracket<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> side<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
adjustment bracket out to the side and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.000 
adjustment bracket out to the side and
that<00:01:06.479> really<00:01:06.840> increases<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.500> tension<00:01:07.920> on

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
that really increases the tension on

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.380 
that really increases the tension on
those<00:01:08.189> Springs<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.790> you're<00:01:08.939> using<00:01:09.090> really

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
those Springs so if you're using really

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
those Springs so if you're using really
big<00:01:09.750> baits<00:01:10.130> that'll<00:01:11.130> give<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.340> all<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
big baits that'll give you all the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.010 
big baits that'll give you all the
motion<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> tension<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.310> need

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
motion and all the tension that you need

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.590 
motion and all the tension that you need
okay<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.080> that's<00:01:16.439> one<00:01:16.650> that's<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.729> thing<00:01:18.000> if

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
okay so that's one that's one thing if

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.030 
okay so that's one that's one thing if
you<00:01:18.689> want<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.110> some<00:01:19.259> big<00:01:19.470> baits<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:20.009> a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
you want to do some big baits with a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.499 
you want to do some big baits with a
with<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> windlass<00:01:20.790> tip<00:01:20.970> up<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.360> course

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
with the windlass tip up and of course

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.320 
with the windlass tip up and of course
that's<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.020> tip<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.280> adds<00:01:23.460> movement<00:01:23.640> but

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
that's the tip up that adds movement but

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.480 
that's the tip up that adds movement but
with<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> straight<00:01:24.780> polar<00:01:25.049> tip<00:01:25.380> up<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:26.369> I've

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
with a straight polar tip up what I've

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.249 
with a straight polar tip up what I've
done<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.970> I've<00:01:27.119> added<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.570> piece<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.930> tip<00:01:28.110> up

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
done is I've added a piece of tip up

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.929 
done is I've added a piece of tip up
line<00:01:28.470> right<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.040> I've<00:01:29.340> connected<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
line right here and I've connected it to

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.440 
line right here and I've connected it to
a<00:01:30.090> snap<00:01:30.540> or<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.700> kind<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.970> clip<00:01:33.210> weight

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
a snap or it's a the kind of clip weight

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.200 
a snap or it's a the kind of clip weight
that<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.200> would<00:01:34.320> use<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.770> release<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.610> with

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
that you would use as a release for with

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.330 
that you would use as a release for with
downriggers<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> basically<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.070> tied

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
downriggers and basically it's just tied
