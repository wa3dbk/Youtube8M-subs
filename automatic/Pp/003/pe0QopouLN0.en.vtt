you out so let's start off with the
packaging<00:00:04.980> so<00:00:05.100> that's<00:00:05.220> what<00:00:05.310> you're<00:00:05.400> gonna

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
packaging so that's what you're gonna

packaging so that's what you're gonna
see<00:00:05.700> first<00:00:06.230> now<00:00:07.230> this<00:00:07.529> box<00:00:07.710> here<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.160> from<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
see first now this box here is from the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.959 
see first now this box here is from the
fake<00:00:08.670> wave<00:00:08.910> fairs<00:00:09.889> so<00:00:10.889> normally<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.790> box

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
fake wave fairs so normally the box

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.970 
fake wave fairs so normally the box
would<00:00:12.269> look<00:00:12.450> pretty<00:00:12.690> good<00:00:12.990> actually<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.830> looks

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
would look pretty good actually it looks

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.660 
would look pretty good actually it looks
almost<00:00:14.190> just<00:00:15.120> as<00:00:15.269> good<00:00:15.420> as<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.630> real<00:00:15.750> box<00:00:16.020> here

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
almost just as good as the real box here

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.189 
almost just as good as the real box here
the<00:00:17.670> only<00:00:17.820> real<00:00:18.119> difference<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.869> could<00:00:19.020> spot

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
the only real difference I could spot

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.150 
the only real difference I could spot
here<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.730> cardboard<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.160> more

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
here is that the cardboard here is more

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.929 
here is that the cardboard here is more
of<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.369> glossy<00:00:23.699> finish<00:00:25.519> whereas<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:26.820> is

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
of a glossy finish whereas this one is

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.320 
of a glossy finish whereas this one is
more<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.269> matte<00:00:28.550> textured<00:00:29.550> finish<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.300> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
more of a matte textured finish but I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.030 
more of a matte textured finish but I
mean<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> printing<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.019> both<00:00:31.260> seems<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.920> be

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
mean the printing on both seems to be

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.000 
mean the printing on both seems to be
about<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.219> same<00:00:32.489> quality<00:00:33.320> I've<00:00:34.320> seen<00:00:34.770> some

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010

about the same quality I've seen some
people<00:00:35.160> say<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.329> if<00:00:36.600> there<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> recycling

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
could just be an old array band box now

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.670 
could just be an old array band box now
on<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> next<00:00:54.629> part<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> over<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.379> I

on to the next part the over see I

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.700 
on to the next part the over see I
already<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:55.949> these<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> cases<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
already have these out of the cases and

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.200 
already have these out of the cases and
the<00:00:58.710> case<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.160> real<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.760> actually<00:00:59.940> my

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
looking out you might not be able to

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.330 
looking out you might not be able to
tell<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:38.760> to<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:39.540> front<00:05:39.720> this<00:05:39.960> is<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.340> 21:40

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
tell and to the front this is the 21:40

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.640 
tell and to the front this is the 21:40
original<00:05:42.000> Wayfarer<00:05:44.120> supposedly<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:46.470> real

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
original Wayfarer supposedly the real

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.470 
original Wayfarer supposedly the real
ones<00:05:47.930> maybe<00:05:48.930> see<00:05:49.140> if<00:05:49.200> the<00:05:49.290> real<00:05:49.440> one<00:05:50.180> does<00:05:51.180> have

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
ones maybe see if the real one does have

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.390 
ones maybe see if the real one does have
a<00:05:51.510> more<00:05:51.750> aggressive<00:05:51.840> curve<00:05:52.650> to<00:05:52.919> the<00:05:53.010> front<00:05:53.310> of

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
a more aggressive curve to the front of

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.470 
a more aggressive curve to the front of
it<00:05:53.550> that's<00:05:53.910> slant<00:05:55.640> and<00:05:56.640> then<00:05:56.940> I<00:05:57.180> think<00:05:57.330> the

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
it that's slant and then I think the

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.820 
it that's slant and then I think the
biggest<00:05:57.840> difference<00:05:58.169> of<00:05:58.290> all<00:05:58.470> how<00:05:58.620> you<00:05:58.650> can

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
biggest difference of all how you can

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.760 
biggest difference of all how you can
tell<00:05:59.010> is<00:05:59.280> that<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.630> real<00:06:00.630> ones<00:06:00.870> have<00:06:01.530> a<00:06:01.620> nice

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
tell is that the real ones have a nice

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.020 
tell is that the real ones have a nice
weight<00:06:02.160> to<00:06:02.340> them<00:06:02.490> because<00:06:03.440> there<00:06:04.440> are<00:06:05.030> metal

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
weight to them because there are metal

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.860 
weight to them because there are metal
rods<00:06:06.450> inside<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:07.050> arms<00:06:07.350> here<00:06:07.620> real<00:06:08.340> ones<00:06:08.580> here
