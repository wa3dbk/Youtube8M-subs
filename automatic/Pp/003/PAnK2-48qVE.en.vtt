welcome to the rustic garden today I

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.880 
welcome to the rustic garden today I
want<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.100> show<00:00:02.250> you<00:00:02.310> how<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.669> can<00:00:03.030> build<00:00:03.240> a

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:03.890 
want to show you how you can build a

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.710 
want to show you how you can build a
strawberry<00:00:04.890> tower<00:00:05.160> out<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.730> recycled

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
strawberry tower out of recycled

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.410 
strawberry tower out of recycled
repurposed<00:00:07.350> black<00:00:08.220> plastic<00:00:08.790> containers<00:00:09.300> you

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
repurposed black plastic containers you

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.879 
repurposed black plastic containers you
can<00:00:09.570> use<00:00:09.660> other<00:00:09.809> containers<00:00:10.380> but<00:00:10.500> these<00:00:10.679> seem

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
can use other containers but these seem

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.830 
can use other containers but these seem
to<00:00:11.010> be<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.250> easiest<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.790> cut<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.690> going

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
to be the easiest to cut this is going

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.169 
to be the easiest to cut this is going
to<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:13.049> three<00:00:13.530> levels<00:00:13.910> both<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.059> these

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
to be three levels both of these

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.060 
to be three levels both of these
containers<00:00:15.750> are<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.990> same<00:00:16.199> size<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
containers are the same size this is the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.580 
containers are the same size this is the
bottom<00:00:17.400> container<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:18.300> pattern<00:00:18.840> one<00:00:19.289> two

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
bottom container this pattern one two

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.189 
bottom container this pattern one two
three<00:00:20.100> four<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.970> one<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.270> top<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:22.050> be

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
three four and one on top is going to be

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.990 
three four and one on top is going to be
for<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.949> runner<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.460> that's<00:00:23.640> not<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
for the runner so that's not going to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.359 
for the runner so that's not going to
get<00:00:24.119> plants<00:00:24.510> put<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.810> them<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.769> only<00:00:26.010> want<00:00:26.279> to

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
get plants put in them you only want to

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.510 
get plants put in them you only want to
cut<00:00:26.580> holes<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.779> about<00:00:29.300> 75%<00:00:30.300> 50%<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
cut holes in about 75% 50% of the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.430 
cut holes in about 75% 50% of the
container<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.329> because<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> Sun<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.320> only

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
container so because the Sun is only

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.040 
container so because the Sun is only
going<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.950> stay<00:00:35.250> along<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.390> line<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.690> could

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
going to stay along this line you could

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.750 
going to stay along this line you could
cut<00:00:37.260> more<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.129> back<00:00:38.340> side<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
cut more but the back side of the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.819 
cut more but the back side of the
container<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.329> really<00:00:39.600> good<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.809> get<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.170> lot<00:00:40.680> of

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
container is really good to get a lot of

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:41.900 
container is really good to get a lot of
shade<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.219> they're<00:00:41.370> not<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> grow<00:00:41.879> as

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
shade so they're not going to grow as

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.000 
shade so they're not going to grow as
well<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.809> would<00:00:42.960> be<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> bottom<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
well so this would be the bottom in the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.470 
well so this would be the bottom in the
bottom<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.430> want<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> cut<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.940> hole<00:00:45.239> if

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
bottom you want to cut out a hole if

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
bottom you want to cut out a hole if
you're<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.440> keep<00:00:46.680> your<00:00:46.829> container<00:00:47.309> in

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
you're going to keep your container in

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.340 
you're going to keep your container in
the<00:00:48.030> same<00:00:48.239> place<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.780> think<00:00:48.989> you're<00:00:49.110> going

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the same place if you think you're going

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.470 
the same place if you think you're going
to<00:00:49.469> move<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.739> around<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.309> would<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.180> make<00:00:51.360> sure

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
to move it around I would just make sure

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.420 
to move it around I would just make sure
the<00:00:51.629> holes<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.350> big<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> dirt<00:00:53.070> falls

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the holes not so big that the dirt falls

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.650 
the holes not so big that the dirt falls
out<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:53.760> mine's<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> stay<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.510> one

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
out but mine's going to stay in one

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.430 
out but mine's going to stay in one
place<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.469> middle<00:00:55.620> container<00:00:56.930> has<00:00:57.930> eight

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
place the middle container has eight

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.510 
place the middle container has eight
holes<00:00:58.859> cut<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.879> they'll<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:00.809> planted<00:01:01.520> and

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
holes cut in it they'll get planted and

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.030 
holes cut in it they'll get planted and
that's<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.149> sit<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.799> I'm

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
that's going to sit just like that I'm

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.780 
that's going to sit just like that I'm
going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> fill<00:01:06.150> these<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.390> 50%<00:01:07.020> peat<00:01:07.590> moss

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
going to fill these with 50% peat moss

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.789 
going to fill these with 50% peat moss
50%<00:01:08.790> topsoil<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.810> I'm<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> use<00:01:10.229> organic

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
50% topsoil and I'm going to use organic

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.160 
50% topsoil and I'm going to use organic
fertilizer<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.610> take<00:01:11.790> care<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.689> feeding

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
fertilizer to take care of the feeding

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.399 
fertilizer to take care of the feeding
and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> top<00:01:14.040> container<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:15.409> smaller

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and then the top container is smaller

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.530 
and then the top container is smaller
that's<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.580> plant<00:01:17.820> around<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that's so that I can plant around it and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.660 
that's so that I can plant around it and
also<00:01:18.990> more<00:01:19.350> water<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.799> get<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.189> again<00:01:20.430> I

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
also more water can get in and again I

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.350 
also more water can get in and again I
think<00:01:21.240> there's<00:01:21.420> 1<00:01:21.720> 2<00:01:22.110> 3<00:01:22.140> 4<00:01:22.619> 5<00:01:23.369> that's<00:01:24.000> about<00:01:24.390> 75%

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
think there's 1 2 3 4 5 that's about 75%

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.050 
think there's 1 2 3 4 5 that's about 75%
of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> container<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:29.400> size<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.909> have

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
of the container the size of it have

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.760 
of the container the size of it have
holes<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.570> again<00:01:30.869> remember<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> back<00:01:31.500> side

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
holes in it again remember the back side

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.380 
holes in it again remember the back side
is<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.159> Sun<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.000> some<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
is going to get Sun and some of the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.450 
is going to get Sun and some of the
containers<00:01:33.810> are<00:01:33.960> harder<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.320> cut<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
containers are harder to cut so it's a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.280 
containers are harder to cut so it's a
lot<00:01:35.790> easier<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.150> cut<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> square<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
lot easier to cut a square out with the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.560 
lot easier to cut a square out with the
parish<00:01:37.590> scissors<00:01:38.009> or<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> knife<00:01:38.430> I'm<00:01:39.270> going<00:01:39.329> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
parish scissors or a knife I'm going to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.969 
parish scissors or a knife I'm going to
assemble<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.049> fill<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.619> plant<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
assemble this fill it and plant it and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.649

crown the strawberry plants probably
going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.369> die<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> make<00:02:06.630> sure

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
going to die so you have to make sure

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.419 
going to die so you have to make sure
that's<00:02:06.990> sticking<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.469> above<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> soil<00:02:08.129> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that's sticking out above the soil and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.420 
that's sticking out above the soil and
all<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.750> really

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
all you do is really

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.339 
all you do is really
the<00:02:11.549> crown<00:02:11.819> make<00:02:12.540> sure<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.959> it's<00:02:13.140> sticking

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
the crown make sure that it's sticking

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.470 
the crown make sure that it's sticking
out<00:02:13.620> beyond<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.219> plastic<00:02:14.640> container<00:02:15.030> this

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
out beyond the plastic container this

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.030 
out beyond the plastic container this
way<00:02:15.689> the<00:02:15.810> soil<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.230> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.560> sit<00:02:16.739> on<00:02:16.769> top

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
way the soil is just going to sit on top

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.099 
way the soil is just going to sit on top
of<00:02:17.189> it<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.790> would<00:02:17.939> be<00:02:18.030> perfectly<00:02:18.480> fine<00:02:18.810> in

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
of it and it would be perfectly fine in

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.229 
of it and it would be perfectly fine in
a<00:02:19.439> way<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:19.890> put<00:02:20.069> them<00:02:20.189> in<00:02:20.310> there<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:20.670> just

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
a way that you put them in there is just

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.259 
a way that you put them in there is just
slide<00:02:22.230> them<00:02:22.379> in<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.739> like<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.040> I'm<00:02:23.790> doing

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
slide them in just like that I'm doing

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.259 
slide them in just like that I'm doing
every<00:02:24.959> other<00:02:25.079> planting<00:02:25.920> hole<00:02:26.129> because<00:02:27.030> as

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
every other planting hole because as

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.849 
every other planting hole because as
these<00:02:27.719> grow<00:02:28.079> they're<00:02:28.379> going<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.590> put<00:02:28.739> out

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
these grow they're going to put out

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.740 
these grow they're going to put out
runners<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.670> runners<00:02:29.969> I'm<00:02:30.090> going<00:02:30.359> to<00:02:30.510> pin

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
runners and the runners I'm going to pin

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.440 
runners and the runners I'm going to pin
into<00:02:31.469> these<00:02:31.620> spaces<00:02:31.980> down<00:02:32.400> here<00:02:32.849> these<00:02:33.239> are

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
into these spaces down here these are

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.610 
into these spaces down here these are
all<00:02:33.569> four<00:02:33.780> runners<00:02:34.079> they're<00:02:34.260> not<00:02:34.409> going<00:02:34.560> to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
all four runners they're not going to

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.379 
all four runners they're not going to
get<00:02:34.739> plants<00:02:35.159> and<00:02:35.280> then<00:02:35.700> up<00:02:35.849> top<00:02:36.060> I'll<00:02:36.239> have

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
get plants and then up top I'll have

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.550 
get plants and then up top I'll have
more<00:02:36.599> plants<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.079> I'll<00:02:37.139> show<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.349> what<00:02:37.530> that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
more plants and I'll show you what that

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.209 
more plants and I'll show you what that
looks<00:02:37.889> like

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
looks like

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.940 
looks like
so<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.700> real<00:02:38.879> quick<00:02:39.170> as<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.439> mix<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.829> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
so just real quick as I mix in the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.899 
so just real quick as I mix in the
topsoil<00:02:41.400> 50%<00:02:42.180> top<00:02:42.389> 50%<00:02:43.230> peat<00:02:43.829> moss<00:02:44.069> I'm<00:02:44.549> also

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
topsoil 50% top 50% peat moss I'm also

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.970 
topsoil 50% top 50% peat moss I'm also
mixing<00:02:45.299> in<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.569> fertilizer<00:02:46.019> at<00:02:46.409> different

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
mixing in the fertilizer at different

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.710 
mixing in the fertilizer at different
levels<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:47.760> don't<00:02:47.939> overdo<00:02:48.359> it<00:02:48.389> and<00:02:48.599> you

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
levels just don't overdo it and you

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.539 
levels just don't overdo it and you
could<00:02:48.840> have<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.049> follow<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.829> instructions<00:02:50.400> on

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
could have to follow the instructions on

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.309 
could have to follow the instructions on
whatever<00:02:50.970> fertilizer<00:02:51.480> you're<00:02:51.780> using<00:02:52.049> and

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
whatever fertilizer you're using and

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.309 
whatever fertilizer you're using and
kind<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.680> figure<00:02:53.280> out<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.549> plan<00:02:53.730> from<00:02:53.970> there

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
kind of figure out the plan from there

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.550 
kind of figure out the plan from there
here's<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.500> completed<00:02:56.010> strawberry<00:02:56.519> Tower

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
here's the completed strawberry Tower

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.000 
here's the completed strawberry Tower
the<00:02:58.560> north<00:02:58.799> side<00:02:59.250> is<00:03:00.239> over<00:03:00.719> here<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.680> can

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
the north side is over here and I can

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.459 
the north side is over here and I can
see<00:03:02.219> how<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.430> aligned<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.659> containers<00:03:04.200> more

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
see how I aligned the containers more

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:05.690 
see how I aligned the containers more
towards<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.889> back<00:03:05.040> that's<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.430> not<00:03:05.579> going

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
towards the back that's just not going

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.459 
towards the back that's just not going
to<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:05.909> enough<00:03:06.150> Sun<00:03:06.389> so<00:03:06.840> you're<00:03:06.959> keeping<00:03:07.349> the

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:07.469 
to get enough Sun so you're keeping the

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.140 
to get enough Sun so you're keeping the
holes<00:03:07.739> all<00:03:08.579> cut<00:03:08.969> towards<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.079> front<00:03:10.379> and

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
holes all cut towards the front and

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.259 
holes all cut towards the front and
pretty<00:03:12.150> much<00:03:12.389> three<00:03:13.260> levels<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:14.269> most

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
pretty much three levels the most

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.899 
pretty much three levels the most
important<00:03:15.840> thing<00:03:16.109> is<00:03:16.919> to<00:03:17.159> make<00:03:17.280> sure<00:03:17.489> your<00:03:17.669> top

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
important thing is to make sure your top

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.699 
important thing is to make sure your top
level<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.359> don't<00:03:18.629> have<00:03:18.810> any<00:03:18.930> holes<00:03:19.199> up<00:03:19.470> here

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
level you don't have any holes up here

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.469 
level you don't have any holes up here
because<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:20.069> water<00:03:20.250> will<00:03:20.519> come<00:03:20.699> in<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.000> just

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:21.479 
because the water will come in and just

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:22.879 
because the water will come in and just
pour<00:03:21.750> out<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.079> want<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.379> water<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.650> be<00:03:22.769> able

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
pour out you want the water to be able

there's a nice rim here to hold the
water<00:03:29.489> here's<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:29.879> mistake<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.449> made<00:03:30.479> I<00:03:30.870> thought

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
water here's a mistake I made I thought

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.629 
water here's a mistake I made I thought
I<00:03:31.379> don't<00:03:31.620> know<00:03:31.709> why<00:03:31.829> I<00:03:31.859> thought<00:03:32.069> at<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.310> bottom

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
I don't know why I thought at the bottom

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.610 
I don't know why I thought at the bottom
I<00:03:32.729> could<00:03:32.879> cut<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.120> hole<00:03:33.329> out<00:03:33.359> here<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.409> put<00:03:34.590> a

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
I could cut a hole out here to put a

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.500 
I could cut a hole out here to put a
runner<00:03:34.889> into<00:03:35.129> that<00:03:35.370> but<00:03:35.879> too<00:03:36.060> much<00:03:36.209> water

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
runner into that but too much water

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.289 
runner into that but too much water
drained<00:03:36.840> out<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.079> I<00:03:37.109> just<00:03:37.290> put<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.250> black<00:03:38.519> piece

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
drained out so I just put a black piece

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.759 
drained out so I just put a black piece
of<00:03:39.449> plastic<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.989> cut<00:03:40.229> from<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.470> bottom

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
of plastic that I cut from the bottom

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.110
