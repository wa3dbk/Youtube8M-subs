impossible and some of its many
variations<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.570> just<00:00:10.440> filmed<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.830> most

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
variations I just filmed the most

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.140 
variations I just filmed the most
amazing<00:00:11.910> tutorial<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:13.049> these<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:14.030> when<00:00:15.030> I'm

amazing tutorial on these and when I'm
going<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.330> check<00:00:15.540> somehow<00:00:15.929> my<00:00:16.109> computer

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
going to check somehow my computer

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.660 
going to check somehow my computer
didn't<00:00:17.130> record<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.730> audio<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:19.220> that<00:00:20.220> sucks

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
didn't record the audio and that sucks

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.189 
didn't record the audio and that sucks
because<00:00:20.939> i<00:00:21.359> feel<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.630> i<00:00:21.779> did<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.080> good

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
because i feel like i did a really good

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.929 
because i feel like i did a really good
job<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.710> hopefully<00:00:23.100> i<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.310> do<00:00:23.550> as<00:00:23.640> good<00:00:23.760> as<00:00:23.880> i

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
job so hopefully i can do as good as i

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.910 
job so hopefully i can do as good as i
thought<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.150> did<00:00:24.359> last<00:00:24.539> time<00:00:27.410> impossible<00:00:28.410> pop

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
thought it did last time impossible pop

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.170 
thought it did last time impossible pop
the<00:00:29.130> deck<00:00:30.140> scoop<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.289> around<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
the deck scoop it around like that and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.130 
the deck scoop it around like that and
get<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.989> down<00:00:34.140> um<00:00:35.510> basically<00:00:36.510> house<00:00:36.809> trick

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
get it down um basically house trick

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.750 
get it down um basically house trick
works<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.559> when<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.800> pop<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.370> move<00:00:38.579> your

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
works is when you pop it you move your

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.729 
works is when you pop it you move your
finger<00:00:39.149> your<00:00:39.390> front<00:00:39.660> finger<00:00:39.930> back<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.500> that

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
finger your front finger back like that

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.310 
finger your front finger back like that
try<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:42.000> off<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> side<00:00:42.629> because<00:00:42.960> it

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
try not to do off to the side because it

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.560 
try not to do off to the side because it
just<00:00:43.500> makes<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.980> not<00:00:44.879> quite<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.390> easy

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
just makes it not quite as easy

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660 
just makes it not quite as easy
especially<00:00:46.289> when<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.739> throw<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.100> variation

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
especially when you throw in variation

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.650 
especially when you throw in variation
so<00:00:47.879> move<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.149> kind<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:49.100> scoop<00:00:50.660> and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
so move it kind of like that scoop and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.680 
so move it kind of like that scoop and
come<00:00:52.140> around<00:00:52.699> or<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.850> pop<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.329> move<00:00:54.539> your

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
come around or you pop it move your

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.000 
come around or you pop it move your
finger<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.230> want<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> push<00:00:55.649> really<00:00:55.890> hard

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
finger you just want to push really hard

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.939 
finger you just want to push really hard
like<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:57.690> get<00:00:57.899> it<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:01.559> yeah<00:01:01.649> there's<00:01:01.829> two

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
like this you get it so yeah there's two

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.250 
like this you get it so yeah there's two
ways<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.520> there's<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.780> way<00:01:04.049> like

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
ways to do it there's like this way like

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.679 
ways to do it there's like this way like
where<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.559> completely<00:01:05.189> vertical<00:01:05.400> or<00:01:06.360> like

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
where it's completely vertical or like

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.929 
where it's completely vertical or like
this<00:01:07.729> kind<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.760> scooping<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.210> sideways<00:01:09.799> and

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
this kind of scooping it sideways and

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.420 
this kind of scooping it sideways and
they<00:01:11.939> both<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.360> their<00:01:12.479> benefits<00:01:12.689> in

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
they both have their benefits in

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.399 
they both have their benefits in
negativities<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:15.360> when<00:01:15.570> combined<00:01:15.990> it's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
negativities but when combined it's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.490 
negativities but when combined it's
perfect<00:01:17.180> vertical<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:19.080> pop<00:01:19.320> it

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
perfect vertical like you pop it

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.070 
perfect vertical like you pop it
vertical<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.220> end<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.549> landing<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
vertical you end up landing like on the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.870 
vertical you end up landing like on the
front<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> board<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.040> there's

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
front of the board like that there's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.969 
front of the board like that there's
sometimes<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.450> little<00:01:24.540> more<00:01:24.750> severe<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.439> here

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
sometimes a little more severe like here

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.480 
sometimes a little more severe like here
and<00:01:27.619> horizontal<00:01:28.619> sometimes<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and horizontal sometimes it can be the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.510 
and horizontal sometimes it can be the
opposite<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.210> land<00:01:30.509> back<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:31.049> and

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
opposite and you land back here and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.649 
opposite and you land back here and
ideally<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.610> want<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> bolts<00:01:33.509> like

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
ideally you want to be on the bolts like

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.490 
ideally you want to be on the bolts like
that<00:01:33.900> may<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:34.680> up<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> tail<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.490> bit

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
that may be up on the tail a little bit

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
that may be up on the tail a little bit
never<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:38.369> here<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:40.460> maybe<00:01:41.460> do<00:01:41.790> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
never here here so maybe do a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.399 
never here here so maybe do a
combination<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> little<00:01:43.200> bit

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
combination of like a little bit

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.960 
combination of like a little bit
horizontal<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:44.250> bring<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> around

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
horizontal and then bring it around

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.670 
horizontal and then bring it around
vertical<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.320> land<00:01:46.530> with

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
vertical like that and you land with

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.810 
vertical like that and you land with
good<00:01:46.890> position<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:48.560> first<00:01:49.560> start<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.159> get

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
good position and first start just get

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.429 
good position and first start just get
you<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:50.970> flicking<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> board<00:01:51.780> around<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
you to flicking the board around do it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.920 
you to flicking the board around do it
real<00:01:52.680> slow<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.390> balance<00:01:54.810> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
real slow you have to like balance it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.969 
real slow you have to like balance it
like<00:01:55.079> this<00:02:00.320> just<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.710> come<00:02:01.829> around

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
like this just get it to come around

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.060 
like this just get it to come around
don't<00:02:02.310> worry<00:02:02.430> about<00:02:02.579> catching<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.060> right<00:02:03.180> now

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
don't worry about catching it right now

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.290 
don't worry about catching it right now
and<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.430> eventually

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
and then eventually

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.040 
and then eventually
you<00:02:07.630> just<00:02:08.430> start<00:02:09.430> clicking<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.360> still<00:02:10.870> keep

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
you just start clicking it still keep

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.020 
you just start clicking it still keep
doing<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.320> vertical<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.640> can<00:02:12.790> kind<00:02:12.910> of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
doing it vertical and you can kind of

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.680 
doing it vertical and you can kind of
catch<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.390> like<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.410> front<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.860> then

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
catch it like this on the front and then

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.790 
catch it like this on the front and then
figure<00:02:16.690> out<00:02:16.810> what's<00:02:17.020> comfortable<00:02:17.230> for<00:02:17.500> you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
figure out what's comfortable for you

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.200 
figure out what's comfortable for you
whether<00:02:18.190> it's<00:02:18.310> going<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.870> sideways

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
whether it's going like that sideways

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.520 
whether it's going like that sideways
vertical<00:02:22.210> because<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.050> different<00:02:23.230> for

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
vertical because it is different for

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.950 
vertical because it is different for
everybody<00:02:24.150> these<00:02:25.150> are<00:02:25.300> kind<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.570> technical

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
everybody these are kind of technical

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.660 
everybody these are kind of technical
tricks<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.440> that's<00:02:26.560> pretty<00:02:27.040> difficult<00:02:27.220> even

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
tricks and that's pretty difficult even

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.790 
tricks and that's pretty difficult even
once<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:27.970> get<00:02:28.150> up<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.420> land<00:02:29.080> them<00:02:29.230> cleanly<00:02:29.530> and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
once you get up to land them cleanly and

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.320 
once you get up to land them cleanly and

catching it there catch it here and then

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.070 
catching it there catch it here and then
also<00:03:44.890> helps<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:45.310> land<00:03:45.550> it<00:03:45.670> better<00:03:45.959> instead<00:03:46.959> of

since<00:04:26.030> we<00:04:26.120> need<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.390> be<00:04:26.450> need<00:04:26.600> pop<00:04:27.080> three

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
since we need to be need pop three

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.170 
since we need to be need pop three
fingers<00:04:28.340> forward<00:04:28.640> and<00:04:28.850> when<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:29.000> get<00:04:29.120> to

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
fingers forward and when you get to

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.180 
fingers forward and when you get to
about<00:04:29.480> right<00:04:29.510> here<00:04:29.860> almost<00:04:30.860> like<00:04:31.100> you're

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
about right here almost like you're

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.050 
about right here almost like you're
going<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.400> all<00:04:31.580> into<00:04:31.940> like<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.120> nosegrind<00:04:34.060> when

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
going to all into like a nosegrind when

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.140 
going to all into like a nosegrind when
you<00:04:35.150> get<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.420> about<00:04:35.540> right<00:04:35.600> in<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:36.020> position

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
you get to about right in that position

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.770 
you get to about right in that position
you<00:04:38.150> want<00:04:38.360> to<00:04:38.480> move<00:04:39.470> your<00:04:39.620> back<00:04:39.980> finger<00:04:40.780> and

scoop with your front like that it's

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.880 
scoop with your front like that it's
pretty<00:04:50.210> similar<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.840> your<00:04:51.140> other<00:04:51.260> impossible

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
pretty similar to your other impossible

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.400 
pretty similar to your other impossible
just<00:04:52.010> got<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.250> practice<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.700> scoop<00:04:54.310> around<00:04:55.310> um

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
just got to practice the scoop around um

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.290 
just got to practice the scoop around um
important<00:04:57.410> things<00:04:57.530> that<00:04:57.890> kind<00:04:58.160> of<00:04:58.280> get<00:04:59.150> your

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
important things that kind of get your

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.420 
important things that kind of get your
fingers<00:04:59.660> like<00:04:59.870> there<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.280> come<00:05:01.490> around<00:05:01.810> um

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
fingers like there and come around um

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.770 
fingers like there and come around um
when<00:05:04.430> you're<00:05:04.580> learning<00:05:04.730> it's<00:05:05.180> okay<00:05:05.480> to<00:05:05.540> like

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
when you're learning it's okay to like

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.650 
when you're learning it's okay to like
all<00:05:06.020> you<00:05:06.290> more<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:07.040> hear<00:05:07.070> and<00:05:07.550> then<00:05:08.330> just<00:05:08.480> let

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
all you more to hear and then just let

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.410 
all you more to hear and then just let
it<00:05:08.750> fall<00:05:09.370> same<00:05:10.370> with<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.610> regular<00:05:10.910> possible

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
it fall same with the regular possible

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.300 
it fall same with the regular possible
if<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:11.720> want<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:11.960> just<00:05:12.080> go<00:05:12.230> like<00:05:12.380> this<00:05:12.620> side

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
if you want to just go like this side

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.710 
if you want to just go like this side
down<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.520> then<00:05:13.850> let<00:05:14.030> the<00:05:14.150> board<00:05:14.530> I'm<00:05:15.530> so<00:05:15.860> take

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
down and then let the board I'm so take

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.980 
down and then let the board I'm so take
your<00:05:17.720> first<00:05:17.990> learning<00:05:19.450> sometimes<00:05:20.450> people<00:05:20.630> do

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
your first learning sometimes people do

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.840 
your first learning sometimes people do
these<00:05:21.140> things<00:05:21.440> like<00:05:21.710> that<00:05:21.890> and<00:05:22.610> they're

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
these things like that and they're

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.440 
these things like that and they're
learning<00:05:23.000> tricks<00:05:23.450> and<00:05:23.750> then<00:05:24.760> once<00:05:25.760> they<00:05:26.060> get

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
learning tricks and then once they get

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.030 
learning tricks and then once they get
that<00:05:26.600> down<00:05:26.870> they<00:05:27.140> just<00:05:27.350> stick<00:05:27.530> with<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.710> don't

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
that down they just stick with it don't

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.190 
that down they just stick with it don't
do<00:05:28.280> that<00:05:28.490> that's<00:05:29.210> some<00:05:29.420> time<00:05:29.570> so<00:05:29.780> I<00:05:29.840> don't<00:05:30.050> tell

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
do that that's some time so I don't tell

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.450 
do that that's some time so I don't tell
people<00:05:30.230> to<00:05:30.500> do<00:05:30.680> stuff<00:05:30.740> like<00:05:31.010> that<00:05:31.130> because

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
people to do stuff like that because

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.520 
people to do stuff like that because
they<00:05:31.640> get<00:05:32.360> something<00:05:32.690> that's<00:05:32.780> easy<00:05:33.050> it

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
they get something that's easy it

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.020 
they get something that's easy it
doesn't<00:05:33.830> look<00:05:33.860> good<00:05:34.100> and<00:05:34.370> is<00:05:34.490> it<00:05:34.610> really<00:05:34.640> real

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
doesn't look good and is it really real

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.630 
doesn't look good and is it really real
and<00:05:35.500> they<00:05:36.500> go<00:05:36.620> for<00:05:36.890> it<00:05:37.010> so<00:05:37.190> just<00:05:37.400> practice

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
and they go for it so just practice

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.780 
and they go for it so just practice
getting<00:05:38.060> your<00:05:38.390> tricks<00:05:38.630> down<00:05:39.400> you<00:05:40.400> know<00:05:40.520> where

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
getting your tricks down you know where

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.910 
getting your tricks down you know where
you<00:05:40.880> can<00:05:41.030> flick<00:05:41.720> them<00:05:41.900> or<00:05:42.260> whatever<00:05:42.440> it<00:05:42.680> is<00:05:42.770> in

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
you can flick them or whatever it is in

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.180 
you can flick them or whatever it is in
doing<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:43.580> then<00:05:43.730> make<00:05:44.270> them<00:05:44.390> realistic<00:05:44.990> i

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
doing and then make them realistic i

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.930
