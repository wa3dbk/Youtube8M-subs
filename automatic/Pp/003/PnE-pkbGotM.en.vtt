00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
development on that and when you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.070 
development on that and when you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
maybe it's just a situation where he's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.660 
maybe it's just a situation where he's
trying<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.650> impress<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.159> authority<00:01:14.580> or

trying to impress the authority or
whatever<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.180> may<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.780> simple<00:01:16.140> fact<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.500> that

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
whatever it may be a simple fact is that

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.399

match with Triple H at WrestleMania that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.100 
match with Triple H at WrestleMania that
was<00:02:43.550> one<00:02:43.819> of<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.000> thoughts<00:02:44.300> that<00:02:44.450> popped<00:02:44.870> into

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
was one of the thoughts that popped into

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.500 
was one of the thoughts that popped into
my<00:02:45.410> mind<00:02:45.440> about<00:02:46.300> Dolph<00:02:47.300> Ziggler<00:02:47.720> because<00:02:48.050> I

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
my mind about Dolph Ziggler because I

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.040 
my mind about Dolph Ziggler because I
mean<00:02:50.510> isn't<00:02:51.320> it<00:02:51.700> built<00:02:52.700> up<00:02:52.970> on-screen<00:02:53.300> like

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
mean isn't it built up on-screen like

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.170 
mean isn't it built up on-screen like
they're<00:02:54.260> building<00:02:54.470> up<00:02:55.000> something<00:02:56.000> between

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
they're building up something between

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.180 
they're building up something between
Triple<00:02:56.750> H<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.230> Dolph<00:02:57.410> Ziggler<00:02:57.530> like<00:02:58.010> there

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
Triple H and Dolph Ziggler like there

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.430 
Triple H and Dolph Ziggler like there
has<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.459> be<00:02:58.700> something<00:02:59.269> that<00:02:59.300> comes<00:03:00.050> out<00:03:00.290> of

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
has to be something that comes out of

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.470 
has to be something that comes out of
this<00:03:00.560> like<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.519> said<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.880> could<00:03:02.120> just<00:03:02.330> possibly

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
this like I said I could just possibly

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.930 
this like I said I could just possibly
chalk<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.080> up<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.230> wishful<00:03:03.800> thinking<00:03:04.489> but<00:03:04.700> I

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
chalk it up to wishful thinking but I

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.840 
chalk it up to wishful thinking but I
would<00:03:05.420> love<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.989> believe<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:07.519> isn't

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
would love to believe that this isn't

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.020 
would love to believe that this isn't
just<00:03:08.180> them<00:03:08.950> trashing<00:03:09.950> Ziggler<00:03:10.580> for<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.820> hell

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
just them trashing Ziggler for the hell

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.990 
just them trashing Ziggler for the hell
of<00:03:11.060> it<00:03:11.300> well<00:03:12.019> I<00:03:12.050> mean<00:03:12.200> if<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.830> build-up<00:03:13.820> then

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
of it well I mean if it is build-up then

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.170 
of it well I mean if it is build-up then
it's<00:03:14.150> pretty<00:03:14.750> shallow<00:03:15.170> building<00:03:15.769> for<00:03:15.890> me

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
it's pretty shallow building for me

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.250 
it's pretty shallow building for me
Dolph<00:03:17.180> for<00:03:17.450> all<00:03:17.570> that<00:03:17.750> he's<00:03:17.870> talking<00:03:18.110> about

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
Dolph for all that he's talking about

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.620 
Dolph for all that he's talking about
what<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.829> authority<00:03:19.370> has<00:03:19.880> done<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.480> how<00:03:20.570> he

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
what the authority has done and how he

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.750 
what the authority has done and how he
wants<00:03:21.019> them<00:03:21.140> out<00:03:21.200> of<00:03:21.320> power<00:03:21.500> he's<00:03:22.459> not

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
wants them out of power he's not

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.420 
wants them out of power he's not
necessarily<00:03:23.750> said<00:03:24.019> anything<00:03:24.440> about<00:03:24.560> what

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
necessarily said anything about what

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.060 
necessarily said anything about what
they<00:03:25.610> personally<00:03:26.150> done<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.720> him<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.829> how

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
they personally done to him and and how

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.270 
they personally done to him and and how
they've<00:03:28.310> kept<00:03:28.610> him<00:03:28.820> down<00:03:29.030> or<00:03:29.239> anything<00:03:29.420> so<00:03:29.870> I

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
they've kept him down or anything so I

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.710 
they've kept him down or anything so I
mean<00:03:31.280> until<00:03:31.549> they<00:03:31.670> develop<00:03:31.820> on<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.329> I'm<00:03:32.690> not

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
mean until they develop on that I'm not

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.410 
mean until they develop on that I'm not
sure<00:03:32.900> that<00:03:33.079> he<00:03:33.380> has<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:33.980> much<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.459> desire

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
sure that he has that much of a desire

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.350 
sure that he has that much of a desire
to<00:03:35.450> go<00:03:35.720> after<00:03:35.959> Triple<00:03:36.230> H<00:03:36.350> right

to be in a situation where we had to ask

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.159 
to be in a situation where we had to ask
these<00:04:42.280> questions<00:04:42.340> but<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.240> mean<00:04:43.720> I<00:04:43.750> guess<00:04:43.960> it's

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
these questions but I mean I guess it's

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.279 
these questions but I mean I guess it's
an<00:04:44.289> interesting<00:04:44.560> thing<00:04:44.949> to<00:04:45.220> me<00:04:45.699> it<00:04:45.850> kind<00:04:46.060> of

an interesting thing to me it kind of

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.659 
an interesting thing to me it kind of
parallels<00:04:47.289> the<00:04:47.470> Daniel<00:04:47.860> Bryan<00:04:48.130> triple<00:04:48.520> age

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
thing a little too much it's almost like

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.080 
thing a little too much it's almost like
a<00:04:50.169> rehash<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.860> what<00:04:51.009> was<00:04:51.100> going<00:04:51.400> on<00:04:51.520> there<00:04:51.820> so
