feel it lock in and you just put the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.059 
feel it lock in and you just put the
string<00:03:21.440> through<00:03:22.600> so<00:03:23.600> I'll<00:03:23.870> put<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.230> string<00:03:24.530> on

string through so I'll put the string on

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.900 
string through so I'll put the string on
like<00:03:27.069> that<00:03:27.630> okay

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
like that okay

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.980 
like that okay
next<00:03:30.910> step<00:03:31.470> take<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.650> excess<00:03:33.040> just<00:03:33.870> crank<00:03:34.870> it

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
next step take the excess just crank it

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.110 
next step take the excess just crank it
up<00:03:35.140> there<00:03:35.380> so<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:36.310> just<00:03:36.459> take<00:03:36.610> your<00:03:36.730> tuner

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
up there so you just take your tuner

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.140 
up there so you just take your tuner
just<00:03:37.959> start<00:03:38.170> lining<00:03:38.860> up<00:03:39.069> the<00:03:39.190> string<00:03:39.459> okay<00:03:40.030> at

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
just start lining up the string okay at

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.350 
just start lining up the string okay at
this<00:03:40.300> point<00:03:41.190> you're<00:03:42.190> 90%<00:03:42.489> there<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.239> just

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
this point you're 90% there you just

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.760 
this point you're 90% there you just
want<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.569> cut<00:03:43.720> off<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.959> excess<00:03:44.350> while<00:03:44.650> you

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
want to cut off the excess while you

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.420 
want to cut off the excess while you
still<00:03:44.950> can<00:03:45.010> come<00:03:45.550> in<00:03:46.060> here<00:03:47.130> cut<00:03:48.130> off<00:03:48.250> your

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
still can come in here cut off your

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.180 
still can come in here cut off your
excess<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.060> throw<00:03:49.330> it<00:03:49.450> away<00:03:49.830> so<00:03:50.830> you're<00:03:51.130> just

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
excess and throw it away so you're just
