00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.950 
and now I'm gonna show you how to buy us
an<00:00:03.780> aluminum<00:00:04.440> ring<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:05.270> with<00:00:06.270> sticky<00:00:06.779> way

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
an aluminum ring and with sticky way

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.259 
an aluminum ring and with sticky way
inside<00:00:07.319> so<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:08.069> course<00:00:08.340> even<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:08.849> case<00:00:09.059> we

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
inside so of course even in this case we

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.930 
inside so of course even in this case we
have<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.540> find<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.900> right<00:00:10.050> palm<00:00:10.700> always<00:00:11.700> from

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
have to find the right palm always from

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:22.490 
have to find the right palm always from
inside<00:00:17.600> the<00:00:18.600> gate<00:00:20.869> make<00:00:21.869> sure<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.260> well

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
inside the gate make sure it's well

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:32.900 
inside the gate make sure it's well
tight<00:00:29.900> now<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.170> enter<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.619> sizes<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.430> I'm

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
tight now to enter the sizes of this I'm

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
tight now to enter the sizes of this I'm
going<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> show<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.360> how<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> use<00:00:33.840> The<00:00:33.989> Awl<00:00:34.020> 1p

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
going to show you how to use The Awl 1p

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.410 
going to show you how to use The Awl 1p
program<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.360> go<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> aluminum<00:00:37.340> program

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
program so we go on the aluminum program

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.540 
program so we go on the aluminum program
1p<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:40.290> keep<00:00:40.500> pressing<00:00:40.770> until<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.370> reach

1p I just keep pressing until I reach

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.709 
1p I just keep pressing until I reach
the<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:42.030> precision<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:44.460> now<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.000> am<00:00:45.480> just

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the one precision and now I am just

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.139 
the one precision and now I am just
gonna<00:00:46.020> tell<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.620> Machine<00:00:47.039> where<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> want<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
just will bring this on the first

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.470 
just will bring this on the first
position<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.800> want<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> internal<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.050> and

position I want stay there and as you
can<00:01:15.240> see<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.659> Machine<00:01:15.960> memorized<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.009> second

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
can see the Machine memorized the second

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.830 
can see the Machine memorized the second
position<00:01:19.549> we<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:20.820> perform<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.390> spin

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.160

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.810 
again I'm gonna put it on this handle
taking<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.830> out<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:55.050> when<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.230> display<00:02:56.820> is

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
taking it out and when the display is

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.640 
taking it out and when the display is
getting<00:02:58.150> close<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.570> zero<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.900> know<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.470> you

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
getting close to zero you know that you

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.240 
getting close to zero you know that you
reach<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.190> correct<00:03:00.490> position<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:02.100> when<00:03:03.100> we

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
reach the correct position so when we

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:12.540 
reach the correct position so when we
are<00:03:03.370> here<00:03:04.110> we<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.260> apply<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:05.950> weight<00:03:11.550> again

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
are here we just apply the weight again

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.320 
are here we just apply the weight again
with<00:03:12.970> your<00:03:13.090> hand<00:03:13.390> make<00:03:13.600> sure<00:03:13.930> it's<00:03:15.330> well

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
with your hand make sure it's well

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.390 
with your hand make sure it's well
pressed<00:03:16.780> against<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:18.480> take<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.660> hood<00:03:19.840> down

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
pressed against it take the hood down

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.650 
pressed against it take the hood down
release<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.430> brake<00:03:22.019> perform<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.200> spin<00:03:24.660> to

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
release the brake perform the spin to

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.810 
release the brake perform the spin to
check<00:03:25.959> if<00:03:26.230> they<00:03:26.560> will<00:03:26.739> it's<00:03:27.250> balanced<00:03:29.760> now<00:03:30.760> we

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
check if they will it's balanced now we

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.720 
check if they will it's balanced now we
also<00:03:31.060> gonna<00:03:31.299> see<00:03:31.600> how<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.380> hide<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.920> weight<00:03:33.100> as

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
also gonna see how to hide the weight as

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.820 
also gonna see how to hide the weight as
you<00:03:33.850> know<00:03:33.970> some<00:03:34.180> customer<00:03:34.660> asked<00:03:34.900> not<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.590> see

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
you know some customer asked not to see

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.820 
you know some customer asked not to see
sticky<00:03:36.489> weights<00:03:36.820> between<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.510> spokes<00:03:37.830> so

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
sticky weights between the spokes so

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.759 
sticky weights between the spokes so
after<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.400> have<00:03:39.510> took<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.720> measure<00:03:40.989> of<00:03:41.320> the

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
after you have took the measure of the

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.070 
after you have took the measure of the
wheel<00:03:41.950> after<00:03:42.340> we<00:03:42.880> have<00:03:43.000> done<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.360> first<00:03:43.390> pin

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
wheel after we have done the first pin

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.890 
wheel after we have done the first pin
of<00:03:45.010> course<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.459> internal<00:03:45.790> weight<00:03:46.150> will<00:03:46.720> be

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
of course the internal weight will be

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.750 
of course the internal weight will be
all<00:03:47.110> together<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:48.040> it's<00:03:48.190> not<00:03:48.340> going<00:03:48.580> to<00:03:48.670> be

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
all together so it's not going to be

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.840 
all together so it's not going to be
it's<00:03:48.940> plate<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:50.470> external<00:03:51.010> one<00:03:51.160> can<00:03:51.430> be<00:03:51.580> split

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
it's plate the external one can be split

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.490 
it's plate the external one can be split
behind<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.019> spokes<00:03:53.350> so<00:03:53.680> we<00:03:54.430> just<00:03:54.640> select<00:03:55.500> this

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
behind the spokes so we just select this

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.930 
behind the spokes so we just select this
icon<00:03:56.940> enter<00:03:58.410> what<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.440> have<00:03:59.709> to<00:03:59.890> do<00:04:00.040> now<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.580> just

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
icon enter what I have to do now is just

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.600 
icon enter what I have to do now is just
tell<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.690> Machine<00:04:02.019> how<00:04:02.230> many<00:04:02.500> spokes<00:04:02.920> we<00:04:03.340> have

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
tell the Machine how many spokes we have

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.300 
tell the Machine how many spokes we have
on<00:04:03.850> this<00:04:04.090> wheel<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.750> put<00:04:05.650> one<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:06.100> them

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
on this wheel and put one of them

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.520 
on this wheel and put one of them
exactly<00:04:06.910> at<00:04:07.120> 12<00:04:07.330> o'clock<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:07.900> in<00:04:07.989> this<00:04:08.110> case<00:04:08.349> we

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
exactly at 12 o'clock so in this case we

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.570 
exactly at 12 o'clock so in this case we
have<00:04:08.650> five<00:04:08.950> spokes

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
have five spokes

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.620

I<00:04:09.610> just<00:04:10.209> keep<00:04:10.420> one<00:04:10.840> of<00:04:11.020> them

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
I just keep one of them

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.290 
I just keep one of them
exactly<00:04:11.990> 12<00:04:12.320> o'clock<00:04:12.820> otherwise<00:04:13.820> if<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.150> have

exactly 12 o'clock otherwise if I have
six<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:15.170> see<00:04:15.350> I<00:04:15.380> can<00:04:15.650> change<00:04:15.890> them<00:04:16.100> from<00:04:16.310> here

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
six you see I can change them from here

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.690 
six you see I can change them from here
in<00:04:17.270> this<00:04:17.420> case<00:04:17.690> five<00:04:18.050> I<00:04:18.440> press<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.280> enter

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
rain when we have too much weight which

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.800 
rain when we have too much weight which
is<00:05:13.310> really<00:05:14.300> too<00:05:14.570> much

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
is really too much

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.290 
is really too much
in<00:05:15.680> that<00:05:15.830> case<00:05:16.010> usually<00:05:16.280> what<00:05:16.640> we<00:05:16.760> do<00:05:16.940> we<00:05:17.120> gotta

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
in that case usually what we do we gotta

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.870 
in that case usually what we do we gotta
break<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.780> bead<00:05:17.960> again<00:05:18.170> in<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.620> tire<00:05:18.860> spin<00:05:19.760> it

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
break the bead again in the tire spin it

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.190 
break the bead again in the tire spin it
inside<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:20.900> rain<00:05:21.430> so<00:05:22.430> what<00:05:22.580> I<00:05:22.610> do<00:05:22.730> with<00:05:22.910> its

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
inside the rain so what I do with its

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.690 
inside the rain so what I do with its
optimization<00:05:24.200> program<00:05:24.440> I<00:05:24.860> just<00:05:24.920> bring<00:05:25.460> the

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
optimization program I just bring the

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.380 
optimization program I just bring the
valve<00:05:25.940> at<00:05:26.870> 12<00:05:27.230> o'clock

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
valve at 12 o'clock

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.630 
valve at 12 o'clock
so<00:05:29.390> we<00:05:29.540> have<00:05:29.660> our<00:05:29.780> valve<00:05:30.710> pressure<00:05:31.070> valve<00:05:31.490> at

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
so we have our valve pressure valve at

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.770 
so we have our valve pressure valve at
12<00:05:31.880> o'clock<00:05:32.210> if<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.260> hunter<00:05:33.650> button<00:05:34.160> and<00:05:34.820> as

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
12 o'clock if the hunter button and as

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.800 
12 o'clock if the hunter button and as
you<00:05:35.900> can<00:05:36.050> see<00:05:36.320> now<00:05:36.380> a<00:05:36.470> spin<00:05:36.950> manually<00:05:37.810> will

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
you can see now a spin manually will

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.570 
you can see now a spin manually will
until<00:05:39.230> I<00:05:39.350> reach<00:05:39.560> in<00:05:40.340> this<00:05:41.030> case<00:05:41.270> 180<00:05:42.020> degrees

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
until I reach in this case 180 degrees

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.120 
until I reach in this case 180 degrees
so<00:05:43.580> 180<00:05:44.240> degrees<00:05:44.720> from<00:05:45.020> the<00:05:45.230> valve<00:05:45.440> I<00:05:45.770> just

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
so 180 degrees from the valve I just

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.170 
so 180 degrees from the valve I just
might<00:05:46.610> want<00:05:46.640> to<00:05:46.850> make<00:05:47.000> a<00:05:47.030> mark<00:05:47.680> here<00:05:49.000> then<00:05:50.000> what

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
might want to make a mark here then what

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.800 
might want to make a mark here then what
we'll<00:05:50.360> have<00:05:50.390> to<00:05:50.780> do<00:05:50.960> is<00:05:51.380> just<00:05:52.190> to<00:05:52.460> bring<00:05:52.810> this

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
we'll have to do is just to bring this

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.220 
we'll have to do is just to bring this
line<00:05:54.730> to<00:05:55.730> the<00:05:55.850> valve<00:05:56.060> so<00:05:56.600> of<00:05:56.690> course<00:05:56.900> we<00:05:57.080> will

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
line to the valve so of course we will

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.810 
line to the valve so of course we will
need<00:05:57.350> the<00:05:57.500> tire<00:05:57.710> change<00:05:58.040> or<00:05:58.220> break<00:05:58.460> the<00:05:58.640> bead

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
need the tire change or break the bead

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.390 
need the tire change or break the bead
and<00:05:59.090> spin<00:05:59.870> it<00:05:59.990> into<00:06:00.380> it<00:06:02.920> last<00:06:03.920> thing<00:06:04.130> we<00:06:04.280> have

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
and spin it into it last thing we have

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.250 
and spin it into it last thing we have
this<00:06:04.550> F<00:06:04.820> button<00:06:05.210> where<00:06:05.630> you<00:06:05.660> can<00:06:05.750> exit<00:06:06.230> the

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
this F button where you can exit the

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:13.390 
this F button where you can exit the
programs<00:06:06.860> with<00:06:07.040> that<00:06:07.960> and<00:06:11.920> it<00:06:12.920> can<00:06:13.130> activate

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
programs with that and it can activate

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.310 
programs with that and it can activate
the<00:06:14.270> round<00:06:14.510> so<00:06:15.320> you<00:06:15.620> can<00:06:15.920> choose<00:06:16.220> if

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
the round so you can choose if

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.350 
the round so you can choose if
visualizing<00:06:18.320> the<00:06:18.440> weights<00:06:18.680> five<00:06:19.340> by<00:06:19.610> five<00:06:19.970> or

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
visualizing the weights five by five or

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.770 
visualizing the weights five by five or
one<00:06:21.050> by<00:06:21.260> one<00:06:21.530> I<00:06:21.800> usually<00:06:22.580> recommend<00:06:22.880> to<00:06:23.570> go

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
one by one I usually recommend to go

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.390 
one by one I usually recommend to go
five<00:06:24.110> by<00:06:24.350> five

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
five by five

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.030 
five by five
because<00:06:25.940> it's<00:06:26.720> easier<00:06:27.169> to<00:06:27.350> reach<00:06:27.530> the<00:06:27.800> zero

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
because it's easier to reach the zero

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.700 
because it's easier to reach the zero
one<00:06:28.430> by<00:06:28.610> one<00:06:28.850> you<00:06:29.210> will<00:06:29.360> never<00:06:29.540> get<00:06:29.870> exactly

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
one by one you will never get exactly

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.000 
one by one you will never get exactly
the<00:06:30.919> zero<00:06:31.190> not<00:06:32.060> with<00:06:32.570> the<00:06:32.690> weights<00:06:32.930> that<00:06:33.290> you

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
the zero not with the weights that you

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.180 
the zero not with the weights that you
normally<00:06:34.580> buy<00:06:34.760> if<00:06:35.690> you<00:06:35.990> hold<00:06:36.260> the<00:06:36.410> F<00:06:36.590> button<00:06:36.949> in

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
normally buy if you hold the F button in

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.330 
normally buy if you hold the F button in
case<00:06:37.370> you<00:06:37.580> use<00:06:37.639> grams<00:06:38.210> instead<00:06:39.050> of<00:06:39.470> ounces<00:06:39.740> if

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
case you use grams instead of ounces if

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.150 
case you use grams instead of ounces if
you<00:06:40.850> hold<00:06:41.060> it<00:06:41.240> for<00:06:41.479> a<00:06:41.510> few<00:06:41.540> seconds<00:06:42.199> the

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
you hold it for a few seconds the

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.400 
you hold it for a few seconds the
machine<00:06:43.580> will<00:06:43.820> convert<00:06:44.180> the<00:06:44.540> own<00:06:44.750> C's<00:06:45.110> in

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
machine will convert the own C's in

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.740 
machine will convert the own C's in
grams<00:06:45.860> so<00:06:46.430> as<00:06:46.520> you<00:06:46.639> can<00:06:46.790> see<00:06:47.030> now<00:06:47.180> we<00:06:47.240> have<00:06:47.360> 30

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
grams so as you can see now we have 30

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.680 
grams so as you can see now we have 30
grams<00:06:48.169> inside<00:06:49.010> 20<00:06:49.970> grams<00:06:50.260> outside<00:06:52.540> thanks<00:06:53.540> for

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
grams inside 20 grams outside thanks for

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.320 
grams inside 20 grams outside thanks for
