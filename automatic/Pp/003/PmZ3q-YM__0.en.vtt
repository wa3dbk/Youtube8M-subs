00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.230
 and 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.100
 this boat is very fast and for all at 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.180
 little wind so you notice that yet 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.220
 10 knots of wind 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.140
 we were buying six look that's it 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.920
 boats that we pass whistling with 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.920
 two fingers in the nose 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.090
 during the Dutch 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.670
 the boat has a circle through it 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.740
 holland has won its own class at the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.240
 pants hit by shallow keel and roll 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.410
 to sail 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.410
 that says something about the qualities 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.099
 one of the nicest findings of this 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.569
 boat is the folding mirror 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.560
 followed a blow and 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.819
 bathing platform 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.819
 so can sit great on it 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.640
 and because he has such a style mirror 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.110
 which also come on board very easily 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.340
 like the boat with the could the frameworks 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.530
 moored 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.810
 this newest 45 cruiser is a bird 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.610
 were brothers 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.440
 spectators on someone else's order 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.910
 tel offered him in racing boats 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.830
 a nice floor can also be added 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.750
 has slit for the increase in 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.989
 Looked back at who you were by your side 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.209
 flour are the entire mouthful actually 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.130
 because this is a pgb 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.130
 Ferrari in a PGB absolute 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.599
 bread is full of practical find 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.500
 so that navigation screen can be fine 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.489
 read 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.489
 you can also fold away very well 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.150
 is really a modern lined yacht with 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.190
 especially very wide at the back 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.630
 for that you have two steering wheels you can 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.130
 you easily with suitcases and bags you 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.410
 to go to church through the tub 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.790
 also has two green blades and that is 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.230
 nice then you also when you're under 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.600
 slope sails quite a bit of grip on it 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.070
 where the boat sails under a slope 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:06.380
 we also see something handy 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:06.380
 found by right anyway 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.370
 This boat is really a cruiser one 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.790
 positively meant to be comfortable 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.560
 to sail 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.200
 you have to be equipped with an in 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.880
 mast filling hotel 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.470
 the mainsail that course in the mast 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.850
 woolen and that it is still a good one 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.390
 profiles that is because he 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.400
 vertical garden which we are past the farmer 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.400
 adopt quite a lot of understanding 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.530
 what frog can do it under list leader 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.240
 you can backstay tensioner for those 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.660
 where do you have a short doubt on top 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.880
 seasoned roof that teak deck 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.520
 so actually flexiteak maintenance free 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.660
 we kindly you can obscure it 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.700
 don't have to leave trees behind 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.700
 die nice solution 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.389
 hey let's sleep well let's go 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.159
 real family boat that is especially here 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.550
 within 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.550
 adjust 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.659
 at an even 14 meter length that is one 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.210
 smart layouts 4 cabin version allowed 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.650
 two identical it for in two 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.360
 lows in the back 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.699
 people are sleeping there so we 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.770
 go and have a look behind in milk 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.219

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.219

 lots of cupboard space and here is a lot 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:15.420
 space around the large table that 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.420
 navigation angle that I find very smart 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.730
 the engine are 4-cylinder diesel 55 hp 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.730
 with a co2 de 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.330
 the boat is very light because of that empty 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.250
 to many nice things in a drawing 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.200
 I want to ventilate well
