00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
so now you also did well biology stuff

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.509 
so now you also did well biology stuff
we'll<00:00:06.229> have<00:00:06.319> a<00:00:06.349> chat<00:00:06.590> about<00:00:06.620> a<00:00:07.160> little<00:00:07.399> bit

question of style golf how did a study

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.549 
question of style golf how did a study
for<00:00:12.620> biology<00:00:13.240> with<00:00:14.240> biology<00:00:14.809> the<00:00:15.019> syllabus<00:00:15.410> is

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
for biology with biology the syllabus is

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.460 
for biology with biology the syllabus is
really<00:00:16.010> like<00:00:16.910> a<00:00:16.940> little<00:00:17.240> open<00:00:17.779> to<00:00:17.930> scientists

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
really like a little open to scientists

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.980 
really like a little open to scientists
really<00:00:18.800> are<00:00:19.010> like<00:00:19.580> straightforward<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:20.539> in

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
really are like straightforward and in

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.480 
really are like straightforward and in
quite<00:00:21.349> detail<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.490> I<00:00:22.519> just<00:00:23.529> make<00:00:24.529> I<00:00:24.830> once<00:00:25.279> again

a sudden making notes and we're gone the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.349 
a sudden making notes and we're gone the
silver<00:00:27.529> settings<00:00:28.009> but<00:00:28.730> are<00:00:28.849> really<00:00:29.179> paying

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
silver settings but are really paying

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.460 
silver settings but are really paying
attention<00:00:29.449> to<00:00:29.929> the<00:00:30.019> verb

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
and identify part of the syllabus and so

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.690 
and identify part of the syllabus and so
that<00:00:41.690> way<00:00:42.010> you're<00:00:43.010> making<00:00:43.130> notes

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
you've got enough for you know and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.790 
you've got enough for you know and
analyze<00:00:47.120> one<00:00:47.450> fits<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:47.990> ain't<00:00:48.110> my<00:00:48.260> question

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
analyze one fits and ain't my question

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.210 
analyze one fits and ain't my question
and<00:00:49.010> just<00:00:49.360> you<00:00:50.360> know<00:00:50.420> simple<00:00:50.690> paragraph<00:00:51.410> or<00:00:51.920> in

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
and just you know simple paragraph or in

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.590 
and just you know simple paragraph or in
the<00:00:52.430> outline<00:00:52.730> it's<00:00:52.910> that<00:00:53.060> way<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:53.210> know<00:00:53.540> you

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
the outline it's that way you know you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.780 
the outline it's that way you know you
cut<00:00:53.900> down<00:00:54.080> on<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.380> state<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.740> time<00:00:54.950> but<00:00:55.250> yeah

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
cut down on the state of time but yeah

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.120 
cut down on the state of time but yeah
studying<00:00:56.540> enough<00:00:56.810> for<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.380> requirement<00:00:58.040> of

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
studying enough for the requirement of

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.040 
studying enough for the requirement of
course<00:00:58.400> it's<00:00:58.940> about<00:00:59.120> really<00:00:59.360> telling<00:00:59.870> their

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
course it's about really telling their

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.630 
course it's about really telling their
notes<00:01:00.260> in<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.860> way<00:01:01.040> they're<00:01:01.400> gonna<00:01:01.460> be

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
notes in a way they're gonna be

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.660 
notes in a way they're gonna be
effective<00:01:02.120> for<00:01:02.450> yeah<00:01:03.100> yeah<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:04.400> know<00:01:04.489> it's

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
effective for yeah yeah so you know it's

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.550 
effective for yeah yeah so you know it's
pretty<00:01:04.970> important<00:01:05.539> yeah<00:01:05.689> very<00:01:05.929> like<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.229> trend

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
pretty important yeah very like a trend

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.010 
pretty important yeah very like a trend
innate<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:07.250> very<00:01:07.490> but<00:01:07.880> I<00:01:08.299> thought<00:01:08.630> more<00:01:08.869> so

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
innate is very but I thought more so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.889 
innate is very but I thought more so
through<00:01:09.170> biology<00:01:09.380> because<00:01:10.689> College<00:01:11.689> they

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
through biology because College they

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.209 
through biology because College they
tend<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.289> you<00:01:12.740> know<00:01:12.859> they've<00:01:13.009> got<00:01:13.130> the

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
tend to you know they've got the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.179 
tend to you know they've got the
syllabus<00:01:13.549> playing<00:01:13.820> they<00:01:13.969> will<00:01:14.210> just<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:15.109> know

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
syllabus playing they will just you know

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.380 
syllabus playing they will just you know
restructure<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:16.310> question<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.729> lot<00:01:16.969> you<00:01:17.299> know

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
restructure the question a lot you know

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.359 
restructure the question a lot you know
restructure<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.140> syllabus<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:18.619> lot<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:19.100> make

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
restructure the syllabus a lot and make

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.580 
restructure the syllabus a lot and make
a<00:01:19.399> question<00:01:19.729> out<00:01:19.939> of<00:01:19.999> it<00:01:20.299> there<00:01:21.259> is<00:01:21.289> a<00:01:21.380> bit<00:01:21.530> more

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
a question out of it there is a bit more

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.410 
a question out of it there is a bit more
of<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:21.829> trend<00:01:22.009> you<00:01:22.219> know<00:01:22.369> we<00:01:22.999> would<00:01:23.149> have<00:01:23.179> to

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
of a trend you know we would have to

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.179 
of a trend you know we would have to
apply<00:01:23.509> that<00:01:23.990> in<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:24.229> practical<00:01:24.409> first

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
apply that in a practical first

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.389 
apply that in a practical first
investigation<00:01:26.090> but<00:01:26.829> we're<00:01:27.829> thus<00:01:28.039> it<00:01:28.189> works

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
investigation but we're thus it works

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:29.889 
investigation but we're thus it works
just<00:01:28.700> note<00:01:29.090> on<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.270> silvers<00:01:29.630> hidden

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
just note on the silvers hidden

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.980 
just note on the silvers hidden
knowledge<00:01:30.200> everything<00:01:31.130> oh<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.880> when<00:01:32.719> you<00:01:32.810> put

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
knowledge everything oh and when you put

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.289 
knowledge everything oh and when you put
your<00:01:33.020> notes<00:01:33.429> again<00:01:34.429> was<00:01:34.549> a<00:01:34.579> multiple<00:01:34.909> sources

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
your notes again was a multiple sources

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.109 
your notes again was a multiple sources
that<00:01:35.600> you're<00:01:35.719> using<00:01:36.369> I<00:01:37.369> did<00:01:37.579> actually<00:01:37.759> use<00:01:37.969> I

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
probably use it's a couple of test books

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.140 
you know I haven't watched
even<00:01:48.080> if<00:01:48.140> I<00:01:48.550> felt<00:01:49.550> that<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.790> didn't<00:01:50.030> really

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
even if I felt that it didn't really

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.940 
even if I felt that it didn't really
give<00:01:50.450> me<00:01:50.480> they're<00:01:50.990> really<00:01:51.290> good<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:51.920> I

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
give me they're really good and so I

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.950 
give me they're really good and so I
don't<00:01:52.070> understand<00:01:52.550> into<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:52.940> I<00:01:52.970> have<00:01:53.660> you<00:01:53.900> know

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
don't understand into it I have you know

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.710 
don't understand into it I have you know
a<00:01:54.020> couple<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:54.530> minutes<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:54.920> don't<00:01:55.400> point<00:01:55.720> and

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
a couple of minutes so don't point and

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.000 
a couple of minutes so don't point and
then<00:01:56.840> yeah<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.170> would<00:01:57.290> give<00:01:57.440> me<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.590> bit<00:01:57.830> off

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
then yeah that would give me a bit off

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.570 
then yeah that would give me a bit off
almost<00:01:58.610> super<00:01:59.060> flawed<00:01:59.270> version<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.110> then<00:02:00.260> I'm

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
almost super flawed version and then I'm

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.130 
almost super flawed version and then I'm
better<00:02:01.580> able<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:02.120> because<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:02.810> mean<00:02:02.840> when

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
better able to because I mean when

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.960 
better able to because I mean when
you're<00:02:03.260> making<00:02:03.410> notes<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:04.040> want<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.640> you

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
you're making notes you want you you

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.570 
you're making notes you want you you
want<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.660> understand<00:02:06.290> them<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:06.650> want<00:02:06.860> them<00:02:07.340> to

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
want to understand them you want them to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.520 
want to understand them you want them to
be<00:02:07.670> tailored<00:02:08.060> for<00:02:08.240> you<00:02:08.420> for<00:02:08.660> your<00:02:08.750> learning<00:02:09.229> so

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
be tailored for you for your learning so

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.660 
be tailored for you for your learning so
by<00:02:10.520> finding<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.940> most<00:02:12.190> information<00:02:13.190> comes

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
by finding the most information comes

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.260 
by finding the most information comes
teams<00:02:14.030> simplify<00:02:14.780> for<00:02:15.020> yourself<00:02:15.530> both<00:02:15.740> minutes

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
teams simplify for yourself both minutes

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.380 
teams simplify for yourself both minutes
so<00:02:17.270> just<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.720> mean<00:02:17.870> I'm<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.260> traffic<00:02:18.680> she<00:02:18.830> likes

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
so just I mean I'm so traffic she likes

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.430 
so just I mean I'm so traffic she likes
topology<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:20.630> syllabus<00:02:21.020> top<00:02:21.170> point

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
topology so syllabus top point

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.250 
topology so syllabus top point
identified<00:02:22.040> yeah<00:02:22.970> got<00:02:23.270> points<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:26.630> had<00:02:27.080> both

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
identified yeah got points I I had both

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260 
identified yeah got points I I had both
had<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.890> first<00:02:28.220> about<00:02:28.430> doing<00:02:28.700> dot<00:02:28.940> points

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
had a first about doing dot points

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.490 
had a first about doing dot points
because<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.600> just<00:02:29.780> couldn't<00:02:29.990> read<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> paragraph

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
because I just couldn't read a paragraph

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.230 
because I just couldn't read a paragraph
it<00:02:31.010> was<00:02:31.100> just<00:02:31.310> too<00:02:31.520> much<00:02:31.670> my<00:02:31.850> father<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:34.209> yeah<00:02:35.209> a

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
it was just too much my father so yeah a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
lot of a lot of my notes things like

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.300 
lot of a lot of my notes things like
paragraph<00:02:41.060> or<00:02:41.209> documents<00:02:41.930> would<00:02:42.050> have<00:02:42.260> a

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
paragraph or documents would have a

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.120 
paragraph or documents would have a
diagram<00:02:43.310> graphic<00:02:44.150> come<00:02:44.300> in<00:02:44.480> here<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.100> what<00:02:46.100> I

diagram graphic come in here and what I

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.490 
diagram graphic come in here and what I
found<00:02:46.310> out<00:02:46.459> for<00:02:46.580> biology<00:02:47.090> was<00:02:47.240> that<00:02:47.500> even

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
found out for biology was that even

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.930 
found out for biology was that even
though<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:48.890> lines<00:02:49.190> for<00:02:49.430> writing<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:49.850> the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
though it's lines for writing in the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
diagrams meant to support information

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.810 
diagrams meant to support information
like<00:02:53.989> that's<00:02:54.230> that's<00:02:55.040> part<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.519> say<00:02:55.670> you've

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
got a six marker and you're finding you

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.440 
got a six marker and you're finding you
know<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.709> diagram<00:02:58.340> of<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.580> easier<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.150> explain

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
know a diagram of the easier to explain

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.170 
know a diagram of the easier to explain
to<00:03:00.290> market<00:03:00.709> then<00:03:00.830> you<00:03:00.980> know<00:03:01.130> steadily<00:03:01.790> detects

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
to market then you know steadily detects

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.330 
to market then you know steadily detects
the<00:03:02.390> year<00:03:02.630> ago<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.019> do<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:03.410> so<00:03:03.650> this<00:03:04.100> diagram

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
the year ago to do that so this diagram

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.620 
the year ago to do that so this diagram

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.820 
the year is he gone through the course
yeah<00:03:12.790> how'd<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:13.820> learn<00:03:14.120> them<00:03:14.830> similar

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
yeah how'd you learn them similar

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.860 
yeah how'd you learn them similar
similar<00:03:16.310> sort<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.489> my<00:03:16.610> subjects<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.060> kept<00:03:17.299> I

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
similar sort of my subjects I kept I

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.920 
similar sort of my subjects I kept I
would<00:03:18.380> read<00:03:19.190> them<00:03:19.370> read<00:03:19.880> them<00:03:20.030> are<00:03:20.360> actually<00:03:20.900> a

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
would read them read them are actually a

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.160 
would read them read them are actually a
couple<00:03:21.080> times<00:03:21.440> I<00:03:21.680> award<00:03:22.840> throughout<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.989> year

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
couple times I award throughout the year

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
I can write the syllabus point on the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.700 
I can write the syllabus point on the
