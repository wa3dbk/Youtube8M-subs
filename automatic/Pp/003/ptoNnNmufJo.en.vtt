00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.140
 today the rate is falling sharply 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.380
 he was hit by him for that 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.380
 I mainly use cost-saving 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:17.589
 pepper spray and too low is both finely chopped and cut 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.339
 the salary and hr 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.569
 the slp 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:24.989
 just like nothing done 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.949
 according to old and something 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.929
 this is the former employee 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.929
 that's all she has in unfortunate choir 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.090
 veghel 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.380
 girls 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.910

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.980
 play the nza and touched 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.930
 so what they look like 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.600
 this as high-quality theater offers little bit of boiling water 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.310
 we are going to the team that actually did not play on Wednesday and Thursday 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.720
 So 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.720
 this did not take place 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.150
 the repairs are open 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
 a good reason to die 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.610
 quite a bit too 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.610
 lodeweges sneijder 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.380
 she likes it chic but also has a trailer in the base 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.910
 to adjust 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.910

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.080
 for the party in the constitution and they promise 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.820
 the consortium has appeared 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.820
 the home of course too 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.210
 the approach 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.750
 all parents 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.750
 the scale so you can have a good conversation later 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.560
 8 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.710
 but quests 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.059

 gerard 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.289
 I find it once 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.779
 it's a full one and once you can also get out of the last four by yourself 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.199
 and you can also drive the current cabinet for hours 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.199
 I feel I was defeated was hit indeed 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.379
 keep technicians apart and far beyond 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.389
