00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.920
 d 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.120
 the service of the whole heart toward 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.350
 sign gentlemen is reporting on 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.410
 the presence of this that is the great 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.730
 front number 36 that is observed is already 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.730
 very weak about northern states and 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.560
 part of the east because you look 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.109
 later very robust as front 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.730
 cold number 36 and that is taking advantage 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.009
 the entry of moisture that is also 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.990
 very scarce from the Pacific and will continue 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.730
 offering us some cloudiness with 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.259
 precipitations that can become 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.390
 from moderate to strong in the southeast as well 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.820
 as in some places of the peninsula 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.190
 from Yucatan the cold air mass that has 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.290
 generated this system has offered 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.940
 very low temperatures in the states 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.550
 north- northeast in some points of the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.130
 orient very to the extreme and also in the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.570
 event event of north in the littoral of 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.760
 gulf of mexico that can reach 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.980
 speeds between 60 and 80 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.230
 kilometers to return very to the slope 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.700
 of this wind not only in the same 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.960
 the gulf of tehuantepec but in what 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.610
 is the coastline of the gulf of mexico in 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.860
 where minor navigators could 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.920
 have some some difficulties in 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.630
 as to what is the temperatures for 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.509
 all this great area I'm going to talk 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.610
 that we would have conditions still of little 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.010
 humidity for him 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.420
 from the Mexican republic temperatures 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.980
 that you come and reach values ​​up 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.200
 from 30 degrees to the north end 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.640
 pacific littoral the mornings follows 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.510
 being really very cold for the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.850
 northern states although the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.290
 good maximum temperatures serve in 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.450
 some places a little nice 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.120
 because the cold air mass is gone 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.520
 moving towards the east but there 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.010
 the time is really nice for the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.729
 northeast part of the northeast and part of the 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.440
 center 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.620
 the maximum temperatures in the scale of 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.080
 tempered the morning / cool to cold in 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.820
 all these states in sky sky very 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.070
 clean very dry for the eyes more to the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.540
 north towards the center of cleared to 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.119
 Partly Cloudy Some Precipitation 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.420
 very scattered for the next next 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.330
 late the western Mexican temperatures 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.979
 pleasant 29 30 31 degrees the sky the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.810
 sky already clear to partly cloudy and there is 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.250
 much less humidity in this region and 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.440
 there will be much less moisture in the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.960
 next hours and that towards the center 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.489
 look at you half cloudy or if you gave them 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.350
 very scattered views but this medium 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.810
 Cloudy if in the morning because 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.880
 one afternoon and there will be less cloudiness and 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.100
 certainly much radiation is solar 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.620
 for the status of warrior 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.650
 in you for the video portal kabul co 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.510
 32 33 degrees of maximum temperature very 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.370
 nice the sky with some clouds 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.080
 only some clouds but if it is very 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.330
 but very sunny 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.120
 the beautiful Cuernavaca and you 29-31 the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.160
 maximum of 10 to 12 13the minimum 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.420
 sky but also very sunny some 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.370
 clouds but that will also go 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.800
 limiting that training condition 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.260
 cloudy in the state of morelos please 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.130
 the condition for the southeast 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.590
 moderate to heavy rainfall 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.420
 the temperatures can reach 28 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.070
 or the 30 degrees but if we have some 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.080
 places where the temperature will have 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.300
 to go falling because the displacement 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.670
 of cold air will harm 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.200
 notably the thermometer of this 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.140
 region the appearance of yucatán also 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.580
 already at the end we hope that it also 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.080
 hinder the temperature by the 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.310
 presence of the cold air mass 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.320
 Partly cloudy cloudy sky with 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.730
 some rainfall and good for the 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.770
 temperatures that will not be very 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.890
 unpleasant but you will feel a 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.940
 thermal low for this region for the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.260
 Mexico City 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.670

 of maximum temperature in forecast is 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.480
 just more important that we have to 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.930
