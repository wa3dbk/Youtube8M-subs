spring<00:02:13.630> we<00:02:14.110> have<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.350> disconnect<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:15.040> lower

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
spring we have to disconnect the lower

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.690 
spring we have to disconnect the lower
and<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:16.110> upper<00:02:17.110> end<00:02:17.560> we're<00:02:18.280> going<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.460> remove

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
and the upper end we're going to remove

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.370 
and the upper end we're going to remove
the<00:02:18.910> lower<00:02:19.090> half<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.600> spring<00:02:19.900> which<00:02:20.350> is

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
the lower half of the spring which is

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.830 
the lower half of the spring which is
connected<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.130> frame<00:02:21.510> all<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.630> have<00:02:22.720> to

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
connected to the frame all you have to

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.300 
connected to the frame all you have to
do<00:02:22.960> is<00:02:23.110> grab<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.470> spring<00:02:23.740> and<00:02:23.920> pull<00:02:24.100> down<00:02:24.250> on

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
do is grab the spring and pull down on

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.970 
do is grab the spring and pull down on
it<00:02:24.490> in<00:02:24.790> most<00:02:25.360> cases<00:02:25.660> you're<00:02:26.440> changing<00:02:26.860> the

it in most cases you're changing the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.620 
it in most cases you're changing the
spring<00:02:27.280> out<00:02:27.400> because<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.970> lower<00:02:28.150> part<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
spring out because the lower part of the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.600 
spring out because the lower part of the
spring<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:28.990> worn<00:02:29.230> out<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.190> won't<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.550> to

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
spring is worn out so you won't have to

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.890 
spring is worn out so you won't have to
disconnect<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.240> it's<00:02:31.450> just<00:02:31.600> going<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.780> be

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
disconnect it it's just going to be

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.930 
disconnect it it's just going to be
hanging<00:02:32.140> there<00:02:32.380> in<00:02:32.560> order<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.400> get<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.700> upper

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
hanging there in order to get the upper

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.910 
hanging there in order to get the upper
half<00:02:34.090> off<00:02:34.330> just<00:02:35.040> take<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.160> out<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.430> hole

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
half off just take it out of the hole

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.470 
half off just take it out of the hole
