00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 so we wanted to do a little test of 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.379
 soft water so we took a shell in 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.380
 friend waterboy yeah we're going to weigh a little 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.030
 little so we are there 230 grams to little 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.030
 we will add a little bit of you 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.289
 So here is the drone weighs a kilo 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.890
 pity 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.630
 is there then we could see that the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.630
 drone fell to Lorient 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.600
 look at the ball 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.600
 start to appear 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:12.620
 look I do not know if you see well 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.560
 the ball is well inflated I think 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:25.100
 a little bit too much weight 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.100
 wait a little bit 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.270
 it will not go back up 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.070
 behind for a diver their evidence 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.810
 very easily 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.380
 I am now I am the little 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.900
 balloon the diver and their movement that 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.560
 depends on this day it's hot one neither two nor 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:12.990
 on Thursday he will see better half time 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.799
 I destroyed the hottest no but that 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.870
 means marc of amendments 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:23.760
 and there I imagine with 5 could put 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.760
 pressure against world war 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.150
 m 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.240
 I 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.010
 and now you have to wait for a 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.380
 little bit we can see that it is when 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.410
 even in the limit it takes not much 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:49.100
 in fact to sink what are we going to 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:50.420
 to do a little and that's a good ben 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.520
 beautiful waters and it works 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.970
 no worries 1 so here's the ghost the 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.800
 shell of ghosts lester to 1 kg without 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.970
 that's with the water boy 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.120
 triggered good it's still glimpsed 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.620
 in fact that waterboy he was giving really 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.820
 all his power as soon as he comes out of 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.340
 the water in fact we feel that there is a 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.200
 small inflation pressure 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.739
 additional as soon as the keychain 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.070
 out of the water but otherwise positive there with 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.580
 a load of 1 kg 100 eh ben it is 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.580
 surfaced
