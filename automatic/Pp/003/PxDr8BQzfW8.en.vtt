yes and it was large enough it was

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.140 
yes and it was large enough it was
around<00:00:23.430> two<00:00:23.850> point<00:00:24.180> five<00:00:24.420> centimeter<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:25.380> size

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
around two point five centimeter in size

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.870 
around two point five centimeter in size
here's<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.269> needle<00:00:27.539> coming<00:00:27.750> out<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.880> we're

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
here's a needle coming out and we're

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.849 
here's a needle coming out and we're
going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.330> put<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> needle<00:00:30.689> inside<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.590> fifth

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
going to put the needle inside the fifth

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.370 
going to put the needle inside the fifth
you<00:00:32.130> can<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.790> slime<00:00:33.090> there<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
you can see the slime there this is a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.790 
you can see the slime there this is a
needle<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.960> next<00:00:37.230> step<00:00:37.380> will<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> take

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
needle and the next step will be to take

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.840 
needle and the next step will be to take
a<00:00:37.950> sample<00:00:38.250> from<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.329> test<00:00:40.040> we<00:00:41.040> were<00:00:41.160> able<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
a sample from the test we were able to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.049 
a sample from the test we were able to
get<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> sample<00:00:42.629> from<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.200> assess<00:00:44.059> success

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
get a sample from the assess success

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.049 
get a sample from the assess success
content<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.020> send<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.710> pathology<00:00:47.399> drop

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
content and send it for pathology drop

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.860 
content and send it for pathology drop
for<00:00:48.300> malignant<00:00:48.809> cells<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:50.030> indeed<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.570> found

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
for malignant cells and indeed we found

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.670 
for malignant cells and indeed we found
that<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> cyst<00:00:52.530> has<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:53.219> mild<00:00:53.960> grade<00:00:54.960> or<00:00:55.289> what

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
that the cyst has a mild grade or what

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.040 
that the cyst has a mild grade or what
we<00:00:55.800> called<00:00:56.010> low<00:00:56.219> grade<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.489> dysplasia<00:00:57.120> this

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
we called low grade of dysplasia this

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.889 
we called low grade of dysplasia this
term<00:00:58.350> means<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.850> cyst<00:01:00.210> was<00:01:00.570> harboring

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
term means that the cyst was harboring

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.009 
term means that the cyst was harboring
cells<00:01:01.500> that's<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:02.129> normal<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.480> was<00:01:03.690> an<00:01:03.840> ex

cells that's not normal and it was an ex
way<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.799> become<00:01:05.129> cancer<00:01:05.670> if<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.570> left<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.080> later

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
way to become cancer if we left it later

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.660 
way to become cancer if we left it later
on<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:08.670> patient<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.150> need<00:01:09.390> close<00:01:10.260> follow-up

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
on the patient all need close follow-up

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.840 
on the patient all need close follow-up
she<00:01:11.670> might<00:01:11.850> need<00:01:12.030> surgical<00:01:12.450> consultation<00:01:13.850> but

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
she might need surgical consultation but

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.760 
she might need surgical consultation but
we<00:01:15.000> wouldn't<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.509> without<00:01:16.049> taking<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
we wouldn't know that without taking the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.340 
we wouldn't know that without taking the
sample<00:01:17.159> from<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> test

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
sample from the test

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.990 
sample from the test
now<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.619> pancreatic<00:01:19.830> cancer<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
now as pancreatic cancer is one of the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.560 
now as pancreatic cancer is one of the
most<00:01:21.210> deadly<00:01:21.570> cancers<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.970> once<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.180> diagnose

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
most deadly cancers and once we diagnose

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.050 
most deadly cancers and once we diagnose
it<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.869> often<00:01:25.439> too<00:01:25.590> late<00:01:25.619> okay<00:01:26.610> that's<00:01:26.880> really

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it is often too late okay that's really

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.310 
it is often too late okay that's really
good<00:01:29.090> giving<00:01:30.090> how<00:01:30.270> large<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.750> v<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.140> we're

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
good giving how large the v is we're

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.440 
good giving how large the v is we're
gonna<00:01:31.470> take<00:01:31.680> another<00:01:31.829> sample<00:01:32.250> from<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.790> what

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
gonna take another sample from it what

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.200 
gonna take another sample from it what
we<00:01:33.600> used<00:01:33.869> was<00:01:34.020> endoscopic<00:01:34.740> ultrasound<00:01:35.210> which

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
we used was endoscopic ultrasound which

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.810 
we used was endoscopic ultrasound which
enable<00:01:36.810> us<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.439> an<00:01:37.590> early<00:01:37.920> diagnosis<00:01:38.610> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
enable us to get an early diagnosis of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.480 
enable us to get an early diagnosis of
no<00:01:39.659> great<00:01:39.930> dysplasia<00:01:40.409> before<00:01:40.979> even<00:01:41.250> has

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
no great dysplasia before even has

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
no great dysplasia before even has
become<00:01:41.790> cancer

become cancer

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.450 
become cancer
and<00:01:42.600> prevent<00:01:43.140> cysts<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.650> that<00:01:44.100> from

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and prevent cysts like that from

before you would do an open surgery or
laparoscopy<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.860> sometime<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.820> would<00:02:06.000> do

and CT guided biopsy from the skin and
it<00:02:10.260> is<00:02:10.380> very<00:02:10.590> hard<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.950> reach<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.430> pancreas

it is very hard to reach the pancreas
from<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.120> skin<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:13.590> was<00:02:13.800> really

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
from the skin and this was really

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.700 
from the skin and this was really
cumbersome<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.660> patient<00:02:15.900> sometimes

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
cumbersome and this patient sometimes

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.290 
cumbersome and this patient sometimes
you<00:02:16.950> would<00:02:17.100> pass<00:02:17.250> without<00:02:17.490> being<00:02:17.850> diagnosed

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
you would pass without being diagnosed

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.180 
you would pass without being diagnosed
till<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.110> become<00:02:19.380> having<00:02:19.800> cancer

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
till that we have become having cancer

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
where it is originating from and what

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.430 
where it is originating from and what
looks<00:03:20.790> like<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.360> we<00:03:21.450> can<00:03:21.600> also<00:03:21.780> take<00:03:22.050> biopsies

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
looks like and we can also take biopsies
