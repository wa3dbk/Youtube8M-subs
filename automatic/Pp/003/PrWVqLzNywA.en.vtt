your<00:03:46.049> team<00:03:46.109> because<00:03:46.680> if<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:46.949> observe<00:03:47.340> people

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
your team because if you observe people

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.309 
your team because if you observe people
while<00:03:48.150> they're<00:03:48.359> doing<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.780> some<00:03:48.989> people<00:03:49.199> are

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319

like I'm gonna try this right away they
don't<00:03:50.970> need<00:03:51.060> instructions<00:03:51.359> or<00:03:51.810> just<00:03:51.989> their

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
gung-ho you want to try it and some

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.039 
gung-ho you want to try it and some
people<00:03:53.849> are<00:03:53.940> like<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.209> want<00:03:54.449> to<00:03:54.540> see<00:03:54.690> others

that<00:03:59.879> with<00:04:00.299> instructions<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.109> it<00:04:01.500> tells<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:01.859> a

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
that with instructions so it tells you a

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.439 
that with instructions so it tells you a
little<00:04:02.010> bit<00:04:02.190> about<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.519> move<00:04:02.639> dynamics<00:04:03.239> how

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
little bit about the move dynamics how

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:07.250 
little bit about the move dynamics how
people<00:04:03.720> work<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.889> it's<00:04:05.340> fun<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:07.019> what<00:04:07.199> I

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
people work and and it's fun so what I
