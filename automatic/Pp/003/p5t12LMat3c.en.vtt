00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
are muddy well since I have everything

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.120 
are muddy well since I have everything
said<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.760> don't<00:00:08.940> know<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.210> think<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.920> game

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
said I don't know I think that this game

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.150 
said I don't know I think that this game
really<00:00:12.120> important<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:13.790> to<00:00:14.790> understand<00:00:16.160> which

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
really important to to understand which

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.099 
really important to to understand which
season<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:18.119> live<00:00:18.590> from<00:00:19.590> now<00:00:19.859> till<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.270> end<00:00:21.570> I

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
season we live from now till the end I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.580 
season we live from now till the end I
think<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:24.109> very<00:00:25.109> important

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
think that this is a very important

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.429 
think that this is a very important
result<00:00:25.970> yes<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.210> because<00:00:27.449> last<00:00:27.990> season<00:00:28.230> we

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
result yes that because last season we

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.839 
result yes that because last season we
didn't<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.859> good<00:00:28.980> result<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.699> this

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
didn't have a good result here and this

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.030 
didn't have a good result here and this
is<00:00:29.970> one<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.599> shows<00:00:30.900> how<00:00:31.320> far<00:00:31.560> we've<00:00:31.769> come<00:00:31.800> in

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
is one so shows how far we've come in

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.430 
is one so shows how far we've come in
that<00:00:32.250> time<00:00:32.489> yeah<00:00:33.270> yeah<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.809> pitch<00:00:34.050> was<00:00:34.200> very

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that time yeah yeah this pitch was very

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.069 
that time yeah yeah this pitch was very
difficult<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:35.010> think<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.760> think<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.780> there<00:00:36.989> are

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
difficult I think I think that there are

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.540 
difficult I think I think that there are
many<00:00:38.040> teams<00:00:39.079> we<00:00:40.079> lose<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.800> lose<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.010> point<00:00:41.280> for

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
many teams we lose we lose a point for

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.709 
many teams we lose we lose a point for
me<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:44.120> also<00:00:45.120> because<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.539> play

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
me and I think that also because we play

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.830 
me and I think that also because we play
three<00:00:45.960> days<00:00:46.140> after<00:00:46.559> Naples<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.370> maybe<00:00:47.840> they

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
three days after Naples and maybe they

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.779 
three days after Naples and maybe they
were<00:00:48.899> pro<00:00:49.140> players<00:00:50.510> more<00:00:51.510> fresh<00:00:51.750> than<00:00:51.780> us<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
were pro players more fresh than us and

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.430 
were pro players more fresh than us and
but<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.820> think<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.570> did<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:55.289> did

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
but I think that we did we did

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.340 
but I think that we did we did
performance<00:00:56.100> only<00:00:56.460> last<00:00:56.789> ten<00:00:57.030> minutes<00:00:57.230> we<00:00:58.230> had

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
performance only last ten minutes we had

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.590 
performance only last ten minutes we had
really<00:00:58.800> some<00:00:59.129> problem<00:00:59.460> because<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.850> remained

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
really some problem because we remained

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.229 
really some problem because we remained
with<00:01:00.840> them<00:01:01.020> employers<00:01:01.910> but<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.090> frustrating

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
with them employers but it's frustrating

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.780 
with them employers but it's frustrating
when<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.260> ahead<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.189> then<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.400> girl<00:01:05.549> goes

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
when you go ahead and then a girl goes

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.420 
when you go ahead and then a girl goes
in<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.270> quick<00:01:06.510> left<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:06.990> an<00:01:07.170> unknown<00:01:07.950> girl<00:01:08.189> as

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
in so quick left with an unknown girl as

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.520 
in so quick left with an unknown girl as
well<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.850> did<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> think<00:01:09.689> about<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.020> yeah<00:01:10.500> I

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
well as did you think about that yeah I

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.440 
well as did you think about that yeah I
think<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.189> were<00:01:11.340> also<00:01:11.549> lucky<00:01:11.880> to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
think that we were also lucky to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.899 
think that we were also lucky to
consider<00:01:12.990> first<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.530> first<00:01:13.799> god<00:01:14.390> on<00:01:15.390> goal<00:01:16.909> but

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
consider first the first god on goal but

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.090 
consider first the first god on goal but
I<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> end<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.350> happy<00:01:19.680> with

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
I think that in the end I'm happy with

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.090 
I think that in the end I'm happy with
this<00:01:20.280> result<00:01:20.909> because<00:01:21.240> also<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:22.409> men<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
this result because also in men in the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.039 
this result because also in men in the
last<00:01:23.280> ten<00:01:23.580> minutes<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.299> fight<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.869> very

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
last ten minutes we fight on a very
