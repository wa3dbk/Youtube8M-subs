00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
144 pots to put them in but I found the
perfect<00:01:14.580> answer<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.540> that's<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.200> good<00:01:16.290> old

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
perfect answer and that's the good old

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.070 
perfect answer and that's the good old
egg<00:01:16.650> box<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.630> now<00:01:18.840> is

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
egg box and what I'm going to do now is

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.310 
egg box and what I'm going to do now is
to<00:01:19.380> collect<00:01:19.680> some<00:01:19.920> seeds<00:01:20.369> from<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.330> poppy<00:01:21.630> now

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
to collect some seeds from a poppy now

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.980 
to collect some seeds from a poppy now
we've<00:01:22.470> got<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> poppy<00:01:23.130> head<00:01:23.430> here<00:01:23.729> cut<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.780> off

we've got a poppy head here cut this off
and<00:01:25.350> hopefully<00:01:25.650> by<00:01:26.549> using<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.180> these<00:01:27.450> we

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
and hopefully by using one of these we

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.830 
and hopefully by using one of these we
can<00:01:27.780> tip<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.380> poppy<00:01:29.009> seeds<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:30.570> there<00:01:30.720> are

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
can tip the poppy seeds and there are

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.440 
can tip the poppy seeds and there are
quite<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.079> few<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.740> fact<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:32.970> are<00:01:33.000> hundreds

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
quite a few in fact there are hundreds

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.370 
quite a few in fact there are hundreds
upon<00:01:33.900> hundreds<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.939> those<00:01:36.540> poppy

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
upon hundreds in just one of those poppy

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.649 
upon hundreds in just one of those poppy
seed<00:01:37.799> heads<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.310> those<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.119> would<00:01:39.329> go<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
temporary measure but it really does

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.229 
temporary measure but it really does
work<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:25.320> clogs<00:03:25.799> up<00:03:26.070> their<00:03:26.250> slime<00:03:26.640> glam<00:03:26.970> that

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239

work that clogs up their slime glam that
gets<00:03:27.420> into<00:03:27.900> their<00:03:28.080> little<00:03:28.530> holes<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.220> just

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
gets into their little holes and I just

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.400 
gets into their little holes and I just
can't<00:03:29.640> move<00:03:29.850> over<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.510> it's<00:03:30.780> actually

can't move over it and it's actually

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.080 
can't move over it and it's actually
quite<00:03:31.530> fun<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:31.830> watch<00:03:32.040> because<00:03:32.280> they<00:03:32.549> foam<00:03:32.850> up

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
quite fun to watch because they foam up

the citrus and one last tip to give you
I<00:04:03.480> think<00:04:03.660> it's<00:04:03.900> probably<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.290> most<00:04:04.410> effective

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
I think it's probably the most effective

I think it's probably the most effective
the<00:04:05.370> most<00:04:05.579> organic<00:04:06.060> way<00:04:06.390> of<00:04:06.510> keeping<00:04:06.690> slugs

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
grease that does the trick so you put a

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.940 
grease that does the trick so you put a
ring<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.830> all

make the mistake of putting bricks

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.260 
make the mistake of putting bricks
because<00:04:34.920> they'll<00:04:35.220> climb<00:04:35.490> over<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.880> bricks<00:04:36.150> to

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
because they'll climb over the bricks to

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.230 
because they'll climb over the bricks to
get<00:04:36.390> at<00:04:36.480> your<00:04:36.570> plant<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.730> what<00:04:38.730> happens<00:04:39.030> now

they<00:04:39.810> try<00:04:40.170> and<00:04:40.320> get<00:04:40.410> at<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.620> plant<00:04:40.890> and<00:04:41.160> as

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
they try and get at the plant and as

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.820 
they try and get at the plant and as

they crawl over the hair all of a sudden
they<00:04:44.280> start<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.790> sizzle<00:04:45.090> because<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.140> grease

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
they start to sizzle because the grease

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.010 
they start to sizzle because the grease
in<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:46.980> horsehair<00:04:47.610> reacts<00:04:48.210> with<00:04:48.450> their<00:04:48.630> slime

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
in the horsehair reacts with their slime

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.350 
in the horsehair reacts with their slime
to<00:04:49.560> make<00:04:49.710> an<00:04:49.860> acid<00:04:50.250> that<00:04:50.280> actually<00:04:50.670> burns<00:04:50.940> them

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
to make an acid that actually burns them
