organ<00:00:00.450> is<00:00:00.570> moving<00:00:00.870> forward<00:00:01.140> on<00:00:01.469> what<00:00:01.740> many

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
organ is moving forward on what many

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.320 
organ is moving forward on what many
consider<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.490> be<00:00:02.580> one<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:02.970> most<00:00:03.149> ambitious

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
consider to be one of the most ambitious

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.019 
consider to be one of the most ambitious
attempts<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.410> combat<00:00:04.859> rising<00:00:05.160> costs<00:00:05.910> to

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
attempts to combat rising costs to

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.390 
attempts to combat rising costs to
attend<00:00:06.330> universities<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.230> America<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.859> so

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
attend universities in America and so

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.770 
attend universities in America and so
I'm<00:00:08.610> talking<00:00:08.910> about<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.090> bill<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.300> passed<00:00:09.480> the

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
I'm talking about a bill that passed the

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.089 
I'm talking about a bill that passed the
Democratic<00:00:10.260> controlled<00:00:10.530> Senate<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
Democratic controlled Senate and the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.890 
Democratic controlled Senate and the
Democrat<00:00:11.460> controlled<00:00:11.849> house<00:00:12.059> it's<00:00:12.599> waiting

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
Democrat controlled house it's waiting

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.749 
Democrat controlled house it's waiting
for<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.259> signature<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.219> governor<00:00:14.370> who<00:00:14.730> is

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
for the signature of the governor who is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.129 
for the signature of the governor who is
also<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.120> Democrat<00:00:15.299> by<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.719> way<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:15.929> it's

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
also a Democrat by the way so it's

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.080 
also a Democrat by the way so it's
likely<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:16.770> signed<00:00:17.010> but<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> idea<00:00:18.029> behind

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
likely to be signed but the idea behind

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.609 
likely to be signed but the idea behind
this<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.050> would<00:00:19.140> create<00:00:19.380> what

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
this is that it would create what

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.529 
this is that it would create what
they're<00:00:19.740> calling<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.189> pay<00:00:20.490> forward<00:00:20.850> pay<00:00:21.300> back

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
they're calling a pay forward pay back

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.290 
they're calling a pay forward pay back
system<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.199> Oregon<00:00:23.010> where<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.760> would<00:00:23.939> attend

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
system in Oregon where you would attend

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300 
system in Oregon where you would attend
college<00:00:24.720> virtually<00:00:25.410> free<00:00:25.710> while<00:00:26.070> you're

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
college virtually free while you're

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.410 
college virtually free while you're
there<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.580> wouldn't<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.119> pay<00:00:27.240> anything

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
there you wouldn't have to pay anything

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.450 
there you wouldn't have to pay anything
to<00:00:27.570> attend<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.170> then<00:00:28.560> afterward<00:00:29.070> you'd<00:00:29.250> sign

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
to attend and then afterward you'd sign

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.550

percentage of your income back to the

percentage of your income back to the
university<00:00:38.129> system<00:00:38.430> or<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.579> suppose<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> state

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
university system or I suppose the state

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.970 
university system or I suppose the state
specifically<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.469> they're<00:00:40.590> saying<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.890> would

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
specifically and they're saying it would

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.319 
specifically and they're saying it would
probably<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.340> around<00:00:41.730> three<00:00:42.149> percent

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
probably be around three percent

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.750 
probably be around three percent
depending<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.260> your<00:00:43.829> income<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.280> depending

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
depending on your income and depending

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.910 
depending on your income and depending
on<00:00:44.820> what<00:00:44.969> university<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.629> went<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.800> we've

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
on what university you went to so we've

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.959 
on what university you went to so we've
got<00:00:47.039> some<00:00:47.190> more<00:00:47.280> details<00:00:47.640> about<00:00:47.760> how<00:00:47.879> this

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
got some more details about how this

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.580 
got some more details about how this
might<00:00:48.149> actually<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.539> implemented<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.379> just

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
might actually be implemented but just

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.110 
might actually be implemented but just
based<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> general<00:00:50.489> idea<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.059> you

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
based on the general idea what do you

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.779 
based on the general idea what do you
think<00:00:51.300> about<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.840> mean<00:00:52.170> my<00:00:52.789> initial

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
think about this I mean my initial

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.459 
think about this I mean my initial
reaction<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.539> sounds<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:54.840> indentured

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
reaction is this sounds like indentured

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.110 
reaction is this sounds like indentured
servitude<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.550> don't<00:00:56.610> think<00:00:57.000> it's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
servitude like I don't think it's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.549 
servitude like I don't think it's
something<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.539> would<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.140> sign<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.350> for

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
something I would want to sign up for

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.209 
something I would want to sign up for
yeah<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.570> mean<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.620> guess<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> same

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
yeah I I mean it's I guess it's the same

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.889 
yeah I I mean it's I guess it's the same
thing<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.520> taking<00:01:02.820> out<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> loan<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.780> then

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
thing as taking out a loan and then

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.890 
thing as taking out a loan and then
paying<00:01:04.170> back<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:04.979> school<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:06.030> later<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.659> but

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
paying back your school or later but but

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.570 
paying back your school or later but but
it's<00:01:07.020> linked<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.710> idea<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.549> are

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
it's linked to the idea of like you are

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.460 
it's linked to the idea of like you are
working<00:01:09.060> contributing<00:01:09.990> member<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> society

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
working contributing member of society

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.620 
working contributing member of society
and<00:01:11.040> will<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.760> able<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.970> take<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> percentage<00:01:12.420> of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and will be able to take a percentage of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.969 
and will be able to take a percentage of
your<00:01:12.720> income<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.409> seems<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.740> there's<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
your income it seems like there's a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
your income it seems like there's a
couple<00:01:14.159> problems<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.270> qualify<00:01:15.420> as

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
couple problems you have to qualify as

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.170 
couple problems you have to qualify as
an<00:01:15.840> Oregon<00:01:16.200> resident<00:01:16.650> mm-hm<00:01:17.130> what<00:01:17.850> happens<00:01:18.090> if

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
an Oregon resident mm-hm what happens if

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.719 
an Oregon resident mm-hm what happens if
you<00:01:18.240> leave<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.600> state<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.310> assume<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.610> it's

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
you leave this state I assume and it's

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.120 
you leave this state I assume and it's
not<00:01:21.000> clear<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:22.650> fast<00:01:22.950> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
not clear here just really fast so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.219 
not clear here just really fast so
they're<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.090> if<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.840> gets<00:01:24.990> signed

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
they're going to if it gets signed

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.510 
they're going to if it gets signed
they're<00:01:25.470> gonna<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.770> assess<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
they're gonna like assess the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.370 
they're gonna like assess the
feasibility<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.990> would<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.200> put

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
feasibility and then it would be put

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.620 
feasibility and then it would be put
into<00:01:28.560> limited<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.579> circulation<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.360> suppose

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
into limited like circulation I suppose

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.840 
into limited like circulation I suppose
in<00:01:30.780> 2015<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> assume<00:01:32.130> during<00:01:32.729> that

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
in 2015 and so I assume during that

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.190 
in 2015 and so I assume during that
feasibility<00:01:33.390> study<00:01:33.600> they'd<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.869> figuring<00:01:34.140> out

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
feasibility study they'd be figuring out

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.660 
feasibility study they'd be figuring out
things<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.799> assume<00:01:35.280> they<00:01:35.400> would<00:01:35.520> not

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
things like I assume they would not

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
things like I assume they would not
allow<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.180> flee<00:01:36.420> or<00:01:36.630> yeah<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.229> also

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
allow you to just flee or yeah and also

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.560 
allow you to just flee or yeah and also
this<00:01:37.829> idea<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.759> hopefully<00:01:39.360> they<00:01:39.479> would

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
this idea of like hopefully they would

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.880 
this idea of like hopefully they would
have<00:01:39.750> all<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:39.990> worked<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.680> it

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
have all this worked out not like it

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.859 
have all this worked out not like it
might<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.250> 3%<00:01:41.640> maybe<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> next<00:01:42.689> twenty

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
might be 3% maybe for the next twenty

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.899 
might be 3% maybe for the next twenty
four<00:01:43.049> years<00:01:43.229> or<00:01:43.350> let<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.829> or<00:01:44.009> 40<00:01:44.490> yeah

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
four years or let you know or 40 yeah

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.490 
four years or let you know or 40 yeah
yeah<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.320> freaks

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
yeah you know like that kind of freaks

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.249 
yeah you know like that kind of freaks
me<00:01:46.560> out<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.100> know<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.549> mean<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.479> I'm<00:01:49.079> not

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
me out but you know I I mean I I'm not

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.870 
me out but you know I I mean I I'm not
sure<00:01:49.290> if<00:01:49.530> I'm<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:50.130> who<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.640> talk

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
sure if I'm really one who can talk

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.810 
sure if I'm really one who can talk
about<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.509> did<00:01:52.439> my<00:01:52.560> Master's<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.520> loans

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
about this I did my Master's on loans

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.270 
about this I did my Master's on loans
and<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:55.350> know<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.829> difficult<00:01:56.189> but

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and you know that can be difficult but

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.609 
and you know that can be difficult but
my<00:01:56.399> undergrad<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> was<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.180> really<00:01:57.899> poor<00:01:58.200> like

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
my undergrad I was like really poor like

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.530 
my undergrad I was like really poor like
my<00:01:58.860> mom<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.549> were<00:01:59.729> really<00:01:59.969> poor<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.479> I

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
my mom and I were really poor and so I

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.260 
my mom and I were really poor and so I
qualified<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.229> Texas<00:02:02.130> State<00:02:02.340> grants<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.060> we

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
qualified for Texas State grants and we

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.760 
qualified for Texas State grants and we
didn't<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.750> pay<00:02:03.990> any<00:02:04.170> money<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.619> my

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
didn't have to pay any money for my

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.850 
didn't have to pay any money for my
entire<00:02:05.009> undergo

entire undergo
I<00:02:05.920> mean<00:02:06.190> not<00:02:06.490> for<00:02:06.700> tuition<00:02:07.210> obviously<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:07.780> had

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
I mean not for tuition obviously I had

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.630 
I mean not for tuition obviously I had
to<00:02:07.960> pay<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.440> live<00:02:08.649> but<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:08.890> had<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.039> job<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.580> I

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
to pay to live but I had a job and I

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.980 
to pay to live but I had a job and I
worked<00:02:09.820> all<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.179> out<00:02:10.300> but<00:02:10.420> tuition<00:02:10.810> was

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
worked all of that out but tuition was

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.320 
worked all of that out but tuition was
remissed<00:02:11.380> for<00:02:11.590> me<00:02:11.740> because<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.340> was<00:02:13.090> broke<00:02:13.270> and

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
remissed for me because I was broke and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.200 
remissed for me because I was broke and
I<00:02:13.510> went<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.780> state<00:02:13.930> school<00:02:14.460> so<00:02:15.460> it's<00:02:15.940> it's

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
I went to a state school so it's it's

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.700 
I went to a state school so it's it's
hard<00:02:16.420> for<00:02:16.510> me<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.750> really<00:02:17.140> have<00:02:17.290> much<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.620> an

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
hard for me to really have much of an

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.640 
hard for me to really have much of an
opinion<00:02:17.890> on<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.250> because<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.520> wasn't<00:02:19.210> really

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
opinion on this because I wasn't really

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.720 
opinion on this because I wasn't really
crippled<00:02:20.650> by<00:02:20.890> student<00:02:21.280> loan<00:02:21.430> debt<00:02:21.610> from

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
crippled by student loan debt from

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.610 
crippled by student loan debt from
undergrad<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.390> masters<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:22.900> starting<00:02:23.500> my

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
undergrad and masters and starting my

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.290 
undergrad and masters and starting my
PhD<00:02:23.890> which<00:02:24.220> most<00:02:24.430> most<00:02:24.910> people<00:02:25.090> don't<00:02:25.150> really

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
PhD which most most people don't really

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.480 
PhD which most most people don't really
take<00:02:25.450> out<00:02:25.570> loans<00:02:25.690> for<00:02:25.870> PhDs<00:02:26.290> cuz<00:02:26.530> yeah<00:02:26.830> the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
take out loans for PhDs cuz yeah the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.070 
take out loans for PhDs cuz yeah the
universities<00:02:27.940> usually<00:02:28.180> pay<00:02:28.690> for<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:28.990> if

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
universities usually pay for it if

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.310 
universities usually pay for it if
you're<00:02:29.200> if<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.470> ya<00:02:30.130> ta<00:02:30.670> or<00:02:31.060> lab<00:02:31.330> tech<00:02:31.660> ya<00:02:32.020> you

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
you're if you ya ta or lab tech ya you

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.930 
you're if you ya ta or lab tech ya you
figure<00:02:32.709> out<00:02:32.740> how<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:32.920> pay<00:02:33.130> for<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.490> and

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
figure out how to pay for that and and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.370 
figure out how to pay for that and and
usually<00:02:34.300> your<00:02:34.420> lab<00:02:34.600> will<00:02:34.840> have<00:02:34.870> some<00:02:35.140> sort<00:02:35.320> of

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
usually your lab will have some sort of

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.780 
usually your lab will have some sort of
funding<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:36.040> that's<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.280> only<00:02:36.459> way<00:02:36.550> they<00:02:36.670> can

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
funding and that's the only way they can

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.100 
funding and that's the only way they can
actually<00:02:36.910> pull<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.390> on<00:02:37.420> as<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.660> PhD<00:02:38.050> student

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
actually pull you on as a PhD student

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.600 
actually pull you on as a PhD student
what<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.680> find<00:02:38.920> interesting<00:02:39.190> about<00:02:39.459> this

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
what I find interesting about this

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.030 
what I find interesting about this
particular<00:02:39.850> system<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.540> we<00:02:41.200> have<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.680> long

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
particular system is we have this long

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.680 
particular system is we have this long
experiment<00:02:42.580> with<00:02:42.820> social<00:02:43.090> security<00:02:43.209> where

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
experiment with social security where

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.990 
experiment with social security where
you<00:02:43.720> are<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.620> are<00:02:44.739> paying<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.400> basically

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
you are you are paying in basically

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.430 
you are you are paying in basically
during<00:02:46.239> your<00:02:46.420> working<00:02:46.630> years<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.320> then

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
during your working years and then

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.750 
during your working years and then
you're<00:02:47.560> taking<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:48.010> out<00:02:48.070> afterward<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:48.700> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
you're taking it out afterward and the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.790 
you're taking it out afterward and the
problem<00:02:49.090> with<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.209> is<00:02:49.450> as<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.930> population

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
problem with that is as the population

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.380 
problem with that is as the population
ages<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.280> have<00:02:51.400> more<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.700> more<00:02:51.820> people<00:02:52.030> being

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
ages you have more and more people being

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.810 
ages you have more and more people being
paid<00:02:52.780> by<00:02:53.140> fewer<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.739> fewer<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.459> cool<00:02:54.640> thing

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
paid by fewer and fewer the cool thing

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.430 
paid by fewer and fewer the cool thing
about<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.390> it's<00:02:55.630> actually<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.140> exact

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
about this is it's actually the exact

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.710 
about this is it's actually the exact
opposite<00:02:56.980> you're<00:02:57.459> taking<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:57.970> money<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.420> when

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
opposite you're taking the money in when

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.330 
opposite you're taking the money in when
you're<00:02:58.900> young<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.230> then<00:02:59.530> paying<00:02:59.800> off<00:03:00.040> over<00:03:00.310> a

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
you're young and then paying off over a

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.860 
you're young and then paying off over a
longer<00:03:00.550> period<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.360> cool<00:03:01.480> thing<00:03:01.540> is

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
longer period and so the cool thing is

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.420 
longer period and so the cool thing is
that<00:03:01.900> if<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.560> extrapolate<00:03:02.890> out<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.220> few

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
that if you extrapolate out a few

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.400 
that if you extrapolate out a few
decades<00:03:03.760> eventually<00:03:04.720> you'll<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:05.020> way<00:03:05.380> more

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
decades eventually you'll have way more

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.680 
decades eventually you'll have way more
people<00:03:06.280> paying<00:03:06.489> into<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.850> system<00:03:07.000> than

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
people paying into the system than

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.850 
people paying into the system than
taking<00:03:08.020> out<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.380> so<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.560> becomes

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
taking out and so it becomes

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.039 
taking out and so it becomes
increasingly<00:03:09.480> economically<00:03:10.480> feasible<00:03:10.750> I

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
increasingly economically feasible I

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.150 
increasingly economically feasible I
think<00:03:11.230> you're<00:03:11.320> about<00:03:11.440> here<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.799> think<00:03:11.860> that

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
think you're about here I think that

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.060 
think you're about here I think that
depends<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.940> kind<00:03:13.299> of<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.540> boom<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:14.170> birth

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
depends on kind of the boom of birth

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.830 
depends on kind of the boom of birth
rates<00:03:15.430> in<00:03:15.670> this<00:03:15.790> country<00:03:16.150> -<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.330> mean<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.630> think<00:03:16.690> a

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
rates in this country - I mean I think a

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.000 
rates in this country - I mean I think a
big<00:03:17.019> problem<00:03:17.320> with<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.620> way<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.860> social

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
big problem with the way that social

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.280 
big problem with the way that social
Social<00:03:18.820> Security<00:03:19.120> is<00:03:19.180> working<00:03:19.239> now<00:03:19.510> this<00:03:20.080> is

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
Social Security is working now this is

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.570 
Social Security is working now this is
that<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.500> baby<00:03:20.680> boomers<00:03:21.040> are<00:03:21.160> getting<00:03:21.370> old

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
that the baby boomers are getting old

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.370 
that the baby boomers are getting old
you<00:03:22.060> know<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:22.900> I'm<00:03:23.049> not<00:03:23.200> sure<00:03:23.320> if

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
you know and and and I'm not sure if

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.380 
you know and and and I'm not sure if
that's<00:03:23.470> gonna<00:03:23.680> be<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:24.010> case<00:03:24.220> as<00:03:24.459> we<00:03:24.760> start<00:03:25.269> to

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
that's gonna be the case as we start to

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.880 
that's gonna be the case as we start to
age<00:03:25.420> out<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:25.959> mean<00:03:26.170> it's<00:03:26.290> going<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.500> be<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.709> case

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
age out I mean it's going to be the case

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.110 
age out I mean it's going to be the case
because<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.310> way<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.700> system<00:03:28.000> is

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
because of the way that the system is

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.360 
because of the way that the system is
structured<00:03:28.540> but<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.380> think<00:03:29.950> we're<00:03:30.070> gonna<00:03:30.160> see<00:03:30.340> a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
structured but I think we're gonna see a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.220 
structured but I think we're gonna see a
band<00:03:30.760> flow<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.090> how<00:03:31.180> many<00:03:31.360> people<00:03:31.630> are<00:03:32.110> gonna

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
band flow of how many people are gonna

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.380 
band flow of how many people are gonna
be<00:03:32.470> kind<00:03:32.739> of<00:03:32.799> utilizing<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:33.519> system<00:03:33.880> but<00:03:34.209> one

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
be kind of utilizing that system but one

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.210 
be kind of utilizing that system but one
thing<00:03:34.540> that<00:03:34.690> worries<00:03:34.900> me<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.530> know<00:03:35.680> they're

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
thing that worries me you know they're

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.720 
thing that worries me you know they're
saying<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:38.560> they<00:03:38.799> hope<00:03:39.130> that<00:03:39.580> this

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
saying that that they hope that this

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.870 
saying that that they hope that this
will<00:03:39.970> become<00:03:40.570> kind<00:03:40.989> of<00:03:41.049> a<00:03:41.260> net<00:03:41.880> neutral

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
will become kind of a net neutral

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.940 
will become kind of a net neutral
situation<00:03:43.510> right<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.350> people<00:03:44.590> are<00:03:44.709> going<00:03:44.860> to

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
situation right that people are going to

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.070 
situation right that people are going to
go<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.340> school<00:03:45.670> for<00:03:45.820> free<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.239> then<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:46.959> know

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
go to school for free and then you know

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.430 
go to school for free and then you know
based<00:03:47.560> on<00:03:47.769> your<00:03:48.250> ability<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:48.760> get<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.209> job<00:03:49.440> but

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
based on your ability to get a job but

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.979 
based on your ability to get a job but
you're<00:03:50.590> gonna<00:03:50.709> be<00:03:50.890> able<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.130> pay<00:03:51.280> back<00:03:51.489> into<00:03:51.820> it

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
you're gonna be able to pay back into it

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.810 
you're gonna be able to pay back into it
where<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.320> job<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.950> know<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.310> unemployment

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
where the job you know the unemployment

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.720 
where the job you know the unemployment
is<00:03:55.269> crazy<00:03:55.750> low<00:03:56.170> for<00:03:56.470> recent<00:03:56.799> graduates<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.610> I

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
is crazy low for recent graduates and I

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.280 
is crazy low for recent graduates and I
don't<00:03:58.060> know<00:03:58.360> if<00:03:58.510> that's<00:03:58.690> gonna<00:03:58.930> change

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
don't know if that's gonna change

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.310 
don't know if that's gonna change
anytime<00:03:59.680> soon<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:00.280> so<00:04:00.730> yes<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.209> do<00:04:01.600> think<00:04:01.900> that

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
anytime soon and so yes I do think that

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.440 
anytime soon and so yes I do think that
it's<00:04:02.500> important<00:04:03.040> for<00:04:03.370> people<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.820> get<00:04:04.120> a

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
it's important for people to get a

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.449 
it's important for people to get a
college<00:04:05.320> education<00:04:05.530> but<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:06.010> think<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.250> job

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
college education but I think the job

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.039 
college education but I think the job
prospects<00:04:06.970> aren't<00:04:07.150> as<00:04:07.360> good<00:04:07.540> as<00:04:07.690> they<00:04:07.780> used<00:04:07.959> to

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
prospects aren't as good as they used to

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.870 
prospects aren't as good as they used to
be<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.350> I<00:04:08.410> think<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:08.829> can<00:04:09.370> be<00:04:09.579> kind<00:04:09.790> of

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
be and I think that that can be kind of

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.729 
be and I think that that can be kind of
scary<00:04:10.209> for<00:04:10.450> somebody<00:04:10.750> saying<00:04:10.959> I'm<00:04:11.170> gonna<00:04:11.470> eat

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
scary for somebody saying I'm gonna eat

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.430 
scary for somebody saying I'm gonna eat
all<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.040> cake<00:04:12.280> now<00:04:12.640> and<00:04:13.120> then<00:04:13.780> pay<00:04:13.959> back<00:04:13.989> into

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
all the cake now and then pay back into

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.960 
all the cake now and then pay back into
the<00:04:14.560> system<00:04:14.920> later<00:04:15.160> I<00:04:15.340> don't<00:04:15.730> know<00:04:15.819> if<00:04:15.910> I'm

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
the system later I don't know if I'm

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.430 
the system later I don't know if I'm
gonna<00:04:16.120> be<00:04:16.180> able<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:16.599> have<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.020> kind<00:04:17.200> of<00:04:17.260> job

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
gonna be able to have the kind of job

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.670 
gonna be able to have the kind of job
that<00:04:17.470> can<00:04:17.830> sustain<00:04:17.979> me

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
that can sustain me

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.069 
that can sustain me
3%<00:04:18.979> sounds<00:04:19.579> low<00:04:19.789> but<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.479> cakes<00:04:20.720> super

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
3% sounds low but the cakes super

3% sounds low but the cakes super
expensive<00:04:21.320> exactly<00:04:21.949> and<00:04:22.100> if<00:04:22.250> we're<00:04:22.430> talking

something like that I mean that can

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.980 
something like that I mean that can
actually<00:04:28.250> really<00:04:28.639> hurt<00:04:28.820> yeah<00:04:29.090> yeah<00:04:29.509> yeah<00:04:29.870> I

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990

actually really hurt yeah yeah yeah I
can't<00:04:30.320> um<00:04:30.530> but<00:04:31.130> something<00:04:31.400> does<00:04:31.550> need<00:04:31.729> to<00:04:31.759> be

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
can't um but something does need to be

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.400 
can't um but something does need to be
done<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.240> mean<00:04:32.539> this<00:04:32.660> is<00:04:32.810> kind<00:04:33.020> of<00:04:33.110> what<00:04:33.289> the

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
done I mean this is kind of what the

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.779 
done I mean this is kind of what the
good<00:04:33.680> thing<00:04:33.740> about<00:04:33.889> the<00:04:34.130> u.s.<00:04:34.400> is<00:04:34.610> that<00:04:34.669> we

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
good thing about the u.s. is that we

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.010 
good thing about the u.s. is that we
have<00:04:34.970> 50<00:04:35.300> different<00:04:35.389> states<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:35.870> can

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
have 50 different states that can

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.930 
have 50 different states that can
operate<00:04:36.169> is<00:04:36.530> individual<00:04:37.160> like<00:04:37.310> laboratories

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
operate is individual like laboratories

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.860 
operate is individual like laboratories
of<00:04:38.090> democracy<00:04:38.120> trying<00:04:38.750> out<00:04:38.840> different

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
of democracy trying out different

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.629 
of democracy trying out different
policies<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.710> maybe<00:04:40.009> this<00:04:40.160> won't<00:04:40.340> work<00:04:40.460> and

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
policies and maybe this won't work and

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.010 
policies and maybe this won't work and
maybe<00:04:40.759> it<00:04:40.910> won't<00:04:41.090> even<00:04:41.180> be<00:04:41.360> tried<00:04:41.570> out<00:04:41.720> but<00:04:41.750> it

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
maybe it won't even be tried out but it

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.230 
maybe it won't even be tried out but it
is<00:04:42.139> I<00:04:42.169> think<00:04:42.410> interesting<00:04:43.100> at<00:04:43.430> least<00:04:43.639> and<00:04:43.880> so

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
is I think interesting at least and so

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.580 
is I think interesting at least and so
we<00:04:44.360> will<00:04:44.479> keep<00:04:44.600> you<00:04:44.720> apprised<00:04:45.050> if<00:04:45.380> the

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
we will keep you apprised if the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.810 
we will keep you apprised if the
governor<00:04:45.889> does<00:04:46.039> sign<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.490> if<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.669> does

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
governor does sign it and if it does

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.169 
governor does sign it and if it does
actually<00:04:47.030> go<00:04:47.330> into<00:04:47.539> circulation
