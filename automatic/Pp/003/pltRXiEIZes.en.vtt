we have now a better view finder when it
was<00:00:37.809> before<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.410> all<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.710> eggs<00:00:38.829> we<00:00:38.980> got<00:00:39.010> a

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
was before the all the eggs we got a

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.220 
was before the all the eggs we got a
sort<00:00:39.370> of<00:00:39.399> monocular<00:00:39.850> snap-on<00:00:40.300> now<00:00:40.870> you've<00:00:41.079> got

a<00:00:41.260> fully<00:00:41.530> integrated<00:00:41.829> viewfinder<00:00:42.699> it<00:00:43.390> still

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
a fully integrated viewfinder it still

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.720 
a fully integrated viewfinder it still
shoots<00:00:44.020> on<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.290> sys<00:00:44.710> but<00:00:45.190> there<00:00:45.310> are<00:00:45.460> other

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
shoots on the sys but there are other

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.990 
shoots on the sys but there are other
recording<00:00:46.329> meters<00:00:46.540> like<00:00:46.660> xqd<00:00:47.350> for<00:00:47.560> example

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
recording meters like xqd for example

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.130 
recording meters like xqd for example
but<00:00:49.000> we<00:00:49.180> are<00:00:49.300> actually<00:00:49.600> looking<00:00:49.840> at<00:00:50.079> a

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
but we are actually looking at a

shutter all where they should be at the
back<00:01:33.369> of<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.609> camera<00:01:33.819> we<00:01:34.119> have<00:01:34.329> audio

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
back of the camera we have audio

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:36.840 
back of the camera we have audio
controls<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:35.469> we<00:01:35.649> can<00:01:35.829> they<00:01:36.219> are<00:01:36.340> protected<00:01:36.819> so

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
controls so we can they are protected so

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.489 
controls so we can they are protected so
for<00:01:37.119> example<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.569> can<00:01:37.689> have<00:01:37.749> dark<00:01:37.990> change<00:01:38.289> the

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:38.499 
for example you can have dark change the

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:40.919 
for example you can have dark change the
dial<00:01:38.770> we<00:01:39.399> can<00:01:39.549> set<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.759> manual<00:01:40.090> or<00:01:40.420> auto<00:01:40.599> and

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
dial we can set it to manual or auto and

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.419 
dial we can set it to manual or auto and
then<00:01:41.020> when<00:01:41.139> I'm<00:01:41.229> finished<00:01:41.259> just<00:01:42.039> put<00:01:42.249> it<00:01:42.340> back

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
then when I'm finished just put it back

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.819 
then when I'm finished just put it back
up<00:01:42.670> one<00:01:43.240> another<00:01:43.509> change<00:01:43.749> with<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:43.990> pmw<00:01:44.409> 300

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
up one another change with the pmw 300

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.410 
up one another change with the pmw 300
is<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.039> whole<00:01:45.340> rear<00:01:45.639> of<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.909> camera

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
is the whole rear of the camera

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.749 
is the whole rear of the camera
so<00:01:47.109> unlike<00:01:47.499> the<00:01:47.560> PM<00:01:47.920> 3x3<00:01:48.369> where<00:01:48.579> i<00:01:48.609> had<00:01:48.729> a

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
so unlike the PM 3x3 where i had a

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.089 
so unlike the PM 3x3 where i had a
slightly<00:01:49.060> raised<00:01:49.509> shoulder<00:01:50.079> pad<00:01:50.259> this<00:01:50.829> now

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
slightly raised shoulder pad this now

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:52.649 
slightly raised shoulder pad this now
has<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.399> system<00:01:51.849> which<00:01:51.939> allows<00:01:51.969> you<00:01:52.299> to<00:01:52.359> put<00:01:52.539> it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
has a system which allows you to put it

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.149 
has a system which allows you to put it
onto<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:53.079> shoulder<00:01:53.380> rather<00:01:53.590> than<00:01:53.799> against

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
onto the shoulder rather than against

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.459 
onto the shoulder rather than against
the<00:01:54.249> shoulder<00:01:54.609> so<00:01:55.479> it<00:01:55.749> makes<00:01:55.899> it<00:01:55.959> a<00:01:56.109> gun<00:01:56.319> on<00:01:56.380> me

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
the shoulder so it makes it a gun on me

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.559 
the shoulder so it makes it a gun on me
a<00:01:56.499> little<00:01:56.560> bit<00:01:56.709> easier<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.189> use<00:01:57.359> the<00:01:58.359> back<00:01:58.539> of

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
a little bit easier to use the back of

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.330 
a little bit easier to use the back of
the<00:01:58.749> camera<00:01:58.899> is<00:01:59.139> very<00:01:59.169> familiar<00:01:59.529> so<00:02:00.069> we<00:02:00.189> have

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
the camera is very familiar so we have

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
they do have a new battery system which

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.729 
they do have a new battery system which
are<00:02:13.450> actually<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.780> used<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.080> take<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.200> power<00:02:14.500> out

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
are actually I used to take a power out

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.530 
are actually I used to take a power out
from<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.040> camera<00:02:15.430> as<00:02:15.489> well<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:16.360> might<00:02:16.480> say

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
from the camera as well you might say

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.570 
from the camera as well you might say
why<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.080> important<00:02:17.590> well<00:02:17.770> they<00:02:18.280> do<00:02:18.340> have

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
why is that important well they do have

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.070 
why is that important well they do have
this<00:02:18.700> little<00:02:18.760> box<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.390> clips<00:02:19.720> onto<00:02:19.900> this

of<00:02:37.530> them<00:02:37.620> were<00:02:37.770> provided<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.489> for<00:02:38.580> example<00:02:38.910> we

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
of them were provided so for example we

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.570 
of them were provided so for example we
can<00:02:39.150> go<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.330> an<00:02:39.900> extremum<00:02:40.590> box<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.310> can<00:02:41.489> go

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
can go to an extremum box and we can go

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.370 
can go to an extremum box and we can go
to<00:02:41.640> an<00:02:41.819> external<00:02:42.090> monitor<00:02:42.540> or<00:02:42.569> VTR

to an external monitor or VTR

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.740 
to an external monitor or VTR
we<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.190> timecode<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:44.910> or<00:02:45.060> out<00:02:45.209> with<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.510> little

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
we have timecode in or out with a little

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.020 
we have timecode in or out with a little
switch<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.200> control<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.800> we<00:02:47.580> also<00:02:47.730> have

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
switch to control that we also have

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.580 
switch to control that we also have
genlock<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.720> for<00:02:48.840> example<00:02:49.140> if<00:02:49.230> we're<00:02:49.350> going<00:02:49.500> to

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
genlock so for example if we're going to

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.140 
genlock so for example if we're going to
use<00:02:49.800> this<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.250> low-cost<00:02:50.670> studio

said you know the PM wtx we did have the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.949 
said you know the PM wtx we did have the
rotational<00:03:05.280> handgrip<00:03:05.760> however<00:03:06.630> when<00:03:06.840> they

rotational handgrip however when they

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.740 
rotational handgrip however when they
move<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.380> PM<00:03:07.620> w200<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.940> kind<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.360> removed

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
move to the PM w200 it kind of removed

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.080 
move to the PM w200 it kind of removed
the<00:03:09.959> rotation<00:03:10.440> made<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.650> fixed<00:03:11.069> but<00:03:11.819> with<00:03:11.970> this

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
the rotation made it fixed but with this

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.729 
the rotation made it fixed but with this
camera<00:03:12.390> they're<00:03:12.870> going<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.080> retain<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:13.650> you

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
camera they're going to retain it so you

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.570 
camera they're going to retain it so you
can<00:03:13.920> rotate<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.459> full<00:03:14.670> 45<00:03:15.300> degrees<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:17.250> camera

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
can rotate it full 45 degrees the camera

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
is very easy to use it's early on maybe

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
terms of image quality it's pretty much

one<00:03:33.209> other<00:03:33.360> thing<00:03:33.690> this<00:03:34.320> will<00:03:34.590> be<00:03:34.709> getting<00:03:34.890> X

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
one other thing this will be getting X

one other thing this will be getting X
ABC<00:03:35.730> next<00:03:36.000> year<00:03:36.329> which<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.720> really<00:03:36.930> important

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
ABC next year which is really important

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.780 
ABC next year which is really important
for<00:03:37.500> those<00:03:37.560> people<00:03:37.920> who<00:03:38.280> are<00:03:38.370> thinking<00:03:38.549> about

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
for those people who are thinking about

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.670 
for those people who are thinking about
future<00:03:38.970> proofing<00:03:39.329> their<00:03:39.480> camera<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.410> we<00:03:40.530> think

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
future proofing their camera so we think

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.960 
future proofing their camera so we think
if<00:03:40.829> you're<00:03:40.920> looking<00:03:41.220> for<00:03:41.400> maybe<00:03:41.519> a<00:03:41.640> somewhat<00:03:41.940> a

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
if you're looking for maybe a somewhat a

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.780 
if you're looking for maybe a somewhat a
slightly<00:03:42.329> larger<00:03:42.630> handycam<00:03:43.410> which<00:03:44.100> gives<00:03:44.670> you

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
slightly larger handycam which gives you

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.370 
slightly larger handycam which gives you
the<00:03:45.060> functionality<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.840> sort<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.049> on<00:03:46.260> the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
the functionality of a sort of on the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.990 
the functionality of a sort of on the
shorter<00:03:46.650> camera<00:03:47.010> rather<00:03:47.250> than<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.549> full<00:03:47.730> shot

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
shorter camera rather than a full shot

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.849 
shorter camera rather than a full shot
of<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.209> camera<00:03:48.570> then<00:03:49.110> this<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.530> camera

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
of the camera then this is the camera

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.130 
of the camera then this is the camera
for<00:03:50.010> you
