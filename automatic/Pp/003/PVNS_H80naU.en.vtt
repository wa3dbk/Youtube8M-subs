sense all that you get for free when you
buy<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.120> pedal<00:02:49.780> but<00:02:50.780> there's<00:02:50.990> more<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.320> the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
buy the pedal but there's more to the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.260 
buy the pedal but there's more to the
backing<00:02:51.710> track<00:02:51.890> feature<00:02:52.100> let's<00:02:53.090> say<00:02:53.210> you

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
backing track feature let's say you

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.150 
backing track feature let's say you
created<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.780> great<00:02:54.080> loop<00:02:54.320> on<00:02:54.500> your<00:02:54.530> guitar<00:02:54.920> that

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
created a great loop on your guitar that

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.910 
created a great loop on your guitar that
you<00:02:55.460> want<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.790> work<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:56.300> your<00:02:56.330> doll<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:57.890> can

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
you want to work on in your doll you can

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.410 
you want to work on in your doll you can
actually<00:02:58.130> store<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:58.760> as<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:58.970> backing<00:02:59.300> track

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
actually store that as a backing track

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.600 
actually store that as a backing track
and<00:02:59.780> then<00:03:00.260> upload<00:03:00.709> it<00:03:00.739> from<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.220> pedal<00:03:01.459> and

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
and then upload it from the pedal and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.940 
and then upload it from the pedal and
back<00:03:01.760> into<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.150> computer<00:03:02.570> again<00:03:02.780> data<00:03:03.560> x2

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
back into the computer again data x2

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.680 
back into the computer again data x2
also<00:03:04.280> features<00:03:04.670> stereo<00:03:05.060> in<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.330> outputs

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
also features stereo in and outputs

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.060 
also features stereo in and outputs
which<00:03:05.900> means<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.260> it<00:03:06.380> integrates<00:03:06.830> perfectly

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
which means that it integrates perfectly

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.300 
which means that it integrates perfectly
into<00:03:07.580> stereo<00:03:07.970> guitar<00:03:08.270> systems<00:03:08.830> we<00:03:09.830> also<00:03:09.860> added

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
into stereo guitar systems we also added

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.070 
into stereo guitar systems we also added
the<00:03:10.489> option<00:03:10.610> of<00:03:10.910> running<00:03:11.060> ditto<00:03:11.360> x2<00:03:11.780> of<00:03:11.959> a

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
the option of running ditto x2 of a

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.260 
the option of running ditto x2 of a
battery<00:03:12.380> are<00:03:12.800> actually<00:03:13.250> two<00:03:13.489> batteries<00:03:13.940> for

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
battery are actually two batteries for

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.229 
battery are actually two batteries for
extended<00:03:14.690> performance<00:03:14.810> time<00:03:15.970> last<00:03:16.970> but<00:03:17.150> not

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
extended performance time last but not

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.420 
extended performance time last but not
least<00:03:17.450> we<00:03:17.600> added<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:18.020> hidden<00:03:18.320> very<00:03:18.980> cool<00:03:19.280> little

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
least we added a hidden very cool little

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.540 
least we added a hidden very cool little
extra<00:03:19.670> feature<00:03:20.060> inside<00:03:20.600> data<00:03:20.870> x2<00:03:21.550> louvers

extra feature inside data x2 louvers
generally<00:03:22.940> fall<00:03:23.150> into<00:03:23.180> one<00:03:23.540> of<00:03:23.570> two

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
generally fall into one of two

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.140 
generally fall into one of two
categories<00:03:24.190> either<00:03:25.190> they<00:03:25.550> want<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.880> looping

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
categories either they want the looping

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.310 
categories either they want the looping
sequence<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.780> be<00:03:26.810> loop<00:03:27.489> play<00:03:28.489> record<00:03:29.270> but<00:03:30.200> the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
sequence to be loop play record but the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.810 
sequence to be loop play record but the
other<00:03:30.470> half<00:03:30.709> wants<00:03:31.040> loop<00:03:31.870> overdub<00:03:32.870> play<00:03:33.820> so

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
other half wants loop overdub play so

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.910 
other half wants loop overdub play so
what<00:03:34.970> do<00:03:35.030> we<00:03:35.150> do<00:03:35.330> we've<00:03:36.050> added<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.500> little<00:03:36.739> dip

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
what do we do we've added a little dip

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.470 
what do we do we've added a little dip
switch<00:03:37.160> inside<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.820> battery<00:03:38.090> compartment

of the original ditto looper it's just a

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.440 
of the original ditto looper it's just a
symbol<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:46.640> get<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:46.970> same<00:03:47.150> amazing
