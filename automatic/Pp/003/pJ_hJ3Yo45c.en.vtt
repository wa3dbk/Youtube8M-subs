00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.660 
to make guinea pig toys out of toilet
paper<00:00:04.200> rolls<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.220> popcorn<00:00:05.430> box<00:00:07.069> so<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.519> is

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
paper rolls and a popcorn box so this is

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.320 
paper rolls and a popcorn box so this is
what<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:08.970> looks<00:00:09.150> like<00:00:11.840> this<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.049> first<00:00:13.349> one

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
what it looks like this is the first one

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.990 
what it looks like this is the first one
what<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.080> open<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.590> up<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.100> you

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
what you do is you open it up and you

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.150 
what you do is you open it up and you
put<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> treat<00:00:18.570> inside<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.650> close<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.039> back

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
put the treat inside and close it back

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.790 
put the treat inside and close it back
up<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.480> this<00:00:21.480> helps<00:00:21.779> their<00:00:21.930> teeth<00:00:22.199> because

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
up and this helps their teeth because

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920 
up and this helps their teeth because
they<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.279> chew<00:00:23.519> through<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.570> get<00:00:24.750> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
they have to chew through it to get to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.120 
they have to chew through it to get to
the<00:00:25.050> tree<00:00:28.310> another<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
the tree another one is this one and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.819 
the tree another one is this one and
what<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.850> stuck<00:00:33.180> hay<00:00:33.450> inside

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
what you do is with stuck hay inside

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.459 
what you do is with stuck hay inside
right<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.070> close<00:00:35.670> these<00:00:35.880> zones<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:37.230> chops

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
right and close these zones and it chops

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.709 
right and close these zones and it chops
in<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> head<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.309> once<00:00:39.149> again<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.570> helps

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
in the head and once again it helps

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.090 
in the head and once again it helps
their<00:00:40.020> teeth<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.559> could<00:00:40.739> chew<00:00:40.920> through

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
their teeth because I could chew through

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.200 
their teeth because I could chew through
it<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.730> head<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.430> also<00:00:44.640> made<00:00:45.030> this

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
it to get the head and I also made this

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.330 
it to get the head and I also made this
little<00:00:45.510> homemade<00:00:46.050> tunnel<00:00:46.590> from<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> popcorn

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
little homemade tunnel from a popcorn

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:58.340 
little homemade tunnel from a popcorn
buck<00:00:47.879> box<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.530> how<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.710> make<00:00:52.949> them<00:00:57.350> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
buck box so this is how you make them to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.470 
buck box so this is how you make them to
make<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.309> probably<00:00:59.489> very<00:00:59.940> obvious

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
make this one it's probably very obvious

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.100 
make this one it's probably very obvious
but<00:01:01.230> first<00:01:01.559> thing<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.480> is<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.719> take<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
but first thing to do is to take the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.270 
but first thing to do is to take the
scissors<00:01:04.880> before<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.450> know<00:01:07.280> get

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
scissors before this it is you know get

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.480 
scissors before this it is you know get
off<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:09.650> then<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.740> take<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:10.979> scissors<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
off but then you take your scissors and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.230 
off but then you take your scissors and
start<00:01:12.360> cutting<00:01:12.830> strips<00:01:13.830> off<00:01:14.369> me<00:01:14.729> toilet<00:01:15.119> paper

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
start cutting strips off me toilet paper

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.510 
start cutting strips off me toilet paper
well<00:01:20.090> it's<00:01:21.090> better<00:01:21.390> bigger<00:01:21.900> than<00:01:22.170> small<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.400> if

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
well it's better bigger than small so if

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.740 
well it's better bigger than small so if
you're<00:01:23.670> not<00:01:23.790> sure<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.060> make<00:01:24.330> them<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> little

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
you're not sure just make them a little

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:35.149 
you're not sure just make them a little
bit<00:01:24.960> bigger<00:01:25.170> than<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.680> okay<00:01:33.590> now<00:01:34.590> I

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
bit bigger than you think okay now I

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.850 
bit bigger than you think okay now I
have<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:35.640> pieces<00:01:36.000> cut<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.439> now<00:01:37.590> you're

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
have all my pieces cut and so now you're

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.450 
have all my pieces cut and so now you're
going<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> take<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.549> them<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:40.310> put<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
going to take one of them and put the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.289 
going to take one of them and put the
other<00:01:41.670> one<00:01:41.790> through<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.880> already<00:01:45.030> see

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
other one through it you can already see

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.899 
other one through it you can already see
it<00:01:45.390> forming<00:01:46.189> and<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.340> start<00:01:47.579> randomly

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
it forming and you start randomly

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.940 
it forming and you start randomly
putting<00:01:48.270> them<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.570> slipping<00:01:49.560> them<00:01:49.710> into

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
putting them on slipping them into

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.639 
putting them on slipping them into
places<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.909> they<00:01:51.060> get<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:52.020> they<00:01:52.140> become<00:01:52.439> very

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
places so they get so they become very

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.980 
places so they get so they become very
tight<00:01:53.090> because<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.390> don't<00:01:54.540> want<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.869> be

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
tight because you don't want it to be

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.010 
tight because you don't want it to be
loose<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.560> big<00:01:55.950> open<00:01:56.640> little<00:01:57.329> big<00:01:57.479> openings

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
loose and big open little big openings

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.319 
loose and big open little big openings
in<00:01:58.320> hand<00:01:58.680> because<00:01:59.310> they<00:01:59.640> need<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.880> work<00:02:00.060> for

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
in hand because they need to work for

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.499 
in hand because they need to work for
their<00:02:00.479> treat<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.990> get<00:02:01.110> their<00:02:01.350> teeth<00:02:01.770> um

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
their treat to get their teeth um

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.480 
their treat to get their teeth um
shorter<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.110> don't<00:02:04.290> over<00:02:04.530> grow<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.430> you

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
shorter so they don't over grow but you

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.520 
shorter so they don't over grow but you
can<00:02:05.610> see<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:05.850> already<00:02:06.030> forming<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.350> just

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
can see it's already forming so just

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
can see it's already forming so just
keep<00:02:07.710> doing<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.039> until<00:02:08.160> you

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
keep doing it until you

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:22.700 
keep doing it until you
data<00:02:08.700> tubes<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:17.100> last<00:02:17.340> one<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:22.590> is

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
data tubes and the last one that is

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.470 
data tubes and the last one that is
what's<00:02:23.220> something<00:02:23.880> like<00:02:24.000> it's<00:02:24.150> gonna<00:02:24.300> look

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
what's something like it's gonna look

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.650 
what's something like it's gonna look
like<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.160> now<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.400> now<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:27.030> two<00:02:27.450> little

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
like and so now I now have two little

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:38.960 
like and so now I now have two little
twice<00:02:29.480> okay<00:02:31.790> next<00:02:32.790> one<00:02:35.960> is<00:02:36.960> this<00:02:37.140> one<00:02:37.970> it's

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
twice okay next one is this one it's

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.550 
twice okay next one is this one it's
very<00:02:39.150> obvious<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.960> don't<00:02:39.990> think<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.350> need<00:02:40.530> to

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
very obvious I don't think I need to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.330 
very obvious I don't think I need to
demonstrate<00:02:41.220> but<00:02:41.940> um<00:02:42.830> obviously<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.160> just

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
demonstrate but um obviously you just

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.890 
demonstrate but um obviously you just
take<00:02:44.640> from<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.000> bottom<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> tube<00:02:47.900> this

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
take from the bottom of the tube this

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.300 
take from the bottom of the tube this
one's<00:02:49.080> already<00:02:49.230> been<00:02:49.350> chewed<00:02:49.740> up<00:02:49.860> but<00:02:50.160> what

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
one's already been chewed up but what

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.120 
one's already been chewed up but what
you<00:02:50.400> do<00:02:50.520> is<00:02:50.550> take<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.180> scissors<00:02:51.540> cut<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.740> tube

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
you do is take the scissors cut the tube

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.220 
you do is take the scissors cut the tube
into<00:02:53.610> little<00:02:54.000> strips<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:57.230> just

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
into little strips like that and just

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.800 
into little strips like that and just
keep<00:02:58.410> doing<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.860> until<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.190> come<00:02:59.490> back<00:02:59.810> so

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
keep doing it until you come back so

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.330 
keep doing it until you come back so
it'll<00:03:00.990> start<00:03:01.290> just<00:03:01.560> going<00:03:01.620> looking<00:03:02.010> like<00:03:02.130> that

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
it'll start just going looking like that

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.060 
it'll start just going looking like that
and<00:03:02.610> then<00:03:03.390> when<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.660> have<00:03:03.900> both<00:03:04.320> sides<00:03:04.710> cut

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
and then when you have both sides cut

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.880 
and then when you have both sides cut
the<00:03:05.610> same<00:03:05.820> way<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:06.990> start<00:03:07.230> shoving<00:03:07.500> hang

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
the same way you just start shoving hang

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.540 
the same way you just start shoving hang
in<00:03:08.130> not<00:03:08.970> too<00:03:09.180> much<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.720> overflows<00:03:10.250> but<00:03:11.250> you

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
in not too much so it overflows but you

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.610 
in not too much so it overflows but you
then<00:03:12.000> you'll<00:03:12.180> fold<00:03:12.570> these<00:03:12.810> little<00:03:13.080> flaps<00:03:13.290> in

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
then you'll fold these little flaps in

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.030 
then you'll fold these little flaps in
and<00:03:14.520> then<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.390> hair<00:03:15.540> will<00:03:15.660> be<00:03:15.750> trapped<00:03:16.020> and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.340 

with<00:03:20.040> these<00:03:20.340> things<00:03:20.910> you're<00:03:21.840> gonna<00:03:21.959> want<00:03:22.260> to

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
with these things you're gonna want to

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.560 
with these things you're gonna want to
take<00:03:22.560> your<00:03:22.770> scissors<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.190> poke<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.880> hole<00:03:24.090> in

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
take your scissors and poke a hole in

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.020 
take your scissors and poke a hole in
them<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.530> they<00:03:25.680> can<00:03:25.890> smell<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.430> scent<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.850> The

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
them so they can smell the scent of The

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.270 
them so they can smell the scent of The
Hague<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:28.560> would<00:03:28.680> encourage<00:03:28.980> them

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
Hague and so that would encourage them

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.690 
Hague and so that would encourage them
to<00:03:29.340> try<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.790> get<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.480> bite<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.930> it

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700
