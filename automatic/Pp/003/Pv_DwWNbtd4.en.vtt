okay so with these plans to keep costs

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.369 
okay so with these plans to keep costs
down<00:00:10.650> we've<00:00:10.980> purchased<00:00:11.190> 8<00:00:11.639> foot<00:00:12.080> long<00:00:13.080> piece

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.190 
down we've purchased 8 foot long piece
of<00:00:13.530> sheet<00:00:13.769> metal<00:00:14.059> we<00:00:15.059> cut<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.360> exactly<00:00:15.840> in<00:00:16.020> half

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
of sheet metal we cut it exactly in half

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.749 
of sheet metal we cut it exactly in half
which<00:00:16.470> makes<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.800> 4<00:00:17.010> feet<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:18.259> the<00:00:19.759> OSB

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
which makes it 4 feet and the OSB

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.179 
which makes it 4 feet and the OSB
material<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.689> also<00:00:21.989> 4<00:00:22.290> feet<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.890> want<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
material is also 4 feet and we want the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.690 
material is also 4 feet and we want the
overhang<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.210> little<00:00:24.419> bit<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.739> on<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.520> back

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
overhang a little bit on the on the back

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.549 
overhang a little bit on the on the back
side<00:00:27.000> right<00:00:28.250> here<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.520> to<00:00:29.579> cover<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.559> this

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559 
side right here so to cover this this

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.080 
side right here so to cover this this
gap<00:00:31.800> here<00:00:32.099> sheet<00:00:32.550> metal<00:00:32.700> overhangs<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:35.090> about

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
gap here sheet metal overhangs do about

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.860 
gap here sheet metal overhangs do about
1<00:00:36.300> inch<00:00:36.480> exactly<00:00:37.260> 1<00:00:37.410> inch<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.949> backside<00:00:38.399> to

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
1 inch exactly 1 inch on the backside to

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.819 
1 inch exactly 1 inch on the backside to
cover<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:43.559> front

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
cover that and so on the on the front

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.770 
cover that and so on the on the front
end<00:00:43.980> we're<00:00:44.760> going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> cut<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.269> off<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.629> inch

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
end we're going to cut it off one inch

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.860 
end we're going to cut it off one inch
and<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.079> we've<00:00:46.230> marked<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:47.390> one<00:00:48.390> inch<00:00:48.539> mark

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and so we've marked a one inch mark

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.029 
and so we've marked a one inch mark
across<00:00:49.199> we're<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.329> cut<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.510> off<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
across we're going to cut that off and

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:59.210 
across we're going to cut that off and
then<00:00:53.039> attach<00:00:53.309> our<00:00:53.519> sheet<00:00:53.730> metal

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.870 

okay<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:01.040> roofing<00:01:02.040> for<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> generator<00:01:02.760> shed

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
okay for roofing for the generator shed

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.900 
okay for roofing for the generator shed
we're<00:01:03.060> going<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.240> use<00:01:03.360> this<00:01:03.510> metal<00:01:03.900> roofing

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
we're going to use this metal roofing

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.600 
we're going to use this metal roofing
and<00:01:06.710> because<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:07.980> did<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.280> bought<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and because what we did is we bought a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.660 
and because what we did is we bought a
1/8<00:01:09.330> foot<00:01:09.570> piece<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:10.440> is<00:01:10.470> exactly<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> size

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
1/8 foot piece which is exactly the size

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.080 
1/8 foot piece which is exactly the size
of<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.950> when<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> cut<00:01:14.190> it<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.430> half<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.850> four

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
of the when you cut it in half the four

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.360 
of the when you cut it in half the four
feet<00:01:15.300> matches<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> four<00:01:16.140> feet<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.920> size

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
feet matches the four feet of the size

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.000 
feet matches the four feet of the size
of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> roof<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.660> so<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.620> like<00:01:19.740> anything

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
of the roof and so just like anything

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.400 
of the roof and so just like anything
else<00:01:20.160> we've<00:01:20.460> measured<00:01:20.670> down<00:01:21.230> I'm<00:01:22.230> going<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
else we've measured down I'm going to

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.640 
else we've measured down I'm going to
put<00:01:22.530> marks<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:24.470> I've<00:01:25.470> got<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
put marks here and there I've got a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.460 
put marks here and there I've got a
straight<00:01:25.950> piece<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.280> trim<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:27.380> we're<00:01:28.380> going

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
straight piece of trim here we're going

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.330 
straight piece of trim here we're going
to<00:01:28.530> use<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.920> draw<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> line<00:01:29.340> all<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> way<00:01:29.640> across

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.950 

and<00:01:36.820> it's<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.180> little<00:01:37.329> tough<00:01:37.540> because<00:01:37.659> you<00:01:37.840> have

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
and it's a little tough because you have

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.770 
and it's a little tough because you have
this<00:01:38.079> gap<00:01:38.560> between<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:41.880> trim<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.210> top<00:01:43.750> of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
this gap between the trim and the top of

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.050 
this gap between the trim and the top of
it<00:01:44.049> but<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:45.399> should<00:01:45.579> be<00:01:45.729> able<00:01:45.789> to<00:01:45.909> get<00:01:46.000> it

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
it but you should be able to get it

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:59.750 
it but you should be able to get it
closer<00:01:46.270> you<00:01:46.450> look<00:01:46.630> straight<00:01:46.930> down<00:01:46.960> on<00:01:47.350> it

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.110 

so<00:02:00.600> there's<00:02:01.170> two<00:02:01.380> ways<00:02:01.410> to<00:02:01.560> cut<00:02:01.890> metal<00:02:02.100> one<00:02:02.970> is

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
so there's two ways to cut metal one is

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.510 
so there's two ways to cut metal one is
with<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.530> circular<00:02:04.530> saw<00:02:04.560> with<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> metal

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
with the circular saw with the metal

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.330 
with the circular saw with the metal
blade<00:02:05.730> on<00:02:05.910> it<00:02:06.110> or<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.380> use<00:02:07.470> tin<00:02:07.800> snips<00:02:08.100> if

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
blade on it or you can use tin snips if

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.770 
blade on it or you can use tin snips if
you<00:02:08.460> do<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.820> snips<00:02:09.119> you've<00:02:09.330> got<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.480> be<00:02:09.570> kind

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
you do the snips you've got to be kind

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.620 
you do the snips you've got to be kind
of<00:02:09.869> careful<00:02:10.730> that<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.790> don't<00:02:11.880> bend<00:02:12.210> these<00:02:12.390> out

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
of careful that you don't bend these out

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.230 
of careful that you don't bend these out
every<00:02:12.660> time<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.170> go<00:02:13.620> over<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.800> bump<00:02:14.130> or<00:02:15.060> if<00:02:15.150> you

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
every time you go over a bump or if you

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.180 
every time you go over a bump or if you
do<00:02:15.390> bend<00:02:15.600> them<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.050> put<00:02:16.560> them<00:02:16.620> back<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:17.100> you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
do bend them and put them back if you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.950 
do bend them and put them back if you
use<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.610> circular<00:02:18.030> saw<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.690> want<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.900> be

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
use the circular saw you want to be

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.260 
use the circular saw you want to be
careful<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:20.430> know<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.790> creates<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
careful with you know it creates a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.750 
careful with you know it creates a
really<00:02:21.710> sharp<00:02:22.710> edge<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.520> going<00:02:23.700> to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
really sharp edge but this is going to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.750 
really sharp edge but this is going to
be<00:02:23.850> sharp<00:02:24.090> either<00:02:24.360> way<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:26.250> we're<00:02:26.610> going<00:02:26.700> to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
be sharp either way so we're going to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.170 
be sharp either way so we're going to
cut<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.540> then<00:02:27.690> set<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.740> up<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:28.980> our<00:02:29.180> on

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
cut this and then set it up on our on

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:40.820 
cut this and then set it up on our on
our<00:02:31.050> roof<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.470> have<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> look<00:02:31.800> at<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:39.740> one<00:02:40.740> other

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
our roof and have a look at it one other

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.490 
our roof and have a look at it one other
thing<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:41.520> you're<00:02:41.670> using<00:02:41.700> metal<00:02:42.600> snips

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
thing is if you're using metal snips

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.410 
thing is if you're using metal snips
there's<00:02:43.740> three<00:02:44.010> types<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.460> types<00:02:45.120> with<00:02:45.330> the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
there's three types of types with the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.800 
there's three types of types with the
blades<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.840> cut<00:02:46.050> left<00:02:46.320> cut<00:02:46.740> right<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:48.630> cut

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
blades the cut left cut right and cut

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.330 
blades the cut left cut right and cut
straight<00:02:49.140> these<00:02:49.350> are<00:02:49.530> straight<00:02:49.800> cuts<00:02:50.070> and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
straight these are straight cuts and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.220 
straight these are straight cuts and
makes<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.210> a<00:02:51.270> lot<00:02:51.390> easier<00:02:51.750> when<00:02:51.810> using<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
makes it a lot easier when using the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:02.980 
makes it a lot easier when using the
straight<00:02:52.470> ones<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.940> cut<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:53.970> straight<00:02:54.270> line

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.120 

okay<00:03:03.990> one<00:03:04.140> thing<00:03:04.170> we<00:03:04.410> fail<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.709> know<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:05.010> it

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
okay one thing we fail to know is it

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.260 
okay one thing we fail to know is it
helps<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.459> our<00:03:05.550> gloves<00:03:05.820> when<00:03:06.000> you're<00:03:06.120> cutting

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
helps to our gloves when you're cutting

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.380 
helps to our gloves when you're cutting
this<00:03:06.480> metal<00:03:06.840> because<00:03:07.080> these<00:03:07.230> edges<00:03:07.920> will

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
this metal because these edges will

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.110 
this metal because these edges will
invariably<00:03:09.650> catch<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.860> touch<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.700> finger<00:03:11.970> and

them and is the where we're doing those
is<00:04:31.070> we're<00:04:31.400> holding<00:04:31.669> them<00:04:31.760> back<00:04:31.910> about<00:04:32.660> four

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
is we're holding them back about four

a hold of them on you when you lift up
the<00:04:40.930> roof<00:04:41.930> if<00:04:42.169> if<00:04:43.099> they<00:04:43.340> do<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:43.880> go<00:04:44.389> all<00:04:44.479> the

the roof if if they do and go all the
way<00:04:44.630> through<00:04:45.460> sometimes<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.669> the<00:04:47.150> ends<00:04:47.900> of

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
way through sometimes the the ends of

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.860 
way through sometimes the the ends of
them<00:04:48.110> will<00:04:48.340> will<00:04:49.340> make<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:49.639> through

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
them will will make it through

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.810 
them will will make it through
it's<00:04:51.440> what<00:04:51.650> we're<00:04:51.830> doing<00:04:52.190> is<00:04:52.340> sticking<00:04:52.580> one

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
it's what we're doing is sticking one

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.230 
it's what we're doing is sticking one
next<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.419> every<00:04:53.630> rib<00:04:53.980> along<00:04:54.980> the<00:04:55.160> the<00:04:55.430> top<00:04:55.910> and

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
next to every rib along the the top and

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.800 
next to every rib along the the top and
the<00:04:57.169> bottom<00:04:57.320> edges<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.460> of<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.300> shed<00:04:59.540> roof

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
the bottom edges of the of the shed roof

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.159 
the bottom edges of the of the shed roof
and<00:05:00.139> then<00:05:00.410> one<00:05:01.280> end<00:05:01.460> up<00:05:01.639> in<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.300> middle<00:05:02.630> every

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
and then one end up in the middle every

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.159 
and then one end up in the middle every
24<00:05:03.680> inches<00:05:04.010> so<00:05:05.000> since<00:05:05.270> it's<00:05:05.419> a<00:05:05.510> four-foot<00:05:05.930> roof

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
24 inches so since it's a four-foot roof

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.909 
24 inches so since it's a four-foot roof
there's<00:05:06.470> just<00:05:06.650> three<00:05:07.580> on<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.910> ends<00:05:08.240> and<00:05:08.419> then

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
there's just three on the ends and then

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:15.520 
there's just three on the ends and then
like<00:05:12.880> we're<00:05:13.880> just<00:05:14.030> measuring<00:05:14.330> up<00:05:14.600> a<00:05:14.870> tape

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
like we're just measuring up a tape

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.010 
like we're just measuring up a tape
measure<00:05:15.740> on<00:05:17.560> every<00:05:18.560> one<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:19.040> then<00:05:19.870> drawing<00:05:20.870> on

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
measure on every one and then drawing on

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.060 
measure on every one and then drawing on
it<00:05:21.110> with<00:05:21.199> a<00:05:21.229> pencil<00:05:21.410> and<00:05:21.590> we<00:05:21.710> do<00:05:21.800> this<00:05:21.949> because

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
it with a pencil and we do this because

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.280 
it with a pencil and we do this because
you<00:05:22.460> can<00:05:22.490> see<00:05:22.820> these<00:05:23.030> screws<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:23.840> it<00:05:23.960> just

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
you can see these screws and it just

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.030 
you can see these screws and it just
makes<00:05:24.470> it<00:05:24.560> look<00:05:24.710> a<00:05:24.800> lot<00:05:24.919> better<00:05:25.160> if<00:05:25.340> you<00:05:27.040> take

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
makes it look a lot better if you take

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.190 
makes it look a lot better if you take
the<00:05:28.160> time<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.400> mark<00:05:29.360> exactly<00:05:29.930> where<00:05:30.080> these

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
the time to mark exactly where these
