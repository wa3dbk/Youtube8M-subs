know<00:01:57.539> on<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.049> most<00:01:58.499> of<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.710> time<00:01:58.920> when<00:01:59.100> people

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
know on and most of the time when people

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.069 
know on and most of the time when people
win<00:01:59.639> it's<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.179> day<00:02:00.389> that<00:02:00.420> they<00:02:00.749> were<00:02:00.810> most

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
win it's on the day that they were most

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.139 
win it's on the day that they were most
consistent<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.740> both<00:02:01.770> rounds<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.520> I've<00:02:02.909> had

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
consistent in both rounds and I've had

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.029 
consistent in both rounds and I've had
lots<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.810> shows<00:02:04.079> where<00:02:04.439> my<00:02:04.649> routine<00:02:05.009> was

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
lots of shows where my routine was

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.340 
lots of shows where my routine was
slamming<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.999> the<00:02:06.389> physique<00:02:06.689> was<00:02:06.869> off<00:02:07.079> or

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
slamming and the physique was off or

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.020 
slamming and the physique was off or
where<00:02:07.709> I<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:08.100> focused<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.580> much<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.910> my

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
where I just focused so much on my

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.999 
where I just focused so much on my
physique<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.690> know<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.869> get<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> down<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
physique you know to get it down in and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.740 
physique you know to get it down in and
didn't<00:02:11.880> get<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.060> spend<00:02:12.270> as<00:02:12.360> much<00:02:12.480> time<00:02:12.540> on

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
didn't get to spend as much time on

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.720 
didn't get to spend as much time on
their<00:02:12.959> routine<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.950> routines<00:02:14.310> suffered

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
their routine so the routines suffered

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.490 
their routine so the routines suffered
but<00:02:14.850> my<00:02:14.910> physique<00:02:15.209> was<00:02:15.360> great<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.290> that

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
but my physique was great and so that

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.140 
but my physique was great and so that
turns<00:02:16.740> out<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.069> be<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.190> third<00:02:17.520> or<00:02:17.640> fourth<00:02:17.850> place

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
turns out to be a third or fourth place

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.640 
turns out to be a third or fourth place
and<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.870> just<00:02:19.080> part<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.410> me

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
and so this is just part of me

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.740 
and so this is just part of me
explaining<00:02:19.950> what<00:02:20.340> what<00:02:20.610> it's<00:02:20.760> like<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.630> go

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
explaining what what it's like to go

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.780 
explaining what what it's like to go
year<00:02:22.110> after<00:02:22.140> year<00:02:22.830> after<00:02:23.040> year<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.730> think

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
year after year after year and I think

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.460 
year after year after year and I think
the<00:02:24.030> important<00:02:24.450> thing<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:25.140> reason<00:02:25.260> why<00:02:25.410> this

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
the important thing the reason why this

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.990 
the important thing the reason why this
is<00:02:25.650> very<00:02:25.830> emotional<00:02:26.250> for<00:02:26.280> me<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.640> because<00:02:26.790> I

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
is very emotional for me is because I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.900 
is very emotional for me is because I
knew<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.240> could<00:02:27.569> do<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.920> time<00:02:29.220> has<00:02:29.430> been<00:02:29.459> put

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
knew I could do it the time has been put

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.910 
knew I could do it the time has been put
in

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
in

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.309 
in
and<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.370> does<00:02:31.550> get<00:02:31.819> very<00:02:31.849> very<00:02:32.420> fatiguing<00:02:33.080> and

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
and it does get very very fatiguing and

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.470 
and it does get very very fatiguing and
tiring<00:02:33.530> over<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.920> years<00:02:34.130> but<00:02:34.400> tonight<00:02:34.880> is<00:02:35.120> a

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
tiring over the years but tonight is a

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.210 
tiring over the years but tonight is a
night<00:02:35.810> where<00:02:36.020> I'm<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:36.440> glad<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.980> never

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
night where I'm so glad that I never

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.270 
night where I'm so glad that I never
gave<00:02:37.459> up<00:02:37.670> on<00:02:37.819> my<00:02:37.970> dreams
