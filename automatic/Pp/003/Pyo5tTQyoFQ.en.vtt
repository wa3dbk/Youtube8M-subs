00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
what do we think of Ohana Ashley what

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.920 
what do we think of Ohana Ashley what
would<00:06:08.349> you<00:06:08.469> give<00:06:08.650> it<00:06:08.740> out<00:06:08.860> of<00:06:08.889> five<00:06:09.009> stars

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
would you give it out of five stars

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.480 
would you give it out of five stars
so<00:06:10.930> everything's<00:06:11.409> subjective<00:06:12.099> I<00:06:12.370> know

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
so everything's subjective I know

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.310 
so everything's subjective I know
everyone<00:06:12.849> has<00:06:13.030> different<00:06:13.300> reviews<00:06:13.840> but<00:06:14.139> I

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
everyone has different reviews but I

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.990 
everyone has different reviews but I
would<00:06:14.710> probably<00:06:14.949> give<00:06:15.490> it<00:06:15.520> a<00:06:16.590> three<00:06:17.590> I

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
would probably give it a three I

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.510 
would probably give it a three I
probably<00:06:19.000> give<00:06:19.210> it<00:06:19.240> a<00:06:19.389> three<00:06:19.810> and<00:06:19.930> a<00:06:19.960> half

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
probably give it a three and a half

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.570 
probably give it a three and a half
because<00:06:21.930> we<00:06:22.930> were<00:06:23.080> saying<00:06:23.440> when<00:06:24.009> we<00:06:24.130> went<00:06:24.370> the

because we were saying when we went the
most<00:06:24.759> recent<00:06:25.120> time<00:06:25.330> that<00:06:26.259> we<00:06:26.380> always<00:06:26.680> have

most recent time that we always have

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.209 
most recent time that we always have
fond<00:06:27.729> memories<00:06:27.759> of<00:06:28.240> Ohana<00:06:28.919> until<00:06:29.919> we<00:06:30.070> get

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:30.219 
fond memories of Ohana until we get

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:32.249 
fond memories of Ohana until we get

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
little things that make it not quite

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.560 
little things that make it not quite

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
seen from our other videos as we always

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.469 
seen from our other videos as we always
are<00:06:44.349> looking<00:06:44.590> at<00:06:45.009> ways<00:06:45.219> to<00:06:45.250> save<00:06:45.759> so<00:06:46.240> when<00:06:46.360> we

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 
are looking at ways to save so when we

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.600 
are looking at ways to save so when we
do<00:06:46.840> splurge<00:06:47.409> a<00:06:47.529> little<00:06:47.560> bit<00:06:47.949> on<00:06:48.039> a<00:06:48.099> restaurant

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
do splurge a little bit on a restaurant

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.900 
do splurge a little bit on a restaurant
we<00:06:48.880> expect<00:06:49.270> a<00:06:49.389> lot<00:06:49.599> so

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 
we expect a lot so

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.660 
we expect a lot so
the<00:06:51.330> quality<00:06:51.810> of<00:06:51.900> meats<00:06:52.260> aren't<00:06:52.740> quite<00:06:53.040> to<00:06:53.400> the

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670 
the quality of meats aren't quite to the

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.540 
the quality of meats aren't quite to the
prices<00:06:54.330> that<00:06:54.630> they<00:06:54.840> are<00:06:55.110> and<00:06:55.560> it<00:06:56.040> is<00:06:56.070> very

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
prices that they are and it is very

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.580 
prices that they are and it is very
different<00:06:57.300> each<00:06:57.420> time<00:06:57.750> because<00:06:57.990> it's<00:06:58.320> kind<00:06:58.560> of

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
different each time because it's kind of

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.500 
different each time because it's kind of
just<00:06:58.740> on<00:06:58.950> a<00:06:59.010> grill<00:06:59.400> and<00:06:59.790> they<00:06:59.940> just<00:07:00.150> pick<00:07:00.330> them

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.510 
just on a grill and they just pick them

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.270 
just on a grill and they just pick them
up<00:07:00.570> as<00:07:00.840> they<00:07:00.990> go<00:07:01.200> so<00:07:01.530> you<00:07:01.620> kind<00:07:01.830> of<00:07:01.860> never<00:07:02.040> know

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
up as they go so you kind of never know

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.800 
up as they go so you kind of never know
what<00:07:02.490> the<00:07:02.610> meat<00:07:02.790> it's<00:07:02.910> gonna<00:07:03.060> be<00:07:03.330> like<00:07:03.600> it

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
what the meat it's gonna be like it

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.690 
what the meat it's gonna be like it
might<00:07:03.960> be<00:07:04.080> different<00:07:04.470> each<00:07:04.590> time<00:07:04.620> which<00:07:05.280> can

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:05.700 
might be different each time which can
