00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.929
 speaks guys here along with android 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.599
 plus 1 hour minecraft perform medium 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.460
 indicator with 40s here is the second 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.509
 mott small and that had account for you 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.609
 a previous video 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.779
 It's good that he basically does us 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.119
 show the guys 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.850
 the damage we take from an animal of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.039
 a certain political work he the good judge 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.079
 managed to get down here they are able 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.449
 I can only find some 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.280
 here there is a chicken is just here 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.960
 when I hit her guys beyond 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.440
 indicate what I'm hit her was very 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.670
 good 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.969
 it shows us the rhythm looks only 12 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.440
 it does not depend on the late afternoon crowd 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.289
 one and only I'm a bit slow is just one had one 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.050
 Battle, I found this galley cool. 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.179
 because besides you can know when 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.530
 you're taking the name indicates that you 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.259
 It's knocking on him because sometimes there's 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.570
 several times tried to kill some mobi and 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.600
 He does not know if I'm pounding . 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.670
 sure I was not just taking 55 I think 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.070
 depends on the place saw galera to vilme 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.320
 I can see if the color I 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.610
 I saw that the world also woke up 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.360
 environment I think it's good to take a look 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:29.340
 here and here with flash and let's see 75 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.149
 I do not think it changes, not now. 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:42.930
 our love evaluating now did not know 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:48.960
 force it to beat and also put a 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.299
 Diamond sword v7 is not cool here 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.130
 which I also think gives you 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:02:01.590
 When they fall, I also think that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:03.359
 show the damage is just to see again look only 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:12.480
 I think when you're very close 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:13.800
 it seems that it gets darker 7 and 11 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.870
 9 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.420
 I think 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.860
 You take away from him, but you got clear. 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.540
 here to tap once with the hand is to have a 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.700
 Let's see how much diamonds I had 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.480
 more or it may become clearer in fact 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.190
 of course not 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.000
 the same thing as how much longer 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.440
 same people it appears lighter or 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.030
 more for salum 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.650
 I did not understand the people right to speak. 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:45.540
 for you one of these here play underneath 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.209
 now it's not dark but good people 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.540
 it indicates that we then when we are 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:55.440
 taking him or how much the death actor 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.660
 You, because I also know that you see 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.980
 that even in the sun burning it in 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.120
 shows the risk you are taking is only 1 11 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.220
 also shows the damage he is taking 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.659
 not only of our rivers that is giving 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.609
 nor furniture 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.780
 This is very good with this to you guys. 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.159
 also indicates when you are hitting 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.159
 a blow then this is very interesting 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.470
 it's so good it was basically a mold is 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.299
 this one then you the folder punctuating that 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.940
 I think our side will just come down and 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.370
 replace your folders there that are already 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.739
 How the starring is cute. 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.849
 what a beauty 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.739
 want to video several houses and also 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.290
 I liked it and it was also after the 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.849
 in the evaluation of video beauty then it is 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.849
 That's it, people said.
