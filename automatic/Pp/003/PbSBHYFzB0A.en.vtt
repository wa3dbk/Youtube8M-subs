00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
but fact remains that we have to see

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.289 
but fact remains that we have to see
their<00:01:19.350> final<00:01:19.500> simplification<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.460> how<00:01:21.119> much

their final simplification and how much

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.550 
their final simplification and how much
is<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.509> passed<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> parent<00:01:22.470> has

is to be passed on to the parent has

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
is to be passed on to the parent has
rightly<00:01:22.770> said<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.430> cannot<00:01:23.640> pass<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
rightly said that we cannot pass on the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.420 
rightly said that we cannot pass on the
whole<00:01:24.320> burden<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> parents<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.040> think<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
whole burden to the parents I think it

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.219 
whole burden to the parents I think it
was<00:01:26.580> long<00:01:26.820> overdue<00:01:27.030> because<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.049> think

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
was long overdue because I think

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.990 
was long overdue because I think
basically<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.220> schools<00:01:29.640> especially

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
our group we are very concerned with the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.179 
our group we are very concerned with the
safety<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.909> children<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.659> time<00:01:34.020> given<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.009> us

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
safety of children that time given to us

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.730 
safety of children that time given to us
like<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.240> raised<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.659> issue<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.290> they

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
like I have raised this issue and they

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740 
like I have raised this issue and they
agreed<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.759> will<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.970> given<00:01:39.270> more<00:01:39.450> time

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
agreed that we will be given more time

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.100 
agreed that we will be given more time
for<00:01:40.880> changing<00:01:41.880> over<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> new<00:01:42.450> system<00:01:42.659> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
for changing over to the new system and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.060 
for changing over to the new system and
that<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.799> OK

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
that is OK

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.610 
that is OK
because<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.270> Academy<00:01:46.810> here<00:01:47.050> is<00:01:47.230> starting

because the Academy here is starting
soon<00:01:47.980> schools<00:01:48.460> will<00:01:48.700> require<00:01:49.060> some<00:01:49.360> time<00:01:49.630> to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
soon schools will require some time to

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.380 
soon schools will require some time to
accommodate<00:01:50.440> these<00:01:50.710> modifications<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:52.000> RTA
