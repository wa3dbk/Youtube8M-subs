00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
caught not pounds because every year we

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.990 
caught not pounds because every year we

go up a half inch or an inch we're

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.359 
go up a half inch or an inch we're
actually<00:01:51.299> catching<00:01:51.720> more<00:01:52.170> poundage<00:01:52.890> but

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
actually catching more poundage but

catching less fish so what were fishing
occurs<00:01:55.619> automatically<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.820> we're<00:01:56.969> being

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
conservation network and what they did

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.539 
conservation network and what they did
is<00:02:16.079> they<00:02:16.110> asked<00:02:16.379> many<00:02:16.590> recreational<00:02:16.860> groups

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
is they asked many recreational groups

and commercial groups to join a network

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.720
