00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.540
 well this goes two to a new video 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.700
 It seems that Jonathan died 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.950
 the good designer the creative director 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.349
 of watts 2 has talked about the duration 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.570
 of the game on the duration of the title 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.070
 you know how good always because people 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.080
 who works in this type of games 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.540
 usually increases the duration a little 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.520
 I understand why I do not know if because I play 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.180
 sell more or something but good seems to be 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.580
 that player mode will last between 35 and 40 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.010
 hours I the truth is very long 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.920
 too much I would say no for a game that 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.130
 really because we will not be able to drive 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.940
 helicopter planes or anything aerial 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.430
 we could say I hope that I am not 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.650
 a person who bothers you that way too much 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.940
 the duration as long as the game 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.210
 offer an experience that has been 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.390
 totally good if they are 35 40 hours of 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.520
 go here to point a to point b and do 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.600
 this to the other and does not have much 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.180
 variety of missions is going to give me 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.640
 quite pretty angry not because it's a 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.710
 of the things that I hate you know that 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.479
 I detest the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.610
 of both of them something that makes me pretty 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.950
 in fact I was very afraid in front 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.040
 5 car to spend the same and I 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.630
 I was quite surprised there was not much 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.259
 very good really was very good 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.150
 raised 974 yes that happened to me that that 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.369
 I felt that there were many things 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.320
 repetitive of gt5 I do not know anymore 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.290
 it happened we hope that here in watts 2 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.430
 for not happening to me that 35-40 hours of 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.710
 do all the time the same as 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.930
 really be a lot of variety that 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.350
 we can complete the missions so 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.229
 different yes I have and have fun 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.570
 quite also says that doing everything 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.550
 that is, doing 100% of the game would be 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.009
 close to 100 hours we will see to see 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.320
 as I say these things you can not know 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.020
 until we buy the game and until 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.520
 that we do not pass it then we laugh 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.410
 a little bit not when we do not pass and we say 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.020
 when I spent 20 hours today 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.429
 and you say what the fuck has happened here like this 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.690
 that's good, nothing more kids this all 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.259
 we see nothing in the next video 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.259
 until next time
