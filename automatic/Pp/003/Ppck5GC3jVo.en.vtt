playing<00:00:47.520> black<00:00:47.879> ops<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> most<00:00:48.629> fun<00:00:48.870> I've

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079

can<00:00:52.469> remember<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.370> reason<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.850> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
can remember and the reason for that is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.270 
can remember and the reason for that is
is<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.079> tournament<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.770> then

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
is because of that tournament and then

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.729 
is because of that tournament and then

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
even a close game it's pretty much who

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.310

exactly<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.810> happened<00:01:34.079> right<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.340> I<00:01:35.340> think

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
exactly what happened right here I think

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.170 
exactly what happened right here I think
oh<00:01:36.030> actually<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.750> game<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.259> also<00:01:37.670> my<00:01:38.670> longest

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180

oh actually this game is also my longest
gunstreak<00:01:39.840> i<00:01:40.170> think<00:01:41.009> i'm<00:01:41.159> using<00:01:41.479> 4<00:01:42.479> 8<00:01:43.130> 11<00:01:44.130> so

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
gunstreak i think i'm using 4 8 11 so

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.969 
gunstreak i think i'm using 4 8 11 so
for<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> counter<00:01:45.810> eight<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
for for the counter eight for the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
Blackbird and 11 for dogs i think my

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.100 
Blackbird and 11 for dogs i think my
dogs<00:01:49.770> only<00:01:49.950> get<00:01:50.130> three<00:01:50.430> kills<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.479> i<00:01:51.720> do<00:01:51.780> know

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
dogs only get three kills but i do know

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.899 
dogs only get three kills but i do know
that<00:01:52.140> my<00:01:52.439> gun<00:01:52.680> streak<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.490> particular

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
that my gun streak on this particular

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.590 
that my gun streak on this particular
game<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.540> 44<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> that's<00:01:56.520> pretty<00:01:56.729> solid<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
game is 44 so that's pretty solid and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.920 
game is 44 so that's pretty solid and
that<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.960> by<00:01:58.110> far<00:01:58.380> my<00:01:58.439> best<00:01:59.030> but<00:02:00.030> I'm<00:02:00.570> using<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
that is by far my best but I'm using the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
that is by far my best but I'm using the
Augie<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.350> game<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.770> i'm<00:02:02.100> using<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.610> odd

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
Augie in this game and i'm using the odd

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.850 
Augie in this game and i'm using the odd
because<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.930> tournament<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.500> played<00:02:04.710> this

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
because in the tournament we played this

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.130 
because in the tournament we played this
past<00:02:05.520> weekend<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.299> guess<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.719> almost<00:02:06.930> been<00:02:07.110> a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140

team for my subscribers and I'm still

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.990 
team for my subscribers and I'm still
going<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.209> do<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.780> but<00:03:05.560> at<00:03:06.070> this<00:03:06.310> point<00:03:06.640> it

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
going to do that but at this point it

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.550 
going to do that but at this point it
may<00:03:07.150> have<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.480> wait<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.690> couple<00:03:07.840> weeks<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.500> the

may have to wait a couple weeks and the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.590 
may have to wait a couple weeks and the
reason<00:03:08.830> for<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.610> because<00:03:09.640> works<00:03:10.360> been

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
reason for that is is because works been

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.240 
reason for that is is because works been
really<00:03:10.870> busy<00:03:11.020> and<00:03:12.510> also<00:03:13.510> i<00:03:13.840> will<00:03:14.560> be<00:03:14.680> moving<00:03:14.950> to

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.990 
we said we end up setting up another
game<00:04:53.540> and<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:54.590> next<00:04:54.800> game<00:04:55.010> was<00:04:55.370> for<00:04:55.580> like<00:04:55.730> 10

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.310 
game and the next game was for like 10
or<00:04:56.150> 15<00:04:56.450> minutes<00:04:56.480> later<00:04:56.870> or<00:04:57.050> something<00:04:57.200> like

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
or 15 minutes later or something like

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.530 
or 15 minutes later or something like
that<00:04:57.380> and<00:04:57.680> it<00:04:58.250> just<00:04:58.550> so<00:04:58.760> happens<00:04:59.210> that<00:04:59.360> the

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
that and it just so happens that the

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.600 
that and it just so happens that the
same<00:04:59.900> team<00:05:00.200> accepts<00:05:00.980> the<00:05:01.070> game<00:05:01.250> I'm<00:05:01.430> fight

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
same team accepts the game I'm fight

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.810 
same team accepts the game I'm fight
about<00:05:01.850> so<00:05:03.010> that's<00:05:04.010> when<00:05:04.220> we<00:05:04.250> figured<00:05:04.640> out<00:05:04.760> that

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
about so that's when we figured out that

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.610 
about so that's when we figured out that
he<00:05:05.210> was<00:05:05.360> trying<00:05:05.600> to<00:05:05.720> play<00:05:05.960> us<00:05:05.990> trying<00:05:06.440> I<00:05:06.590> don't

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
he was trying to play us trying I don't

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.100 
he was trying to play us trying I don't
know<00:05:07.040> if<00:05:07.130> he<00:05:07.220> was<00:05:07.280> trolling<00:05:07.550> us<00:05:07.790> or<00:05:08.000> what<00:05:08.150> but<00:05:09.050> I

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
know if he was trolling us or what but I

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.440 
know if he was trolling us or what but I
guess<00:05:09.260> he<00:05:09.380> just<00:05:09.590> didn't<00:05:10.160> want<00:05:10.190> to<00:05:10.340> play<00:05:10.460> but

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
guess he just didn't want to play but

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.930 
guess he just didn't want to play but
this<00:05:11.870> time<00:05:12.050> we<00:05:12.230> did<00:05:12.350> not<00:05:12.380> we<00:05:13.130> did<00:05:13.220> not<00:05:13.280> fall<00:05:13.670> for

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
this time we did not we did not fall for

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.320 
this time we did not we did not fall for
it<00:05:14.090> we<00:05:14.210> actually<00:05:14.510> decided<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.990> play<00:05:15.230> them<00:05:15.470> and

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
it we actually decided to play them and

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.090 
it we actually decided to play them and
we<00:05:17.330> pretty<00:05:17.510> much<00:05:17.600> pooped<00:05:17.930> all<00:05:18.080> over<00:05:18.110> so<00:05:19.070> I

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
we pretty much pooped all over so I

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.800 
we pretty much pooped all over so I
don't<00:05:19.340> know<00:05:19.520> if<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:20.180> reason<00:05:20.450> why<00:05:20.570> there<00:05:20.720> were

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
don't know if the reason why there were

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.170 
don't know if the reason why there were
17<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.290> one<00:05:21.560> is<00:05:21.770> because<00:05:21.950> they<00:05:22.370> were<00:05:22.430> just

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
17 and one is because they were just

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.030 
17 and one is because they were just
playing<00:05:23.540> terrible<00:05:24.110> teams<00:05:24.380> they'd<00:05:24.710> kind<00:05:24.890> of

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
playing terrible teams they'd kind of

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.590 
playing terrible teams they'd kind of
use<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.280> same<00:05:25.460> tactic<00:05:25.910> i<00:05:26.060> actually<00:05:26.300> went<00:05:26.390> back

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
use the same tactic i actually went back

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.230 
use the same tactic i actually went back
and<00:05:26.810> looked<00:05:26.900> at<00:05:27.080> all<00:05:27.920> the<00:05:28.280> recent<00:05:28.460> games<00:05:28.880> and

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
and looked at all the recent games and

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.630 
and looked at all the recent games and
they<00:05:29.690> had<00:05:29.870> like<00:05:30.110> the<00:05:30.920> last<00:05:31.160> seven<00:05:31.490> out<00:05:31.610> of

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
they had like the last seven out of

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.720 
they had like the last seven out of
eight<00:05:31.820> games<00:05:32.120> are<00:05:32.300> all<00:05:32.390> cancellations<00:05:32.990> so<00:05:33.730> i

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
eight games are all cancellations so i

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.830 
eight games are all cancellations so i
don't<00:05:34.910> know<00:05:35.000> i<00:05:35.030> don't<00:05:35.120> know<00:05:35.270> why<00:05:35.420> people<00:05:35.450> do

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
don't know i don't know why people do

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.980 
don't know i don't know why people do
that<00:05:35.870> I<00:05:36.200> mean<00:05:36.440> I<00:05:36.950> I<00:05:37.430> think<00:05:38.060> gamebattles<00:05:38.390> is<00:05:38.690> to

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
that I mean I I think gamebattles is to

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.440 
that I mean I I think gamebattles is to
play<00:05:39.260> a<00:05:39.560> little<00:05:39.830> bit<00:05:40.040> more<00:05:40.220> of<00:05:40.550> a<00:05:40.940> competitive

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
play a little bit more of a competitive

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.570 
play a little bit more of a competitive
type<00:05:41.660> game<00:05:41.990> but<00:05:42.680> I<00:05:42.740> still<00:05:42.950> think<00:05:43.160> it's<00:05:43.280> for<00:05:43.370> fun

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
type game but I still think it's for fun

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.090 
type game but I still think it's for fun
of<00:05:43.640> course<00:05:43.880> I<00:05:44.240> don't<00:05:44.420> like<00:05:44.570> losing<00:05:44.870> but<00:05:45.860> I

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
of course I don't like losing but I

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.910 
of course I don't like losing but I
don't<00:05:46.640> think<00:05:46.850> you<00:05:47.000> should<00:05:47.030> result<00:05:47.870> too<00:05:48.170> sleepy

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
don't think you should result too sleepy

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.570 
don't think you should result too sleepy
tactics<00:05:49.430> to<00:05:49.580> try<00:05:49.610> and<00:05:49.910> get<00:05:50.000> wins<00:05:50.270> or<00:05:50.600> whatever

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
tactics to try and get wins or whatever

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.240 
tactics to try and get wins or whatever
and<00:05:52.930> yeah<00:05:53.930> that's<00:05:54.110> pretty<00:05:54.230> much<00:05:54.440> it<00:05:54.530> so<00:05:54.950> I

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
and yeah that's pretty much it so I

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.630 
and yeah that's pretty much it so I
competitive<00:05:56.240> gaming<00:05:56.390> is<00:05:56.660> a<00:05:56.690> lot<00:05:56.870> of<00:05:56.900> fun<00:05:57.140> I'm

at<00:06:19.340> least<00:06:19.400> from<00:06:19.640> the<00:06:19.760> responses<00:06:20.210> i<00:06:20.240> got<00:06:20.480> i

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
at least from the responses i got i

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.510 
at least from the responses i got i
think<00:06:21.530> that<00:06:21.650> there's<00:06:21.830> a<00:06:21.920> lot<00:06:22.100> of<00:06:22.130> people<00:06:22.310> that

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
think that there's a lot of people that

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.100 
think that there's a lot of people that
are<00:06:22.640> wanting<00:06:22.790> to<00:06:22.940> try<00:06:23.210> out<00:06:23.360> i<00:06:23.390> may<00:06:23.690> even<00:06:23.840> have

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
are wanting to try out i may even have

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.580 
are wanting to try out i may even have
to<00:06:24.580> set<00:06:25.580> up<00:06:25.700> some<00:06:26.050> you<00:06:27.050> know<00:06:27.080> minimum

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
to set up some you know minimum

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.119 
to set up some you know minimum
requirements

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:29.129 
requirements

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:31.489 
requirements
I<00:06:29.419> did<00:06:30.419> because<00:06:30.569> there<00:06:30.809> were<00:06:30.869> so<00:06:30.899> many<00:06:31.139> people

00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:31.499 
I did because there were so many people

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:34.100 
I did because there were so many people
so<00:06:31.679> it<00:06:32.489> actually<00:06:33.029> I<00:06:33.330> probably<00:06:33.599> will<00:06:33.809> have<00:06:33.989> to

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
so it actually I probably will have to

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.149 
so it actually I probably will have to
do<00:06:34.229> that<00:06:34.379> so<00:06:34.529> what<00:06:34.619> do<00:06:34.679> you<00:06:34.739> guys<00:06:34.800> think<00:06:34.889> would

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159 
do that so what do you guys think would

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.799 
do that so what do you guys think would
be<00:06:35.249> fair<00:06:35.489> for<00:06:35.550> minimum<00:06:36.089> requirements<00:06:36.629> I<00:06:36.689> mean

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:36.809 
be fair for minimum requirements I mean

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:38.839 
be fair for minimum requirements I mean
I'm<00:06:36.959> not<00:06:37.110> saying<00:06:37.409> that<00:06:37.529> you<00:06:38.399> have<00:06:38.580> to<00:06:38.729> have

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
I'm not saying that you have to have

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.859 
I'm not saying that you have to have
above<00:06:39.269> a<00:06:39.300> certain<00:06:39.869> KD<00:06:40.409> but<00:06:40.860> I<00:06:41.069> mean<00:06:41.249> at<00:06:42.029> certain

00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:42.869 
above a certain KD but I mean at certain

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.869 
above a certain KD but I mean at certain
at<00:06:43.229> some<00:06:43.619> points<00:06:43.979> you<00:06:44.069> kind<00:06:44.279> of<00:06:44.339> got<00:06:44.489> to<00:06:44.610> cut<00:06:44.759> it

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:44.879 
at some points you kind of got to cut it

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:48.139 
at some points you kind of got to cut it
off<00:06:44.999> and<00:06:45.419> i'm<00:06:45.539> thinking<00:06:45.959> like<00:06:46.909> not<00:06:47.909> to<00:06:48.029> be<00:06:48.059> a

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:48.149 
off and i'm thinking like not to be a

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:51.229 
off and i'm thinking like not to be a
dick<00:06:48.330> or<00:06:48.509> anything<00:06:48.569> but<00:06:49.080> it<00:06:49.199> may<00:06:49.229> be<00:06:49.349> around<00:06:50.239> 15

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:51.239 
dick or anything but it may be around 15

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:53.570 
dick or anything but it may be around 15
katie<00:06:51.599> is<00:06:51.749> the<00:06:51.959> minimum<00:06:52.319> i<00:06:52.559> mean<00:06:53.279> and<00:06:53.489> then
