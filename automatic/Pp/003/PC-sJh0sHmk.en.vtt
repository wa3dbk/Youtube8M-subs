why would use raw eggs because big time
all<00:00:35.219> right<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.460> here's<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:35.700> you're<00:00:35.910> gonna<00:00:35.969> do

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
all right so here's what you're gonna do

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.250 
all right so here's what you're gonna do
right<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> very<00:00:36.809> middle<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
right here in the very middle I have a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.810 
right here in the very middle I have a
glass<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> very<00:00:38.070> middle<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> object

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
glass in the very middle of the object

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.430 
glass in the very middle of the object
is<00:00:38.940> you're<00:00:39.090> gonna<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.719> egg<00:00:39.930> into<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
is you're gonna get the get egg into the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.560 
is you're gonna get the get egg into the
glass<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.890> water<00:00:41.070> no<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.879> let<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.360> drop

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
glass of water no if I let you just drop

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.600 
glass of water no if I let you just drop
the<00:00:42.600> egg<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.110> that's<00:00:43.290> totally<00:00:43.620> boring<00:00:44.010> so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the egg and that's totally boring so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.700 
the egg and that's totally boring so
that's<00:00:44.789> where<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> piping<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.660> comes<00:00:45.930> direct

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that's where the piping in comes direct

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.619 
that's where the piping in comes direct
so<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.070> gonna<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.430> top<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.149> then<00:00:48.450> if<00:00:48.539> I

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
so this is gonna be on top and then if I

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.590 
so this is gonna be on top and then if I
let<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.050> put<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.530> pie<00:00:50.100> pan<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:51.030> top<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
let you put the pie pan on on top and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.729 
let you put the pie pan on on top and
then<00:00:51.690> put<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> egg<00:00:52.050> there<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.440> gonna<00:00:52.530> roll

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
then put the egg there it's gonna roll

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.889 
then put the egg there it's gonna roll
around<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.160> that's<00:00:53.460> why<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.210> need<00:00:54.420> some<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
around so that's why you need some do to

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.740 
around so that's why you need some do to
do<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.850> know<00:00:56.850> what<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.120> call<00:00:57.329> them<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.539> kids

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
do to know what you call them as kids

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.880 
do to know what you call them as kids
but<00:00:57.899> we'd<00:00:58.050> finish<00:00:58.350> I<00:01:03.019> want<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.350> line<00:01:04.589> them

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
but we'd finish I want you to line them

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.429 
but we'd finish I want you to line them
up<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.790> tube<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.360> directly<00:01:07.020> over<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
up so that the tube is directly over the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.370 
up so that the tube is directly over the
opening<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.979> got<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.510> now<00:01:09.510> egg<00:01:09.810> goes<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
opening you got it now egg goes on the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.710 
opening you got it now egg goes on the
top<00:01:10.590> sideways<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.299> don't<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.510> it's

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
top sideways it's just I don't know it's

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.090 
top sideways it's just I don't know it's
a<00:01:12.780> weird<00:01:13.020> thing<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.439> don't<00:01:13.740> know<00:01:13.950> I've

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
a weird thing that I don't know I've

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.460 
a weird thing that I don't know I've
done<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.700> long<00:01:14.880> time<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:18.470> we're

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
done this for a long time and we're

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.140 
done this for a long time and we're
learning<00:01:19.590> about<00:01:19.799> inertia<00:01:20.189> your<00:01:20.549> hand<00:01:20.880> is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
learning about inertia your hand is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.460 
learning about inertia your hand is
gonna<00:01:21.330> go<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.750> side<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.170> you're<00:01:22.380> not

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
gonna go to the side now you're not

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.960 
gonna go to the side now you're not
gonna<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> same<00:01:23.400> time<00:01:23.460> because

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
gonna all do it at the same time because

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.670 
gonna all do it at the same time because
we<00:01:24.060> got<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.420> some<00:01:24.600> room<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:24.990> Gary<00:01:25.200> you're

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
we got to have some room so Gary you're

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
we got to have some room so Gary you're
first<00:01:25.979> it'll<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.360> you're

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540

first it'll be here like this you're
gonna<00:01:27.630> pull<00:01:27.930> back<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.320> about<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.680> other<00:01:28.860> pan

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
gonna pull back to about this other pan

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
gonna pull back to about this other pan
you're<00:01:29.310> gonna<00:01:29.430> hit<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.970> pan<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.570> draw<00:01:30.869> it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
you're gonna hit the pan just draw it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.050 
you're gonna hit the pan just draw it
straight<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.619> okay<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.280> gonna<00:01:32.460> push<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
straight on okay that's gonna push the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.810 
straight on okay that's gonna push the
do<00:01:33.210> -<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.540> -<00:01:33.950> all<00:01:34.950> right<00:01:35.159> toilet<00:01:35.340> paper<00:01:35.579> roll

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
do - to - all right toilet paper roll

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.429 
do - to - all right toilet paper roll
and<00:01:36.180> then<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> inertia<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> egg<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
and then the inertia of the egg the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.719 
and then the inertia of the egg the
tendency<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.920> an<00:01:38.040> object<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.400> stay<00:01:38.490> at<00:01:38.700> rest

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
tendency of an object to stay at rest

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.060 
tendency of an object to stay at rest
until<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.810> force<00:01:40.079> acts<00:01:40.259> upon<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.530> gravity's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
until a force acts upon it gravity's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:02:03.920 
until a force acts upon it gravity's
gonna<00:01:41.220> let<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> fall<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.290> maybe

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.240 

you're<00:02:04.930> doing<00:02:05.260> it<00:02:07.680> wasn't<00:02:08.680> lined<00:02:08.800> up<00:02:08.979> where's

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
you're doing it wasn't lined up where's

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.680 
you're doing it wasn't lined up where's
my<00:02:09.430> fault<00:02:09.670> no<00:02:09.820> no<00:02:09.880> right<00:02:10.149> here<00:02:10.180> like<00:02:10.510> this
