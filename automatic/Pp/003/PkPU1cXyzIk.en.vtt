and I'm going to show you what it is
flamenco<00:00:21.949> is<00:00:22.949> very<00:00:23.220> commonly<00:00:23.609> played<00:00:23.970> and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
flamenco is very commonly played and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.109 
flamenco is very commonly played and
what<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.510> call<00:00:24.750> Phrygian<00:00:25.560> mode<00:00:26.119> Phrygian

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
what we call Phrygian mode Phrygian

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.950 
what we call Phrygian mode Phrygian
scale<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:29.580> scale<00:00:29.910> derives<00:00:30.420> from<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
scale is the scale derives from the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.020 
scale is the scale derives from the
third<00:00:31.199> degree<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.769> your<00:00:31.980> major<00:00:32.130> scale<00:00:32.369> that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
third degree of your major scale that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.450 
third degree of your major scale that
means<00:00:33.239> if<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.290> take<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.800> example<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.250> white

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
means if you take for example the white

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.450 
means if you take for example the white
keys<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.510> piano<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.500> go<00:00:37.739> from<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.010> C<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
keys in a piano and you go from a C to a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.030 
keys in a piano and you go from a C to a
see<00:00:39.050> without<00:00:40.050> touching<00:00:40.379> any<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.860> Black

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
see without touching any of the Black

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.090 
see without touching any of the Black
Keys<00:00:41.250> that's<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.940> major<00:00:42.210> scale<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:42.950> if<00:00:43.950> we

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
Keys that's a major scale now if we

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250 
Keys that's a major scale now if we
start<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.550> same<00:00:44.820> scale<00:00:45.210> instead<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.840> from<00:00:46.020> C

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
start that same scale instead of from C

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.619 
start that same scale instead of from C
to<00:00:46.289> C<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:46.950> from<00:00:47.160> e<00:00:47.370> which<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.090> third<00:00:48.180> note

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
to C we go from e which is a third note

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.310 
to C we go from e which is a third note
so<00:00:49.469> CDE<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.760> will<00:00:50.850> start<00:00:51.059> from<00:00:51.149> E<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.170> would

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
so CDE we will start from E and we would

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.250 
so CDE we will start from E and we would
go<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.500> all<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.100> white<00:00:53.280> notes<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.789> next<00:00:54.030> E

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
go up all the white notes the next E

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.650 
go up all the white notes the next E
that's<00:00:55.260> called<00:00:55.920> an<00:00:56.039> E<00:00:56.340> Phrygian<00:00:56.879> scale<00:00:56.910> what

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
that's called an E Phrygian scale what

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.990 
that's called an E Phrygian scale what
features<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> scale<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.460> half<00:00:59.670> step

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
features the scale is the half step

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.639 
features the scale is the half step
between<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.570> first<00:01:00.780> note<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> second

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
between the first note and the second

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.670 
between the first note and the second
that<00:01:01.770> will<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.039> between<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.430> E<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.180> F

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
that will be between the E and the F

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.250 
that will be between the E and the F
okay<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.979> that's<00:01:05.549> one<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.909> main<00:01:06.570> harmonic

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
okay and that's one of the main harmonic

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
okay and that's one of the main harmonic
features<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.830> flamenco<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.880> Phrygian

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
features of flamenco is that Phrygian

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.140 
features of flamenco is that Phrygian
sound<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.830> hear<00:01:11.070> all<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.250> time<00:01:11.369> kind<00:01:12.090> of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
sound that we hear all the time kind of

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.490 
sound that we hear all the time kind of
like

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.740 

okay<00:01:16.370> so<00:01:16.430> basically<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.970> flamenco<00:01:17.240> skill<00:01:17.600> is

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
okay so basically the flamenco skill is

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.560 
okay so basically the flamenco skill is
a<00:01:17.780> Phrygian<00:01:18.350> scale<00:01:18.940> but<00:01:19.940> we're<00:01:20.420> going<00:01:20.510> to

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
a Phrygian scale but we're going to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.760 
a Phrygian scale but we're going to
include<00:01:20.840> one<00:01:21.080> more<00:01:21.110> note<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:22.340> flamenco<00:01:22.670> scale

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
include one more note the flamenco scale

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.590 
include one more note the flamenco scale
also<00:01:24.770> accommodates<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.910> major<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:26.480> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
also accommodates the major and the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.630 
also accommodates the major and the
minor<00:01:26.840> key<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.680> whether<00:01:27.890> we<00:01:28.010> play<00:01:28.220> in<00:01:28.280> an<00:01:28.460> a

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
minor key so whether we play in an a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.120 
minor key so whether we play in an a
major<00:01:28.910> or<00:01:29.180> a<00:01:29.210> minor<00:01:29.440> we<00:01:30.440> would<00:01:30.590> use<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.950> same

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
major or a minor we would use the same

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.920 
major or a minor we would use the same
scale<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:31.760> that<00:01:31.940> means<00:01:32.180> that<00:01:32.420> Phrygian<00:01:32.900> scale

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
scale and that means that Phrygian scale

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.840 
scale and that means that Phrygian scale
is<00:01:33.380> going<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.650> include<00:01:33.800> an<00:01:33.920> extra<00:01:34.220> note<00:01:34.370> to

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
is going to include an extra note to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.570 
is going to include an extra note to
make<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.150> accommodation<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:37.250> let<00:01:37.370> me<00:01:37.430> play

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
make that accommodation so let me play

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.180 
make that accommodation so let me play
you<00:01:37.610> just<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.120> Phrygian<00:01:38.450> scale<00:01:38.740> if<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:39.860> was<00:01:40.040> in

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
you just a Phrygian scale if I was in

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:51.790 
you just a Phrygian scale if I was in
the<00:01:40.280> key<00:01:40.430> of<00:01:40.910> a<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.930> play<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.770> Phrygian<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:51.680> the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
the key of a I play a Phrygian so the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.740 
the key of a I play a Phrygian so the
flamenco<00:01:52.100> scale<00:01:52.490> is<00:01:52.580> an<00:01:52.670> eighth<00:01:52.910> note<00:01:52.940> scale<00:01:53.479> a

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
flamenco scale is an eighth note scale a

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.400 
flamenco scale is an eighth note scale a
Phrygian<00:01:54.290> scale<00:01:54.470> with<00:01:55.430> an<00:01:55.550> added<00:01:56.000> major<00:01:56.390> third

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
Phrygian scale with an added major third

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:13.729 
Phrygian scale with an added major third
