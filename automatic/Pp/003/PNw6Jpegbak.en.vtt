00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the game it's a pretty much just like

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.740 
the game it's a pretty much just like
temple<00:00:14.519> run<00:00:14.549> except<00:00:14.969> there's<00:00:15.120> not<00:00:15.299> one<00:00:15.540> lane

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
temple run except there's not one lane

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.560 
temple run except there's not one lane
but<00:00:16.020> three<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.820> which<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.000> makes<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.390> kind

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
but three and which that makes it kind

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.599 
but three and which that makes it kind
of<00:00:18.630> more<00:00:18.840> fun<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.710> concept<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.430> game

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
of more fun and the concept of the game

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.150 
of more fun and the concept of the game
is<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.510> try<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.840> avoid<00:00:22.560> getting<00:00:22.890> hit<00:00:23.100> by

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
is that you try to avoid getting hit by

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.000 
is that you try to avoid getting hit by
trains<00:00:23.640> running<00:00:24.480> into<00:00:24.660> stuff<00:00:24.720> what<00:00:25.470> obstacles

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
trains running into stuff what obstacles

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.540 
trains running into stuff what obstacles
and<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:27.180> away<00:00:27.240> from<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.510> cop<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.010> story

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
and get away from the cop so the story

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.930 
and get away from the cop so the story
behind<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.179> there's<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.859> bunch<00:00:32.730> of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
