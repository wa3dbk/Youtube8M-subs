00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
hi I'm Michael Pitt I'm a professional

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.259 
hi I'm Michael Pitt I'm a professional
recurve<00:00:13.679> Archer<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.190> Olympic<00:00:14.670> reserve<00:00:15.030> and

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
recurve Archer and Olympic reserve and

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.590 
recurve Archer and Olympic reserve and
this<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.260> how<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.470> improve<00:00:17.010> your<00:00:17.310> bow<00:00:17.490> grip<00:00:17.730> so

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
this is how to improve your bow grip so

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.320 
this is how to improve your bow grip so
the<00:00:18.690> best<00:00:18.840> way<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.050> grip<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> bow<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.820> to<00:00:20.820> apply

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the best way to grip a bow is to apply

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.390 
the best way to grip a bow is to apply
the<00:00:21.390> pressure<00:00:21.630> down<00:00:22.230> here<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.740> line<00:00:23.070> with<00:00:23.310> your

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the pressure down here in line with your

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.849 
the pressure down here in line with your
lifeline<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:25.109> we've<00:00:25.289> got<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> pressure<00:00:25.680> on

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
lifeline so we've got the pressure on

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.550 
lifeline so we've got the pressure on
this<00:00:25.980> pad<00:00:26.310> leading<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.960> lifeline<00:00:28.349> and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
this pad leading up to the lifeline and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.849 
this pad leading up to the lifeline and
not<00:00:28.769> over<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.390> basically<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.289> lifeline

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
not over here so basically this lifeline

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.889 
not over here so basically this lifeline
here<00:00:33.860> wants<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.890> line<00:00:35.130> up<00:00:35.309> down<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.329> edge<00:00:36.630> of

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
here wants to line up down this edge of

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.869 
here wants to line up down this edge of
the<00:00:36.989> grip<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> neutral<00:00:38.340> desirable

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the grip so the neutral desirable

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.180 
the grip so the neutral desirable
position<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.390> again<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.440> lifeline<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
position is again the lifeline on the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.220 
position is again the lifeline on the
edge<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> grip<00:00:41.719> commonly<00:00:42.719> see<00:00:42.899> people

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
edge of the grip commonly see people

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.410 
edge of the grip commonly see people
going<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.590> too<00:00:43.739> far<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.250> starting<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.300> put

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
going in too far and starting to put

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.990 
going in too far and starting to put
pressure<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.590> pad<00:00:46.860> here<00:00:47.129> which<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> going

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
pressure on this pad here which is going

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940 
pressure on this pad here which is going
to<00:00:48.059> talk<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.539> bow<00:00:48.719> left<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.289> right<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.710> cause

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
to talk the bow left and right and cause

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.100 
to talk the bow left and right and cause
you<00:00:50.160> some<00:00:50.340> problems<00:00:50.370> or<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.449> other<00:00:51.570> issue<00:00:51.930> I

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you some problems or the other issue I

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.900 
you some problems or the other issue I
come<00:00:52.350> across<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:53.070> people<00:00:53.520> who<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.699> hanging

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
come across is people who are hanging

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.850 
come across is people who are hanging
off<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> thumb<00:00:54.480> they're<00:00:55.260> drawing<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.710> like

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
off the thumb they're drawing up like

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.590 
off the thumb they're drawing up like
this<00:00:56.039> again<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:56.850> putting<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.149> lot<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> twist

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
this again it's putting a lot of twist

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.360 
this again it's putting a lot of twist
on<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> bow<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.230> also<00:00:58.890> you're<00:00:59.039> sometimes

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
on the bow and also you're sometimes

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.430 
on the bow and also you're sometimes
fine<00:00:59.579> if<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.850> then<00:00:59.969> starts<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.329> rain<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.230> grip

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
fine if it then starts to rain the grip

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.229 
fine if it then starts to rain the grip
becomes<00:01:01.770> slippery<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.789> end<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
becomes slippery and you end up with a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.479 
becomes slippery and you end up with a
unstable<00:01:04.080> hand<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.739> normally<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.280> relax

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489

your hand and you line it up with the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530 
your hand and you line it up with the
lifeline<00:01:07.710> you're<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> relaxed<00:01:09.299> hand

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
lifeline you're going to relaxed hand

what it means is I going to have my hand

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.969 
what it means is I going to have my hand
totally<00:01:38.310> relaxed<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:39.329> when<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> shoot

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
totally relaxed because when I shoot

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.319 
totally relaxed because when I shoot
when<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> bow<00:01:41.220> instead<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.850> falling<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.210> my

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
when the bow instead of falling out my

hand and crashing to the floor the sling

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.460 
hand and crashing to the floor the sling
catches<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.780> means<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.049> only<00:01:46.140> shoot<00:01:46.320> with

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
catches it so it means I only shoot with

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.649

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
a relaxed hand so I don't apply any talk
