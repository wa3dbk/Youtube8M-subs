00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.970
 good people we are already reaching the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.070
 applestore of the colon street 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.580
 there the bottom is already the tail now they are 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.359
 the average six and six thirty 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.590
 the morning 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.349
 and it seems that there are people we have arrived 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.410
 before it reached the vicinity and 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.150
 I already tell you that there is still a 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.090
 lots of people now we will continue there the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.440
 video and the tail 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.120
 here we are since we have advanced 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.100
 enough but because it offers us a little 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.170
 the tail seems or because they have already got a 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.460
 little of people out of the first to 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.460
 that are near the door and you can 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.030
 I'm doing all this goes for long 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:56.860
 because they are about seven 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.969
 7 5 and until 8 do not open at the moment 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.750
 to fill the store until it's not 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.930
 they leave people they do not let enter more and by one 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.930
 to keep waiting 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.930
 do not 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.650
 once 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.230
 we are here closer and start to 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.440
 dawn there you can see in this video it 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:41.700
 They reflect the posters of the iphone and I do not know 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.540
 if you can appreciate that gold and excel 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.370
 a little but it's 5 of that black no 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.740
 it's very good 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.580
 the rose suffix and that's his 5 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.090
 made with green sleeve or like but good 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.090
 we are closer 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.510
 well so we continue later 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.780
 yes 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.400
 good people like her we are here 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.040
 enough theory we have the store 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.909
 practically before there is all the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.790
 table full of toys you see here 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.500
 the 5 c I think they're going to eat it 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.130
 little but it seems that it kept moving forward 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.510
 the 5 s well there's the bottom 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:47.790
 begins to lower but that 56 and that 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.790
 sees a fat and yellow bite 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.500
 in pink well the red red that is that 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.030
 but the truth is that this is already beginning 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.950
 to put a little interesting people already 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.760
 it's out there inside they're already going to 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.760
 tell you a second 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.940
 it's nine o'clock nine o'clock 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.060
 minutes so well let's wait for a 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.060
 little bit 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.090
 all right 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.410
 yes 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.960
 good
