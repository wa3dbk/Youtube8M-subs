00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.730
 sulik dei ming today on destiny 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.890
 we're going to see time and patience 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.990
 an exotic sniper rifle convict 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.309
 very very particular arc 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.840
 this because this rifle of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.389
 precision encompasses what is the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.949
 true essence of the chosen shooter and it 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.960
 you will soon understand his abilities 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.180
 as usual it will have two main ones 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.650
 plus two below upgrades first though 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.359
 let's spend a moment on two little words 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.220
 what the weapon statistics are 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.109
 time and patience will have a cadence 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.550
 very low however in a rifle of 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.740
 you will not make precision as usual 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.750
 too much chance will have an impact that is not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.489
 some of the best will have shaken almost to the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.290
 maximum that goes hand in hand with one 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.540
 stability among the best present in the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.430
 title equal only to that of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.469
 previti revenge is a time of 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.329
 recharging very good also despite 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.070
 basic only have four strokes e 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.480
 charger with a why we will see more 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.309
 up to 6 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.350
 Now let's go back to talking about skills 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.640
 perk its first ability and third 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.170
 eye skill that has already been seen in 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.120
 other weapons such as the multi 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.190
 tool me from the radar and zuccone radar 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.820
 of the very underrated skill will seem 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.620
 my 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.750
 in practice it will allow you to hold the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.850
 radar tivo when I connect with this weapon 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.110
 many tend to forget that when 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.729
 you have told me on the radar 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.770
 deactivated and not seeing it if 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.659
 they completely forget this 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.250
 skill you will often notice enemies 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.840
 that you were born near rather than 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.610
 they want to come away from behind 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.439
 from the side that you would not otherwise have 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.600
 seen and here is the strong point 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.340
 of this skill the second ability e 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.380
 particularity of the weapon is called time 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 and patience and a few words vi 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.939
 will allow it to become invisible of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.159
 camouflage me as he says skill itself 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.990
 when to network with this weapon this 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.430
 ability also a dow call so it's not 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.780
 that every time you take aim 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.670
 disappear all at once 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.900
 no after a couple of seconds you have the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.189
 aims become invisible 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.020
 if you had any reason 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.850
 come back visible before you can 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.659
 disappear again will have to pass 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.340
 a few seconds 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.920
 this skill is really very much 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.600
 pvp useful where ok even if you are 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 invisible they see the same in the light 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.500
 red orange of the weapon however in the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.270
 complex makes you more difficult to 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.640
 identify first of all also being 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.890
 will not see your icon on the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.810
 radar passing close if you don't 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.969
 they see just visually fail 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.580
 to understand that if you maybe an enemy and there 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.810
 could 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.000
 the bar and life at least on one occasion 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.350
 and of course also when you go to 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.090
 clash with cats from the long 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.070
 distance maybe with other snipers who 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.540
 they are focusing on not seeing you 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.160
 just not physically seeing the outline 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.110
 of your head could do it 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.850
 make a mistake that could cost you 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.590
 their life, however, and this is precisely the 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.840
 strong point of this weapon of this 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.730
 skill abilities that unfortunately in the pv e 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.350
 it is not as useful as it is there 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.300
 even becoming invisible could 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.280
 help you right when you have to run away 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.110
 from a shelter behind which you were and that 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.910
 could help you larvae but everything 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.740
 this of the pd and is not a skill too 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.660
 useful for two sets instead 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.490
 upgrades in the first use branch 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.200
 throttle the first one you will unlock in 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.330
 poor words that will increase range 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.310
 impact and also slightly increase the 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.410
 recoil of the weapon in what though of 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.270
 base as I said earlier is already 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.130
 good and that if you really want 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.030
 improving it there is also the second ability 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.170
 to do it 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.090
 so let's say I don't care 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.860
 too much to slightly worsen the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.600
 recoil for a good cause or the 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.670
 range and the impact that appears at the meeting 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.350
 in this weapon it is good to increase them more 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.820
 if instead he wanted to find a 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.170
 there is a good compromise for this branch 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.660
 the last one for both ballistics 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.489
 aggressive to reduce the range and ne 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.380
 will increase the impact without damaging the 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.570
 too much the recoil however in my opinion remains 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.670
 the same best choke as a bonus 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.470
 in the second branch instead a choice will be 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.820
 really very difficult because they are all 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.050
 the three great bonuses 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.940
 the first will allow you to change 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.830
 optical alarm to put a minino with 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.150
 a lower zoom will not change in any 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.709
 way the weapon statistics 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.900
 it will simply be for pure convenience 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.950
 then evaluate yourself based on yours 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.840
 capacity 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.370
 if you are comfortable with the basic joints if 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.019
 you need an inferior last 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.150
 because the map is not too large 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.620
 according to bones instead rectified cash 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.239
 increases the stability of the weapon makes it 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.709
 get to the top in a few words a 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.510
 my opinion you could also avoid 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.010
 use this bonus also because if 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.780
 stability was not right at 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.010
 maximum maximum, however very low ed 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.019
 it's easy to control 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.820
 so let's say you could close a 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.860
 eye the third bonus instead what 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.870
 use the is normally explorer from 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.820
 field that increases the strokes by two that 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.350
 you can carry in the charger 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.850
 doing so this gun will have six 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.739
 shots in the charger can take you 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.360
 behind a larger stock in pvp 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.950
 above all I like to use this 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.170
 bonus because when you collect the 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.430
 Ground ammunition will sell benthic and 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.019
 not the 6 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.879
 would normally be with chargers from 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.320
 I also recommend four shots with 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.120
 a precision rifle just like 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.039
 this don't worry about having to hit 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.479
 always and in any case having the head 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.100
 however a very good stability 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.080
 you can also afford to kill the 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.460
 enemies by hitting them twice on one 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.620
 any part of the body 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.240
 in conclusion the type and patience yes 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.889
 presents as an excellent rifle of 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.020
 precision this thanks to the skills 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.210
 very focused is one of the most stable 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.800
 high present in destiny and despite 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.930
 they are sniper rifles that come 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.000
 exploited mainly in the pvp where it is 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.650
 truly a beast manages to make itself 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.849
 can also be used in the pdl 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.650
 and this is exactly what I appreciate 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.669
 this weapon saying this guy the 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.259
 video comes to an end 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.669
 as usual the ring for yours 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.530
 attention I invite you to leave me the 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.970
 your feedback share this video 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.380
 with all your friends 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.919
 destinee we feel the next 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.919
 hello everyone guys
