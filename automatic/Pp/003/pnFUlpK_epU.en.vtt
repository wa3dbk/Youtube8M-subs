00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.939
 the dream of everyone who poses 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.040
 writing is doing it in a big house 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.809
 with a beautiful view on the sea 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.089
 beating its waves through large 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.309
 windows a very hairy dog 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:18.310
 dozing by the fireplace in the 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.320
 lounge a back garden pool and a 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.529
 pair of horses on the block to give 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.750
 walks through the surrounding forest that 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.609
 It would be great what doubt are the 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.460
 ideal conditions to write from 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:33.250
 then but also to paint or to 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.340
 compose music or just to live 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.340
 I love it too but we talk about 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.770
 write not of daydreaming in a 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.650
 house so I imagine that you should live 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.960
 very good but you can believe me I do not know 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.510
 writes better and is even very likely 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.270
 that at that point let's tell ourselves already 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.330
 I have the house so I do not want to 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.090
 write now to live and it's more than 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.160
 understandable who is can have those 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.260
 minimum conditions before sitting down to 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.640
 writing does not really want to write 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.710
 absolutely 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.020
 in the history of literature in the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.420
 biographies of writers we find 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.040
 very few authors who have worked or 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.990
 work in those conditions 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.510
 there are times when you do not even 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.330
 we can find a quiet place in 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.920
 our own house for those cases there are 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.170
 to be as stubborn as imaginative 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.509
 there are bank libraries in the 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.180
 parks waiting rooms at stations 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.850
 buses and airports trains and up 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.220
 hospitals churches and funeral homes if 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.369
 the case may come to be in 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.990
 some instant appropriate places 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.740
 We will have to find our own 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.899
 corner 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.659
 one of my students lived with his parents 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.799
 in a very small house the mother the 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.290
 Grandma had the television on 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.049
 all day and did not have a room 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.670
 own slept in the living room in a bed 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.189
 that came from inside a sofa 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.100
 family there was no place where 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.229
 concentrate finally locked himself in the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.990
 bathroom put cushions on 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.259
 the bathtub and sat inside to 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.260
 except of all to be able to write such 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.750
 time is not the ideal place but if to him 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.960
 it was used to write can start 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.850
 do what 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.280
 They also told me the case of a woman 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.710
 to which her husband and children took 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.990
 her hair every time she started writing 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.270
 what to do because you do not stop writing 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.610
 foolish and wasting time we're going to 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.790
 dine today that you think they're going to give you the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.800
 Nobel prize she knew that she was never going to 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.950
 get them to respect their need to 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.010
 write so he searched for a safe place 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.660
 of assaults outside the home 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.670
 I sat in a coffee shop 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.090
 Areces inside your own car 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.710
 and wrote then bought quickly 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.560
 some dinner and go home 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.060
 He said it had taken a long time because 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.319
 queues in the market that day were 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.359
 Horrible also worth 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.010
 anything that makes you write 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.650
 Anywhere you can 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.360
 writing is your place to write like that 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.490
 that now I'm going to write 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.440
