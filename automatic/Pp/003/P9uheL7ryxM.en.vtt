hi<00:00:07.830> my<00:00:08.189> name<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.340> Jesse<00:00:08.760> from<00:00:09.030> source<00:00:09.269> audio

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
hi my name is Jesse from source audio

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:19.370 
hi my name is Jesse from source audio
and<00:00:09.929> I'm<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.679> creator<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.309> hot<00:00:18.020> hot<00:00:19.020> hand<00:00:19.260> is

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
and I'm the creator of hot hot hand is

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.740 
and I'm the creator of hot hot hand is
basically<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.890> three<00:00:20.400> axis<00:00:20.790> accelerometer<00:00:20.880> and

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
basically a three axis accelerometer and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.230 
basically a three axis accelerometer and
you<00:00:22.110> can<00:00:22.290> use<00:00:22.440> it<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.740> control<00:00:22.980> our<00:00:23.580> FX<00:00:23.970> or

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
you can use it to control our FX or

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.270 
you can use it to control our FX or
other<00:00:24.630> peoples<00:00:25.050> effects<00:00:25.470> as<00:00:25.680> well<00:00:25.830> so

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.280 
other peoples effects as well so

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.840 
other peoples effects as well so
accelerometer<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.390> small<00:00:28.110> piece<00:00:28.440> of

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
accelerometer is a small piece of

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.630 
accelerometer is a small piece of
silicon<00:00:29.850> it's<00:00:30.540> machine<00:00:31.020> silicon<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.550> on

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
silicon it's machine silicon so it's on

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.389 
silicon it's machine silicon so it's on
a<00:00:32.669> very<00:00:32.910> small<00:00:32.969> scale<00:00:33.649> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.800> picture<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
a very small scale you can picture a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.869 
a very small scale you can picture a
little<00:00:35.760> plate<00:00:36.359> sitting<00:00:37.260> above<00:00:37.710> another<00:00:38.579> plate

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
little plate sitting above another plate

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.540 
little plate sitting above another plate
and<00:00:39.179> then<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.409> you<00:00:40.859> move<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> thing<00:00:41.280> around

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and then as you move the thing around

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.549 
and then as you move the thing around
there's<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.690> sitting<00:00:42.929> on<00:00:43.019> little<00:00:43.109> silicon

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
there's it's sitting on little silicon

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.529 
there's it's sitting on little silicon
Springs<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.249> it<00:00:44.670> actually<00:00:44.789> moves<00:00:45.089> back<00:00:45.359> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
Springs and it actually moves back and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.119 
Springs and it actually moves back and
forth<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.499> it's<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.679> same<00:00:46.859> thing<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.069> you

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
forth so it's the same thing if you

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.470 
forth so it's the same thing if you
tilted<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.640> way<00:00:47.819> the<00:00:48.059> thing<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.329> move

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
tilted it this way the thing we move

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.299 
tilted it this way the thing we move
this<00:00:48.659> way<00:00:48.839> we<00:00:49.379> tilted<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.920> way<00:00:50.069> to<00:00:50.129> move

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
this way we tilted it this way to move

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.829 
this way we tilted it this way to move
that<00:00:50.489> way<00:00:50.640> or<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.179> you<00:00:51.269> shake<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.719> going

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
that way or if you shake if it's going

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.349 
that way or if you shake if it's going
to<00:00:51.899> move<00:00:51.989> back<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.199> forth<00:00:52.409> and<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:54.030> piece<00:00:54.179> of

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
to move back and forth and the piece of

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.540 
to move back and forth and the piece of
silicon<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.870> sensed<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.859> relative

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
silicon are sensed the relative

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.729 
silicon are sensed the relative
positions<00:00:56.999> are<00:00:57.149> sensed<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.409> can<00:00:58.559> tell

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
positions are sensed and you can tell

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.079 
positions are sensed and you can tell
how<00:00:58.890> much<00:00:59.039> motion<00:00:59.249> there<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.579> based<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.969> how

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
how much motion there is based on how

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.049 
how much motion there is based on how
it's<00:01:00.269> moving<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:02.010> there's<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:02.370> for<00:01:02.639> three

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
it's moving and so there's one for three

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.479 
it's moving and so there's one for three
x<00:01:03.210> axis<00:01:03.719> accelerometer<00:01:04.190> there's<00:01:05.190> one<00:01:05.370> going

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
x axis accelerometer there's one going

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.429 
x axis accelerometer there's one going
this<00:01:05.729> way<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.780> way<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.140> one

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
this way one going this way and one

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.830 
this way one going this way and one
going<00:01:07.469> this<00:01:07.890> way<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.820> X<00:01:09.060> direction<00:01:09.600> which<00:01:09.719> is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
going this way the X direction which is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.260 
going this way the X direction which is
the<00:01:09.990> one<00:01:10.259> we<00:01:10.380> use<00:01:10.409> usually<00:01:10.950> by<00:01:11.070> default<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the one we use usually by default is the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.030 
the one we use usually by default is the
one<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.509> goes<00:01:12.659> along<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.590> arm<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.979> this

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
one that goes along your arm like this

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.139 
one that goes along your arm like this
and<00:01:14.840> in<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.049> sort<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> direction<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.909> any

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
and in this sort of direction so any

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.480 
and in this sort of direction so any
motion<00:01:18.659> or<00:01:18.899> any<00:01:19.500> tilting<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.310> direction

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
motion or any tilting in that direction

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.469 
motion or any tilting in that direction
is<00:01:20.969> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.810> affect<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> signal<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
is going to affect the signal and

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.520 
is going to affect the signal and
accelerometer<00:01:24.479> extensions<00:01:24.780> acceleration<00:01:25.320> so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
accelerometer extensions acceleration so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.859 
accelerometer extensions acceleration so
by<00:01:25.770> tilting<00:01:26.670> you're<00:01:27.149> just<00:01:27.360> getting<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> force

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
by tilting you're just getting the force

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.870 
by tilting you're just getting the force
of<00:01:28.020> gravity<00:01:28.350> which<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.530> an<00:01:28.979> acceleration<00:01:29.399> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
of gravity which is an acceleration the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.209 
of gravity which is an acceleration the
acceleration<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.659> gravity<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:32.070> you'll

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
acceleration of gravity and so you'll

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:37.450 
acceleration of gravity and so you'll
get<00:01:32.369> sort<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.880> set<00:01:33.630> level<00:01:33.869> by<00:01:34.109> doing<00:01:34.350> that

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.670 

but<00:01:38.460> also<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.789> can<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.149> move<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.680> sorrowing

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
but also I can just move the sorrowing

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.109 
but also I can just move the sorrowing
along<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.250> direction<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.850> I'll<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
along that direction and I'll get a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.320 
along that direction and I'll get a
responsible<00:01:42.600> Oh

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.310 

and<00:01:46.480> now<00:01:46.570> it<00:01:46.659> doesn't<00:01:46.870> matter<00:01:46.990> how<00:01:47.200> I'm

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
and now it doesn't matter how I'm

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.660 
and now it doesn't matter how I'm
holding<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.680> rig's<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:48.130> could<00:01:48.310> from<00:01:48.430> still

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
holding the rig's I could from still

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.280 
holding the rig's I could from still
moving<00:01:48.940> that<00:01:49.060> direction<00:01:49.390> it's<00:01:49.900> gonna<00:01:50.050> have

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
moving that direction it's gonna have

00:01:50.290 --> 00:02:00.780 
moving that direction it's gonna have
the<00:01:50.380> same<00:01:50.530> effect<00:01:59.010> y-axis<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.220> ring<00:02:00.400> goes<00:02:00.610> in

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
the same effect y-axis the ring goes in

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.150 
the same effect y-axis the ring goes in
this<00:02:00.909> direction<00:02:01.090> here<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:02.470> now<00:02:02.619> I<00:02:02.650> can<00:02:02.950> get<00:02:03.010> the

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
this direction here so now I can get the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.920 
this direction here so now I can get the
same<00:02:03.340> effect<00:02:03.640> that's<00:02:04.119> getting<00:02:04.300> on<00:02:04.360> X<00:02:04.600> but<00:02:04.810> by

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
same effect that's getting on X but by

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.050 
same effect that's getting on X but by
turning<00:02:04.990> my<00:02:05.320> hand<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.619> do<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:05.860> way<00:02:06.070> this<00:02:06.790> way

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
turning my hand you do this way this way

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.029 
turning my hand you do this way this way
we're<00:02:07.420> moving<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:07.990> way

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
we're moving it this way

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.210 
we're moving it this way

little<00:04:47.090> bit<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.480> need<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.660> be<00:04:47.720> able<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:47.900> change

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
little bit you need to be able to change

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.990 
little bit you need to be able to change
the<00:04:48.290> response<00:04:48.620> of<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.830> ring<00:04:49.010> so<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:49.790> get<00:04:49.910> the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
the response of the ring so you get the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.130 
the response of the ring so you get the
full<00:04:50.120> range<00:04:50.360> of<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.600> thing<00:04:50.750> you're<00:04:50.840> plugging

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
full range of the thing you're plugging

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.960 
full range of the thing you're plugging
it<00:04:51.230> into<00:04:51.350> so<00:04:52.190> that's<00:04:52.310> why<00:04:52.430> we<00:04:52.580> have<00:04:52.670> these<00:04:52.790> two

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
it into so that's why we have these two

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.570 
it into so that's why we have these two
knobs<00:04:53.150> here<00:04:53.420> the<00:04:53.870> depth<00:04:54.110> is<00:04:54.290> basically<00:04:54.680> how

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
knobs here the depth is basically how

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.220 
knobs here the depth is basically how
much<00:04:55.760> range<00:04:56.090> there<00:04:56.330> is<00:04:56.480> on<00:04:56.870> what<00:04:57.080> you're<00:04:57.200> doing

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
much range there is on what you're doing

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.100 
much range there is on what you're doing
and<00:04:57.940> smoothing<00:04:58.940> is<00:04:59.090> filtering<00:04:59.660> out<00:04:59.840> all<00:04:59.870> the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
and smoothing is filtering out all the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.690 
and smoothing is filtering out all the
fast<00:05:00.350> stuff<00:05:00.620> so<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:00.920> doesn't<00:05:01.190> sound<00:05:01.310> like<00:05:01.520> it's

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
fast stuff so it doesn't sound like it's

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.810 
fast stuff so it doesn't sound like it's
too<00:05:02.030> jittery<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.540> jumpy

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
too jittery and jumpy

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.420 
too jittery and jumpy

your<00:05:51.520> computer<00:05:51.849> it's<00:05:51.969> going<00:05:52.000> to<00:05:52.150> look<00:05:52.240> like<00:05:52.419> a

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
your computer it's going to look like a

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.659 
your computer it's going to look like a
MIDI<00:05:52.689> input<00:05:53.020> port<00:05:53.349> then<00:05:54.099> it<00:05:54.219> also<00:05:54.340> comes<00:05:54.550> with

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
MIDI input port then it also comes with

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.040 
MIDI input port then it also comes with
a<00:05:54.759> piece<00:05:54.879> of<00:05:54.909> software<00:05:55.330> where<00:05:55.599> you<00:05:55.659> can<00:05:55.750> tune

a piece of software where you can tune
all<00:05:56.229> the<00:05:56.349> signals<00:05:56.710> and<00:05:57.210> and<00:05:58.210> set<00:05:58.779> up<00:05:58.900> a<00:05:59.020> bunch

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 
all the signals and and set up a bunch

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.330 
all the signals and and set up a bunch
of<00:05:59.289> different<00:05:59.560> scenes<00:05:59.710> that<00:05:59.919> you<00:06:00.009> can<00:06:00.129> use<00:06:00.250> to

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
of different scenes that you can use to

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.760 
of different scenes that you can use to
control<00:06:00.580> something<00:06:00.849> like<00:06:00.969> Ableton<00:06:01.810> or<00:06:02.169> logic

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
control something like Ableton or logic

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.610 
control something like Ableton or logic
or<00:06:03.580> reason<00:06:04.000> there's<00:06:04.629> all<00:06:04.750> sorts<00:06:05.020> of<00:06:05.110> equipment

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
or reason there's all sorts of equipment

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.659 
or reason there's all sorts of equipment
that<00:06:05.919> uses<00:06:06.159> MIDI<00:06:06.490> as<00:06:06.789> a<00:06:07.509> control<00:06:08.259> protocol<00:06:08.770> so

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
that uses MIDI as a control protocol so

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.249 
that uses MIDI as a control protocol so
if<00:06:09.789> you<00:06:09.909> want<00:06:10.029> to<00:06:10.120> use<00:06:10.210> it<00:06:10.330> with<00:06:10.479> lighting

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
if you want to use it with lighting

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.200 
if you want to use it with lighting
we've<00:06:11.409> had<00:06:11.529> some<00:06:11.680> guys<00:06:11.830> to<00:06:12.009> that<00:06:12.189> hooking<00:06:13.120> up

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
we've had some guys to that hooking up

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.540 
we've had some guys to that hooking up
synthesizers<00:06:13.900> and<00:06:13.960> things<00:06:14.199> like<00:06:14.349> that<00:06:14.590> it's

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
synthesizers and things like that it's

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.999

for the audience sometimes so I mean the
hot<00:06:27.159> hands<00:06:27.339> going<00:06:27.490> to<00:06:27.580> give<00:06:27.699> you<00:06:27.759> the<00:06:27.849> ability

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
hot hands going to give you the ability

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.719
