00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:23.439 
to arbitrate second was the absolute

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:59.070 
to arbitrate second was the absolute
importance<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:29.730> which<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:30.879> more<00:03:31.060> than

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
the feature is when the answer choice

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:48.110 
the feature is when the answer choice
that<00:04:31.490> we're<00:04:31.610> sparring

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.820

I think the opportunity to make over

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.780 
I think the opportunity to make over
here<00:04:54.690> today<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.500> Pierre<00:04:55.830> respected<00:04:56.490> people
