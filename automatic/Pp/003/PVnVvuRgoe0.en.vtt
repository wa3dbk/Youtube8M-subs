Dream series around that age so I

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.170 
Dream series around that age so I

this<00:00:21.270> modification<00:00:21.630> 20<00:00:22.380> years<00:00:22.619> ago<00:00:22.769> but<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.519> can

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
this modification 20 years ago but I can

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.839 
this modification 20 years ago but I can
still<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.990> battery<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.670> there

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
still get the battery that it's in there

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.790 
still get the battery that it's in there
today<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.960> thought<00:00:28.230> I'll<00:00:28.349> show<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
today so I thought I'll show you the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.540 
today so I thought I'll show you the
qualification<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> bracket<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.369> hold<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
qualification so the bracket to hold the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.030 
qualification so the bracket to hold the
battery<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.079> bottom<00:00:34.410> break<00:00:34.559> here<00:00:34.829> we

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
battery in is this bottom break here we

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.040 
battery in is this bottom break here we
didn't<00:00:35.280> modify<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.420> had<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> respray

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
didn't modify that it's had a respray

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.450 
didn't modify that it's had a respray
doesn't<00:00:37.559> quite<00:00:37.680> match<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.920> frame<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.399> you

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
doesn't quite match the frame but you

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.700 
doesn't quite match the frame but you
don't<00:00:38.610> see<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.850> anyway<00:00:39.469> there's<00:00:40.469> an<00:00:40.590> earth

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
don't see it anyway there's an earth

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.000 
don't see it anyway there's an earth
strap<00:00:41.040> put<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.989> which<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.020> braaap<00:00:43.739> cut

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
strap put on here which is braaap cut

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.260 
strap put on here which is braaap cut
brass<00:00:45.440> wrapped<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.559> heat<00:00:46.739> shrink<00:00:47.090> and<00:00:48.090> just

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
brass wrapped in heat shrink and just

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.720 
brass wrapped in heat shrink and just
bolt<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.750> bottom<00:00:49.710> bracket<00:00:49.800> there<00:00:50.190> on

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
bolt it to the bottom bracket there on

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.619 
bolt it to the bottom bracket there on
this<00:00:51.239> side<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:51.780> would<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:53.090> a<00:00:54.090> positive

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
this side we just would be a positive

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.970 
this side we just would be a positive
connection<00:00:55.699> a<00:00:56.699> bit<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.390> thick<00:00:58.079> Padma<00:00:58.469> prevent

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
connection a bit of thick Padma prevent

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 
connection a bit of thick Padma prevent
around<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.719> sit<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
around so that that can sit on the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.270 
around so that that can sit on the
battery<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:03.420> top<00:01:03.600> bracket<00:01:04.070> we<00:01:05.070> did

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
battery there the top bracket we did

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.770 
battery there the top bracket we did
have<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.519> modify<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.180> had<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.360> work<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
have to modify so we had to work out the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.990 
have to modify so we had to work out the
maximum<00:01:07.200> allowable<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:08.430> could<00:01:08.610> raise<00:01:08.790> this

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
maximum allowable we could raise this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.690 
maximum allowable we could raise this
top<00:01:09.270> bracket<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> still<00:01:10.920> fit<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> case<00:01:11.460> on

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
top bracket so to still fit the case on

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.740 
top bracket so to still fit the case on
the<00:01:11.970> cabin<00:01:13.850> just<00:01:14.850> being<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> cover<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the cabin just being the cover and so

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.179 
the cabin just being the cover and so
you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.930> see<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.650> think<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.100> just

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
you can see that I think it's just

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.149 
you can see that I think it's just
silver<00:01:20.850> solder<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.450> bronze<00:01:21.900> probably<00:01:22.680> bronzed

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
silver solder or bronze probably bronzed

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.660 
silver solder or bronze probably bronzed
I<00:01:23.280> would<00:01:23.430> say<00:01:23.720> from<00:01:24.720> memory<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.770> we've<00:01:26.280> cut<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
I would say from memory so we've cut the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.649 
I would say from memory so we've cut the
original<00:01:27.320> cut<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> original<00:01:28.770> brackets<00:01:29.130> off

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
original cut the original brackets off

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.050 
original cut the original brackets off
on<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:30.840> side<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.310> we've<00:01:32.310> bronzed<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.850> this

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
on one side but we've bronzed on this

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.170 
on one side but we've bronzed on this
extension<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.079> same<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> other<00:01:34.560> side

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
extension and the same on the other side

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.780 
extension and the same on the other side
this<00:01:36.180> will<00:01:36.450> Gnaeus<00:01:36.750> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
this will Gnaeus it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:50.590 
this will Gnaeus it
but<00:01:39.120> if<00:01:39.920> TLC

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.520 

so<00:01:54.220> of<00:01:55.220> course<00:01:55.370> you<00:01:55.520> bolt<00:01:55.729> it<00:01:55.850> all<00:01:55.940> at<00:01:56.530> the

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
so of course you bolt it all at the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.270 
so of course you bolt it all at the
Weizmann<00:01:58.010> it's<00:01:58.190> for<00:01:58.400> this<00:01:58.520> course<00:01:58.760> and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
Weizmann it's for this course and

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:15.870 
Weizmann it's for this course and
there's<00:02:01.280> enough<00:02:01.520> room<00:02:01.550> over<00:02:03.670> on<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:07.160> battery

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.410 

that<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:16.940> used<00:02:19.570> us<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.800> YB<00:02:21.800> 16<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.400> L<00:02:22.580> -<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.940> -<00:02:22.970> this
