00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
electrode pixel and then that because I

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.539 
electrode pixel and then that because I
don't<00:03:41.799> want<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.310> other<00:03:42.459> way<00:03:44.370> don't<00:03:45.370> put

that<00:03:45.700> there<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.569> we<00:03:46.629> also<00:03:46.870> have<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.170> space<00:03:47.530> I

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
that there and we also have a space I

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.580 
that there and we also have a space I
don't<00:03:47.830> really<00:03:48.280> like<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:48.970> wish<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.959> was<00:03:50.079> a<00:03:50.140> Nixle

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
don't really like I wish I was a Nixle

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.550 
don't really like I wish I was a Nixle
with<00:03:50.739> that<00:03:50.950> with<00:03:51.370> one<00:03:51.610> by<00:03:51.819> one<00:03:52.260> piece<00:03:53.260> that

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
with that with one by one piece that

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.670 
with that with one by one piece that
doesn't<00:03:53.739> have<00:03:53.860> any<00:03:54.099> buds<00:03:54.370> on<00:03:54.610> it<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:55.379> next<00:03:56.379> we

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
doesn't have any buds on it and next we

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:04.800 
doesn't have any buds on it and next we
have<00:03:56.709> his<00:03:57.310> hands<00:03:59.519> and<00:04:01.140> that<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:03.819> just<00:04:04.660> like

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
have his hands and that and just like

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.220 
have his hands and that and just like
the<00:04:04.959> infra<00:04:05.290> knights<00:04:05.440> have<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.549> put<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.819> ear<00:04:08.280> so

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
the infra knights have to put the ear so

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.930 
the infra knights have to put the ear so
so<00:04:11.230> far<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:11.680> should<00:04:11.859> get<00:04:12.190> something<00:04:12.760> like

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
so far you should get something like

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.349 
so far you should get something like
this<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.810> then<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.560> have<00:04:17.769> one<00:04:18.039> the<00:04:18.459> faces<00:04:18.910> and

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
this and then you have one the faces and

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.490 
this and then you have one the faces and
of<00:04:19.959> course<00:04:20.229> his<00:04:20.919> hand<00:04:21.250> is<00:04:21.459> too<00:04:22.030> short<00:04:22.389> if<00:04:23.289> you

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
of course his hand is too short if you

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.270 
of course his hand is too short if you
just<00:04:24.690> want<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.750> do<00:04:25.930> like<00:04:25.960> this<00:04:26.350> you<00:04:26.650> cut<00:04:26.860> up

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
just want to do like this you cut up

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.730 
just want to do like this you cut up
I'll<00:04:27.760> rather<00:04:28.479> have<00:04:29.220> these<00:04:30.220> pieces<00:04:30.910> from<00:04:31.240> the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
I'll rather have these pieces from the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.440 
I'll rather have these pieces from the
inference<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:33.010> so<00:04:33.270> works

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
inference it so works

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.149 
inference it so works
Wow<00:04:35.260> now<00:04:36.250> such<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.580> video

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:58.469 
that way he looks his hand looks way and

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:02.209 
that way he looks his hand looks way and
there<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.770> can<00:04:58.830> actually<00:04:59.159> spin<00:04:59.460> it
