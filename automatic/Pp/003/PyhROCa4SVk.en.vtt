and<00:03:14.700> it's<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.420> very<00:03:15.599> small<00:03:15.719> galley<00:03:16.379> when<00:03:16.859> I

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
and it's a very small galley when I

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.839 
and it's a very small galley when I
rebuild<00:03:17.579> this<00:03:17.849> is<00:03:18.090> going<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.299> be<00:03:18.359> a<00:03:18.390> lot<00:03:18.569> bigger

desa my intention now down here is the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.589 
desa my intention now down here is the
engine<00:03:25.079> room<00:03:25.500> now<00:03:26.099> it's<00:03:26.400> not<00:03:26.640> exactly<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.269> an

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
engine room now it's not exactly like an

engine room now it's not exactly like an
engine<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.439> mean<00:03:28.709> it's<00:03:28.859> not<00:03:28.950> like<00:03:29.099> you<00:03:29.549> can<00:03:29.670> see

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
engine I mean it's not like you can see

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.270 
engine I mean it's not like you can see
the<00:03:29.909> Pistons<00:03:30.390> or<00:03:30.689> the<00:03:31.170> manifold<00:03:31.680> or<00:03:31.950> anything

moving upwards a lifeboat system and the
lifeboat<00:03:57.299> actually<00:03:57.659> does<00:03:57.870> work<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.620> just<00:03:58.950> it

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
stair case yet this is like free flights

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.360 
stair case yet this is like free flights
of<00:05:19.590> stairs<00:05:20.039> people<00:05:20.940> have<00:05:21.180> to<00:05:21.389> go<00:05:21.570> up<00:05:22.370> that's

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
of stairs people have to go up that's

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.310 
of stairs people have to go up that's
going<00:05:23.639> to<00:05:23.729> be<00:05:23.760> all<00:05:23.909> rebuilt<00:05:24.360> as<00:05:24.570> well<00:05:24.840> and

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
going to be all rebuilt as well and

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.450 
going to be all rebuilt as well and
there<00:05:27.229> and<00:05:28.229> this<00:05:28.409> actually<00:05:28.590> doesn't<00:05:28.889> same<00:05:29.310> on

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
there and this actually doesn't same on

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.600 
there and this actually doesn't same on
the<00:05:29.550> other<00:05:29.580> side<00:05:30.000> as<00:05:30.599> well<00:05:30.990> as<00:05:31.380> we<00:05:31.979> could<00:05:32.130> see

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
the other side as well as we could see

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.010 
the other side as well as we could see
this<00:05:33.510> shifter<00:05:34.080> will<00:05:34.500> narrow<00:05:35.810> now<00:05:36.810> this<00:05:36.960> is

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
this shifter will narrow now this is

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.250 
this shifter will narrow now this is
what<00:05:37.200> I'm<00:05:37.260> saying<00:05:37.289> about<00:05:37.800> how<00:05:39.020> it's<00:05:40.020> just

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
what I'm saying about how it's just

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.649 
what I'm saying about how it's just
getting<00:05:40.440> light<00:05:40.800> there's<00:05:41.130> not<00:05:41.279> enough<00:05:41.659> support

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
getting light there's not enough support

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.110 
getting light there's not enough support
down<00:05:43.139> there<00:05:43.469> so<00:05:43.800> my<00:05:44.310> finger<00:05:44.669> down<00:05:44.820> there<00:05:44.880> and

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
down there so my finger down there and

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.709 
down there so my finger down there and
it<00:05:45.450> will<00:05:45.570> just<00:05:45.690> go<00:05:46.139> like<00:05:46.680> that<00:05:46.979> but<00:05:47.969> take<00:05:48.599> this

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
it will just go like that but take this

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.860 
it will just go like that but take this
out<00:05:48.930> and<00:05:49.460> I've<00:05:50.460> actually<00:05:50.669> look<00:05:51.000> like<00:05:51.029> a<00:05:51.630> little

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
out and I've actually look like a little

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.640 
out and I've actually look like a little
smoking<00:05:52.800> lounge<00:05:53.070> down<00:05:53.580> here<00:05:53.990> yeah<00:05:54.990> a<00:05:55.260> little

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
smoking lounge down here yeah a little

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.709 
smoking lounge down here yeah a little
worm<00:05:55.860> is<00:05:56.669> a<00:05:56.849> little<00:05:57.150> quiet<00:05:57.599> area<00:05:58.729> that<00:05:59.729> back<00:06:00.300> I

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
worm is a little quiet area that back I

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:04.940 
worm is a little quiet area that back I
may<00:06:01.200> not<00:06:01.289> be<00:06:01.409> the<00:06:01.529> best<00:06:01.950> but<00:06:02.340> I<00:06:03.409> am<00:06:04.409> going<00:06:04.860> to

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
may not be the best but I am going to

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.940 
may not be the best but I am going to
start<00:06:05.190> redoing<00:06:05.909> this<00:06:06.300> and

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
start redoing this and

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.120 
start redoing this and
proper<00:06:07.910> air<00:06:08.030> en<00:06:08.090> little<00:06:08.960> more<00:06:09.170> strong<00:06:09.530> some

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
proper air en little more strong some

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.970 
proper air en little more strong some
just<00:06:10.370> move<00:06:10.580> right<00:06:11.030> this<00:06:11.960> is<00:06:12.080> the<00:06:12.110> back<00:06:12.500> of<00:06:12.860> the

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:12.980 
just move right this is the back of the

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.970 
just move right this is the back of the
boat<00:06:13.750> now<00:06:14.750> the<00:06:14.810> rudder<00:06:15.140> in<00:06:15.380> that<00:06:15.620> if<00:06:15.800> you're

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
boat now the rudder in that if you're

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.010 
boat now the rudder in that if you're
wondering<00:06:16.250> where<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:17.150> propellers<00:06:17.750> are

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
wondering where the propellers are

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.130 
wondering where the propellers are
they're<00:06:18.680> too<00:06:19.010> big<00:06:19.430> on<00:06:20.390> but<00:06:21.230> these<00:06:21.950> here<00:06:23.140> would

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
they're too big on but these here would

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.960 
they're too big on but these here would
be<00:06:24.170> the<00:06:24.590> propellers<00:06:25.160> this<00:06:25.490> is<00:06:25.610> actually<00:06:25.880> one

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
be the propellers this is actually one

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.990 
be the propellers this is actually one
of<00:06:26.030> the<00:06:26.140> pair<00:06:27.140> shafts<00:06:27.890> that<00:06:28.100> actually<00:06:28.490> goes<00:06:28.730> on

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
of the pair shafts that actually goes on

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.750 
of the pair shafts that actually goes on
the<00:06:29.650> on<00:06:30.650> the<00:06:31.000> port<00:06:32.000> side<00:06:32.950> which<00:06:33.950> is<00:06:33.980> the<00:06:34.190> left

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
the on the port side which is the left

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.870 
the on the port side which is the left
side<00:06:34.940> of<00:06:34.970> the<00:06:35.120> boat<00:06:37.780> the<00:06:38.780> right<00:06:39.470> one<00:06:39.740> is<00:06:40.010> just

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
side of the boat the right one is just

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.280 
side of the boat the right one is just
over<00:06:41.510> there<00:06:43.300> so<00:06:44.920> this<00:06:45.920> is<00:06:45.950> pretty<00:06:46.250> much

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
over there so this is pretty much

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.070 
over there so this is pretty much
next<00:06:48.290> time<00:06:48.470> when<00:06:48.710> you<00:06:48.740> see<00:06:49.130> this<00:06:49.340> when<00:06:49.970> I

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
next time when you see this when I

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.140 
next time when you see this when I
finish<00:06:51.080> it<00:06:51.290> properly<00:06:51.770> it's<00:06:52.550> all<00:06:52.880> going<00:06:53.060> to<00:06:53.090> be

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
finish it properly it's all going to be

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.730 
finish it properly it's all going to be
redone<00:06:53.780> and<00:06:54.170> there's<00:06:55.130> going<00:06:55.280> to<00:06:55.340> be<00:06:56.710> much<00:06:57.710> more

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
redone and there's going to be much more

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.370 
redone and there's going to be much more
it's<00:06:58.130> gonna<00:06:58.190> be<00:06:58.340> much<00:06:58.460> more<00:06:58.610> stronger<00:06:59.380> there's

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 
it's gonna be much more stronger there's

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.990 
it's gonna be much more stronger there's
gonna<00:07:00.470> be<00:07:00.590> a<00:07:00.620> lot<00:07:00.710> more<00:07:00.770> support<00:07:01.400> going<00:07:01.700> into

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 
gonna be a lot more support going into

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.120 
gonna be a lot more support going into
it<00:07:02.240> and<00:07:02.720> there's<00:07:03.260> going<00:07:03.530> to<00:07:03.590> be<00:07:03.620> more<00:07:03.860> more

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.130 
it and there's going to be more more

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:11.470 
it and there's going to be more more
rooms<00:07:06.280> and<00:07:07.280> xander<00:07:07.880> a<00:07:09.310> lot<00:07:10.310> more<00:07:10.520> stuff<00:07:11.300> to

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480 
rooms and xander a lot more stuff to

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.540 
rooms and xander a lot more stuff to
show<00:07:11.780> but<00:07:12.200> really<00:07:13.330> this<00:07:14.330> is<00:07:14.540> it<00:07:14.720> and<00:07:14.960> now<00:07:15.550> this

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
show but really this is it and now this

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.850 
show but really this is it and now this
has<00:07:16.730> pretty<00:07:16.880> much<00:07:17.000> last<00:07:17.420> time<00:07:17.710> it's<00:07:18.710> gonna

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
has pretty much last time it's gonna

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.490 
has pretty much last time it's gonna
look<00:07:19.700> like<00:07:19.910> that<00:07:20.180> on<00:07:20.420> the<00:07:20.510> inside<00:07:21.020> the<00:07:21.290> last

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.500 
look like that on the inside the last

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.520 
look like that on the inside the last
time<00:07:21.830> it's<00:07:22.100> going<00:07:22.220> to<00:07:22.310> Cronk<00:07:23.120> all<00:07:23.270> up<00:07:23.480> and<00:07:23.780> fall

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:24.530 
time it's going to Cronk all up and fall

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.180 
time it's going to Cronk all up and fall
to<00:07:24.740> bits<00:07:24.980> and<00:07:25.840> there<00:07:26.840> was<00:07:27.500> going<00:07:27.650> to<00:07:27.740> be<00:07:27.770> redone

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.190 
to bits and there was going to be redone

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.190 
to bits and there was going to be redone
it's<00:07:28.430> going<00:07:28.550> to<00:07:28.610> be<00:07:28.670> turned<00:07:29.240> upon<00:07:29.540> have<00:07:29.990> a<00:07:30.020> lot

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:30.200 
it's going to be turned upon have a lot

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.290 
it's going to be turned upon have a lot
better<00:07:30.380> all<00:07:30.650> the<00:07:30.680> plans<00:07:30.980> of<00:07:31.370> what<00:07:31.700> is<00:07:31.910> going<00:07:32.270> to

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300 
better all the plans of what is going to

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.720 
better all the plans of what is going to
happen<00:07:32.780> but<00:07:33.470> obviously<00:07:34.040> throughout<00:07:34.580> the

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:34.730 
happen but obviously throughout the

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.660 
happen but obviously throughout the
creativity<00:07:35.090> and<00:07:35.720> then<00:07:36.560> maybe<00:07:37.040> chanterelle

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:37.670 
creativity and then maybe chanterelle

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.290 
creativity and then maybe chanterelle
might<00:07:38.330> change<00:07:38.660> the<00:07:38.930> design<00:07:39.110> or<00:07:40.270> automate<00:07:41.270> a

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.300 
might change the design or automate a

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.550 
might change the design or automate a
few<00:07:41.570> things<00:07:41.870> I<00:07:42.320> don't<00:07:42.590> know<00:07:43.450> now<00:07:44.450> i'm<00:07:44.720> still<00:07:45.140> in

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 
few things I don't know now i'm still in

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.490 
few things I don't know now i'm still in
the<00:07:46.010> drawing<00:07:46.460> session<00:07:47.030> i<00:07:47.270> probably<00:07:48.050> won't

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:48.500
