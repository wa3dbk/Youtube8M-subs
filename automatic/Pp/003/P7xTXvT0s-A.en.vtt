more<00:00:24.060> interesting<00:00:24.869> from<00:00:25.230> now<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.269> then<00:00:27.269> of

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
more interesting from now on and then of

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.570 
more interesting from now on and then of
course<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:28.080> main<00:00:28.289> reason<00:00:28.859> why<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.220> are<00:00:29.250> here

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
course the main reason why we are here

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.450 
course the main reason why we are here
is<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.240> learn<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.720> little<00:00:30.960> bit<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.320> HTML<00:00:32.070> so

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
is to learn a little bit of HTML so

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.819 
is to learn a little bit of HTML so
let's<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:32.969> back<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.360> our<00:00:33.390> HTML<00:00:34.050> tutorial<00:00:34.620> and

links<00:00:42.210> are<00:00:42.329> quite<00:00:42.510> cool<00:00:42.780> because<00:00:43.410> they<00:00:43.770> allow

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
links are quite cool because they allow

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.880 
links are quite cool because they allow
us<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.370> travel<00:00:44.610> between<00:00:44.969> different<00:00:45.329> web<00:00:45.660> pages

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
us to travel between different web pages

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
quickly with a simple click and then we

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.319 
quickly with a simple click and then we
don't<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.620> type<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.070> URL<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.120> top

next page so you know imagine going to a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
next page so you know imagine going to a
website<00:01:03.210> where<00:01:03.600> they<00:01:03.780> didn't<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.080> any<00:01:04.320> links

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710

website where they didn't have any links
at<00:01:04.890> all<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> mean<00:01:05.489> how<00:01:05.640> boring<00:01:06.299> would<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.689> be

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
at all I mean how boring would that be

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.960 
at all I mean how boring would that be
like<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.530> mean<00:01:07.799> you'd<00:01:07.950> go<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> web<00:01:08.430> page<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
like I mean you'd go to the web page and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.910 
like I mean you'd go to the web page and
it<00:01:09.780> would<00:01:10.020> kind<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.350> look<00:01:10.530> something<00:01:10.890> like

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
it would kind of look something like

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.100 
it would kind of look something like
this<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:12.150> stuck<00:01:12.450> staring<00:01:12.990> at

greatest<00:01:19.229> web<00:01:19.530> page<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> world<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.549> let's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
greatest web page in the world so let's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.980 
greatest web page in the world so let's
go<00:01:21.030> ahead<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.540> make<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.290> link<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
go ahead and make a link and to do that

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.830 
go ahead and make a link and to do that
we<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.650> use<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.369> called<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.330> anchor

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
we have to use what is called the anchor

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.550 
we have to use what is called the anchor
tag<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.720> go<00:01:30.840> ahead<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.259> use<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
tag so you have to go ahead and use a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.990 
tag so you have to go ahead and use a
smaller<00:01:31.979> than<00:01:32.100> greater<00:01:32.369> than<00:01:32.430> salon<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
smaller than greater than salon and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.620 
smaller than greater than salon and
inside<00:01:33.659> there<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.350> keyword<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.630> for

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
inside there the keyword is just a for

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.950 
inside there the keyword is just a for
anchor<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:38.729> pretty<00:01:38.909> cool<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.299> then<00:01:39.810> to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
anchor so that's pretty cool and then to

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.460 
anchor so that's pretty cool and then to
end<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.200> off<00:01:40.320> obviously<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.100> /a<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.470> there

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
end it off obviously just /a and there

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.950 
end it off obviously just /a and there
we<00:01:43.560> go<00:01:43.770> anything<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.579> between<00:01:44.820> these<00:01:45.299> two<00:01:45.570> tags

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
we go anything in between these two tags

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.999 
we go anything in between these two tags
over<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.649> will<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> link<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.649> I'm<00:01:49.649> just

it's<00:02:13.450> highlighting<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.230> text<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:15.370> that's<00:02:15.550> not

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
it's highlighting the text so that's not

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.030 
it's highlighting the text so that's not
exactly<00:02:15.760> what<00:02:16.210> we<00:02:16.330> were<00:02:16.390> after<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:17.040> that's

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
exactly what we were after and that's

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.400 
exactly what we were after and that's
because<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:18.820> left<00:02:19.060> out<00:02:19.300> one<00:02:19.330> thing<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.020> I<00:02:20.260> left

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
because I left out one thing and I left

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.650 
because I left out one thing and I left
it<00:02:20.560> out<00:02:20.650> on<00:02:20.680> purpose<00:02:21.040> just<00:02:21.460> so<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.540> guys

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
it out on purpose just so that you guys

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.090 
it out on purpose just so that you guys
remember<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.410> little<00:02:23.590> bit<00:02:23.680> better<00:02:23.830> and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
remember this a little bit better and

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.810 
remember this a little bit better and
that<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.420> when<00:02:25.600> we<00:02:25.630> use<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.990> link

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
that is that when we use a link

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.080 
that is that when we use a link
it<00:02:27.820> also<00:02:27.970> requires<00:02:28.540> one<00:02:29.170> attribute<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:30.160> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
it also requires one attribute and the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.980 
it also requires one attribute and the
attribute<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:32.080> link<00:02:32.470> requires<00:02:32.920> is<00:02:33.280> called

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
attribute that a link requires is called

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.550 
attribute that a link requires is called
href<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.730> stands<00:02:37.090> for<00:02:37.560> hypertext

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
href and that stands for hypertext

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.660 
href and that stands for hypertext
reference<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:40.710> we<00:02:41.710> actually<00:02:41.860> have<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.430> set

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
reference and we actually have to set

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.420 
reference and we actually have to set
that<00:02:42.850> equal<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.300> something<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:44.160> what<00:02:45.160> we<00:02:45.280> do

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
that equal to something and what we do

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.940 
that equal to something and what we do
is<00:02:45.610> we<00:02:45.760> set<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.060> equal<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.050> website<00:02:47.620> which

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
is we set it equal to the website which
