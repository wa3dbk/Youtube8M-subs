00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 ok let's go to foundation this one 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.839
 framework with which we will work 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.410
 the next couple of lectures until we get to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.360
 graphic part 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.070
 foundation is responsible for basic types 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.380
 data and basic operations with which we 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.820
 face constantly in low and 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.850
 in particular on this slide you can 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 see how the foundation works with 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.789
 the numbers in the foundation figure have a class 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.090
 and nest us a bar and this is a universal class 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.309
 for storing and working with numbers of different 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.800
 types here you can see we create 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.649
 3 palette which is called may typing 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:48.239
 fleet on the back of them is a vestibule and ask them 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:50.879
 different values ​​when creating an object we 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.070
 we can specify with what value and with 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.110
 what type of number do we create this object 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.440
 In this case we work with int and jerome 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.340
 then we can do with long with the fleet 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.199
 and from the doblo in the object 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.680
 positives, he further is also not N. 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.930
 inter ns integer is not a class 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.990
 so there is no asterisk my int is 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.409
 just variable is not a pointer 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.799
 these pointers are variable too but this is not 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.049
 pointer is a primitive variable n with 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.020
 Inter is the only type definitions that 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:31.439
 there is a car replacement that happens when 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.049
 copying the program and the essence 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.790
 us using integer is that 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.439
 Depending on what your system 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.299
 32-bit or 64-bit installed 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.869
 nsf pager will be replaced by the corresponding 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.770
 int and this will avoid problems with 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.770
 compatibility 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.619
 in the first lecture I talked about what 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.110
 method and no syllable accepts only and on 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.719
 cstring and it was not entirely true 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.530
 the bottom line is that the messengers accepts any 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.360
 object if this object is nest 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.599
 ring then he will happily bring 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.459
 the content of this line on the screen 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.220
 but not a syllable can take any 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.500
 an object that is any pointer to any 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.910
 the object and if this is not our training then we 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.959
 can still pull some 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.110
 information on the screen 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.049
 any we want for this us 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.970
 you need to overwrite the detection method he 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.870
 looks like this and let's go right away 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.959
 for example, I want to do the following 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.940
 our fraction and here is the main function here 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.519
 when we finished our witchcraft 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.940
 I display the value of my fraction on the screen 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:50.260
 by calling the print method and this 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.290
 the method is here and it is in the water and it 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.620
 used slock to withdraw 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.489
 integer 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.680
 on screen i want to do the next i want 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:07.420
 so here we can use and on 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:09.430
 servants themselves and we would give him such 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.900
 construction only instead of int and jero 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.540
 as we used before i want 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.760
 display an object so i'm here 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:22.840
 I use a dog and then I will give May 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.780
 fraction to make it work i need 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.850
 write my discourse because i 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.430
 I want to bring the machines in some format 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.019
 which makes sense to me therefore I 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.560
 I will go to fraction m and create here 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.260
 method implementation 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:44.530
 This method returns n. 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:47.050
 string is called hen 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.810
 and all he does is returning 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.300
 some line by line will be 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.950
 displayed to me basically nothing 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.660
 does not interfere here to write anything it 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.080
 and will be displayed i can write 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.080
 blah 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.069
 now no matter what in my 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.310
 including recorded every time i'm you 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.220
 when I display it using 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.110
 she's a servant will be bred was of course 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.160
 same it doesn't matter much i want 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:18.370
 bring here and nsstring which contains 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.090
 correct number for this i'm on the fly 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.270
 created Majstrenko as follows 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.070
 section other string and this class 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.130
 called a class method which is called 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.040
 Stream will format string with 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.320
 formatting and here I will ask the same 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.850
 format as if i was doing it here 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:43.930
 so I just copy from they syllable 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.970
 Hizmet is a prince and and I put this one here 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.530
 the line will return a new different string which 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:53.530
 will contain a numerator value 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.720
 division symbol and denominator now me 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.000
 don't need this print because i can 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.419
 display an object using 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.669
 just calling on words and passing it to him 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.910
 this object here xcode complain 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.550
 that we don’t accept the ron method because 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.419
 that i didn't delete it from the interface and i 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.270
 I can remove it 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:17.200
 here now in my function should not 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.630
 be mistakes 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:24.729
 there is some kind of small BC syllable 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.660
 few people have not written about what 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.190
 minas doesn't work for servants because 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.180
 wrong spelling what mistakes here 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.370
 during the course of this she is with big letters and 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.640
 further name too with a capital letter 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.470
 there are three big letters noky run and 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.390
 our conclusion should be no different from 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.860
 previous but this time we 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.860
 used disclosure
