is we'll use our screwdriver here I'll
take<00:01:24.319> out<00:01:24.530> these<00:01:24.740> three<00:01:24.799> screws<00:01:27.970> as<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.960> see

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
take out these three screws as you see

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.520 
take out these three screws as you see
in<00:01:30.289> front<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.649> me<00:01:30.710> I<00:01:31.009> have<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.909> magnet<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.229> I'm

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
in front of me I have a magnet and I'm

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.279 
in front of me I have a magnet and I'm
using<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:34.039> magnet<00:01:34.520> for<00:01:34.729> two<00:01:34.850> reasons<00:01:35.289> the

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
using this magnet for two reasons the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.580 
using this magnet for two reasons the
first<00:01:36.860> reason<00:01:37.189> is<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:38.569> I<00:01:38.600> can<00:01:38.869> hold<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.229> screws

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
first reason is so I can hold the screws

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.179 
first reason is so I can hold the screws
and<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:40.849> don't<00:01:41.119> lose<00:01:41.330> them<00:01:41.569> the<00:01:42.229> second<00:01:42.679> is<00:01:42.860> that

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
and I don't lose them the second is that

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.819 
and I don't lose them the second is that
the<00:01:43.549> screws<00:01:43.909> inside<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.780> iPhone<00:01:45.110> itself<00:01:45.560> are

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
the screws inside the iPhone itself are

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.429 
the screws inside the iPhone itself are
very<00:01:46.189> small<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.599> what<00:01:47.810> I'm<00:01:47.899> going<00:01:48.079> to<00:01:48.200> do

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
very small and so what I'm going to do

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.039 
very small and so what I'm going to do
later<00:01:48.679> in<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:48.979> video<00:01:49.069> is<00:01:49.780> magnetize<00:01:50.780> the

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
later in the video is magnetize the

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.229 
later in the video is magnetize the
screwdriver<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.069> that<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:53.049> can<00:01:54.759> hold<00:01:55.759> on<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:56.119> the

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:56.239 
screwdriver so that I can hold on to the

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:58.990 
screwdriver so that I can hold on to the
screws<00:01:56.539> and<00:01:56.810> this<00:01:57.439> will<00:01:57.649> not<00:01:57.799> damage<00:01:58.039> the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
screws and this will not damage the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:17.570 
screws and this will not damage the
iPhone<00:01:59.360> in<00:01:59.479> any<00:01:59.599> way

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580
