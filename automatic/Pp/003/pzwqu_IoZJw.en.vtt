in it first of all now you can craft a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.509 
in it first of all now you can craft a
snow<00:00:23.310> cover<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.230> place<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.769> use<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.039> and

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
snow cover and place it and use it and

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.910 
snow cover and place it and use it and
yeah<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.570> pretty<00:00:27.810> cool<00:00:28.109> different<00:00:28.740> height

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
yeah it's pretty cool different height

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.470 
yeah it's pretty cool different height
levels<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.519> want<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> quickly<00:00:29.880> show<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.179> how

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
levels we want to quickly show you how

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.049 
levels we want to quickly show you how
it's<00:00:30.660> done<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.949> course<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.520> works<00:00:32.759> in

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
it's done so of course it works in

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.780 
it's done so of course it works in
survival<00:00:33.630> mode<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:34.020> well<00:00:34.340> that<00:00:35.340> quickly

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
survival mode as well that quickly

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.180 
survival mode as well that quickly
change<00:00:36.210> game<00:00:36.540> mode<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.290> see<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:38.160> have

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
change game mode so we can see we have

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.340 
change game mode so we can see we have
some<00:00:38.460> snowballs<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.780> course<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
some snowballs and of course with the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.959 
some snowballs and of course with the
snowballs<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.219> would<00:00:41.370> make<00:00:41.550> your<00:00:41.730> snow

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
snowballs you would make your snow

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.290 
snowballs you would make your snow
blocks<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.840> then<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:44.340> take<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> snow<00:00:44.940> blocks

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
blocks and then we take the snow blocks

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.619 
blocks and then we take the snow blocks
and<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:46.110> could<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.410> able<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.770> create<00:00:47.070> these

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
and you could be able to create these

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.529 
and you could be able to create these
mini<00:00:48.629> half<00:00:48.989> slabs<00:00:49.410> thing<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.239> eight<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
mini half slabs thing is and eight of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.080 
mini half slabs thing is and eight of
them<00:00:51.840> make<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.410> full<00:00:52.649> block<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.280> there<00:00:54.000> you

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
them make up a full block and there you

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.290 
them make up a full block and there you
can<00:00:54.149> place<00:00:54.539> them<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.960> survival<00:00:55.559> now<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.300> that

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
can place them in survival now and that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.160 
can place them in survival now and that
is<00:00:57.329> pretty<00:00:57.960> cool<00:00:58.730> kind<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.820> microblogs<00:01:00.629> almost

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
is pretty cool kind of microblogs almost

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.789 
is pretty cool kind of microblogs almost
and<00:01:02.000> you<00:01:03.000> could<00:01:03.210> make<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.570> into<00:01:04.229> staircases

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
and you could make it into staircases

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.530 
and you could make it into staircases
and<00:01:05.070> whatnot<00:01:06.590> pretty<00:01:07.590> cool<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.939> different

and whatnot pretty cool so different

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
and whatnot pretty cool so different
snow<00:01:09.840> heights<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:11.299> can<00:01:12.380> walk<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.979> four

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
snow heights and you can walk up to four

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.920 
snow heights and you can walk up to four
I<00:01:14.670> believe<00:01:15.240> let<00:01:15.570> me<00:01:15.689> quickly<00:01:15.900> test<00:01:16.909> so<00:01:17.930> sprint

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
I believe let me quickly test so sprint

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.359 
I believe let me quickly test so sprint
in<00:01:19.610> yep<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:21.570> through<00:01:22.070> making<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.130> higher

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
in yep going through making it higher

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.550 
in yep going through making it higher
here

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
here

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:36.440 
here
still<00:01:28.380> see<00:01:31.590> ya

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.580 

yep<00:01:37.189> still<00:01:38.189> run<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:39.360> pretty<00:01:39.600> cool<00:01:39.840> so

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
yep still run it up it's pretty cool so

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.679 
yep still run it up it's pretty cool so
you<00:01:40.680> could<00:01:40.829> make<00:01:41.039> nice<00:01:41.759> decades<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.659> that

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
you could make nice decades with that

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.440 
you could make nice decades with that
snow<00:01:43.850> has<00:01:44.850> good<00:01:45.119> use<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.539> of<00:01:45.659> course<00:01:45.990> snow<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
snow has good use and of course snow and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.850 
snow has good use and of course snow and
prevents<00:01:48.450> mob<00:01:48.689> spawning<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.560> also

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
prevents mob spawning that is also

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.770 
prevents mob spawning that is also
pretty<00:01:50.039> cool<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.880> now<00:01:51.060> craft<00:01:51.450> snow

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
pretty cool so you can now craft snow

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.260 
pretty cool so you can now craft snow
layer<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.200> getting<00:01:52.590> snow<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.039> easy<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:54.119> make

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
layer and getting snow is easy can make

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.169 
layer and getting snow is easy can make
a<00:01:54.299> lot<00:01:54.539> of<00:01:54.600> time<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.049> saw<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.319> good<00:01:56.039> ratio<00:01:56.310> so

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
a lot of time you saw it good ratio so

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.959 
a lot of time you saw it good ratio so
yeah<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.409> mop<00:01:58.890> prove<00:01:59.159> things<00:01:59.429> now<00:01:59.729> with

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
yeah you can mop prove things now with

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.440 
yeah you can mop prove things now with
snow<00:02:00.509> which<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.530> pretty<00:02:01.920> cool<00:02:04.850> also<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.240> bone

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
snow which is pretty cool also the bone

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.139 
snow which is pretty cool also the bone
meal<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.960> was<00:02:07.170> nerfed<00:02:07.500> last<00:02:07.890> time<00:02:08.250> took<00:02:08.700> up<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
meal it was nerfed last time took up to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.320 
meal it was nerfed last time took up to
seven<00:02:09.869> or<00:02:10.110> took<00:02:10.500> seven<00:02:11.009> ball<00:02:11.700> mills<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.090> grow

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
seven or took seven ball mills to grow

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.930 
seven or took seven ball mills to grow
some<00:02:12.599> weed<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.140> now<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:14.010> seems<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.459> random

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
some weed and now it seems to be random

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:26.440 
some weed and now it seems to be random
we<00:02:15.120> got<00:02:15.299> 12<00:02:16.730> for<00:02:17.730> full<00:02:18.030> gross<00:02:18.360> 1<00:02:19.160> 2<00:02:20.450> 1<00:02:21.450> 2<00:02:21.750> 3<00:02:24.110> 1<00:02:25.110> 2

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
we got 12 for full gross 1 2 1 2 3 1 2

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.229 
we got 12 for full gross 1 2 1 2 3 1 2
so<00:02:27.450> 2<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.470> 3<00:02:28.739> maybe<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.250> looks<00:02:29.459> at<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.849> moment

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
so 2 to 3 maybe it looks at the moment

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.610 
so 2 to 3 maybe it looks at the moment
let's<00:02:30.810> try<00:02:31.170> again<00:02:33.290> see

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
let's try again see

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.920 
let's try again see
one<00:02:36.190> two<00:02:36.670> one<00:02:37.659> two<00:02:38.099> three<00:02:39.239> one<00:02:40.239> two<00:02:41.280> one<00:02:42.280> two

one two one two three one two one two

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.930 
one two one two three one two one two
looks<00:02:43.930> like<00:02:44.170> maximum<00:02:45.099> sorry<00:02:45.459> maybe<00:02:45.849> and<00:02:46.530> trees

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
looks like maximum sorry maybe and trees

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.970

to<00:03:27.730> 8<00:03:28.709> 34<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.819> it<00:03:31.239> seems<00:03:31.599> to<00:03:31.840> be<00:03:31.989> random<00:03:32.980> now<00:03:33.280> I

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
to 8 34 so it seems to be random now I

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.319 
to 8 34 so it seems to be random now I
don't<00:03:34.930> know<00:03:35.140> if<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.379> really<00:03:35.530> like<00:03:35.829> that

don't know if I really like that

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.710 
don't know if I really like that
randomness<00:03:37.329> is<00:03:37.690> never<00:03:37.959> good<00:03:38.290> for<00:03:38.500> machinery

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
randomness is never good for machinery

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.930 
randomness is never good for machinery
hmm

another<00:05:11.539> good<00:05:11.779> bug<00:05:12.080> fix<00:05:12.349> though<00:05:12.589> was<00:05:13.039> that<00:05:13.069> the

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
another good bug fix though was that the

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.230 
another good bug fix though was that the
timing<00:05:14.059> of<00:05:14.360> comparators<00:05:15.349> now<00:05:15.770> is<00:05:16.240> consistent

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
timing of comparators now is consistent

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.540 
timing of comparators now is consistent
as<00:05:17.900> you<00:05:18.080> can<00:05:18.259> see<00:05:18.499> nicely<00:05:18.889> here<00:05:19.069> at<00:05:19.189> this<00:05:19.279> demo

as you can see nicely here at this demo

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.790 
as you can see nicely here at this demo
setup<00:05:19.909> will<00:05:20.689> be<00:05:20.719> made<00:05:21.050> can<00:05:21.979> see<00:05:23.349> another<00:05:24.349> leg

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
setup will be made can see another leg

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.890 
setup will be made can see another leg
but<00:05:25.189> it's<00:05:25.490> Excel<00:05:25.909> you<00:05:26.059> know<00:05:26.180> arriving<00:05:26.659> at<00:05:26.749> the

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
but it's Excel you know arriving at the

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.779 
but it's Excel you know arriving at the
exact<00:05:27.289> same<00:05:27.559> moments<00:05:28.779> it's<00:05:29.779> always<00:05:30.110> the<00:05:30.289> same

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
exact same moments it's always the same

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:37.329 
exact same moments it's always the same
that's<00:05:31.789> very<00:05:32.180> good<00:05:33.339> consistency<00:05:35.949> okay<00:05:36.949> so<00:05:37.009> one

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:37.339 
that's very good consistency okay so one

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:40.659 
that's very good consistency okay so one
