00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.660 
my normal skin tone would be so it's a
little<00:01:38.380> bit<00:01:38.499> more<00:01:38.649> instant<00:01:39.189> if<00:01:39.369> you're<00:01:39.520> not

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
little bit more instant if you're not

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.539 
little bit more instant if you're not
like<00:01:39.849> good<00:01:40.090> at<00:01:40.240> applying<00:01:40.979> self<00:01:41.979> tanner<00:01:42.189> I

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
like good at applying self tanner I

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.279 
like good at applying self tanner I
would<00:01:42.939> recommend<00:01:43.329> getting<00:01:43.509> the<00:01:43.719> medium<00:01:44.079> one

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
would recommend getting the medium one

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.010 
would recommend getting the medium one
because<00:01:45.329> it'll<00:01:46.329> be<00:01:46.359> more<00:01:46.599> of<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.719> gradual

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
because it'll be more of a gradual

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.589 
because it'll be more of a gradual

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.229 
day long so I really really like this
and<00:03:22.510> there's<00:03:22.630> definitely<00:03:22.930> worth<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.319> price

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
and there's definitely worth the price

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.150 
and there's definitely worth the price
okay<00:03:25.319> next<00:03:26.319> I<00:03:26.620> have<00:03:28.410> two<00:03:29.410> blushes<00:03:29.889> and<00:03:30.040> they're

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
okay next I have two blushes and they're

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.490 
okay next I have two blushes and they're
actually<00:03:30.250> both<00:03:30.700> nics<00:03:31.120> blushes<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:32.200> if<00:03:32.290> she'll

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
actually both nics blushes so if she'll

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.020 
actually both nics blushes so if she'll
miss<00:03:32.709> before<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.340> think<00:03:33.579> I've<00:03:33.670> shown<00:03:33.700> this<00:03:33.910> one

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
miss before I think I've shown this one

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.990 
miss before I think I've shown this one
too<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.569> this<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.840> just<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:35.319> natural<00:03:35.889> and<00:03:36.430> it's

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
too and this is just a natural and it's

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.470 
too and this is just a natural and it's
just<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.209> really<00:03:37.420> natural<00:03:38.069> pink<00:03:39.069> color<00:03:39.579> I<00:03:39.880> guess

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
just a really natural pink color I guess

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.090 
just a really natural pink color I guess
it<00:03:40.690> looks<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:41.019> lot<00:03:41.170> like<00:03:41.319> lady<00:03:41.560> blush<00:03:41.769> it's<00:03:42.040> a

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.949 
it looks a lot like lady blush it's a
little<00:03:42.280> bit<00:03:42.400> less<00:03:42.549> is<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.510> little<00:03:43.750> bit<00:03:43.840> more

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
little bit less is a little bit more

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.050 
little bit less is a little bit more
pink<00:03:44.290> than<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:44.650> is<00:03:44.769> purple<00:03:45.010> lady<00:03:45.730> blushes<00:03:46.030> more

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
pink than it is purple lady blushes more

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.910 
pink than it is purple lady blushes more
purple<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.660> little<00:03:47.170> bit<00:03:47.260> more<00:03:47.380> natural<00:03:47.560> but<00:03:47.889> I

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
purple a little bit more natural but I

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.710 
purple a little bit more natural but I
really<00:03:48.190> really<00:03:48.400> like<00:03:48.549> it<00:03:48.579> and<00:03:48.940> it's<00:03:49.569> really

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720

quickly apply it it works really well

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.099

then<00:03:53.440> this<00:03:53.620> one<00:03:53.829> is<00:03:54.450> actually<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.750> hot<00:03:55.900> pink

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
then this one is actually in hot pink

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.990 
then this one is actually in hot pink
and<00:03:56.260> it's<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.500> really<00:03:56.739> scary<00:03:57.220> really<00:03:57.730> bright

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
and it's a really scary really bright

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.370 
and it's a really scary really bright
pink<00:03:58.329> so<00:03:59.290> it's<00:03:59.620> like<00:03:59.709> clown<00:04:00.400> makeup<00:04:01.380> almost

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
pink so it's like clown makeup almost

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.960 
pink so it's like clown makeup almost
but<00:04:02.650> if<00:04:02.950> you<00:04:03.280> apply<00:04:03.489> with<00:04:03.639> the<00:04:03.730> stippling

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
but if you apply with the stippling

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.640 
but if you apply with the stippling
brush<00:04:04.209> and<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.510> really<00:04:04.750> light<00:04:04.900> hand<00:04:05.109> it<00:04:05.410> looks

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
brush and a really light hand it looks

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.080 
brush and a really light hand it looks
really<00:04:05.950> really<00:04:06.280> pretty<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.639> it<00:04:06.760> doesn't<00:04:07.030> look

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
really really pretty and it doesn't look

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.870 
really really pretty and it doesn't look
too<00:04:07.269> overdone<00:04:07.630> at<00:04:07.780> all<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:09.220> obviously<00:04:09.790> I

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
too overdone at all so obviously I

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.240 
too overdone at all so obviously I
wouldn't<00:04:10.180> apply<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.690> much<00:04:10.900> but<00:04:11.620> it's<00:04:12.010> really

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
wouldn't apply that much but it's really

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.069 
wouldn't apply that much but it's really
pigmented<00:04:12.609> and<00:04:13.000> if<00:04:13.419> you<00:04:13.540> just<00:04:13.660> use<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:13.870> light

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
pigmented and if you just use a light

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.409 
pigmented and if you just use a light
hand<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.530> looks<00:04:14.709> really<00:04:14.950> really<00:04:15.250> pretty<00:04:15.419> okay

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
hand it looks really really pretty okay

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.650

it's<00:05:42.339> just<00:05:42.520> the<00:05:42.610> white<00:05:42.819> one<00:05:43.029> I<00:05:43.060> don't<00:05:43.360> know<00:05:43.449> the

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:43.569 
it's just the white one I don't know the

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:45.480 
it's just the white one I don't know the
color<00:05:43.779> of<00:05:43.870> it<00:05:44.080> but<00:05:44.770> at<00:05:44.919> first<00:05:45.069> I<00:05:45.250> didn't<00:05:45.460> like

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
color of it but at first I didn't like

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.089 
color of it but at first I didn't like
this<00:05:45.759> because<00:05:46.650> um<00:05:47.909> where<00:05:48.909> can<00:05:49.029> i<00:05:49.089> watch<00:05:49.120> this

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
this because um where can i watch this

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.050 
this because um where can i watch this
it's<00:05:51.099> kind<00:05:51.339> of<00:05:51.400> hard<00:05:51.610> to<00:05:51.669> put<00:05:51.849> on<00:05:51.909> your

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
it's kind of hard to put on your

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.760 
it's kind of hard to put on your
waterline<00:05:52.360> because<00:05:53.199> it<00:05:53.319> doesn't<00:05:53.349> show<00:05:53.740> up

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
waterline because it doesn't show up

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.110 
waterline because it doesn't show up
pure<00:05:54.129> white<00:05:54.339> and<00:05:54.610> that's<00:05:54.759> what<00:05:54.879> I<00:05:54.909> was<00:05:55.029> looking

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
pure white and that's what I was looking

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.059 
pure white and that's what I was looking
for<00:05:55.300> but<00:05:55.689> the<00:05:55.779> actually<00:05:56.469> the<00:05:56.529> thing<00:05:56.710> I<00:05:56.830> like

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
for but the actually the thing I like

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.070 
for but the actually the thing I like
about<00:05:57.099> it<00:05:57.370> is<00:05:57.610> first<00:05:58.120> off<00:05:58.270> there's<00:05:58.479> like<00:05:58.599> 89

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
about it is first off there's like 89

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.920 
about it is first off there's like 89
cents<00:05:59.439> which<00:05:59.620> is<00:05:59.830> a<00:06:00.069> great<00:06:00.819> deal<00:06:00.969> second<00:06:01.839> I

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
cents which is a great deal second I

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.240 
cents which is a great deal second I
like<00:06:02.139> that<00:06:02.259> it's<00:06:02.439> not<00:06:02.500> pure<00:06:02.800> white<00:06:03.009> so<00:06:03.219> it

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
like that it's not pure white so it

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.249 
like that it's not pure white so it
doesn't<00:06:03.520> look<00:06:03.610> super<00:06:04.029> in<00:06:04.270> your<00:06:04.779> face<00:06:04.930> like<00:06:05.139> you

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259 
doesn't look super in your face like you

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.079 
doesn't look super in your face like you
and<00:06:05.439> tell<00:06:05.529> you<00:06:05.560> a<00:06:05.680> white<00:06:05.860> eyeliner<00:06:06.069> it<00:06:06.669> just

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089 
and tell you a white eyeliner it just

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:08.640 
and tell you a white eyeliner it just
opens<00:06:07.360> up<00:06:07.419> your<00:06:07.539> eyes<00:06:07.629> without<00:06:07.900> making<00:06:08.319> it<00:06:08.409> too

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
opens up your eyes without making it too

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.100 
opens up your eyes without making it too
obvious<00:06:09.129> that<00:06:09.520> you<00:06:09.610> have<00:06:09.789> white<00:06:10.479> eyeliner<00:06:10.839> on

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
obvious that you have white eyeliner on

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.769 
obvious that you have white eyeliner on
your<00:06:11.409> lower<00:06:11.589> waterline<00:06:12.580> so<00:06:13.150> I<00:06:13.180> really<00:06:13.569> really

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
your lower waterline so I really really

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.839 
your lower waterline so I really really
like<00:06:13.930> it<00:06:14.110> and<00:06:14.259> i've<00:06:14.349> been<00:06:14.379> using<00:06:14.620> this<00:06:14.919> every

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
like it and i've been using this every

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.119 
like it and i've been using this every
single<00:06:15.969> day<00:06:16.120> for<00:06:16.240> school<00:06:16.599> so<00:06:16.900> i<00:06:17.139> think<00:06:17.800> this<00:06:18.069> is

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
single day for school so i think this is

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:19.920 
single day for school so i think this is
a<00:06:18.279> really<00:06:18.400> good<00:06:18.550> investment<00:06:19.089> i'm<00:06:19.270> at<00:06:19.539> first<00:06:19.719> I

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
a really good investment i'm at first I

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.300 
a really good investment i'm at first I
had<00:06:20.110> about<00:06:20.319> this<00:06:20.589> like<00:06:20.710> last<00:06:20.949> year<00:06:21.159> and<00:06:21.279> I

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
had about this like last year and I

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.429 
had about this like last year and I
really<00:06:21.550> hated<00:06:21.759> it<00:06:21.969> but<00:06:22.719> I<00:06:22.779> just<00:06:22.960> started<00:06:23.259> using

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:23.439 
really hated it but I just started using

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:25.679 
really hated it but I just started using
it<00:06:23.650> and<00:06:23.919> found<00:06:24.699> a<00:06:24.819> way<00:06:24.909> to<00:06:24.969> like<00:06:25.240> if<00:06:25.419> you<00:06:25.569> just

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:25.689 
it and found a way to like if you just

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:30.089 
it and found a way to like if you just
pile<00:06:26.069> like<00:06:27.069> a<00:06:27.279> few<00:06:27.699> coats<00:06:27.909> of<00:06:28.770> this<00:06:29.770> on<00:06:29.919> it

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
pile like a few coats of this on it

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.709 
pile like a few coats of this on it
works<00:06:30.250> really<00:06:30.370> well<00:06:30.490> and<00:06:30.789> then<00:06:31.000> one<00:06:31.539> more<00:06:31.689> I

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
works really well and then one more I

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.139 
works really well and then one more I
product<00:06:32.199> and<00:06:32.379> this<00:06:32.560> is<00:06:32.770> the<00:06:33.039> benefit<00:06:33.909> they're

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:34.149

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
as well or maybe a little bit better

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:54.140 
as well or maybe a little bit better
than<00:06:52.410> my<00:06:52.560> L'Oreal<00:06:53.370> voluminous<00:06:53.580> million

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
than my L'Oreal voluminous million

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.909 
than my L'Oreal voluminous million
lashes<00:06:54.240> so<00:06:54.660> i'll<00:06:55.080> probably<00:06:55.320> finish<00:06:55.620> the

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
lashes so i'll probably finish the

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.409 
lashes so i'll probably finish the
bottle<00:06:56.040> i<00:06:56.430> don't<00:06:56.610> know<00:06:56.699> if<00:06:56.729> i'll<00:06:56.970> buy<00:06:57.150> a<00:06:57.180> new

bottle i don't know if i'll buy a new
one<00:06:57.570> just<00:06:58.350> because<00:06:58.620> it<00:06:59.100> was<00:06:59.190> $22<00:06:59.970> and<00:07:00.210> that's<00:07:00.330> a

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
one just because it was $22 and that's a

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.790 
one just because it was $22 and that's a
little<00:07:00.630> expensive<00:07:00.810> for<00:07:01.139> a<00:07:01.440> mascara

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
little expensive for a mascara
