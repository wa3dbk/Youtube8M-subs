00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:09.090
 hello everyone I wanted to show you one 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.610
 thing so he can already he hold there 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.840
 anybody and no business catalytic 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:21.810
 which one is soviet-made 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.439
 so to speak somehow she is on the defensive 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.760
 technologies they were made here 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.760
 I ordered myself a pair of pieces I got to wear 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.160
 thing wanna say pretty 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.110
 awesome really since 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.059
 her catalyst consists of adding 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.780
 more accurately sprayed with platinum 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:52.530
 how do you spell it badly I think that 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:58.760
 it will be seen well, something like this works 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:02.719
 we have it on ordinary gasoline 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.719
 cleaned for lighters 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.689
 put on in such a pouch in order 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.430
 so as not to burn his hands here but 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.650
 in fact, I think that here I tried 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:20.100
 the couch and it burns of course for five with 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.360
 plus hands up hard to keep but 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.130
 one if it is in the cold 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.530
 tolerable will be as if normal that is 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.090
 heats his hands completely 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.310
 but if it will be as they say little 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.130
 oxygen access then it is no longer 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.869
 will burn as well as it is about 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.640
 is outdoors just in 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.750
 hands if hold or hang it under 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.000
 clothes will be very good too 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.920
 given and released in 90 second year this 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.380
 this one is this 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.380
 missed us ninety third 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:01.560
 orange bunny with diaper support 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.119
 Cheholchik principle all the same 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.049
 same warmer from she if so 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.069
 compare hand - not very much big 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:14.000
 about so here it is 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.430
 preferably not to touch the catalyst 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.140
 fingers because the dam and spraying 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.269
 still from the dam spraying like myself 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.590
 Well, maybe she did not dam 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:30.440
 In all can be but the fact that she that she 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:34.670
 works for five plus it's kind of thing 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.670
 catalytic heating pad which one 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.940
 great just a couple of pieces 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:49.049
 putting yourself in the pocket will just be 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:53.310
 okay winter is warm so who has 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:56.760
 any questions or some other 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.630
 reflections on this topic will be glad 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.120
 hear 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.120
