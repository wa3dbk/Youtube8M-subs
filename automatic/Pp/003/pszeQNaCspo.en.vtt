00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:02.350
 the time is coming 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.120
 thirty days for the Beijing Olympics begins with a chill in the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.809
 belly renato and then some people already start with that special feeling 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.120
 to participate 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.329
 of an Olympics for the first time 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:18.690
 from the point of view of the state 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.509
 this affects not only the athletes in the anatel because I am a freshman 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.719
 the first emperor first came to realize how you are as you are 

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:26.859
 will be 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.359
 in the period of four years 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.430
 few days of the Olympics are the most important for the athletes the freshmen 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.490
 are anxious to discover the sensation 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.410
 to be in the games 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.580
 some more experienced 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.340
 already enjoyed enough 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.140
 they know how difficult it is to accept that it will be the last 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.250
 today in the second report of the series about deco 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.400
 marcusso show what makes the heart shoot harder in the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.700
 olympics say hello 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 Say goodbye 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.370
 the russian leader stadium 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.200
 live under extreme pressure 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.590
 get ready for it 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.350
 gymnastics on the wall can be 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.830
 almost an instrument of torture 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.880
 Helium barboza, this does not stick 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.410
 can you go to the garden? 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.180
 to tell the truth the country that waits 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.300
 and snake 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.360
 Olympiad 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.230
 It's for big people. 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.800
 the school is beautiful 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.600
 a very good thing 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.270
 I think it was to be one of the best 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.330
 I do not do 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.800
 in the new device but I did not regret finally those indicated in the analysis 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.220
 that afternoon yes because it is difficult that he was small 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.980
 mfr good on the four handsets - it will also stay 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.070
 I think she has to do what she likes to do what is decisive 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.530
 this is the theory 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.040
 in official speech 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.410
 in practice 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.740
 still according to different Augustine 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.930
 he says that they have to give a little bit in the belly with the 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.380
 Flame restraint 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.009
 as the background is something as striking as with time 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.229
 but the summons 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:14.229
 when the athlete arrives here for the stadium of the opening ceremony 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:19.629
 it is an emotion nervousness there is no one who does not feel the cold in the belly if 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.309
 it would be possible to invent okada that will present in that area would sell 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.909
 nor water here in Beijing because this is the feeling that 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.899
 every athlete 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:34.009
 The first river, according to the last, has no way. 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.699
 to feel 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:40.989
 the size of this stage because in fact inattention sale attention of the whole 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.989
 world of art seems to be the greatest spectacle of the sport 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.539
 by me 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.939
 to get there at the top 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.939
 it takes more than perfect physical turn 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:12.180
 the athletes need to puc the quality 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:18.079
 the scenario favorable to the competition but after all how will it ever be 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.119
 made 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:23.069
 you will see the morning in the third report of the series b 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.619
