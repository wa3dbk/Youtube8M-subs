00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:11.460
 here with samsung galaxy s 3 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.790
 And it's the 4 almost 64 minutes and a half 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.820
 end there an update with the man 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.920
 he wants on samsung galaxy s3 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.529
 it's the ie9 1,300 and I took the audio 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.260
 original because he was at work and that 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.009
 a lot of people talking about this vital, right? 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.710
 I retired, I 'm here on the ram, it's for you there. 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.829
 the person is rotten and has even update 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.690
 If you want to film what is already 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.520
 to film 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.530
 from what we saw there was no change 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.840
 on android it still continues 4.1.2 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.960
 but it was certainly some update is 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.329
 cannon a small update then 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.820
 why he does not even changes 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.930
 fun but the lyrics you have there by 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.359
 example and 9.300 xxl b something with 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.670
 sure there was some change so one 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.110
 letter to another and in the kernel version 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.320
 they have just below when you go there 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.000
 in settings on the device it 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.020
 shows this configuration and has the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.540
 canyon no more people can realize 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.720
 the latest is and that's personal to the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.390
 samsung she is making available and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.740
 this latest update for the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.140
 ps3 is before one and rumors come out 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.850
 one of a few things there that the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.950
 People are raising you guys today. 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.259
 to know in the other video is the one of 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.570
 an operator who has had this update 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.200
 I do not know if it was for all 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.000
 operators 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.890
 Ok, but getting back to the subject is a subject. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.409
 controversy there that you will see in the next 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.110
 video I'm going to tell you about this 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.909
 s3 cell phone and that probably this 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.890
 update because of that, right? 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.409
 you will know why it is not a 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.229
 You are very controversial. 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.250
 seeing that it is halfway through the process 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.050
 finished and update now it's just 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.560
 updating the programs 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.239
 It takes a while, it's still 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.069
 is this not having to scroll here by 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.200
 while you in the four and a half minutes 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.060
 there is more about one of the most 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.790
 two more minutes 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.900
 so this was a smooth update 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.720
 probably for all the s3's 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.410
 life there but this was an operator there 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.190
 I met, I'm not mistaken on this day. 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.080
 of July was on July 4 and this 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.300
 probably by the room on the 4th of 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.230
 July that had this update 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:50.489
 available and they even talked to me 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.380
 They would shoot your there and cell phone you 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.069
 update has been made. 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.980
 he / she / it does not catch 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.959
 in a normal quiet cell phone 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.209
 thing that the gift of itself speaks 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.970
 Sometimes it happens that it warms up a 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.940
 little time for you is you're 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.160
 loading it and depending on the game 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.170
 also take a hotheaded but also 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.900
 had another person also at work 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.570
 who has a white f3 said he is 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.870
 Warming up a lot and stopping 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.510
 enough and has hours until the person 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.299
 have to pull the trigger to britney 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:32.989
 battery puts battery back 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:36.209
 it's there is hope is that has not 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.250
 has not been anything serious or even 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.109
 type a we need to do this update 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.959
 because we have detected a 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:47.030
 problem there and such right 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.049
 there already is already started operating system 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.730
 these small updates usually 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.920
 when it is not working any 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.269
 thing on the cell phone samsung goes there and does 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.190
 and if this update 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:03.720
 I do not remember what I got the 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:07.799
 detail but now we will try to see 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.109
 which version of the operating system you 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.690
 is still in 4.1.2 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.389
 my cell phone s3 mini it does not shoot 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.169
 very closely I was filming with him going 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.630
 there to see more or less 30 in 4.1.2 a 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.450
 put your finger up 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.450
 4.1.2 and kerlon that the version you had 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.880
 a small update in the canon 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.150
 Ok guys, this is it if you liked it 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.310
 osce's staff joinha leaves the message 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.670
 Okay, I thought it was four and a half years. 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.140
 but it's 15 minutes of right video gives 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:47.310
 your game is very important for the 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:49.700
 channel personal touch spoke worthy to the young 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.700
 it is
