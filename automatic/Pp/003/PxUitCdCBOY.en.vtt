00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
dry storage I've got is to soup cans

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.270 
dry storage I've got is to soup cans
campbell<00:02:07.870> soup<00:02:08.020> cans<00:02:08.380> both<00:02:08.770> of<00:02:08.979> them<00:02:09.100> been

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
campbell soup cans both of them been

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.540 
campbell soup cans both of them been
edge<00:02:09.610> cut<00:02:11.850> talk<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.180> one<00:02:13.390> here<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.310> i

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
edge cut talk to this one here so that i

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.830 
edge cut talk to this one here so that i
haven't<00:02:16.270> folded<00:02:16.480> ring<00:02:17.350> obviously<00:02:18.810> take<00:02:19.810> a

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
haven't folded ring obviously take a

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.740 
haven't folded ring obviously take a
motorcycle<00:02:20.620> inner<00:02:21.520> tube<00:02:21.880> just<00:02:22.360> because

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
motorcycle inner tube just because

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.680 
motorcycle inner tube just because
they're<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.930> little<00:02:23.020> bit<00:02:23.170> bigger<00:02:24.690> it's

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
they're a little bit bigger it's

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.540 
they're a little bit bigger it's
definitely<00:02:26.110> good<00:02:26.290> stretches<00:02:27.240> put<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.360> on<00:02:28.540> a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
definitely good stretches put it on a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.160 
definitely good stretches put it on a
little<00:02:30.550> harder<00:02:30.940> on<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.209> bigger<00:02:31.420> can<00:02:31.780> because

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
little harder on the bigger can because

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.300 
little harder on the bigger can because
this<00:02:32.380> wasn't<00:02:32.650> very<00:02:32.890> big<00:02:33.430> inner<00:02:34.209> tube

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
this wasn't very big inner tube

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.710 
this wasn't very big inner tube
but<00:02:36.310> because<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.910> site<00:02:37.390> side<00:02:38.080> cut<00:02:39.720> it

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
but because that a site side cut it

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:51.860 
but because that a site side cut it
seals<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:43.030> edge<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.450> can
