has<00:00:27.990> yes<00:00:28.670> arm<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:31.790> this<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> string

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
has yes arm on it so this is the string

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.910 
has yes arm on it so this is the string
right<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.630> watch<00:00:34.200> how<00:00:34.380> long<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.649> takes<00:00:34.800> for

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
right here watch how long it takes for

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.680 
right here watch how long it takes for
them<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> get<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.440> all<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:38.690> that's

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
them to get that out so all that that's

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.119 
them to get that out so all that that's
all<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.170> time<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.469> takes<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:40.860> them<00:00:40.950> to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
all the time it takes for them to

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.240 
all the time it takes for them to
actually<00:00:41.520> get<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.180> also<00:00:43.070> which<00:00:44.070> one

actually get it out but also which one

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.610 
actually get it out but also which one
note<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.210> does<00:00:45.450> take<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.780> long<00:00:46.020> time<00:00:46.289> if

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
note is that it does take a long time if

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.799 
note is that it does take a long time if
you<00:00:46.739> don't<00:00:46.980> counsel<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> block<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.750> do

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
you don't counsel for you to block I do

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.569 
you don't counsel for you to block I do
anything<00:00:49.020> after<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.440> range<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.920> all<00:00:50.399> that

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
anything after this range so all that

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.709 
anything after this range so all that
time<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.820> think<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.180> see<00:00:51.270> I'm<00:00:51.360> holding<00:00:51.480> on

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
time I think you see I'm holding on

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.150 
time I think you see I'm holding on
block<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.230> actually<00:00:52.350> does<00:00:52.649> take<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> while

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
block but it actually does take a while

block but it actually does take a while
foot<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.460> get<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.090> if<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.270> cancel<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
foot to get out but if you cancel it you

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.979 
foot to get out but if you cancel it you
have<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.070> worry<00:00:56.190> about<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.329> time<00:00:57.840> it

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
have to worry about that that a time it

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.439 
have to worry about that that a time it
takes<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> recover<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.969> let's<00:01:00.120> put<00:01:00.239> them<00:01:00.329> back

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
takes to recover so let's put them back

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
in it so instead just doing that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.740 
in it so instead just doing that
continuously<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.600> actually

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
continuously you can actually

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.719 
continuously you can actually
incorporate<00:01:34.619> his<00:01:35.039> overhead<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.930> his<00:01:36.930> load

you can do this ring when you get them

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.260 
you can do this ring when you get them
blocking<00:01:46.649> low<00:01:46.890> real<00:01:47.069> quick<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.850> restrain

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
blocking low real quick you can restrain

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.200 
blocking low real quick you can restrain
and<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.289> now<00:01:50.039> this<00:01:50.190> move<00:01:50.429> is<00:01:50.580> negative<00:01:51.030> to

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.969 
and of this now this move is negative to
unblock<00:01:51.539> so<00:01:51.929> it<00:01:52.140> can't<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.470> punished<00:01:52.799> either

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
unblock so it can't be punished either

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.070 
unblock so it can't be punished either
so<00:01:53.369> that's<00:01:53.459> safe<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.690> do<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> whole

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
so that's safe so if you do the whole

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.070 
so that's safe so if you do the whole
thing<00:01:56.600> like<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:59.090> that<00:02:00.090> does<00:02:00.330> about<00:02:00.569> 11%

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
thing like this that does about 11%

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.749 
thing like this that does about 11%
block<00:02:01.890> damage<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:05.009> opponent<00:02:05.220> not<00:02:05.549> only

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
block damage so the opponent not only

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.949 
block damage so the opponent not only
has<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.030> block<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> whole<00:02:06.509> thing<00:02:06.750> but<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.899> also

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
has to block the whole thing but I also

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.410 
has to block the whole thing but I also
have<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.259> keep<00:02:07.380> don't<00:02:07.920> mix<00:02:08.130> ups<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.850> in

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
have to keep don't mix ups like in in

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.949 
have to keep don't mix ups like in in
mind<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.929> overhead<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.630> below<00:02:12.630> he<00:02:12.810> also

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
mind the overhead and the below he also

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.380 
mind the overhead and the below he also
has<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.290> movie<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.709> overhead<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.060> can

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
has this movie this overhead so you can

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.340 
has this movie this overhead so you can
you<00:02:15.510> know<00:02:17.720> incorporate<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:21.660> most<00:02:22.230> of

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
you know incorporate that but most of

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.319 
you know incorporate that but most of
use<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.470> because<00:02:22.799> that's<00:02:22.950> like<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.489> one

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
use that because that's like a one

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.370 
use that because that's like a one
string<00:02:24.540> overhead<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:24.959> said<00:02:25.079> I'd<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.290> to

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
string overhead and said I'd like to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.750 
string overhead and said I'd like to
going<00:02:25.590> through<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.829> like<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> whole<00:02:26.250> string

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
going through that like a whole string

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.400 
going through that like a whole string
to<00:02:26.910> get<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.150> overhead<00:02:27.420> another<00:02:28.079> to<00:02:28.260> that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
to get that overhead another to that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.050 
to get that overhead another to that
string<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.890> just<00:02:29.070> go<00:02:29.340> straight<00:02:29.579> get<00:02:29.700> over<00:02:29.940> it

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
string you just go straight get over it

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.210 
string you just go straight get over it
so<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:33.390> they're<00:02:33.840> blocking<00:02:34.079> low<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.980> want<00:02:35.160> to

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
so so they're blocking low you want to

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.850 
so so they're blocking low you want to
incorporate<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.730> over<00:02:35.970> right

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
incorporate the over right

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.010 
incorporate the over right
just<00:02:38.430> do<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.330> can<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.540> dash<00:02:39.810> up

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
just do that and you can just dash up

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.750 
just do that and you can just dash up
after<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.440> overhead<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.650> then<00:02:44.550> keep<00:02:44.730> that

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
after that overhead and then keep that

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.290 
after that overhead and then keep that
pressure<00:02:45.000> going<00:02:45.710> so<00:02:46.850> put<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:47.880> reverse<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
pressure going so put that reverse the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.910 
pressure going so put that reverse the
back<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.870> guys<00:02:48.960> can<00:02:49.200> see<00:02:49.380> again<00:02:49.740> they

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
back on so you guys can see again they

00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:05.540 
back on so you guys can see again they
can't<00:02:50.190> get<00:02:50.370> out<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.610> this<00:03:03.709> see<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:04.740> I'm<00:03:05.430> gonna

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
can't get out of this see that I'm gonna

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.920 
can't get out of this see that I'm gonna
put<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.790> wick<00:03:05.910> up<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.209> that's<00:03:06.420> one<00:03:06.600> thing<00:03:06.840> with

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
put the wick up on that's one thing with

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.300 
put the wick up on that's one thing with
Lu<00:03:07.080> Kang<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:07.590> actually<00:03:07.920> don't<00:03:08.130> have<00:03:08.220> to

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
Lu Kang you actually don't have to

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.860 
Lu Kang you actually don't have to
expect<00:03:08.670> wake-ups<00:03:09.150> either<00:03:09.300> just<00:03:09.570> because<00:03:09.750> of

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
expect wake-ups either just because of

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.020 
expect wake-ups either just because of
this<00:03:09.959> move<00:03:10.170> right<00:03:10.320> here<00:03:10.380> those<00:03:11.370> tools<00:03:11.730> come<00:03:11.940> up

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
this move right here those tools come up

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.550 
this move right here those tools come up
so<00:03:12.150> fast<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.720> most<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.260> time<00:03:13.410> they

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
so fast that the most of the time they

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.470 
so fast that the most of the time they
knock<00:03:13.770> off<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.190> Armada<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.910> opponent<00:03:15.390> they

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
knock off the Armada and opponent they

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.780 
knock off the Armada and opponent they
can<00:03:15.660> knock<00:03:15.810> off<00:03:15.989> Zack<00:03:16.320> says<00:03:16.560> -<00:03:16.860> bunch

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.020 

scorpions<00:03:20.790> teleports<00:03:21.420> sub<00:03:22.260> zero's<00:03:23.030> slide

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
scorpions teleports sub zero's slide

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.520 
scorpions teleports sub zero's slide
they<00:03:24.300> can<00:03:24.450> make<00:03:24.660> pretty<00:03:24.870> much<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.170> knock<00:03:25.320> off

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
they can make pretty much to knock off

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.010 
they can make pretty much to knock off
any<00:03:25.800> armored<00:03:26.400> move<00:03:27.209> unless<00:03:27.510> like<00:03:27.870> his

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
any armored move unless like his

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.430 
any armored move unless like his
manliness<00:03:29.600> roll<00:03:30.600> she<00:03:31.050> does<00:03:31.200> because<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.410> think

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
manliness roll she does because I think

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.060 
manliness roll she does because I think
that<00:03:31.650> comes<00:03:31.830> out<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.040> like<00:03:32.130> eight<00:03:32.280> frames<00:03:32.489> so

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
that comes out in like eight frames so

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.550 
that comes out in like eight frames so
but<00:03:35.070> let's<00:03:35.280> have<00:03:35.489> them<00:03:35.790> come<00:03:36.270> on<00:03:37.260> knock<00:03:37.410> them

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
but let's have them come on knock them

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.350 
but let's have them come on knock them
down<00:03:37.709> how<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:37.920> wake<00:03:38.130> up<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:39.060> show<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.209> guys

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
down how to wake up on and show you guys

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.670 
down how to wake up on and show you guys
the<00:03:39.570> ex<00:03:39.690> don't<00:03:39.810> have<00:03:39.959> respect<00:03:40.170> anything<00:03:40.470> right

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
the ex don't have respect anything right

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.810 
the ex don't have respect anything right
so<00:03:41.070> after<00:03:41.670> getting<00:03:41.730> down<00:03:42.950> he's<00:03:43.950> back<00:03:44.160> like

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
so after getting down he's back like

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.740 
so after getting down he's back like
you're<00:03:45.180> back<00:03:45.330> into<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.630> pressure<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.690> you

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
you're back into the pressure and you

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.000 
you're back into the pressure and you
keep<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:48.989> got<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.110> full<00:03:49.350> compliment<00:03:49.830> for<00:03:49.890> them

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
keep you got a full compliment for them

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.039 
keep you got a full compliment for them
even<00:03:50.160> trying<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.640> do<00:03:50.730> anything<00:03:50.940> knock<00:03:51.900> them

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
even trying to do anything knock them

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.410 
even trying to do anything knock them
down<00:03:52.200> again<00:03:52.430> now<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.489> can<00:03:53.820> just<00:03:53.910> keep<00:03:54.180> keep

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
down again now you can just keep keep

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.860 
down again now you can just keep keep
the<00:03:54.540> pressure<00:03:54.720> going<00:03:55.019> once<00:03:55.260> again<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:56.870> that's

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
the pressure going once again so that's

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.660 
the pressure going once again so that's
one<00:03:58.140> thing<00:03:58.350> we<00:03:58.860> do<00:03:58.980> King<00:03:59.220> this<00:03:59.430> move<00:03:59.580> right

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
one thing we do King this move right

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.039 
one thing we do King this move right
here<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.940> do<00:04:00.030> not<00:04:00.150> have<00:04:00.269> respect<00:04:00.360> your<00:04:00.660> way

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
here you do not have respect your way

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.880 
here you do not have respect your way
cups<00:04:01.260> at<00:04:01.320> all<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.650> we<00:04:01.769> get<00:04:01.920> this<00:04:01.980> out<00:04:02.160> that's<00:04:02.760> up

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
cups at all so we get this out that's up

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.050 
cups at all so we get this out that's up
most<00:04:04.890> likely<00:04:05.130> going<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.310> be<00:04:05.400> blocking<00:04:05.610> if<00:04:05.910> they

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
most likely going to be blocking if they

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.160 
most likely going to be blocking if they
know<00:04:06.299> that<00:04:06.540> they<00:04:06.660> can't<00:04:06.870> get<00:04:06.959> out<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:09.720> get

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
know that they can't get out so you get

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.830 
know that they can't get out so you get
that<00:04:10.290> in

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
that in

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.000

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
opponent's back into the vortex he can't

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.820 
opponent's back into the vortex he can't
get<00:05:29.630> out<00:05:29.690> of<00:05:29.870> it<00:05:29.990> once<00:05:30.170> again<00:05:30.290> unless<00:05:30.710> you

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
get out of it once again unless you

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.740 
get out of it once again unless you
block<00:05:31.670> breakfast<00:05:32.090> or<00:05:32.240> just<00:05:32.270> breakfast
