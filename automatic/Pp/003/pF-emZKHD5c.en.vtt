00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
and I'll try to remember to talk about

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.150 
and I'll try to remember to talk about
restraints<00:05:24.900> and<00:05:25.020> seclusion<00:05:25.080> because<00:05:25.889> they

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
restraints and seclusion because they

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.680 
restraints and seclusion because they
are<00:05:26.280> trying<00:05:26.580> more<00:05:26.910> and<00:05:27.030> more<00:05:27.180> to<00:05:27.270> do<00:05:27.360> away<00:05:27.510> with

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
are trying more and more to do away with

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.050 
are trying more and more to do away with
that<00:05:28.020> because<00:05:28.650> it<00:05:28.889> basically<00:05:29.160> takes<00:05:29.699> up<00:05:29.910> too

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
that because it basically takes up too

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.730 
that because it basically takes up too
much<00:05:30.090> staff<00:05:30.479> time<00:05:30.810> to<00:05:31.020> be<00:05:31.139> honest<00:05:31.500> it's

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
much staff time to be honest it's

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.310 
much staff time to be honest it's
something<00:05:32.220> as<00:05:32.340> a<00:05:32.400> last<00:05:32.880> resort<00:05:33.479> they<00:05:34.050> do<00:05:34.110> not

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
something as a last resort they do not

something as a last resort they do not
like<00:05:34.560> to<00:05:34.770> do<00:05:34.889> that<00:05:35.100> they<00:05:35.460> do<00:05:35.520> not<00:05:35.700> want<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.120> do

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
like to do that they do not want to do

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.909 
like to do that they do not want to do
that<00:05:36.419> it<00:05:36.630> is<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:36.810> pain<00:05:37.080> in<00:05:37.229> their<00:05:37.350> neck<00:05:37.620> they

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
by the way I can explain that too but

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.290 
by the way I can explain that too but
the<00:05:43.650> mega<00:05:44.070> bites<00:05:44.280> are<00:05:44.460> just<00:05:44.639> about<00:05:44.789> gone<00:05:45.000> so
