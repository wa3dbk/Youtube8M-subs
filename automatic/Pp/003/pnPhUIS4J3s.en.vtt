00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.829 

and<00:00:05.309> our<00:00:06.309> next<00:00:06.639> image<00:00:06.910> from<00:00:07.120> the<00:00:07.240> lake<00:00:07.450> is<00:00:07.779> the

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:07.839 
and our next image from the lake is the

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.820 
and our next image from the lake is the
one<00:00:08.349> I<00:00:08.379> took<00:00:08.620> of<00:00:08.860> the<00:00:08.980> boaters<00:00:09.459> and<00:00:10.619> this<00:00:11.619> is

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
one I took of the boaters and this is

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.650 
one I took of the boaters and this is
pretty<00:00:12.039> much<00:00:12.280> how<00:00:12.549> it<00:00:12.699> looked<00:00:12.939> out<00:00:13.510> of<00:00:13.539> the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
pretty much how it looked out of the

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.289 
pretty much how it looked out of the
camera<00:00:14.139> I<00:00:14.199> captured<00:00:14.830> some<00:00:15.250> of<00:00:15.279> the<00:00:15.490> Sun<00:00:15.820> coming

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
camera I captured some of the Sun coming

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.509 
camera I captured some of the Sun coming
in<00:00:16.449> and<00:00:16.810> of<00:00:16.960> course<00:00:17.230> I<00:00:17.380> caught<00:00:17.619> him<00:00:17.859> in<00:00:18.010> that<00:00:18.189> in

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:18.519 
in and of course I caught him in that in

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.650 
in and of course I caught him in that in
that<00:00:18.580> Sun<00:00:19.539> line<00:00:19.810> on<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.380> lake<00:00:20.590> and<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:22.330> can<00:00:22.510> only

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
that Sun line on the lake and I can only

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.380 
that Sun line on the lake and I can only
take<00:00:22.869> one<00:00:22.930> picture<00:00:23.530> because<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:25.330> were

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
take one picture because they were

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.779 
take one picture because they were
moving<00:00:25.630> pretty<00:00:25.900> fast<00:00:26.020> and<00:00:26.680> I<00:00:27.010> think<00:00:27.430> I'm<00:00:27.730> not

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
moving pretty fast and I think I'm not

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.040 
moving pretty fast and I think I'm not
sure<00:00:27.910> if<00:00:28.119> I<00:00:28.180> took<00:00:28.360> another<00:00:28.630> one<00:00:28.840> but<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:29.020> think

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
sure if I took another one but I think

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.140 
sure if I took another one but I think
they<00:00:29.289> were<00:00:29.440> gone<00:00:29.680> already<00:00:30.039> they<00:00:30.760> were<00:00:30.820> out<00:00:31.119> of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
they were gone already they were out of

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.290 
they were gone already they were out of
that<00:00:31.359> spot<00:00:31.720> so<00:00:32.109> I<00:00:32.140> only<00:00:32.649> got<00:00:32.920> a<00:00:32.980> chance<00:00:33.910> to<00:00:34.090> take

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
that spot so I only got a chance to take

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.779 
that spot so I only got a chance to take
one<00:00:34.539> exposure<00:00:34.960> on<00:00:35.350> this<00:00:35.530> shot<00:00:35.770> here<00:00:36.160> but<00:00:36.340> now

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
one exposure on this shot here but now

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.899 
one exposure on this shot here but now
this<00:00:36.940> year<00:00:37.329> I<00:00:37.569> cropped<00:00:37.989> a<00:00:38.260> little<00:00:38.559> bit<00:00:38.769> and<00:00:38.979> in

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:39.909 
this year I cropped a little bit and in

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:43.020 
this year I cropped a little bit and in
this<00:00:40.120> particular<00:00:40.629> one<00:00:40.929> I<00:00:41.229> kept<00:00:42.219> part<00:00:42.579> of<00:00:42.850> the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
this particular one I kept part of the

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.090 
this particular one I kept part of the
Sun<00:00:43.359> in<00:00:43.569> because<00:00:43.929> that<00:00:44.079> was<00:00:44.199> sort<00:00:44.350> of<00:00:44.499> a<00:00:44.679> nice

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
Sun in because that was sort of a nice

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.360 
Sun in because that was sort of a nice
effect<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:45.940> then<00:00:46.809> I<00:00:46.929> took<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.409> horizon<00:00:48.129> line

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
effect and then I took the horizon line

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.049 
effect and then I took the horizon line
down<00:00:48.760> to<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.149> lower<00:00:49.479> thirds<00:00:50.339> so<00:00:51.339> this<00:00:51.519> is<00:00:51.699> more

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
down to the lower thirds so this is more

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.959 
down to the lower thirds so this is more
of<00:00:52.179> a<00:00:52.269> slimmer<00:00:52.780> effect<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.579> it's<00:00:54.729> kind<00:00:54.940> of

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
of a slimmer effect and it's kind of

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.879 
of a slimmer effect and it's kind of
nice<00:00:55.179> the<00:00:55.359> way<00:00:55.510> it<00:00:55.629> is<00:00:55.780> and<00:00:56.289> of<00:00:56.440> course<00:00:56.499> I

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:56.889 
nice the way it is and of course I

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.520 
nice the way it is and of course I
darken<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.549> sky<00:00:57.909> a<00:00:57.940> little<00:00:58.299> bit<00:00:58.870> more<00:00:59.229> just

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
darken the sky a little bit more just

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.180 
darken the sky a little bit more just
gave<00:00:59.829> it<00:00:59.949> more<00:01:00.670> of<00:01:01.120> an<00:01:01.299> impact<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:02.049> then<00:01:02.889> here

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
gave it more of an impact and then here

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.840 
gave it more of an impact and then here
I<00:01:03.219> moved<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:04.799> horizon<00:01:05.799> line<00:01:05.979> up<00:01:06.310> towards<00:01:06.729> the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
I moved the horizon line up towards the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.480 
I moved the horizon line up towards the
top<00:01:06.880> third<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.780> photograph<00:01:08.290> and<00:01:09.070> notice

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
top third of the photograph and notice

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.700 
top third of the photograph and notice
how<00:01:09.670> I<00:01:09.700> cropped<00:01:10.120> out<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.630> Sun<00:01:10.960> on<00:01:11.200> this<00:01:11.440> one

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
how I cropped out the Sun on this one

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.420 
how I cropped out the Sun on this one
and<00:01:12.100> then<00:01:12.940> we<00:01:13.450> still<00:01:13.750> see<00:01:14.050> more<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.860> the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
and then we still see more of the

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.660 
and then we still see more of the
highlight<00:01:16.420> area<00:01:16.900> in<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.320> water<00:01:17.590> and<00:01:18.490> that's

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
highlight area in the water and that's

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.310 
highlight area in the water and that's
kind<00:01:18.850> of<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:18.970> nice<00:01:19.150> effect<00:01:19.180> too<00:01:19.840> although<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.200> do

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
kind of a nice effect too although I do

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.770 
kind of a nice effect too although I do
like<00:01:20.650> it<00:01:20.860> with<00:01:20.980> the<00:01:21.100> Sun<00:01:21.340> up<00:01:21.520> on<00:01:21.700> top<00:01:21.940> as<00:01:22.510> well

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
like it with the Sun up on top as well

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.290 
like it with the Sun up on top as well
and<00:01:23.290> another<00:01:23.530> option<00:01:24.310> would<00:01:24.490> be<00:01:24.550> to<00:01:25.030> make<00:01:25.270> the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
and another option would be to make the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.690 
and another option would be to make the
water<00:01:25.840> cool<00:01:26.410> so<00:01:26.890> I<00:01:26.980> just<00:01:27.010> gave<00:01:27.370> it<00:01:27.550> like<00:01:27.670> a

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
water cool so I just gave it like a

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.990 
water cool so I just gave it like a
bluish<00:01:28.330> hue<00:01:28.840> on<00:01:29.170> this<00:01:29.350> one<00:01:29.560> in<00:01:29.830> Photoshop<00:01:30.430> but

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
bluish hue on this one in Photoshop but

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.390 
bluish hue on this one in Photoshop but
I<00:01:31.030> think<00:01:31.360> overall<00:01:31.690> out<00:01:32.050> of<00:01:32.170> these<00:01:32.320> I<00:01:32.590> prefer

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
I think overall out of these I prefer

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.240 
I think overall out of these I prefer
the<00:01:33.580> one<00:01:33.820> which<00:01:34.090> has<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:35.050> slimline<00:01:35.380> look<00:01:35.980> and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
the one which has the slimline look and

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.340 
the one which has the slimline look and
shows<00:01:36.700> part<00:01:37.180> of<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.420> Sun<00:01:37.780> because<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.290> think

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
shows part of the Sun because I think

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.240 
shows part of the Sun because I think
it's<00:01:38.680> kind<00:01:39.010> of<00:01:39.040> a<00:01:39.130> neat<00:01:39.490> composition<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:41.250> even

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
it's kind of a neat composition and even

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.790 
it's kind of a neat composition and even
though<00:01:42.340> your<00:01:42.490> eye<00:01:42.520> goes<00:01:42.940> to<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.150> Sun<00:01:43.510> it<00:01:44.290> just

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
though your eye goes to the Sun it just

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.880 
though your eye goes to the Sun it just
continues<00:01:45.340> down<00:01:45.700> onto<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.270> boaters<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:46.990> I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
continues down onto the boaters and I

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.510 
continues down onto the boaters and I
think<00:01:48.100> it's<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.340> nice<00:01:48.520> combination<00:01:50.130> our<00:01:51.130> next

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
think it's a nice combination our next

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.460 
think it's a nice combination our next
image<00:01:51.850> is<00:01:52.120> one<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.450> took<00:01:52.630> as<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.080> vertical

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
image is one I took as a vertical

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.399 
image is one I took as a vertical
however<00:01:54.400> after<00:01:55.330> I<00:01:55.360> looked<00:01:55.720> at<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.080> I<00:01:56.170> thought

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
however after I looked at it I thought

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.230 
however after I looked at it I thought
this<00:01:56.710> would<00:01:56.890> be<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:57.040> really<00:01:57.460> nice<00:01:57.700> horizontal

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
this would be a really nice horizontal

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.160 
this would be a really nice horizontal
if<00:01:58.900> I<00:01:59.080> maybe<00:01:59.409> cut<00:01:59.860> out<00:02:00.040> that<00:02:00.340> little<00:02:00.640> open<00:02:01.210> area

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
if I maybe cut out that little open area

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.800 
if I maybe cut out that little open area
of<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.440> sky<00:02:02.890> now<00:02:03.820> if<00:02:03.940> you<00:02:04.060> look<00:02:04.210> at<00:02:04.360> this<00:02:04.570> it's

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
of the sky now if you look at this it's

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.630 
of the sky now if you look at this it's
got<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.020> few<00:02:05.320> things<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:06.250> are<00:02:06.400> kind<00:02:06.580> of

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
got a few things that are kind of

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.520 
got a few things that are kind of
interesting<00:02:07.180> of<00:02:07.300> course<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.690> boat<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:08.200> light

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
interesting of course the boat is light

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.949 
interesting of course the boat is light
so<00:02:08.950> that's<00:02:09.159> one<00:02:09.429> area<00:02:09.940> where<00:02:10.300> your<00:02:10.479> riot<00:02:10.659> goes

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
so that's one area where your riot goes

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.399 
so that's one area where your riot goes
to<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.830> other<00:02:12.069> area<00:02:12.639> is<00:02:12.909> that<00:02:13.239> open<00:02:13.629> sky<00:02:14.019> area

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
to the other area is that open sky area

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.059 
to the other area is that open sky area
and<00:02:15.329> the<00:02:16.329> third<00:02:16.689> area<00:02:17.049> where<00:02:17.379> your<00:02:17.590> third<00:02:18.040> and

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
and the third area where your third and

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.129 
and the third area where your third and
fourth<00:02:18.370> actually<00:02:18.849> where<00:02:18.999> your<00:02:19.120> eye<00:02:19.239> go<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.569> or

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:20.139 
fourth actually where your eye go to or

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.470 
fourth actually where your eye go to or
the<00:02:20.170> little<00:02:20.590> looks<00:02:20.889> like<00:02:21.040> paddle<00:02:21.519> boats<00:02:21.730> the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
the little looks like paddle boats the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.929 
the little looks like paddle boats the
yellow<00:02:22.840> seats<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.680> there's<00:02:23.889> one<00:02:24.249> that<00:02:24.430> stayed

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
yellow seats and there's one that stayed

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.530 
yellow seats and there's one that stayed
light<00:02:25.450> blue<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.709> those<00:02:27.040> colored<00:02:27.939> seats<00:02:28.299> are

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
light blue so those colored seats are

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.530 
light blue so those colored seats are
sort<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:29.109> distraction<00:02:30.239> although<00:02:31.239> I'm<00:02:31.329> gonna

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
sort of a distraction although I'm gonna

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.170 
sort of a distraction although I'm gonna
crop<00:02:31.870> this<00:02:32.170> into<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.739> horizontal<00:02:33.129> I<00:02:33.639> think<00:02:33.939> it

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
crop this into a horizontal I think it

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.129 
crop this into a horizontal I think it
still<00:02:34.480> may<00:02:34.659> be<00:02:34.689> a<00:02:34.870> good<00:02:35.139> vertical<00:02:35.680> if<00:02:36.129> I<00:02:37.139> darken

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
still may be a good vertical if I darken

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.080 
still may be a good vertical if I darken
the<00:02:38.290> sky<00:02:38.620> up<00:02:38.859> a<00:02:39.010> little<00:02:39.310> bit<00:02:39.489> more<00:02:39.700> however

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
the sky up a little bit more however

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.690 
the sky up a little bit more however
we're<00:02:40.540> gonna<00:02:40.659> crop<00:02:41.109> this<00:02:41.409> horizontal<00:02:42.249> and

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
we're gonna crop this horizontal and

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.209 
we're gonna crop this horizontal and
this<00:02:42.909> is<00:02:43.120> how<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.420> looks<00:02:43.659> after<00:02:44.049> I<00:02:44.349> clone<00:02:44.920> out

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.219 
this is how it looks after I clone out

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:49.170 
this is how it looks after I clone out
those<00:02:46.319> yellow<00:02:47.319> seats<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:48.249> the<00:02:48.549> light<00:02:48.819> blue

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
those yellow seats and the light blue

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.890 
those yellow seats and the light blue
seats<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:50.590> way<00:02:50.859> these<00:02:51.790> colors<00:02:52.269> are<00:02:52.540> not<00:02:52.840> a

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
seats this way these colors are not a

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.979 
seats this way these colors are not a
distraction<00:02:53.499> to<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:53.950> image<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:55.540> also<00:02:55.749> took

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
distraction to the image and I also took

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.309 
distraction to the image and I also took
out<00:02:56.469> like<00:02:56.769> cropped<00:02:57.249> out<00:02:57.519> actually<00:02:57.849> the<00:02:58.450> light

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
out like cropped out actually the light

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.949 
out like cropped out actually the light
spot<00:02:59.739> there<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.189> the<00:03:00.340> sky<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.420> now<00:03:01.629> your

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
spot there in the sky so now your

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.379 
spot there in the sky so now your
attention<00:03:02.499> flows<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.579> goes<00:03:03.849> right<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.299> the

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
attention flows it goes right to the

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.229 
attention flows it goes right to the
boat<00:03:04.659> it<00:03:05.230> starts<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.219> from<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.639> right<00:03:06.909> side

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
boat it starts in from the right side

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.619 
boat it starts in from the right side
here<00:03:08.219> and<00:03:09.219> then<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.579> course<00:03:09.849> your<00:03:10.329> eyes<00:03:10.480> just

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
here and then of course your eyes just

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.039 
here and then of course your eyes just
follow<00:03:11.139> it<00:03:11.379> to<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.129> boat<00:03:12.510> now<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.540> just<00:03:13.599> want<00:03:13.989> to

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
follow it to the boat now I just want to

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.739 
follow it to the boat now I just want to
mention<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:14.620> here<00:03:15.189> in<00:03:15.370> our<00:03:15.609> country<00:03:15.879> we<00:03:16.359> read

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:16.749 
mention that here in our country we read

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.619 
mention that here in our country we read
from<00:03:17.019> left<00:03:17.109> to<00:03:17.439> right<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:18.040> many<00:03:18.879> times<00:03:19.209> it's

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
from left to right so many times it's

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.129 
from left to right so many times it's
more<00:03:20.019> of<00:03:20.409> a<00:03:20.680> natural<00:03:21.519> thing<00:03:22.239> if<00:03:22.419> our<00:03:22.599> eye<00:03:22.629> goes

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
more of a natural thing if our eye goes

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.519 
more of a natural thing if our eye goes
from<00:03:23.439> left<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.859> right<00:03:24.129> however<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.209> tried

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:25.529 
from left to right however I tried

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:27.989 
from left to right however I tried
flipping<00:03:26.529> this<00:03:26.739> but<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.099> didn't<00:03:27.370> look<00:03:27.549> as<00:03:27.760> good

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:27.999 
flipping this but it didn't look as good

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.179 
flipping this but it didn't look as good
so<00:03:28.269> I'm<00:03:28.359> just<00:03:28.540> leaving<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.079> one<00:03:29.319> as<00:03:29.529> it<00:03:29.739> is<00:03:29.859> so

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:30.189 
so I'm just leaving this one as it is so

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.979 
so I'm just leaving this one as it is so
here<00:03:30.400> we<00:03:30.489> have<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:30.760> boats<00:03:30.969> of<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:31.359> left<00:03:31.659> third

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
here we have the boats of the left third

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.339 
here we have the boats of the left third
side<00:03:32.769> of<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.129> image<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:34.299> sky<00:03:34.629> of<00:03:34.840> course<00:03:35.139> is

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
side of the image the sky of course is

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.009 
side of the image the sky of course is
the<00:03:35.469> 2/3<00:03:36.010> up<00:03:36.279> on<00:03:36.459> top<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:37.569> is<00:03:37.779> the<00:03:37.900> image

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
the 2/3 up on top so this is the image

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.209 
the 2/3 up on top so this is the image
and<00:03:38.409> then<00:03:38.739> here<00:03:39.159> after<00:03:39.549> we<00:03:39.669> mount<00:03:39.969> it<00:03:40.180> onto<00:03:40.419> a

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:41.219 
and then here after we mount it onto a

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.640 
and then here after we mount it onto a
blackboard<00:03:42.219> and<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:43.510> use<00:03:43.779> some<00:03:44.109> of<00:03:44.139> the<00:03:44.319> tones

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
blackboard and I use some of the tones

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.899 
blackboard and I use some of the tones
from<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.099> sky<00:03:45.430> gave<00:03:45.849> it<00:03:46.029> that<00:03:46.239> border<00:03:47.909> that's

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
from the sky gave it that border that's

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.299 
from the sky gave it that border that's
how<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.269> looks<00:03:49.480> after<00:03:49.719> it's<00:03:50.049> done<00:03:50.319> however<00:03:50.799> we

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:51.309 
how it looks after it's done however we

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:53.549 
how it looks after it's done however we
took<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:51.700> one<00:03:51.939> step<00:03:51.969> further<00:03:52.480> here<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.349> gave

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:53.559 
took it one step further here and I gave

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:56.069 
took it one step further here and I gave
it<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:54.010> crackle<00:03:54.609> or<00:03:54.790> texture<00:03:55.419> on<00:03:55.629> here<00:03:55.989> as

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
it that crackle or texture on here as

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.189 
it that crackle or texture on here as
well<00:03:56.379> and<00:03:56.949> after<00:03:57.699> I<00:03:57.939> gave<00:03:57.999> it<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.359> texture<00:03:58.930> I

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199 
well and after I gave it the texture I

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.629 
well and after I gave it the texture I
back<00:03:59.559> T<00:03:59.829> opacity<00:04:00.790> off<00:04:00.969> slightly<00:04:01.769> so<00:04:02.769> as<00:04:03.189> to<00:04:03.489> not

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
back T opacity off slightly so as to not

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
earlier days of print competition in the

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.799 
earlier days of print competition in the
days<00:04:10.120> of<00:04:10.299> film<00:04:10.719> and<00:04:11.279> chemistry<00:04:12.279> I<00:04:12.569> purchased<00:04:13.569> a

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:13.809 
days of film and chemistry I purchased a

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:15.720 
days of film and chemistry I purchased a
texture<00:04:14.559> screen<00:04:14.889> it<00:04:15.069> was<00:04:15.189> called

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
texture screen it was called

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.490 
texture screen it was called
and<00:04:15.909> it<00:04:16.090> was<00:04:16.209> something<00:04:16.660> like<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:17.019> one<00:04:17.260> it

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
and it was something like this one it

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.949 
and it was something like this one it
was<00:04:17.680> called<00:04:17.980> I<00:04:18.160> think<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.609> crackle<00:04:19.239> or<00:04:19.389> one<00:04:19.660> and

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
was called I think a crackle or one and

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.800 
was called I think a crackle or one and
it<00:04:20.650> wasn't<00:04:20.830> sixteen<00:04:21.430> by<00:04:21.580> twenty<00:04:21.610> so<00:04:22.420> after<00:04:22.750> I

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
it wasn't sixteen by twenty so after I

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.040 
it wasn't sixteen by twenty so after I
purchased<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:23.470> I<00:04:23.500> sent<00:04:23.950> that<00:04:24.130> out<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.880> my<00:04:25.000> lab

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
purchased that I sent that out to my lab

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.219 
purchased that I sent that out to my lab
and<00:04:26.340> occasionally<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.400> would<00:04:27.610> use<00:04:28.030> that<00:04:28.060> on<00:04:28.660> one

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
and occasionally I would use that on one

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.050 
and occasionally I would use that on one
of<00:04:29.259> my<00:04:29.440> competition<00:04:29.979> prints<00:04:30.460> so<00:04:30.759> what<00:04:30.940> they

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
of my competition prints so what they

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.659 
of my competition prints so what they
did<00:04:31.120> was<00:04:31.330> they<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:32.770> developer<00:04:33.430> would

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
did was they the developer would

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.800 
did was they the developer would
actually<00:04:34.210> lay<00:04:35.050> this<00:04:35.889> Texas<00:04:36.759> screen<00:04:37.060> over<00:04:37.690> the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
actually lay this Texas screen over the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.290 
actually lay this Texas screen over the
enlarging<00:04:38.289> paper<00:04:38.680> on<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.069> easel<00:04:39.490> as<00:04:39.669> they

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
enlarging paper on the easel as they

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.540 
enlarging paper on the easel as they
shown<00:04:40.659> the<00:04:40.900> enlarger<00:04:41.470> down<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:42.099> the<00:04:42.220> image

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
shown the enlarger down and the image

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.659 
shown the enlarger down and the image
went<00:04:42.970> through<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.509> texture<00:04:43.990> screen<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:45.490> he

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
went through the texture screen and he

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.240 
went through the texture screen and he
gave<00:04:45.879> it<00:04:46.030> this<00:04:46.180> kind<00:04:46.419> of<00:04:46.569> an<00:04:46.720> effect<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.409> in

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
gave it this kind of an effect and in

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.490 
gave it this kind of an effect and in
some<00:04:48.550> cases<00:04:48.849> say<00:04:49.360> for<00:04:49.629> instance<00:04:49.930> they<00:04:50.080> gave<00:04:50.319> it

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
some cases say for instance they gave it

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.930 
some cases say for instance they gave it
a<00:04:50.940> 15-second<00:04:51.940> exposure<00:04:52.409> maybe<00:04:53.409> after<00:04:53.979> half

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
a 15-second exposure maybe after half

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.260 
a 15-second exposure maybe after half
the<00:04:55.300> exposure<00:04:55.810> time<00:04:56.610> would<00:04:57.610> be<00:04:57.789> with<00:04:58.090> the

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
the exposure time would be with the

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.059 
the exposure time would be with the
texture<00:04:58.720> screen<00:04:59.020> off<00:04:59.319> and<00:04:59.710> then<00:04:59.800> they<00:04:59.919> would

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
texture screen off and then they would

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:00.860 
texture screen off and then they would
do<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.340> other<00:05:00.370> half

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
do the other half

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.480 
do the other half
they<00:05:01.870> would<00:05:02.050> put<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.349> texture<00:05:02.680> screen<00:05:03.099> back

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
they would put the texture screen back

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.290 
they would put the texture screen back
on<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.960> that's<00:05:05.110> how<00:05:05.319> that's<00:05:05.530> done<00:05:05.909> so<00:05:06.909> this<00:05:07.120> is

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
on so that's how that's done so this is

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.600 
on so that's how that's done so this is
how<00:05:07.479> it<00:05:07.630> looks<00:05:07.870> after<00:05:08.110> it's<00:05:08.620> all<00:05:08.860> done<00:05:09.159> and

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
how it looks after it's all done and

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.969 
how it looks after it's all done and
this<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.330> just<00:05:10.659> a<00:05:10.720> nice<00:05:10.900> way<00:05:11.169> of<00:05:11.199> how<00:05:11.710> you<00:05:11.740> can
