00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.690 

you<00:00:44.860> get<00:00:45.010> this<00:00:45.100> ripple<00:00:45.810> ripple<00:00:46.810> effects<00:00:47.230> are

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
you get this ripple ripple effects are

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.140 
you get this ripple ripple effects are
and<00:00:49.090> then<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:49.420> can<00:00:49.630> open<00:00:50.410> up<00:00:50.580> I'm<00:00:51.580> can<00:00:51.850> design

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
and then you can open up I'm can design

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.440 
and then you can open up I'm can design
your<00:00:52.360> own<00:00:52.420> home<00:00:52.840> screens<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.910> if<00:00:55.060> you<00:00:55.150> go<00:00:55.300> into

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
your own home screens so if you go into

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.350 
your own home screens so if you go into
us<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:57.010> if<00:00:57.130> these<00:00:57.310> things<00:00:57.550> they<00:00:57.700> use<00:00:57.730> a<00:00:58.060> lots

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
us and if these things they use a lots

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:07.290 
us and if these things they use a lots
of<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.940> hold<00:01:01.180> it's<00:01:01.690> already<00:01:01.990> been<00:01:02.140> in<00:01:02.350> drag
