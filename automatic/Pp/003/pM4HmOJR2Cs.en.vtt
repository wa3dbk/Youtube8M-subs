00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 I want to learn maths sign up 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.430
 come with me 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.770
 think of the place with three figures 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.480
 different 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.550
 now that number is to invent 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.940
 public the difference between these two 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.850
 numbers there was the result the difference 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.130
 You will reverse again and now you will. 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.000
 sum the result of the difference as if the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.529
 converse 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.789
 the result was 33 squared 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.730
 I'm not 1.089 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.100
 How do I know that, my friends? 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.960
 very simple just attention in the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.149
 explanation 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.160
 this is the river math channel 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:47.070
 Write the explanation well then I'll go 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.579
 draw here is a rhythm which 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.949
 hundreds of dozens of units 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.480
 let's now realize the calculations that 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.879
 were made 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.739
 first because you will choose the number of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.059
 three distinct digits so I'll put 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.329
 here abc 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.830
 all different from each other and then I 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.130
 I asked to reverse this number. 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.439
 then this number would be the c &amp; b to let 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.570
 consider that the air is larger than you 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.790
 we can carry out the subtraction here 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.979
 so the first thing is to subtract the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.420
 number of the other then abc 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:26.479
 there are hundreds of dozens less units 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.329
 six hundred b tens and the unit 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.049
 How much and then , what is it? 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:37.229
 as we are considering here the the 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.930
 bigger than them and then we have to be - 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.990
 I would not give to do the subtraction we have 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.570
 to borrow for the baby 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.970
 when we borrow because we 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.950
 we have to see now it will be worth less 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.149
 that being 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.329
 it will count c + 10 agree with me already 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:02.040
 I lent a dozen b side 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:05.070
 so if 10 more - it's going to stay like this 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.500
 more 10 - the right hit 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.000
 this here in the house of the units and in the house 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.830
 from the dozens hour - 1 - see this too 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.640
 you can not subtract 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.500
 borrow here donate here will be worth to -1 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.080
 and then asking a hundred borrowed 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.590
 one hundred and ten tens and that goes 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.600
 be extended to nine more since I 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:33.240
 had before and less one but the tens 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.430
 I lent side to 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.770
 then here would be well over nine're 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.570
 right there and doing the subtraction well 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.680
 9 more - b 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.320
 here it will give 9 since b cancels with the bb 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.680
 There'll be 19 then repairs on the house. 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:54.530
 of the tens will always have 19 ac and a - 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.520
 1 - and stayed here for 16 years and 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.959
 then we will do what I asked 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.120
 to reverse the result of the 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.480
 subtraction and add these two numbers 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.020
 so I'm going to have less than 10 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.860
 but if here I will be 19 again 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:14.340
 and here I 'll have less be less one 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.770
 but the a1 is those figures here 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.590
 inverted and then when to calculate this 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.030
 sum will end then with the bills 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:27.390
 What do I have to do? I'll have the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:31.230
 next - plus a 0 c - e is 0 10 - 11 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:36.030
 it will be 99 plus nine to 18 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:40.769
 leaves eight and goes one up here less 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.220
 to 0 - and another 60 minus a 10 will give 9 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:48.739
 with this 1 to 10 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:55.140
 then the answer will always be equal to 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:57.870
 1.089 very cool even if you liked it 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.530
 of the video and those and joycinha add 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.690
 jazz or corinthians sign up for the channel 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.000
 math short river also other two 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.890
 videos from the channel and meet my others 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.080
 projects here on youtube 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.739
 a big hug to everyone and even the 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.739
