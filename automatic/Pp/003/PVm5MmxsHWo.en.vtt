00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
right into it alright guys so here is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.790 
right into it alright guys so here is
just<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.540> quick<00:00:35.780> look<00:00:37.060> so<00:00:38.060> as<00:00:38.960> far<00:00:39.170> as<00:00:39.230> any

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
just a quick look so as far as any

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.550 
just a quick look so as far as any
changes<00:00:40.520> goes<00:00:40.730> from<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.600> midsole<00:00:41.990> cushion

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
changes goes from the midsole cushion

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.830 
changes goes from the midsole cushion
and<00:00:42.710> traction<00:00:42.950> down<00:00:43.480> everything<00:00:44.480> is<00:00:44.600> exactly

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
and traction down everything is exactly

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.610 
and traction down everything is exactly
the<00:00:45.200> same<00:00:45.290> as<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:47.690> CP<00:00:48.350> 3.6<00:00:49.989> so<00:00:50.989> traction<00:00:51.530> and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
the same as the CP 3.6 so traction and

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.770 
the same as the CP 3.6 so traction and
cushion<00:00:51.950> will<00:00:52.280> probably<00:00:52.700> be<00:00:52.880> beast<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:53.570> will

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
cushion will probably be beast so will

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.680 
cushion will probably be beast so will
the<00:00:54.020> torsional<00:00:54.800> support<00:00:55.329> for<00:00:56.329> those<00:00:56.450> of<00:00:56.600> you

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
the torsional support for those of you

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.360 
the torsional support for those of you
wondering<00:00:56.840> you<00:00:57.170> can<00:00:57.200> feel<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.860> arch<00:00:58.040> in<00:00:58.190> here

it's fairly pronounced so if you have a
low<00:01:01.309> sitting<00:01:01.550> arch<00:01:01.850> these<00:01:02.809> might<00:01:03.050> be<00:01:03.200> a<00:01:03.230> little

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
low sitting arch these might be a little

low sitting arch these might be a little
bit<00:01:03.559> uncomfortable<00:01:03.829> for<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:04.369> if<00:01:04.489> you<00:01:04.579> have<00:01:04.670> a

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
high arch these might be one of those

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:08.739

case<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.219> different<00:01:17.770> as<00:01:18.770> far<00:01:18.799> as<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.130> upper<00:01:19.579> is

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:19.639 
case is different as far as the upper is

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:21.129 
case is different as far as the upper is
concerned<00:01:20.030> obviously<00:01:20.569> the<00:01:20.689> design<00:01:20.840> is

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
concerned obviously the design is

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:24.969 
concerned obviously the design is
different<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:23.359> went<00:01:23.630> with<00:01:24.020> more<00:01:24.469> of<00:01:24.709> a

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
different and you went with more of a

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.949 
different and you went with more of a
premium<00:01:25.340> type<00:01:25.819> feel<00:01:26.090> where<00:01:26.359> they<00:01:26.539> use<00:01:26.719> new

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:26.959 
premium type feel where they use new

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:30.219 
premium type feel where they use new
bucks<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:27.709> synthetics<00:01:28.520> instead<00:01:29.479> of<00:01:29.749> the

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
bucks and synthetics instead of the

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.319 
bucks and synthetics instead of the
fused<00:01:31.189> material<00:01:31.700> which<00:01:31.819> is<00:01:31.939> something<00:01:32.090> that<00:01:32.209> I

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
fused material which is something that I

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.999 
fused material which is something that I
actually<00:01:32.509> like<00:01:33.249> they<00:01:34.249> have<00:01:34.490> increased<00:01:35.029> the

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
actually like they have increased the

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.989 
actually like they have increased the
ventilation<00:01:38.200> sort<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.369> they<00:01:40.369> have<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.670> vent

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
ventilation sort of they have that vent

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.489 
ventilation sort of they have that vent
here<00:01:41.240> just<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:41.749> you<00:01:41.840> can<00:01:41.929> see<00:01:42.079> my<00:01:42.229> finger

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
here just so you can see my finger

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.289 
here just so you can see my finger
through<00:01:42.649> it<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:43.609> then<00:01:43.729> they<00:01:43.759> have<00:01:43.969> also

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
through it and then they have also

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.269 
through it and then they have also
reduced<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:44.869> thickness<00:01:45.529> of<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.799> tongue<00:01:45.979> so

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:46.279 
reduced the thickness of the tongue so

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:47.819 
reduced the thickness of the tongue so
it's<00:01:46.399> just<00:01:46.549> a<00:01:46.639> little<00:01:46.849> bit<00:01:46.939> more<00:01:47.149> Airy

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
it's just a little bit more Airy

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.349 
it's just a little bit more Airy
it'll<00:01:48.829> allow<00:01:48.950> for<00:01:49.249> airflow<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.819> get<00:01:50.060> in<00:01:50.209> and

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
it'll allow for airflow to get in and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.080 
it'll allow for airflow to get in and
out<00:01:50.420> much<00:01:50.719> easier<00:01:51.159> as<00:01:52.159> long<00:01:52.399> as<00:01:52.670> well<00:01:52.880> as<00:01:52.969> these

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
out much easier as long as well as these

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.269 
out much easier as long as well as these
vents<00:01:53.389> here<00:01:53.630> which<00:01:53.749> are<00:01:53.869> on<00:01:53.959> the<00:01:54.049> side<00:01:54.279> these

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
vents here which are on the side these

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:57.279 
vents here which are on the side these
are<00:01:55.340> modeled<00:01:56.090> after<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.420> air<00:01:56.599> jordan<00:01:56.869> 13

which<00:01:57.649> is<00:01:57.679> Chris<00:01:58.099> Paul's<00:01:58.340> favorite<00:01:58.549> sneaker

00:01:59.019 --> 00:01:59.029 
which is Chris Paul's favorite sneaker

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:01.089 
which is Chris Paul's favorite sneaker
so<00:01:59.569> that's<00:01:59.810> where<00:02:00.020> these<00:02:00.289> little<00:02:00.439> pod<00:02:00.740> things

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
so that's where these little pod things

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.309 
so that's where these little pod things
come<00:02:01.369> in<00:02:01.520> from<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:01.999> then<00:02:02.509> they<00:02:02.719> emphasize

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
come in from and then they emphasize

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:04.690 
come in from and then they emphasize
that<00:02:03.529> a<00:02:03.560> little<00:02:03.799> bit<00:02:03.919> further<00:02:04.189> with<00:02:04.429> this

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
that a little bit further with this

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.050 
that a little bit further with this
model<00:02:05.090> by<00:02:05.659> adding<00:02:06.109> the<00:02:06.319> triangle<00:02:06.950> patterns<00:02:07.880> on

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
model by adding the triangle patterns on

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.199 
model by adding the triangle patterns on
the<00:02:08.149> sidewalls<00:02:08.630> as<00:02:09.379> well<00:02:09.709> as<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.340> tab<00:02:10.909> that

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
the sidewalls as well as the tab that

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.350 
the sidewalls as well as the tab that
you<00:02:11.299> would<00:02:11.420> see<00:02:11.629> on<00:02:11.659> the<00:02:12.189> 13s<00:02:13.189> themselves

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
you would see on the 13s themselves

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.480 
you would see on the 13s themselves
you<00:02:14.480> can<00:02:14.600> also<00:02:14.750> see<00:02:15.080> some<00:02:15.110> mesh<00:02:15.980> right<00:02:16.220> here

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
you can also see some mesh right here

which is pretty much the same mesh that
they<00:02:18.830> use<00:02:18.980> on<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.190> Air<00:02:19.550> Jordan<00:02:19.580> 11<00:02:20.140> this<00:02:21.140> is

right there at the toe whereas the other

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.060 
right there at the toe whereas the other
one<00:02:28.340> was<00:02:28.580> just<00:02:28.610> one<00:02:28.940> solid<00:02:29.390> piece<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.870> fuse

it<00:02:39.080> as<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.260> sculpted<00:02:40.010> heel<00:02:40.190> mold<00:02:40.460> which<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.870> my

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
it as a sculpted heel mold which in my

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.280 
it as a sculpted heel mold which in my
opinion<00:02:42.200> should<00:02:42.710> work<00:02:43.220> better<00:02:43.750> for<00:02:44.750> heel<00:02:45.050> walk

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
opinion should work better for heel walk

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.740 
opinion should work better for heel walk

hold the heel in there kind of pushed it
out<00:04:04.220> further<00:04:04.940> than<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.330> should<00:04:05.510> have<00:04:05.600> been<00:04:06.250> and

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
out further than it should have been and

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.940 
out further than it should have been and
same<00:04:07.580> thing<00:04:07.790> there<00:04:08.090> so<00:04:08.650> ventilation<00:04:09.650> wasn't

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
same thing there so ventilation wasn't

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.470 
same thing there so ventilation wasn't
too<00:04:10.130> great<00:04:10.310> on<00:04:10.519> these<00:04:10.670> guys<00:04:10.970> so<00:04:11.180> these<00:04:11.299> guys

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
have beefed it up just a little bit not

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.920 
have beefed it up just a little bit not
anything<00:04:13.519> crazy<00:04:13.970> but<00:04:14.269> just<00:04:14.510> enough<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:16.930> and

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
anything crazy but just enough so and

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.449 
anything crazy but just enough so and
then<00:04:18.109> like<00:04:18.560> I<00:04:18.680> was<00:04:18.739> saying<00:04:18.979> with<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.190> fuse

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
then like I was saying with the fuse

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.400 
then like I was saying with the fuse
here<00:04:19.760> it's<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.180> little<00:04:20.390> bit<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.690> little<00:04:21.260> bit

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
here it's a little bit a little bit

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.740 
here it's a little bit a little bit
thick<00:04:21.769> not<00:04:22.550> too<00:04:22.580> bad<00:04:22.910> to<00:04:23.060> wear<00:04:23.180> like<00:04:23.390> hindered

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
thick not too bad to wear like hindered

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.840 
thick not too bad to wear like hindered
mobility<00:04:24.620> or<00:04:24.740> flexibility<00:04:25.310> but<00:04:25.520> with<00:04:25.729> the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
mobility or flexibility but with the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.300 
mobility or flexibility but with the
mesh<00:04:26.030> here

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
mesh here

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.170 
mesh here
it's<00:04:26.370> gonna<00:04:26.490> be<00:04:26.790> just<00:04:27.540> increased<00:04:29.180> mobility

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
it's gonna be just increased mobility

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.000 
it's gonna be just increased mobility
just<00:04:30.810> slightly<00:04:31.080> right<00:04:31.410> where<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.590> foot

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
just slightly right where that foot

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.810 
just slightly right where that foot
striker<00:04:32.340> bend<00:04:32.700> is<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:35.160> there<00:04:36.000> is<00:04:36.210> that

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
striker bend is so there is that

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.400 
striker bend is so there is that
everything<00:04:38.820> else<00:04:38.970> is<00:04:39.210> exactly<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:40.020> same<00:04:40.230> as

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
everything else is exactly the same as

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:47.920 
everything else is exactly the same as
far<00:04:40.590> as<00:04:40.740> like<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.889> midsole<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.669> outsole

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.000 

alright<00:04:48.930> guys<00:04:49.110> so<00:04:49.320> that<00:04:49.440> pretty<00:04:49.620> much<00:04:49.770> takes

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
alright guys so that pretty much takes

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.050 
alright guys so that pretty much takes
care<00:04:50.310> of<00:04:50.340> it

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
care of it

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.240 
care of it
stay<00:04:51.510> tuned<00:04:51.720> for<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:52.080> performance<00:04:52.830> review<00:04:52.980> it

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
stay tuned for a performance review it

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
stay tuned for a performance review it
should<00:04:53.430> be<00:04:53.580> pretty<00:04:53.790> quick

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
should be pretty quick

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.690 
should be pretty quick
mostly<00:04:54.990> because<00:04:55.200> hardly<00:04:56.070> anything's<00:04:56.490> been

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
mostly because hardly anything's been

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.260 
mostly because hardly anything's been
changed<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.240> just<00:04:57.510> wanted<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.900> see<00:04:58.169> if<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:59.270> heel

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
changed I just wanted to see if the heel

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.629 
changed I just wanted to see if the heel
lock<00:05:00.510> down<00:05:00.750> was<00:05:00.780> better<00:05:01.229> in<00:05:02.040> this<00:05:02.190> particular

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
lock down was better in this particular

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.090 
lock down was better in this particular
version<00:05:03.120> than<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:03.570> original<00:05:03.930> is<00:05:04.020> mainly<00:05:04.950> the

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
version than the original is mainly the

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.760 
version than the original is mainly the
only<00:05:05.460> reason<00:05:05.760> why<00:05:05.880> I<00:05:05.910> wanted<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.300> get<00:05:07.080> this

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
only reason why I wanted to get this

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.830 
only reason why I wanted to get this
pair<00:05:07.979> right<00:05:08.010> here<00:05:08.430> plus<00:05:09.180> when<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.419> saw<00:05:09.600> them<00:05:09.750> I

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
pair right here plus when I saw them I

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.680 
pair right here plus when I saw them I
was<00:05:09.870> like<00:05:10.020> security<00:05:10.500> I'll<00:05:10.620> just<00:05:10.740> do<00:05:10.889> it<00:05:11.040> so<00:05:11.690> but

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
was like security I'll just do it so but

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.510 
was like security I'll just do it so but
yeah<00:05:12.840> so<00:05:12.990> I<00:05:13.020> just<00:05:13.200> want<00:05:13.350> to<00:05:13.380> see<00:05:13.560> if<00:05:14.130> there<00:05:14.370> is

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
yeah so I just want to see if there is

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.270 
yeah so I just want to see if there is
additional<00:05:15.240> heel<00:05:15.690> lock<00:05:15.930> down<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.470> so<00:05:16.979> this

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
additional heel lock down and so this

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.580 
additional heel lock down and so this
should<00:05:17.520> not<00:05:18.150> take<00:05:18.330> too<00:05:18.389> long<00:05:18.750> at<00:05:18.900> all<00:05:18.990> I'll

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
should not take too long at all I'll

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.020 
should not take too long at all I'll
probably<00:05:19.800> play<00:05:20.070> them<00:05:20.220> just<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:20.460> few<00:05:20.610> times<00:05:20.850> just

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
probably play them just a few times just

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.050 
probably play them just a few times just
