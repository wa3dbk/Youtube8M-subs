00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.700
 and cookie decoration 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.980
 ingredients 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.170
 implements to use 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.629
 once we have ready the royal there 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.250
 zinc we will distribute it in different 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.300
 containers to start forming 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.699
 colors 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.970
 on the back of the box are shown 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.919
 some colors and the amount of droplets 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.680
 that must be applied to form it 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.680
 we will start forming the green color 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:40.390
 we add 4 droplets of yellow and then 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.640
 8 droplets of blue now we stir as 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.220
 Christmas is a special need 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.220
 form the red however it does not 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.170
 find the instructions of the box 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.390
 after experimenting it was possible to obtain 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.110
 the red by applying 20 droplets of 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.110
 dyes 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.320
 now we must modify one of the 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.390
 consistencies for the stuffing for it 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.390
 we will use water with a spoon 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.000
 Fill density will be ready 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.930
 When falling do not leave furrows 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.660
 if so, add a little more water 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.900
 Now we get to the point because when we fall 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.210
 Quickly mix the consistency for 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.450
 the filling of the red color was obtained 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.640
 with only one teaspoon of water 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.350
 that it already had 20 droplets of 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.530
 dyes 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.360
 in summary we put two one and two 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.880
 teaspoons of water 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.190
 we already have the dense pastes for the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.610
 eyeliner and the finest for the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.610
 filling 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.270
 another way to prove consistency is 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.880
 pulling a line and then another that the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.850
 cut in the delineate paste will remain 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.240
 one line mounted on the other and on the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.909
 fill will be fused to perform the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.459
 drawn from the delineate the 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.000
 nozzle so that the paste falls into the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.799
 air if it creeps will be distorted if 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.799
 it rises will remain uniform 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.980
 the toothpick is used for these 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.340
 final tips and correct 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.610
 imperfections we deposit the filling in 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.770
 sleeves or bags 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.410
 and we'll cut the tip only when it 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.240
 are going to use the paste should 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.620
 stay well covered so you do not 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.140
 I know that 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.810
 to decorate we will first make the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.230
 delineated since this will give you the 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.980
 containment to the filling preventing it from 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.340
 fall so the form will remain intact 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.450
 of the figure 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.790
 with the toothpick we join the tips 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.920
 we place the filling and move it 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.920
 from the center to the extremes 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.350
 now we will use the red color so 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.590
 we will both cut off the tip of the bag 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.550
 dropping droplets we will make the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.550
 Christmas balls 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.269
 to give the impression that they are hanging 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.269
 drag them with the toothpick 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.970
 now we will make a Christmas stick 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:46.489
 which you can leave with dots 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.489
 red or draw hearts 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.690
 now we will decorate a Christmas droplet 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:58.730
 of white and red colors 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.700
 Each color must carry its own 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.810
 eyeliner in this way we avoid that 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.810
 the fillers are mixed 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.019
 to stimulate a seam use the 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.019
 toothpick 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.459
 in this little bell we made the outline 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:24.130
 in red and white filling 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.130
 and on we put red dots 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.949
 to decorate the little man of snow 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:37.460
 first we must do the body and the 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:40.639
 hat let them dry and once 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.300
 be ready and we look for the face and its 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.300
 accessories 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.370
 this snow monkey is already 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.340
 completely dry so we can already 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.960
 draw the scarf the line the 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.960
 hat and buttons 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.160
 with melted chocolate coating 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.440
 we draw the face 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.470
 or you can simply form a new 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.930
 color using royal there's zinc and 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.419
 Colorant 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.680
 with the same coverage we draw the 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.320
 little arms 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.190
 below we present varied 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.030
 designs that can be made 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.030
 especially at Christmas time 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:14.800
 in the top right of this 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.520
 video will appear two links 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.680
 1 to prepare these cookies and the other 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.680
 to make the royal ice 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.110
