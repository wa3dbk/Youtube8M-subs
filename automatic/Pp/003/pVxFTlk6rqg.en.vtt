00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.299
 nice guys the ones that talk to you is like 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.370
 you can see I came back you are 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.859
 back with you with my second video 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.500
 first I wanted to thank everyone 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.990
 you the whole community because you have me 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.420
 later I saw I loved the 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.590
 my first video you also have some 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.500
 they also gave me advice 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.710
 to improve like that of the microphone 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.710
 Obviously then I follow then else 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.640
 what I wanted to tell you was that I'm preparing 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.910
 the live class series will be shadowed 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.990
 tearing because it is not easy to do in 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.570
 how good you have to have 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:50.770
 organization during the live and it is me 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.530
 organizing we say after these videos 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.690
 I will begin to record I think a little 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.000
 video with a slightly more decent microphone 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.420
 It will feel better so all of you 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.679
 will have the video I do not say is 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.439
 perfect because I'm not like that 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:09.939
 presumptuous but yes a good video a video 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.859
 with all the credentials to be 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.229
 a great video 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.609
 then today I believe it is 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.829
 the time has come to introduce the 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.450
 game today , I can talk a lot 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.999
 since the gameplay is long it lasts for you 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.909
 not then who was a rage station 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:28.689
 of this using the n 94 consequences with 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:32.140
 the adjustable lime and you will get a 49 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.149
 from the streak or c 30 49 killings of 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.649
 row think about dying without doing them 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.679
 reward killings which I think is 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.969
 really something very very good 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.399
 I was playing in a group with two of my own 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.340
 friends who are boron kruger now greet them 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.439
 you are seeing this video and yes 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.969
 because I was playing teams 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.299
 I tell you immediately why 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:55.060
 really this mode is in one 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.490
 good team is the most recommended for 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.159
 make good gameplay or the like in 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.840
 how much enemies will not always shoot at 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.249
 you can sometimes even find gods 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.499
 enemies who shoot each other 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:07.359
 however this is not the real reason there 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:10.330
 are other factors that I am not now 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:11.530
 but I know when I play 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.330
 let's say 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.000
 then since this is long 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.500
 commentari I could give you I can give you a 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.050
 little more information than the last time 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.080
 type sv to tell third parties everything else 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.760
 like bears abusing inflexible and indeed 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.830
 splinters that I think are a lot 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.420
 important as they arrive 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.860
 quickly ambu orbital state can 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.200
 be the most important thing in the game 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.420
 and anti-splinters you won't fly from one 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.860
 grenade at random similar things I think 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.720
 these two for better actions too 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.459
 because by now ghost is played for 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.970
 nuclear power is of no use as far as 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.799
 instead they will always have the disturbed web 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.700
 then how would it be points as you can 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.049
 to see I was using web of used time and 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.180
 now you will wonder why I was not 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.650
 using the club that even more useful me 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.870
 i was using the mp because to be honest 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.519
 I was looking for it but I was musler 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.980
 playing to make many points and 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.480
 obviously these three rewards are the 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.910
 more recommended as they will give you 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.000
 many points of assists and also many 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.310
 points there are all who will be made with 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.310
 the weapon we say and therefore instead of 25 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.100
 would take 50 or 100 points varies 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.430
 of mode to mode then yes 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.859
 guys what I wanted to tell you in 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.829
 practice was this now i will talk about a 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.019
 topic that is very popular on youtube 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.989
 and also quite inflated though 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.700
 I think it's right that I do too 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.180
 I believe that I too must face it 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.500
 this is the call out of duty ghost output 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.329
 this should be the tenth call of 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.750
 duty is in practice the tenth call of 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.680
 duty 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.630
 for me it's really nice to come out a 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.850
 call of duty of a different saga because 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.620
 maybe there will be innovations and 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.540
 so I'm also curious to see them 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.639
 but I have to tell you the truth, not me 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.130
 I waited for it when I went 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.980
 to get me mv 2 to take it back because ce 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.870
 I already had it and then sold it for want 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.109
 resume for more variety in 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.780
 channel I saw in the bulletin board of 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:08.989
 mediaworld this presale for 30 euros 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.359
 of call of duty mp4 and so now mi 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.739
 the excused question arises automatically 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.419
 but those who bought it have 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.079
 spent all in 3 30 euros have them 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:20.359
 throw yourself in the toilet or I don't know for 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.790
 luckily I didn't buy it and I hope that 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.370
 none of you bought it anyway 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.970
 because I did not really know 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.760
 what to tell you then by now I would still be 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.880
 very skeptical about ghost output though 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.360
 not all of these had come out 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.310
 information such as the new camouflage 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.180
 metric august that can be ordered 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.970
 great from the call of duty site 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.580
 or in mv 3 when you use the net 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.220
 game you will see very well 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.590
 good morning we are very proud of 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.020
 present you our new titles of 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.720
 call of duty physical decline then these 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.550
 are the main information 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.620
 leaked on call of duty cost and I believe 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:10.710
 that are very predictable a lot yes 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.070
 here they are a lot but they are alive in 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.450
 term are very credible we say 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:21.810
 even if it was not the term I wanted 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:24.780
 say now many youtubers have talked about 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.949
 this argument now serves no purpose what I say 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.720
 the names because it's not what you do 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:32.220
 advertising anyway I'll tell you the same 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.860
 they are wings and riff tor etcetera 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.900
 I think the release is very interesting 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.960
 again call of duty for as I already have 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.820
 said before I would not be repetitive 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.729
 thank you again thank you again 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.080
 for the support you gave me in 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.520
 my first video was a lot 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.710
 happy for me it was truly one 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.450
 satisfaction and in any case as I 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.010
 said earlier now I will inform you 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.360
 more amazon to take you through but 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.980
 better as many of you have me 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.170
 said I could improve 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.850
 so the video lasts seven minutes us 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.750
 we are at the fifth minute 50 of the 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.520
 registration 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.170
 since I don't do ladders either 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.940
 nothing else I had talked for three 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.610
 fine minutes this time I have to talk 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.440
 for 7 I don't have much to say vi 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.450
 I will probably leave you as a background 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.970
 a song so coming back bore you 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.620
 too much this last minute then now 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.140
 time to say goodbye 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.180
 I was really good with you on 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.790

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.310
 so left I like to comment on how 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:35.410

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.440
 a weight
