mount I think I might have a cheaper
alternative<00:00:22.189> for<00:00:23.000> you<00:00:23.149> it's<00:00:23.840> one<00:00:24.110> life<00:00:24.349> looked

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
alternative for you it's one life looked

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.190 
alternative for you it's one life looked
at<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:25.730> I<00:00:25.970> think<00:00:26.029> it<00:00:26.480> works<00:00:26.689> for<00:00:26.930> just<00:00:27.079> about

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
at and I think it works for just about

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.249 
at and I think it works for just about
every<00:00:27.590> occasion<00:00:27.860> I'd<00:00:28.160> like<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:28.489> use<00:00:28.640> it<00:00:28.790> for<00:00:29.259> so

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
every occasion I'd like to use it for so

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.150 
every occasion I'd like to use it for so
start<00:00:30.800> with<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:30.980> standard<00:00:31.189> GoPro<00:00:32.180> camera

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
start with the standard GoPro camera

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.840 
start with the standard GoPro camera
what<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:34.250> need<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.460> do<00:00:34.579> to<00:00:34.760> add<00:00:34.880> to<00:00:34.910> that<00:00:36.850> is

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
what you need to do to add to that is

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.650 
what you need to do to add to that is
the<00:00:38.080> standard<00:00:39.080> helmet<00:00:39.710> mount<00:00:40.300> that<00:00:41.300> normally

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
the standard helmet mount that normally

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.940 
the standard helmet mount that normally
comes<00:00:41.960> with<00:00:42.260> a<00:00:45.100> nylon<00:00:46.100> strap<00:00:47.620> but<00:00:48.620> we<00:00:48.800> won't

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
comes with a nylon strap but we won't

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.860 
comes with a nylon strap but we won't
use<00:00:49.160> that<00:00:49.190> for<00:00:49.850> what<00:00:50.060> I'm<00:00:50.270> thinking<00:00:50.810> of<00:00:52.870> to

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
use that for what I'm thinking of to

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.510 
use that for what I'm thinking of to
remove<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.260> nylon<00:00:54.530> strap<00:00:54.829> you<00:00:55.070> normally<00:00:55.430> have

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
remove the nylon strap you normally have

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.240 
remove the nylon strap you normally have
to<00:00:55.579> peel<00:00:56.030> back<00:00:56.060> the<00:00:56.540> rubber<00:00:57.290> padding<00:00:57.770> but<00:00:58.130> it

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
to peel back the rubber padding but it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.780 
to peel back the rubber padding but it
goes<00:00:58.430> back<00:00:58.610> quite<00:00:59.390> well<00:00:59.600> afterwards<00:01:00.640> so<00:01:01.640> what

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
goes back quite well afterwards so what

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.410 
goes back quite well afterwards so what
I've<00:01:01.910> then<00:01:02.120> done<00:01:02.420> is<00:01:02.690> I've<00:01:03.020> trimmed<00:01:03.890> back<00:01:04.420> some

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
I've then done is I've trimmed back some

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.280 
I've then done is I've trimmed back some
of<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.540> foam<00:01:05.750> padding<00:01:06.049> to<00:01:06.290> expose<00:01:06.680> these<00:01:07.009> lips

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
of the foam padding to expose these lips

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.690 
of the foam padding to expose these lips
at<00:01:09.290> both<00:01:09.590> sides<00:01:11.710> what<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:12.830> can<00:01:13.040> then<00:01:13.220> do<00:01:13.460> is

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
at both sides what you can then do is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.420 
at both sides what you can then do is
use<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.180> standard<00:01:14.720> GoPro<00:01:15.430> mounting

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
use the standard GoPro mounting

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.510 
use the standard GoPro mounting
attachments<00:01:17.290> so<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.650> straight<00:01:18.920> base

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.789 

as<00:01:22.520> such<00:01:24.430> then<00:01:25.430> add<00:01:25.760> to<00:01:26.000> that<00:01:26.150> a<00:01:26.540> normal<00:01:27.380> short

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
as such then add to that a normal short

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:36.050 
as such then add to that a normal short
connector

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.310 

and<00:01:37.060> they<00:01:37.150> just<00:01:37.330> normally<00:01:37.660> fit<00:01:37.870> in<00:01:38.020> as<00:01:38.140> they

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
and they just normally fit in as they

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.640 
and they just normally fit in as they
would<00:01:38.440> normally<00:01:40.080> not<00:01:41.080> sure<00:01:41.230> if<00:01:41.350> any<00:01:41.470> of<00:01:41.530> you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
would normally not sure if any of you

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.810 
would normally not sure if any of you
guys<00:01:41.830> actually<00:01:42.070> worked<00:01:42.400> out<00:01:42.550> what<00:01:42.700> these

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
guys actually worked out what these

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.130 
guys actually worked out what these
things<00:01:43.060> are<00:01:43.300> but<00:01:43.360> they're<00:01:43.660> just<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.930> little

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
things are but they're just a little

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.810 
things are but they're just a little
safety<00:01:44.350> retainer<00:01:44.980> that<00:01:45.160> just<00:01:45.340> pops<00:01:45.550> in<00:01:45.730> the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
safety retainer that just pops in the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.330 
safety retainer that just pops in the
base<00:01:46.000> just<00:01:46.300> to<00:01:46.450> stop<00:01:46.630> everything

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
base just to stop everything

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.010 
base just to stop everything
accidentally<00:01:48.340> coming<00:01:48.550> apart<00:01:48.910> but<00:01:49.240> the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
accidentally coming apart but the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.510 
accidentally coming apart but the
clipping<00:01:50.380> mechanism<00:01:50.890> is<00:01:50.980> pretty<00:01:51.220> tight

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
clipping mechanism is pretty tight

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.330 
clipping mechanism is pretty tight
anyway<00:01:51.970> so<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:53.500> may<00:01:53.620> not<00:01:53.800> actually<00:01:53.980> want<00:01:54.310> to

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
anyway so you may not actually want to

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.280 
anyway so you may not actually want to
use<00:01:54.400> that<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:57.280> then<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:58.540> just<00:01:58.750> loops<00:01:58.990> over

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
use that but then that just loops over

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.830 
use that but then that just loops over
the<00:01:59.380> handle<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:01.060> if<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.270> then<00:02:01.450> get<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.720> all

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
the handle and if you then get it all

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.160 
the handle and if you then get it all
lined<00:02:02.080> up<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:07.360> can<00:02:07.540> then<00:02:07.660> thread<00:02:08.020> that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
lined up you can then thread that

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:19.830 
lined up you can then thread that
together<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.640> tighten<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.030> up

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:31.899 

there<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.900> go<00:02:27.670> okay<00:02:29.769> so<00:02:30.769> all<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.519> need<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.790> do

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
there you go okay so all you need to do

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.589 
there you go okay so all you need to do
now<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:33.049> add<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.680> GoPro<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.549> that<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:35.450> what

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
now is to add the GoPro to that now what

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.449 
now is to add the GoPro to that now what
we're<00:02:35.719> trying<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.049> do<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.590> trying<00:02:36.889> to<00:02:36.980> mount<00:02:37.250> it

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
we're trying to do is trying to mount it

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.830 
we're trying to do is trying to mount it
on<00:02:37.639> the<00:02:37.819> back<00:02:37.969> of<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.180> wrist<00:02:38.389> like<00:02:39.139> that<00:02:40.840> so

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
on the back of the wrist like that so

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.619 
on the back of the wrist like that so
you<00:02:41.930> can<00:02:42.079> either<00:02:42.230> mount<00:02:42.439> the<00:02:42.620> GoPro<00:02:43.629> facing

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
you can either mount the GoPro facing

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.099 
you can either mount the GoPro facing
away<00:02:44.750> from<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:45.170> or<00:02:46.689> facing<00:02:47.689> towards<00:02:48.019> you

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
away from you or facing towards you

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.569 
away from you or facing towards you
depending<00:02:48.739> what<00:02:48.829> sort<00:02:49.069> of<00:02:49.099> camera<00:02:49.430> shot

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
depending what sort of camera shot

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.750 
depending what sort of camera shot
you're<00:02:49.790> after<00:02:50.680> I'll<00:02:51.680> attach<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.250> facing<00:02:52.669> away

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
you're after I'll attach it facing away

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.530 
you're after I'll attach it facing away
for<00:02:53.090> now<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.959> just<00:02:57.290> slop<00:02:57.530> those<00:02:57.739> in<00:02:57.889> together

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
for now and just slop those in together

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.099 
for now and just slop those in together
line<00:02:59.540> them<00:02:59.689> up<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:01.299> then<00:03:02.299> tighten<00:03:02.540> up<00:03:02.870> with

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
line them up and then tighten up with

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:11.619 
line them up and then tighten up with
the<00:03:04.269> normal<00:03:05.269> bolt<00:03:07.120> there<00:03:08.120> we<00:03:08.269> go<00:03:10.299> so<00:03:11.299> almost

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
the normal bolt there we go so almost

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.509 
the normal bolt there we go so almost
there<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.230> last<00:03:12.379> thing<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.709> do<00:03:12.859> now<00:03:13.069> is<00:03:13.310> to

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
there so the last thing to do now is to

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.280 
there so the last thing to do now is to
attach<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.299> to<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.480> wrist<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.989> what<00:03:18.169> I've<00:03:18.260> got

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
attach it to the wrist and what I've got

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.500 
attach it to the wrist and what I've got
there<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:19.189> can<00:03:19.340> get<00:03:19.430> these<00:03:19.579> from<00:03:19.790> most<00:03:20.030> DIY

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
there you can get these from most DIY

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.189 
there you can get these from most DIY
stores<00:03:20.870> it's<00:03:21.439> 20<00:03:22.189> millimeters<00:03:22.699> wide<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.329> it's

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
stores it's 20 millimeters wide and it's

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.199 
stores it's 20 millimeters wide and it's
a<00:03:24.349> velcro<00:03:24.739> strip<00:03:25.069> on<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.340> benefit<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.819> this<00:03:26.150> is

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
a velcro strip on the benefit of this is

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.710 
a velcro strip on the benefit of this is
that<00:03:26.449> actually<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:27.169> can<00:03:27.409> stick<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.340> itself

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
that actually you can stick to itself

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.550 
that actually you can stick to itself
quite<00:03:29.720> successfully<00:03:31.720> so<00:03:32.720> what<00:03:32.810> we<00:03:32.930> do<00:03:33.079> with

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
quite successfully so what we do with

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.250 
quite successfully so what we do with
this<00:03:33.709> is<00:03:34.189> we<00:03:34.430> will<00:03:34.519> thread<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:35.359> over<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.049> top

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
this is we will thread it over the top

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.140 
this is we will thread it over the top
loop<00:03:36.439> and<00:03:36.739> back<00:03:37.579> on<00:03:37.760> its<00:03:37.879> off<00:03:39.819> and<00:03:40.819> we'll<00:03:41.000> do

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
loop and back on its off and we'll do

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.050 
loop and back on its off and we'll do
something<00:03:41.389> similar<00:03:41.930> for<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.169> bottom<00:03:43.060> thread

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
something similar for the bottom thread

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.699 
something similar for the bottom thread
that<00:03:44.209> over<00:03:44.659> and<00:03:45.229> back<00:03:45.470> through<00:03:45.769> on<00:03:45.919> itself

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
that over and back through on itself

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.219 
that over and back through on itself
what<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:48.769> then<00:03:48.919> do<00:03:49.129> is<00:03:49.489> place<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.930> through

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
what you then do is place and through

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:57.749 
what you then do is place and through
the<00:03:51.349> loop<00:03:55.000> can<00:03:56.000> then<00:03:56.150> hold<00:03:56.359> it<00:03:56.479> pretty<00:03:56.720> tight

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:57.759 
the loop can then hold it pretty tight

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:02.679 
the loop can then hold it pretty tight
and<00:03:59.709> tighten<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.799> strap<00:04:01.400> back<00:04:01.609> down<00:04:01.939> and<00:04:02.479> it's

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:02.689 
and tighten the strap back down and it's

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:04.929 
and tighten the strap back down and it's
done<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.229> you<00:04:03.500> can<00:04:03.709> shorten<00:04:04.579> this<00:04:04.759> all

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:04.939 
done and you can shorten this all

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.899 
done and you can shorten this all
infinite<00:04:05.359> as<00:04:05.509> much<00:04:05.689> as<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:05.900> like<00:04:06.549> but<00:04:07.549> let's

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
infinite as much as you like but let's

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.589 
infinite as much as you like but let's
just<00:04:08.120> put<00:04:08.329> that<00:04:08.509> on<00:04:08.659> there<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:10.150> then<00:04:11.150> you've

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
just put that on there and then you've

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.020 
just put that on there and then you've
pretty<00:04:11.810> much<00:04:11.900> got<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.349> camera<00:04:12.680> set<00:04:12.709> mount<00:04:13.250> on

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
pretty much got the camera set mount on

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.129 
pretty much got the camera set mount on
your<00:04:14.209> hand<00:04:16.150> now<00:04:17.150> what<00:04:17.329> I'll<00:04:17.449> do<00:04:17.630> is<00:04:17.780> I'll<00:04:17.900> mount

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
your hand now what I'll do is I'll mount

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.189 
your hand now what I'll do is I'll mount
this<00:04:18.289> as<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.400> would<00:04:19.579> using<00:04:19.940> it<00:04:20.030> in<00:04:20.209> my<00:04:20.780> scuba

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
this as I would using it in my scuba

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.649 
this as I would using it in my scuba
diving<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:21.769> this<00:04:22.520> will<00:04:22.669> fit<00:04:22.820> on<00:04:22.849> a<00:04:22.970> glove<00:04:23.240> and

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
diving and this will fit on a glove and

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:31.040 
diving and this will fit on a glove and
that'd<00:04:24.139> be<00:04:24.320> quite<00:04:24.530> snug<00:04:24.830> fit

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.970 

tannaz<00:04:32.050> you<00:04:32.170> see<00:04:32.380> is<00:04:32.500> not<00:04:32.650> going<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.830> come<00:04:32.950> off

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
tannaz you see is not going to come off

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:42.450 
tannaz you see is not going to come off
accidentally<00:04:33.670> while<00:04:33.910> you're<00:04:34.090> diving<00:04:41.340> as<00:04:42.340> you

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
accidentally while you're diving as you

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.010 
accidentally while you're diving as you
can<00:04:42.580> see<00:04:42.700> the<00:04:42.790> dive<00:04:42.970> globe<00:04:43.210> is<00:04:43.360> pretty<00:04:43.570> pretty

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
can see the dive globe is pretty pretty

00:04:44.020 --> 00:05:04.220 
can see the dive globe is pretty pretty
chunky

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.160 

once<00:05:05.230> that's<00:05:05.440> on<00:05:05.620> that's<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.400> nice<00:05:06.580> neat<00:05:06.820> fit

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
once that's on that's a nice neat fit

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.390 
once that's on that's a nice neat fit
and<00:05:08.170> you<00:05:08.260> still<00:05:08.470> got<00:05:08.590> all<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.770> dexterity<00:05:09.160> to

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
and you still got all the dexterity to

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.550 
and you still got all the dexterity to
do<00:05:09.670> what<00:05:09.790> you<00:05:09.880> need<00:05:10.030> to<00:05:10.060> do<00:05:10.380> when<00:05:11.380> you<00:05:11.470> normally

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
do what you need to do when you normally

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.090 
do what you need to do when you normally
div'<00:05:12.870> so<00:05:13.870> hopefully<00:05:14.290> that's<00:05:14.470> a<00:05:14.530> nice<00:05:14.710> cheap
