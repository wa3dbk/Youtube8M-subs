00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.769
 the left throws Motorola Moto and school that's a cliche has millions 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.199
 here a 2 more pixel camera 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.390
 Children we want to test now unusually 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.880
 the chamber has it on the left instead of the right but if you can 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.439
 pressed these keys 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.059
 then you have to go to the camera then you have to keep it that way a bit 

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.539
 be careful that you have the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.539
 This does not obscure that goes pretty fast 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.130
 Here we have first look at the actionists 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.090
 because you can be here directly percent media go you can the video mode 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.970
 switch 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.570
 there is a self-timer serial Momo and then there is here 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.430
 again the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.440
 Camera setting via test time Identification Standard Name Memory clock Martz 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.830
 to save 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.640
 Percent news in the final 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.199
 then there are still separate picture settings video setting 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.690
 in the picture lineup can mean the resolution so we have here 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.090
 ran 1 2 million shares pixel just selected Hausen 200 times thousand Exner 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.290
 pixel 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.290
 Violation course and the quality 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.490
 and in which the video setting is also the larger 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.500
 Unfortunately, the highest resolution is 476 944 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.630
 not much 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.140
 the only thing you can choose is to pay less attention to its level 20 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.600
 times 6 90 pixels 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.660
 then there is go recording throne here 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.660
 Quality and video things 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.070
 investigated 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.740
 then we have here again to yes the speed dial so you can 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.750
 problem-free 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.290
 eight times digital zoom 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.380
 then you can just hold on here identifier 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.250
 rather remained 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.370
 Stierli and TAS 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.370
 Suleiman now 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.630
 and I have to say it actually looks amazingly good looking 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.139
 worse expected and in traffic Matter 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.139
 the colors are around Nokia and of course 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:16.099
 the photo is punishable so you can not complain 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.339
 Of course it will be difficult at night because the phone 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.579
 no beat is Hertha 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.549
 I think in good light conditions you can shoot a photo with the 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.019
 Man behind what can start 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.129
 so I'll have this picture now Munich 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.129
 because the daughters also one 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.899
 to record a video 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.899
 so also Kranig search here 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.909
 and the others are hiring 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.559
 that had slowed down so much 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.199
 In March 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.119
 and look at the result 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:05.779
 you can already see it here 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:07.739
 a small picture from the media 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.579
 but a bit blurred 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.579
 Just look here it actually looks like 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.689
 who narrow the sound recording very well 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.169
 and then the video and then natural is the way to be 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:27.150
 but that up to the fact that it can recognize that after all creates now 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:31.010
 finished the question how much with a video with too low a resolution 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.019
 can start 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.979
 but the camera makes a percentage 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.649
 yes quite good work 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:38.689
 their possibilities
