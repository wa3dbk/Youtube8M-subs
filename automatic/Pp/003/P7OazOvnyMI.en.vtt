00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
check my form and really work on that

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.950 
check my form and really work on that
slow-<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.670> contraction<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:51.570> chest

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
slow- and the contraction on my chest

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.080 
slow- and the contraction on my chest
again<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.740> mind<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.189> muscle<00:01:53.549> connection<00:01:54.000> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
again the mind to muscle connection you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.700 
again the mind to muscle connection you
have<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.479> what<00:01:54.720> muscle<00:01:55.110> you're<00:01:55.259> working

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
have to know what muscle you're working

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.920 
have to know what muscle you're working
so<00:01:56.460> when<00:01:56.610> my<00:01:56.729> delts<00:01:57.090> started<00:01:57.390> burning<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.750> knew

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
so when my delts started burning I knew

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.080 
so when my delts started burning I knew
I<00:01:57.960> was<00:01:58.170> doing<00:01:58.259> something<00:01:58.409> wrong<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.280> what<00:01:59.969> did

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
I was doing something wrong so what did

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.760 
I was doing something wrong so what did
I<00:02:00.149> do

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
I do

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.620 
I do
lighten<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.920> weight<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.369> that's<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> last

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
lighten the weight and that's the last

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.730 
lighten the weight and that's the last
thing<00:02:03.840> people<00:02:03.869> want<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> hear<00:02:04.500> when<00:02:04.649> they're

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
thing people want to hear when they're

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.679 
thing people want to hear when they're
working<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:05.189> lighten<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> weight<00:02:06.450> or

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
working out lighten the weight or

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.620 
working out lighten the weight or
lighten<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.079> load<00:02:07.259> old

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
lighten the load old

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.779 
lighten the load old
but<00:02:07.750> mainly<00:02:08.739> because<00:02:09.190> they<00:02:09.429> think<00:02:09.489> they're

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
but mainly because they think they're

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.339 
but mainly because they think they're
taking<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:10.179> step<00:02:10.420> backwards<00:02:10.720> when<00:02:11.230> in

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
taking a step backwards when in

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.040 
taking a step backwards when in
actuality<00:02:11.680> you're<00:02:12.250> just<00:02:13.209> improving<00:02:13.840> your

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
actuality you're just improving your

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.320 
actuality you're just improving your
form<00:02:14.349> you're<00:02:14.920> only<00:02:15.400> gonna<00:02:15.730> get<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.090> where<00:02:16.209> you

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
form you're only gonna get to where you

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.420 
form you're only gonna get to where you
want<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.540> be<00:02:16.630> faster<00:02:17.200> by<00:02:17.560> lightening<00:02:18.400> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
want to be faster by lightening the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.250 
want to be faster by lightening the
weight<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> little<00:02:18.910> bit<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.330> really<00:02:20.050> working

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
weight a little bit and really working

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.089 
weight a little bit and really working
the<00:02:20.500> muscle<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:20.950> you're<00:02:21.099> intending<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.610> work

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
the muscle that you're intending to work

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.490 
the muscle that you're intending to work
so<00:02:24.209> that's<00:02:25.209> pretty<00:02:25.450> much<00:02:25.660> as<00:02:25.870> my<00:02:26.019> whole<00:02:26.230> point

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
so that's pretty much as my whole point

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.110 
so that's pretty much as my whole point
you<00:02:26.709> know<00:02:26.830> don't<00:02:27.220> be<00:02:27.340> embarrassed<00:02:27.790> about<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
you know don't be embarrassed about the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.550 
you know don't be embarrassed about the
weight<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.569> lift<00:02:28.810> because<00:02:28.989> I<00:02:29.319> lift

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
weight that you lift because I lift

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.729 
weight that you lift because I lift
relatively<00:02:30.160> light<00:02:30.340> weight<00:02:30.580> for<00:02:30.880> my<00:02:31.000> size<00:02:31.269> and

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
relatively light weight for my size and

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.320 
relatively light weight for my size and
all<00:02:32.739> of<00:02:33.040> my<00:02:33.190> lifts<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.640> I've<00:02:33.760> been<00:02:33.910> doing<00:02:34.239> I

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
all of my lifts that I've been doing I

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.550 
all of my lifts that I've been doing I
actually<00:02:34.630> dropped<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.019> weight<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.200> little<00:02:35.380> bit

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
actually dropped the weight a little bit

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.070 
actually dropped the weight a little bit
and<00:02:35.800> focus<00:02:36.190> more<00:02:36.400> on<00:02:36.459> form<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.209> again<00:02:37.900> that

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
and focus more on form and again that

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.420 
and focus more on form and again that
mind<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.440> muscle<00:02:38.769> connection<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.340> I've

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
mind to muscle connection and I've

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.030 
mind to muscle connection and I've
noticed<00:02:39.670> big<00:02:40.510> increases<00:02:41.110> in<00:02:41.290> size<00:02:41.739> and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
noticed big increases in size and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.949 
noticed big increases in size and
strength<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:43.420> know<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.569> could<00:02:43.780> take<00:02:43.900> a

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
strength you know you could take a

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.420 
strength you know you could take a
dumbbell<00:02:44.290> curl<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:44.980> could<00:02:45.130> just<00:02:45.220> keep

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
dumbbell curl and you could just keep

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.250 
dumbbell curl and you could just keep
going<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:46.150> but<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.049> don't<00:02:47.110> have

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
going like this but if you don't have

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.199 
going like this but if you don't have
the<00:02:47.380> right<00:02:47.530> range<00:02:47.769> of<00:02:47.920> motion<00:02:48.310> if<00:02:48.849> you're<00:02:49.090> not

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
the right range of motion if you're not

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.150 
the right range of motion if you're not
contracting<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.930> actual<00:02:50.319> muscle<00:02:50.680> properly

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
contracting the actual muscle properly

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.949 
contracting the actual muscle properly
you're<00:02:51.670> really<00:02:51.880> not<00:02:52.000> doing<00:02:52.060> any<00:02:52.420> justice<00:02:52.810> for

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
you're really not doing any justice for

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.280 
you're really not doing any justice for
yourself<00:02:53.319> because<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.310> me<00:02:54.519> personally<00:02:55.390> it's

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
yourself because to me personally it's

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.229 
yourself because to me personally it's
not<00:02:56.410> very<00:02:56.739> impressive<00:02:57.130> if<00:02:57.430> someone<00:02:57.760> can<00:02:57.940> curl

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
not very impressive if someone can curl

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.780 
not very impressive if someone can curl
an<00:02:58.420> 80<00:02:58.660> pound<00:02:58.989> dumbbell<00:02:59.470> with<00:03:00.069> one<00:03:00.310> arm<00:03:00.519> but

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
an 80 pound dumbbell with one arm but

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.850

they<00:03:00.940> haven't<00:03:01.299> seen<00:03:01.420> any<00:03:01.660> size<00:03:01.989> increases<00:03:02.680> in

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
they haven't seen any size increases in

they haven't seen any size increases in
