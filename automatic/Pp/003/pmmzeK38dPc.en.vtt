correcting concealer it's a little bit

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.410 
correcting concealer it's a little bit
peachy<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.590> i<00:00:43.590> started<00:00:44.250> using<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.210> i

kind<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> missed<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.940> um<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.870> product<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.469> think

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
kind of missed it um the product I think

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.150 
kind of missed it um the product I think
worked<00:00:51.149> well<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.530> my<00:00:52.649> skin<00:00:52.949> tone

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
worked well just for my skin tone

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.470 
worked well just for my skin tone
because<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.610> quite<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> bit<00:00:54.000> lighter<00:00:54.239> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
because it's quite a bit lighter and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
since I have a lot of hyperpigmentation

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.459 
since I have a lot of hyperpigmentation
under<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.510> kind<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.809> covered<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> well

concealer like usually primers work
pretty<00:01:16.979> well<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.400> paint<00:01:17.939> pods<00:01:18.180> don't<00:01:18.540> crease

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
pretty well like paint pods don't crease

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.690 
pretty well like paint pods don't crease
on<00:01:19.259> me<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.650> stuff<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.009> which<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> lot

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
on me and stuff like that which on a lot

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.370 
on me and stuff like that which on a lot
of<00:01:20.790> people<00:01:21.000> they<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.570> crease<00:01:21.960> dummy

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
of people they do this crease dummy

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.399 
of people they do this crease dummy
almost<00:01:23.009> immediately<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.450> good<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.869> I

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
almost immediately so it's not good as I

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.770 
almost immediately so it's not good as I
guess<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.920> shadow<00:01:26.549> primer<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.479> color

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
guess a I shadow primer the color

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
guess a I shadow primer the color
correcting<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:29.159> really<00:01:29.310> nice<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.939> if

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
