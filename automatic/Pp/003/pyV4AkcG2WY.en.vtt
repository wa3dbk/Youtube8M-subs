00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
too much it just pulls like a dream when

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.460 
too much it just pulls like a dream when
it's<00:03:38.620> wet<00:03:39.550> like<00:03:39.580> this<00:03:40.170> but<00:03:41.170> when<00:03:41.290> we<00:03:41.350> were

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
it's wet like this but when we were

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.430 
it's wet like this but when we were
coming<00:03:41.740> in<00:03:41.830> at<00:03:41.920> minus<00:03:42.220> 30<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:44.140> was<00:03:44.290> like

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
coming in at minus 30 it was like

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.960 
coming in at minus 30 it was like
pulling<00:03:44.740> on<00:03:46.470> coarse<00:03:47.470> sandpaper<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.760> was

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
pulling on coarse sandpaper it was

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.620 
pulling on coarse sandpaper it was
really<00:03:49.540> tough<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.060> take<00:03:52.300> what<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:52.570> can

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
really tough so you take what you can

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:18.170 
really tough so you take what you can
get

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.879 

one<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.359> things<00:04:19.569> we<00:04:19.780> commonly<00:04:20.169> find<00:04:20.530> when

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
one of the things we commonly find when

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.270 
one of the things we commonly find when
we<00:04:20.919> pack<00:04:21.609> a<00:04:21.639> sled<00:04:22.539> trail<00:04:22.810> in<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.350> are<00:04:24.069> coming

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
we pack a sled trail in and are coming

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.499 
we pack a sled trail in and are coming
back<00:04:24.550> out<00:04:24.789> a<00:04:25.060> few<00:04:25.419> days<00:04:25.600> later<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:27.509> wolves

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
back out a few days later that wolves

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.730 
back out a few days later that wolves
will<00:04:29.169> actually<00:04:29.880> use<00:04:30.880> our<00:04:31.349> pack<00:04:32.349> trail

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
will actually use our pack trail

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.430 
will actually use our pack trail
anything<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.520> helps<00:04:33.849> them<00:04:34.199> conserve<00:04:35.199> energy

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
anything that helps them conserve energy

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.659 
anything that helps them conserve energy
and<00:04:35.830> be<00:04:35.919> more<00:04:36.069> efficient<00:04:36.580> they<00:04:36.789> use<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:39.490> it's

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
and be more efficient they use so it's

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.059 
and be more efficient they use so it's
good<00:04:39.819> to<00:04:39.940> be<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.199> environment<00:04:41.199> where<00:04:41.500> we<00:04:41.860> still

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 
good to be a environment where we still

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.710 
good to be a environment where we still
have<00:04:42.599> wolves<00:04:43.599> and<00:04:43.870> moose<00:04:44.050> doing<00:04:45.009> their<00:04:45.130> thing

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
have wolves and moose doing their thing

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.229 
have wolves and moose doing their thing
that's<00:04:46.720> pretty<00:04:46.930> cool
