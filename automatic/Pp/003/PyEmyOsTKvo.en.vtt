00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
if you already want a harmonizer pill

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.160 
if you already want a harmonizer pill
you<00:00:02.790> probably<00:00:03.060> already<00:00:03.240> know<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:03.720> so<00:00:03.990> this

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
you probably already know this so this

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.320 
you probably already know this so this
is<00:00:04.350> for<00:00:04.560> people<00:00:04.740> who<00:00:04.920> are<00:00:05.160> thinking<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:06.089> buying

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
is for people who are thinking of buying

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.780 
is for people who are thinking of buying
one<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.440> especially<00:00:07.680> revelant<00:00:08.550> if

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
one and this is especially revelant if

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.049 
one and this is especially revelant if
you<00:00:09.030> use<00:00:09.480> any<00:00:09.870> type<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.290> distortion<00:00:10.950> where<00:00:11.639> you

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
you use any type of distortion where you

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.570 
you use any type of distortion where you
place<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.690> harmonizer<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.219> effects

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
place the harmonizer and the effects

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.620 
place the harmonizer and the effects
chain<00:00:15.020> make<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> drastic<00:00:16.800> difference<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.820> how

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
chain make a drastic difference in how

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.260 
chain make a drastic difference in how
well<00:00:18.900> your<00:00:19.109> harmonized<00:00:19.470> Attell<00:00:19.800> zones<00:00:20.210> so<00:00:21.210> I

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
well your harmonized Attell zones so I

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.230 
well your harmonized Attell zones so I
first<00:00:21.570> got<00:00:22.199> mine<00:00:22.609> and<00:00:23.609> put<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:23.939> my<00:00:23.970> Pell

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
first got mine and put it in my Pell

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.769 
first got mine and put it in my Pell
champ<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:25.050> sounds<00:00:25.380> horrible<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:27.330> thing

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
champ that sounds horrible and the thing

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.429 
champ that sounds horrible and the thing
is<00:00:28.310> if<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.369> place<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.179> harmonizer<00:00:30.660> before

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
is if you place the harmonizer before

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.190 
is if you place the harmonizer before
the<00:00:31.529> distortion<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.399> will<00:00:32.550> sound<00:00:32.880> horrible<00:00:33.200> so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
the distortion it will sound horrible so

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.280 
the distortion it will sound horrible so
I'm<00:00:34.320> going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.590> play<00:00:35.040> as<00:00:35.219> something<00:00:35.640> with

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
I'm going to play as something with

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.100 
I'm going to play as something with
using<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> distortion<00:00:37.890> from<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> amp<00:00:39.110> which

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
using the distortion from the amp which

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.319 
using the distortion from the amp which
technically<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.010> harmonizer<00:00:41.670> pedal<00:00:42.059> will<00:00:42.210> be

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
technically the harmonizer pedal will be

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.090 
technically the harmonizer pedal will be
in<00:00:42.390> front<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> distortion<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.980> I'll

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
in front of the distortion that I'll

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.709 
in front of the distortion that I'll
play<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.370> something<00:00:44.550> using<00:00:45.059> my<00:00:45.210> distortion

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
play is something using my distortion

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.389 
play is something using my distortion
pedal<00:00:46.079> which<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.070> front<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
pedal which is in front of the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.690 
pedal which is in front of the
harmonizer<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> clean<00:00:48.420> shot<00:00:48.629> VM<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.700> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
harmonizer on the clean shot VM and the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.220 
harmonizer on the clean shot VM and the
difference<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> same<00:00:51.539> even<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.050> just

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
difference is the same even if I just

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.310 
difference is the same even if I just
switch<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.390> pedals<00:00:54.390> around<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> top<00:00:55.050> or

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
switch the pedals around on the top or

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.900 
switch the pedals around on the top or
it's<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> lot<00:00:55.920> easier<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.789> this

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it's just a lot easier is to do it this

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:21.389 
it's just a lot easier is to do it this
way<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.620> first<00:00:58.620> example

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.029 

that<00:01:22.399> sounds<00:01:22.700> pretty<00:01:22.880> rough<00:01:23.240> doesn't<00:01:23.689> it

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
that sounds pretty rough doesn't it

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.310 
that sounds pretty rough doesn't it
let's<00:01:25.039> try<00:01:25.189> with<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.360> distortion<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.110> front

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
let's try with the distortion in front

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
let's try with the distortion in front
of<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.469> harmonizer

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:09.400 

you

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.470 

you
