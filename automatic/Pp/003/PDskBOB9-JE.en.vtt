00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.150

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.280
 played it every brought heard every 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.900
 she has been with everyone since the 90s with access to 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.120
 it changed the idea of ​​what 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.250
 should be these games she was play years 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.140

 to the whole world for millions of players who 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.439
 not indifferent to this game with this part 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.840
 rockstar proved once again that it was they 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.640
 make the best in the game world and now when 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.529
 already worth starting to wait for the sixth part i 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.600
 sure that it will be some kind of breakthrough 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.340
 in the gaming world definitely bring something 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.680
 new i tried did not want with you 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.780
 talk now when there is no information 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.670
 what kind of game will it be 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.440
 about what it will be and so on site 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.730
 just guess and new through gta in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.710
 first associated with 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.570
 a giant open world like him 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.219
 implemented in gta 5 it's just not 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.020
 every detail fits in the head 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.239
 handled every corner of it 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.039
 the world is made by hands even a huge mountain 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.930
 the terrain is not just generated 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.480
 structure is all the result of works 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.430
 rockstar workers I and imagine not 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.170
 I can, that will gta 6 but this something 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.420
 must be really awesome 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.630
 imagine full interaction with 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.460
 the world with people with all things and everything 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.070
 it seems to be real life in 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.290
 within one game of course gta never 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.689
 did not seek to be realistic for her 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.490
 it would be interesting to play realism you need 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.070
 to the best of this, no problem with this 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.900
 There is no game, but I do not know the score of the world in gta 6 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.119
 where the main events will take place 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.810
 I know that many want to see gta 6 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.790
 Vasiti 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.619
 return to that city on the example of the same 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.659
 the fifth part where we are again sent to 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.280
 los santos could have thought so and by 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.229
 this is the most likely option for me 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.000
 although it could still be done by others 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.130
 city ​​and state san andreas the same las 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.720
 venturas or san fierro necessarily 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.990
 write to komenty what city do you go 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.579
 see in gta 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.500
 I think the game engine will remain the same and 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.390
 barrace euphoria is perfect for 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.340
 gta and taking into account the graphic features 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.229
 most likely rockstar will not take up 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.450
 development of a new engine and a 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.579
 will improve the old about the graphics not 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.770
 doubt will be still more beautiful 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.649
 more beautiful than gta 5 seemingly 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.870
 better for me too gta 5 on ps4 looks 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.360
 just great 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.070
 gta series never famous for plots 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.660
 about him, the developers remembered when 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.850
 have already sent a truck with discs to 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.010
 sale but nevertheless this gameplay 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.290
 always attracted draco of all ages and 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.000
 categories really plot in such 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.770
 the game is not at all important considering what is 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.620
 online mode and just miss you 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.860
 impossible and I think few of you 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.300
 passed because of interest about three or four 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.910
 Wasiti san andreas yes any part at all 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.440
 except 5 because gta 5 is really 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.190
 it is impossible not to pass if you have it 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.140
 there is about exclusivity and i don't have 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.030
 doubt was sony and microsoft enough 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.310
 money to gta 6 was exclusive to 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.470
 these platforms at least a year longer possible 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.050
 as it was with the fifth part and how much 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.820
 man bought the console for the sake of the same gta 5 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.710
 I was including a lot more 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.280
 people who couldn't wait for her 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.220
 PC 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.200
 I personally would like to see the gta 6 plot not 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.470
 just fan almost pointless miss 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.360
 and 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.250
 would like something new in terms of 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.860
 character stories and so on and so on 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.260
 like this is what is missing in gta and 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.150
 what makes her childish play like 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.070
 so that she was just a little more serious 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.140
 despite all this gta my favorite 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.360
 series each part is a masterpiece without 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.370
 exceptions to not say there this 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.370
 the game has always been and will be the best in the world
