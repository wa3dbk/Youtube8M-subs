00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.799 

a<00:00:07.490> lot<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.519> people<00:00:08.849> have<00:00:09.000> scanners<00:00:09.330> at<00:00:09.630> home

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
a lot of people have scanners at home

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.110 
a lot of people have scanners at home
that<00:00:10.050> they<00:00:10.170> used<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.500> scan<00:00:10.740> paper<00:00:11.160> or<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:12.000> know

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
that they used to scan paper or you know

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.660 
that they used to scan paper or you know
sometimes<00:00:12.719> their<00:00:13.200> butts<00:00:13.740> or<00:00:14.040> something<00:00:14.549> like

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
sometimes their butts or something like

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.160 
sometimes their butts or something like
that<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:15.269> don't<00:00:15.450> know<00:00:15.630> anything<00:00:15.870> about<00:00:16.049> that

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
that I don't know anything about that

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.050 
that I don't know anything about that
but<00:00:16.379> what<00:00:17.010> does<00:00:17.100> he<00:00:17.190> want<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.430> scan<00:00:17.699> something

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
but what does he want to scan something

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.200 
but what does he want to scan something
like<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.869> 3d<00:00:19.439> well<00:00:20.189> I'm<00:00:20.340> here<00:00:20.640> at<00:00:20.850> next

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
like this in 3d well I'm here at next

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.330 
like this in 3d well I'm here at next
engine<00:00:21.359> technology<00:00:22.140> with<00:00:22.320> Dan<00:00:22.529> Gustafson<00:00:23.130> who

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
engine technology with Dan Gustafson who

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.490 
engine technology with Dan Gustafson who
is<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> marketing<00:00:24.359> director<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.199> he's

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
is the marketing director here and he's

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.380 
is the marketing director here and he's
going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.740> tell<00:00:25.890> me<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> little<00:00:26.160> bit<00:00:26.340> about<00:00:26.460> 3d

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
going to tell me a little bit about 3d

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.269 
going to tell me a little bit about 3d
scanning<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.199> why<00:00:28.560> that's<00:00:28.710> important<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
scanning and why that's important the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.679 
scanning and why that's important the
future<00:00:29.550> technology<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.300> what<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.570> all

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
future technology and what it's all

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:40.060 
future technology and what it's all
about

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.590 

basically<00:00:41.070> 3d<00:00:41.399> scanning<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.210> technology

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
basically 3d scanning the technology

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.270 
basically 3d scanning the technology
that's<00:00:42.719> been<00:00:42.840> around<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:43.230> quite<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.440> while<00:00:43.680> but

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that's been around for quite a while but

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.920 
that's been around for quite a while but
what<00:00:44.520> we've<00:00:44.700> done<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.090> made<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.510> very<00:00:45.600> portable

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
what we've done is made it very portable

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.619 
what we've done is made it very portable
and<00:00:46.110> very<00:00:46.200> easy<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.649> use<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.820> allows<00:00:48.059> people

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and very easy to use so it allows people

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.639 
and very easy to use so it allows people
throughout<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> world<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.530> different

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
throughout the world in different

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.010 
throughout the world in different
industries<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.489> things<00:00:50.760> faster<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.420> even

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
industries to do things faster and even

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.450 
industries to do things faster and even
things<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.230> couldn't<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.620> before<00:00:52.710> they<00:00:53.250> can

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
things they couldn't do before they can

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
things they couldn't do before they can
now<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:53.879> 3d<00:00:54.180> scanning<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.960> how<00:00:55.079> does

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
now do that with 3d scanning so how does

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.189 
now do that with 3d scanning so how does
the<00:00:55.289> technology<00:00:55.469> work<00:00:56.039> how<00:00:56.879> much<00:00:57.809> detail<00:00:58.109> do

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the technology work how much detail do

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.439 
the technology work how much detail do
you<00:00:58.230> want<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.649> want<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> look<00:00:59.010> at<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.219> detail

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
you want you want to look at in detail

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.700 
you want you want to look at in detail
there's<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.539> sensor<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.109> there's<00:01:01.500> actually

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
there's a sensor here there's actually

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.930 
there's a sensor here there's actually
two<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:01.980> goes<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> macro<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.820> know

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
two one goes this is a macro we know

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
two one goes this is a macro we know
this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.210> wide<00:01:03.390> window<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.320> you're

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
this is a wide window but you're

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.500 
this is a wide window but you're
triangulating<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> light<00:01:05.850> against<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
triangulating the light against the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.210 
triangulating the light against the
sensor<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.350> measuring<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> speed<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.040> light

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
sensor and measuring the speed of light

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.010 
sensor and measuring the speed of light
so<00:01:08.790> there's<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.210> lot<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.390> things<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.750> Google

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
so there's a lot of things like Google

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.429 
so there's a lot of things like Google
Sketchup<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.670> Second<00:01:12.150> Life<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.780> could

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
Sketchup and and Second Life that could

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.260 
Sketchup and and Second Life that could
probably<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:14.220> benefit<00:01:14.640> from<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.030> kind

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
probably really benefit from this kind

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.789 
probably really benefit from this kind
of<00:01:15.330> technology<00:01:15.630> yeah<00:01:16.020> yeah<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:16.530> have

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
of technology yeah yeah we actually have

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.590 
of technology yeah yeah we actually have
customers<00:01:17.009> who<00:01:17.430> scan<00:01:17.880> physical<00:01:18.240> objects

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
customers who scan physical objects

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.480 
customers who scan physical objects
create<00:01:19.229> 3d<00:01:19.439> models<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.920> then<00:01:20.009> sell<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.400> on

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
create 3d models and then sell them on

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
create 3d models and then sell them on
Second<00:01:20.820> Life<00:01:20.909> really<00:01:21.630> does<00:01:21.810> that's<00:01:22.080> pretty

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
Second Life really does that's pretty

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.140 
Second Life really does that's pretty
popular<00:01:22.560> already<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.369> think<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.850> people<00:01:23.970> who

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
popular already I think the people who

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.060 
popular already I think the people who
are<00:01:24.210> doing<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:24.780> don't<00:01:25.650> talk<00:01:25.799> about<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
are doing it don't don't talk about a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.910 
are doing it don't don't talk about a
lot<00:01:26.220> because<00:01:26.509> they<00:01:27.509> have<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> one-up<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.650> many

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
lot because they have a one-up on many

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.730 
lot because they have a one-up on many
people<00:01:29.780> it's<00:01:30.780> kind<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.049> cheating<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> way

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
people it's kind of cheating in a way

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.499 
people it's kind of cheating in a way
that<00:01:32.280> are<00:01:32.369> creating<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.939> game<00:01:33.150> they're

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
that are creating it in game they're

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.060 
that are creating it in game they're
kind<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.780> replicating<00:01:34.229> things<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.710> real<00:01:34.829> life

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
kind of replicating things in real life

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.289 
kind of replicating things in real life
and<00:01:35.310> then<00:01:35.400> bringing<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.790> into<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.060> virtual

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and then bringing it into the virtual

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.480 
and then bringing it into the virtual
world<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.200> say<00:01:37.740> things<00:01:37.799> they<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.400> do

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
world we like to say things they can do

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.370 
world we like to say things they can do
things<00:01:38.579> faster<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> cheating

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
things faster not really the cheating

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
things faster not really the cheating
faster<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> mentioned<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.000> people<00:01:42.299> are

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
faster so you mentioned that people are

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.609 
faster so you mentioned that people are
using<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.810> Second<00:01:43.140> Life<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.439> is

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
using it in Second Life this is

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.050 
using it in Second Life this is
something<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.159> lot<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.340> consumers<00:01:44.549> are

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
something that a lot of consumers are

is the setup mode for your scan the way
the<00:02:50.110> scanner<00:02:50.320> works<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.650> take<00:02:50.680> multiple

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
the scanner works is you take multiple

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.710 
the scanner works is you take multiple
scans<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.550> you<00:02:51.610> put<00:02:52.090> those<00:02:52.240> scans<00:02:52.540> together

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
scans and you put those scans together

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.470 
scans and you put those scans together
to<00:02:53.110> create<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.530> watertight<00:02:54.010> mesh<00:02:54.340> file<00:02:54.580> so

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
to create a watertight mesh file so

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.530 
to create a watertight mesh file so
here's<00:02:55.780> our<00:02:55.900> Nabu<00:02:56.110> fighter<00:02:56.320> in<00:02:57.100> 3d<00:02:58.030> texture

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.770 
here's our Nabu fighter in 3d texture
and<00:02:58.990> then<00:02:59.590> we<00:02:59.740> have<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.130> surface<00:03:00.780> solid

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
and then we have it the surface solid

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.810 
and then we have it the surface solid
this<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.860> mesh<00:03:03.010> bottom<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.520> can<00:03:03.670> see

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
this is the mesh bottom so you can see

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.130 
this is the mesh bottom so you can see

in action some things that you've worked

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.740 
in action some things that you've worked
on<00:03:21.730> in<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.910> past<00:03:22.120> yeah<00:03:22.330> absolutely<00:03:22.660> we<00:03:22.720> have

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
on in the past yeah absolutely we have

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.650 
on in the past yeah absolutely we have
some<00:03:22.930> right<00:03:23.080> here<00:03:23.110> oh<00:03:24.390> well<00:03:25.390> that<00:03:25.570> was

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
some right here oh well that was

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.600 
some right here oh well that was
convenient<00:03:26.050> yeah<00:03:26.380> here's<00:03:27.190> some<00:03:27.340> physical

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
convenient yeah here's some physical

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.210 
convenient yeah here's some physical
objects<00:03:27.970> that<00:03:28.269> are<00:03:29.019> mechanical<00:03:29.590> in<00:03:29.680> nature<00:03:29.709> we

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
objects that are mechanical in nature we

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.090 
objects that are mechanical in nature we
have<00:03:30.400> some<00:03:31.060> 3d<00:03:31.300> prints<00:03:31.540> actually<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:32.890> is<00:03:33.070> a

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
have some 3d prints actually this is a

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.370 
have some 3d prints actually this is a
manifold<00:03:33.820> this<00:03:34.239> is<00:03:34.360> also<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.630> manifold<00:03:35.050> from<00:03:35.260> a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
manifold this is also a manifold from a

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.520 
manifold this is also a manifold from a
old<00:03:36.130> vehicle<00:03:36.760> from<00:03:37.090> a<00:03:37.239> popular<00:03:37.930> car<00:03:38.170> collector

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
old vehicle from a popular car collector

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.590 
old vehicle from a popular car collector
in<00:03:38.650> Southern<00:03:38.890> California<00:03:39.010> it's<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:40.060> 1922

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
in Southern California it's a 1922

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.300 
in Southern California it's a 1922
Bugatti<00:03:40.989> part<00:03:41.320> we<00:03:41.769> don't<00:03:41.950> have<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.160> actual

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
Bugatti part we don't have the actual

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.070 
Bugatti part we don't have the actual
aluminum<00:03:43.150> piece<00:03:43.300> but<00:03:43.450> this<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:43.690> really<00:03:43.959> what

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
aluminum piece but this is really what

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.330 
aluminum piece but this is really what
it<00:03:44.140> looked<00:03:44.350> like<00:03:44.440> when<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.769> came<00:03:44.920> in

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
it looked like when it came in

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.420 
it looked like when it came in
imagine<00:03:45.850> this<00:03:45.940> ABS<00:03:46.390> print<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:46.930> aluminum<00:03:47.769> you

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
imagine this ABS print in aluminum you

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.860 
imagine this ABS print in aluminum you
can<00:03:48.550> see<00:03:48.670> a<00:03:48.700> hole<00:03:48.910> here<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.360> can<00:03:49.480> see<00:03:49.600> all<00:03:49.750> the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
can see a hole here you can see all the

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.780 
can see a hole here you can see all the
rough<00:03:50.019> edges<00:03:50.230> on<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.680> outside<00:03:51.040> here<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.670> was

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
rough edges on the outside here it was

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.030 
rough edges on the outside here it was
worn<00:03:52.090> over<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.019> years<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.500> was<00:03:53.739> no<00:03:53.830> longer

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
worn over the years and was no longer

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.979 
worn over the years and was no longer
useful<00:03:54.250> so<00:03:54.970> what<00:03:55.090> with<00:03:55.209> his<00:03:55.330> we<00:03:55.480> created<00:03:55.810> the

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
useful so what with his we created the

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.380 
useful so what with his we created the
3d<00:03:56.620> model<00:03:56.980> off<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.220> scan<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.730> then<00:03:58.180> took<00:03:58.330> it

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
3d model off the scan and then took it

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.540 
3d model off the scan and then took it
into<00:03:58.750> software<00:03:59.470> that<00:03:59.860> allowed<00:04:00.010> us<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.280> reverse

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
into software that allowed us to reverse

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.940 
into software that allowed us to reverse
model<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.239> we<00:04:01.840> were<00:04:01.959> able<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.260> generate<00:04:02.530> an

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
model so we were able to generate an

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.790 
model so we were able to generate an
idealized<00:04:03.430> part<00:04:03.760> from<00:04:04.540> scan<00:04:04.840> data<00:04:05.080> so<00:04:05.500> this<00:04:05.650> is

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
idealized part from scan data so this is

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.620 
idealized part from scan data so this is
almost<00:04:05.980> like<00:04:06.190> Star<00:04:06.550> Trek<00:04:06.580> technology<00:04:07.390> this<00:04:07.570> is

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
almost like Star Trek technology this is

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.600 
almost like Star Trek technology this is
like<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.019> precursor<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.620> a<00:04:08.739> replicator<00:04:09.310> in<00:04:09.519> a

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
like the precursor to a replicator in a

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.940 
like the precursor to a replicator in a
way<00:04:09.730> right<00:04:10.090> right<00:04:10.330> that's<00:04:10.810> really<00:04:11.170> cool<00:04:11.410> is

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
way right right that's really cool is

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.320 
way right right that's really cool is
there<00:04:12.100> gonna<00:04:12.190> be<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.370> time<00:04:12.610> when<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:12.970> scanners

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
there gonna be a time when the scanners

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.580 
there gonna be a time when the scanners
are<00:04:13.450> just<00:04:13.630> printing<00:04:14.019> scanner

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
are just printing scanner

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.199 
are just printing scanner
it<00:04:15.069> kind<00:04:15.250> of<00:04:15.310> goes<00:04:15.489> on<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.849> this<00:04:15.940> like<00:04:16.090> the

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
it kind of goes on to this like the

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.759 
it kind of goes on to this like the
probiotics<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.079> soaps<00:04:17.320> making

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
probiotics and it soaps making

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.050 
probiotics and it soaps making
themselves<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.579> then<00:04:18.669> they<00:04:18.820> don't<00:04:19.000> need

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
themselves and then they don't need

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.610 
themselves and then they don't need
humans<00:04:19.510> anymore<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:20.230> little<00:04:20.470> bit<00:04:20.560> of

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
humans anymore a little bit of

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.870 
humans anymore a little bit of
intelligence<00:04:20.829> there<00:04:21.220> so<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.430> don't<00:04:21.609> think<00:04:21.699> that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
intelligence there so I don't think that

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.750 
intelligence there so I don't think that
will<00:04:21.970> happen<00:04:22.000> but<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:23.410> never<00:04:23.590> know<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:23.949> this

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
will happen but you never know so this

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.670 
will happen but you never know so this
is<00:04:24.910> a<00:04:24.940> 3d<00:04:25.300> printer<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.750> dimension<00:04:26.139> 3d<00:04:26.380> printer

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
is a 3d printer the dimension 3d printer

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.390 
is a 3d printer the dimension 3d printer
and<00:04:26.889> you're<00:04:27.190> able<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.460> create<00:04:28.000> 3d<00:04:28.510> models<00:04:28.540> by

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
and you're able to create 3d models by

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.469 
and you're able to create 3d models by
downloading<00:04:30.400> an<00:04:30.490> STL<00:04:30.820> file<00:04:31.000> into<00:04:31.360> this

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
downloading an STL file into this

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.080 
downloading an STL file into this
machine<00:04:31.840> and<00:04:32.229> it<00:04:32.889> will<00:04:33.070> actually<00:04:33.370> print<00:04:33.910> in

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
machine and it will actually print in

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.490 
machine and it will actually print in
three<00:04:34.210> dimensions<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:34.960> then<00:04:35.199> you<00:04:35.320> have<00:04:35.470> a

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
three dimensions and then you have a

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.550 
three dimensions and then you have a
little<00:04:36.160> piece<00:04:36.310> here<00:04:39.930> table<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.440> piece

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
little piece here table that the piece

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.290 
little piece here table that the piece
will<00:04:41.710> be<00:04:41.800> printed<00:04:42.100> in<00:04:42.220> so<00:04:42.490> when<00:04:42.970> you<00:04:43.030> pull<00:04:43.180> this

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
will be printed in so when you pull this

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.850 
will be printed in so when you pull this
out<00:04:43.449> you'll<00:04:43.750> have<00:04:43.930> support<00:04:44.350> material<00:04:44.650> below

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
out you'll have support material below

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:52.590 
out you'll have support material below
it<00:04:45.040> and<00:04:45.160> your<00:04:45.850> piece<00:04:46.060> will<00:04:46.210> look<00:04:46.240> like<00:04:46.449> this<00:04:51.600> so

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
it and your piece will look like this so

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.850 
it and your piece will look like this so
from<00:04:52.720> what<00:04:52.900> I<00:04:52.930> can<00:04:53.050> see<00:04:53.169> so<00:04:53.530> far

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
from what I can see so far

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.730 
from what I can see so far
I<00:04:54.040> imagined<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.060> be<00:04:55.300> trimming<00:04:55.810> away<00:04:56.020> from<00:04:56.650> a

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
I imagined it to be trimming away from a

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.110 
I imagined it to be trimming away from a
material<00:04:57.220> and<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:57.430> doesn't<00:04:57.820> look<00:04:57.940> like<00:04:58.090> that

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
material and it doesn't look like that

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.550 
material and it doesn't look like that
at<00:04:58.270> all<00:04:58.479> it's<00:04:58.870> like<00:04:58.930> it's<00:04:59.110> making<00:04:59.350> something

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
at all it's like it's making something

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.960 
at all it's like it's making something
out<00:04:59.710> of<00:04:59.770> nothing<00:04:59.889> what<00:05:00.310> is<00:05:00.400> it<00:05:00.520> doing<00:05:00.639> right

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
out of nothing what is it doing right

out of nothing what is it doing right
well<00:05:01.090> there's<00:05:01.240> two<00:05:01.330> methods<00:05:01.690> of

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
well there's two methods of

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.730 
well there's two methods of
manufacturing

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
manufacturing

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.409 
manufacturing
there's<00:05:03.010> additive<00:05:03.520> and<00:05:03.610> subtractive<00:05:03.669> this<00:05:04.300> is

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
there's additive and subtractive this is

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:05.520 
there's additive and subtractive this is
additive<00:05:04.810> where<00:05:04.990> it's<00:05:05.110> actually<00:05:05.169> printing

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
additive where it's actually printing

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.529 
additive where it's actually printing
something<00:05:05.800> from<00:05:05.950> nothing<00:05:06.389> attractive<00:05:07.389> is

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
when you actually have a physical object

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.730 
when you actually have a physical object
you're<00:05:09.190> cutting<00:05:09.490> away<00:05:09.550> from<00:05:09.610> it<00:05:09.910> okay<00:05:10.840> so

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
you're cutting away from it okay so
