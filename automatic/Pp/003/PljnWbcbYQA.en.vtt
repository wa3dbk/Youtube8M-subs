a<00:00:20.279> lot<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.580> reading<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:21.060> thing<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.510> pretty

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
a lot of reading this thing is pretty

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.060 
a lot of reading this thing is pretty
pretty<00:00:23.880> significant<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.689> you've<00:00:25.619> got<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
pretty significant and you've got the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.220 
pretty significant and you've got the
the<00:00:26.849> main<00:00:27.380> crank<00:00:29.300> gear<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.630> idler<00:00:31.199> gear

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the main crank gear the idler gear

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.340 
the main crank gear the idler gear
there's<00:00:31.800> an<00:00:31.890> idler<00:00:32.160> bushing<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> block

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
there's an idler bushing in the block

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.110 
there's an idler bushing in the block
there's<00:00:34.350> two<00:00:34.620> gears<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> rear<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.760> feed

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
there's two gears in the rear that feed

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.290 
there's two gears in the rear that feed
up<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.860> these<00:00:37.860> side<00:00:38.160> chains<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.910> go<00:00:39.059> up<00:00:39.270> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
up to these side chains that go up to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.049 
up to these side chains that go up to
the<00:00:39.450> top<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.989> heads<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:41.129> that's<00:00:41.700> that's

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the top of the heads and that's that's

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.880 
the top of the heads and that's that's
the<00:00:42.210> case<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.660> both<00:00:42.870> sides<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.410> covered<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the case on both sides have covered that

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.790 
the case on both sides have covered that
one<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.480> uh<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.899> pretty<00:00:46.350> advanced

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
one so it's uh it's pretty advanced

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.770 
one so it's uh it's pretty advanced
there's<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.070> couple<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.430> tensioners<00:00:48.239> here

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
there's a couple of tensioners here

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.799 
there's a couple of tensioners here
oil<00:00:49.530> pressure<00:00:49.770> driven<00:00:50.190> tensioners<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.120> then

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
oil pressure driven tensioners and then

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.779 
oil pressure driven tensioners and then
there's<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.079> mechanical<00:00:52.739> tensioner<00:00:53.370> system

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
there's a mechanical tensioner system

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.490 
there's a mechanical tensioner system
here<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.980> yeah<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.399> uh<00:00:56.930> it's<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.079> fairly

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
here and so yeah it's uh it's a fairly

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.920 
here and so yeah it's uh it's a fairly
significant<00:00:59.190> system<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.420> one<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.809> need

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
significant system the one that you need

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.799 
significant system the one that you need
to<00:01:01.050> read<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.739> you're<00:01:01.890> gonna<00:01:01.980> do<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.780> do<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
to read up on if you're gonna do a do a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
to read up on if you're gonna do a do a
replacement<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.589> installation<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:05.309> that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
replacement and installation on that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.270 
replacement and installation on that
part<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.689> part<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> motor<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:08.100> real

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
part that part of the motor it's real

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.550 
part that part of the motor it's real
doable<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:09.119> no<00:01:09.780> tricky<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.450> enter<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.600> timing

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
doable just no tricky so enter on timing

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.310 
doable just no tricky so enter on timing
gears<00:01:13.890> timing<00:01:14.310> chains<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.320> tensioners

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
gears timing chains are on tensioners

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.700 
gears timing chains are on tensioners
are<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.590> everything's<00:01:17.159> torque<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.640> spec<00:01:18.710> began

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
are on everything's torque to spec began

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.520 
are on everything's torque to spec began
over<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.159> by<00:01:20.630> putting<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.960> valve<00:01:22.200> cover

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
over here by putting on this valve cover

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.590 
over here by putting on this valve cover
I<00:01:22.799> let<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> other<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:23.909> off<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
I let the other one off just for the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.950 
I let the other one off just for the
sake<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> Si<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:26.270> seeing<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> timing

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
sake of Si and the seeing the timing

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.469 
sake of Si and the seeing the timing
chains<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.470> gears<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:29.070> now<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
chains and gears for right now so the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.899 
chains and gears for right now so the
next<00:01:30.509> big<00:01:30.930> action<00:01:31.170> will<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> remove<00:01:31.860> put<00:01:32.790> on

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
next big action will be to remove put on

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.940 
next big action will be to remove put on
the<00:01:33.650> timing<00:01:34.650> cover<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.829> it's<00:01:37.829> all

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
the timing cover you know this it's all

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.469 
the timing cover you know this it's all
cleaned<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.579> ready<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.820> go<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.329> think

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
cleaned up and ready to go so I think

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.109 
cleaned up and ready to go so I think
I'm<00:01:39.840> gonna<00:01:40.100> give<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> shot<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.880> can't

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
I'm gonna give it a shot see if I can't

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.810 
I'm gonna give it a shot see if I can't
put<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.590> I'll<00:01:44.040> get<00:01:44.280> back<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.490> you

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.219 

well<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.909> got<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> front<00:01:48.360> end<00:01:48.479> mostly<00:01:48.899> together

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
well I got the front end mostly together

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.580 
well I got the front end mostly together
main<00:01:50.070> seal<00:01:50.399> still<00:01:50.670> out<00:01:51.140> I'm<00:01:52.140> gonna<00:01:52.259> save<00:01:52.560> that

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
main seal still out I'm gonna save that

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.770 
main seal still out I'm gonna save that
for<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.009> bit<00:01:53.220> still<00:01:53.579> got<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.470> thermostat<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
for a bit still got the thermostat and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.480 
for a bit still got the thermostat and
radiator<00:01:57.780> hose<00:01:57.960> connection<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.890> put<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.219> there

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
radiator hose connection to put on there

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.190 
radiator hose connection to put on there
I<00:01:59.810> still<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:01.079> to

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
I still have to

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.679 
I still have to
but<00:02:02.409> that's<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.920> oil<00:02:04.229> fill<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.530> there<00:02:06.689> in

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
but that's the oil fill to there in

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.419 
but that's the oil fill to there in
general<00:02:07.960> I'd<00:02:08.470> say<00:02:08.739> we're<00:02:08.920> looking<00:02:09.039> pretty

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
general I'd say we're looking pretty

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.710 
general I'd say we're looking pretty
good<00:02:09.840> timing<00:02:10.840> plates<00:02:11.140> on<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.790> timing<00:02:13.120> gas<00:02:13.420> get

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
good timing plates on the timing gas get

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.900 
good timing plates on the timing gas get
aligned<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.470> time<00:02:14.830> plate<00:02:15.040> gasket<00:02:15.430> align<00:02:15.640> just

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
aligned a time plate gasket align just

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.430 
aligned a time plate gasket align just
fine<00:02:16.470> but<00:02:17.470> both<00:02:18.099> were<00:02:18.430> placed<00:02:19.290> torque<00:02:20.290> to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
fine but both were placed torque to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.220 
fine but both were placed torque to
specifications<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.730> we<00:02:22.569> should<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:22.900> good<00:02:23.110> on

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
specifications so we should be good on

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.130 
specifications so we should be good on
that<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:25.600> pretty<00:02:25.900> much<00:02:27.330> we're<00:02:28.330> close<00:02:28.930> to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
that so pretty much we're close to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.740 
that so pretty much we're close to
finishing<00:02:29.500> up<00:02:29.769> at<00:02:29.980> least<00:02:30.130> with<00:02:30.430> this<00:02:30.750> this

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
finishing up at least with this this

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.750 
finishing up at least with this this
external<00:02:32.349> portion<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.010> rebuild<00:02:33.340> short<00:02:33.700> of

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
external portion of the rebuild short of

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.540 
external portion of the rebuild short of
put<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.090> car<00:02:34.830> my<00:02:35.830> plan<00:02:36.100> now<00:02:36.130> is

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
put it in the car my plan now is

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.509 
put it in the car my plan now is
probably<00:02:37.330> starting<00:02:37.810> tomorrow<00:02:37.900> evening<00:02:38.519> and

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
probably starting tomorrow evening and

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.660 
probably starting tomorrow evening and
tape<00:02:40.330> off<00:02:40.510> some<00:02:40.840> more<00:02:41.049> areas<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.010> protect<00:02:42.340> from

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
tape off some more areas to protect from

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.190 
tape off some more areas to protect from
paint<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:45.030> gonna<00:02:46.030> probably<00:02:46.239> get<00:02:46.510> on<00:02:46.660> priming

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
paint and gonna probably get on priming

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.940 
paint and gonna probably get on priming
and<00:02:47.290> painting<00:02:47.940> painting<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.150> cover<00:02:49.959> the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
and painting painting the cover the

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.350 
and painting painting the cover the
timing<00:02:51.280> cover<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.819> top<00:02:55.000> end<00:02:55.239> of

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
timing cover and the and the top end of

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.630 
timing cover and the and the top end of
the<00:02:55.420> motor<00:02:55.630> bottom<00:02:56.319> ends<00:02:56.500> pretty<00:02:57.400> well

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
the motor bottom ends pretty well

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.110 
the motor bottom ends pretty well
painted<00:02:59.340> let<00:03:00.340> me<00:03:00.430> think<00:03:00.610> what<00:03:00.819> else<00:03:00.880> do<00:03:01.090> we

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
painted let me think what else do we

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.410 
painted let me think what else do we
have

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
have

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.229 
have
I<00:03:01.690> did<00:03:02.410> install<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:03.040> engine<00:03:03.310> lift<00:03:03.670> bolts<00:03:04.060> that

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
I did install the engine lift bolts that

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.259 
I did install the engine lift bolts that
you<00:03:04.299> see<00:03:04.630> there<00:03:04.870> on<00:03:05.110> top<00:03:05.760> they<00:03:06.760> stay<00:03:07.000> in<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
you see there on top they stay in the

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.620 
you see there on top they stay in the
car<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:07.950> when<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.100> installed<00:03:09.579> those<00:03:09.850> they'll

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
car so when it installed those they'll

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.349 
car so when it installed those they'll
get<00:03:10.810> paint<00:03:11.019> as<00:03:11.079> well<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.950> water<00:03:12.400> pump<00:03:12.730> it's

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
get paint as well the water pump it's

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.380 
get paint as well the water pump it's
part<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:14.459> pretty<00:03:15.459> much<00:03:15.549> part<00:03:15.880> at<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.180> time

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
part of the pretty much part at the time

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.569 
part of the pretty much part at the time
in<00:03:16.510> cover<00:03:16.920> install<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:17.950> think<00:03:18.310> there's<00:03:18.489> four

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
in cover install I think there's four

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.509 
in cover install I think there's four
pumps<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.299> actually<00:03:19.950> four<00:03:20.950> bolts<00:03:21.280> rather

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
pumps that actually four bolts rather

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.289 
pumps that actually four bolts rather
than<00:03:21.760> actually<00:03:22.060> bolt<00:03:22.510> into<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.140> timing

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
than actually bolt into the timing

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.970 
than actually bolt into the timing
timing<00:03:25.299> cover<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:26.170> rest<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:26.530> America

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
timing cover the rest of America

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.890 
timing cover the rest of America
actually<00:03:27.640> part<00:03:28.090> up<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.390> timing<00:03:28.630> cover

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
actually part up the timing cover

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.740 
actually part up the timing cover
holding<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.290> timing<00:03:29.620> cover<00:03:29.769> on<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:30.540> got<00:03:31.540> the

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
holding the timing cover on so got the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.130 
holding the timing cover on so got the
new<00:03:32.140> water<00:03:32.380> pump<00:03:32.590> installed<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:34.140> think

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
new water pump installed and I think

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.699 
new water pump installed and I think
we're<00:03:35.380> getting<00:03:35.880> getting<00:03:36.880> close<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.269> ready

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
we're getting getting close to ready

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.789 
we're getting getting close to ready
like<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:38.829> said<00:03:39.010> next<00:03:39.220> day<00:03:39.579> or<00:03:39.700> two<00:03:39.850> it<00:03:40.000> will<00:03:40.120> spin

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
like I said next day or two it will spin

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.830 
like I said next day or two it will spin
priming<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:41.980> painting<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.489> motor<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.000> I'd

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
priming and painting the motor and I'd

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.420 
priming and painting the motor and I'd
have<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.049> tape<00:03:44.290> off<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.530> lot<00:03:44.829> of<00:03:44.859> these<00:03:45.010> areas

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
have to tape off a lot of these areas

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.970 
have to tape off a lot of these areas
that<00:03:46.019> we<00:03:47.019> don't<00:03:47.230> want<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.470> be<00:03:47.560> painting<00:03:47.920> it

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
that we don't want to be painting it

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.720 
that we don't want to be painting it
right<00:03:48.160> off<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:49.319> these<00:03:50.319> little<00:03:50.470> odd<00:03:50.650> odds<00:03:51.459> and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
right off and these little odd odds and

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.190 
right off and these little odd odds and
ends<00:03:51.880> nuts<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.329> bolts<00:03:52.569> here<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:52.870> need<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.079> be

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
ends nuts and bolts here that need to be

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.099 
ends nuts and bolts here that need to be
painted<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.709> dealt<00:03:53.890> with<00:03:54.040> so<00:03:54.660> anyway<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.690> think

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
painted and dealt with so anyway I think

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.559 
painted and dealt with so anyway I think
we're<00:03:56.350> I<00:03:56.769> think<00:03:57.040> we're<00:03:57.190> getting<00:03:57.370> close<00:03:57.579> next

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
we're I think we're getting close next

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.090 
we're I think we're getting close next
time<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.780> hear<00:03:58.900> from<00:03:58.959> me<00:03:59.200> hopefully<00:03:59.920> we'll

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
time you hear from me hopefully we'll

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.120 
time you hear from me hopefully we'll
have<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.310> completed<00:04:00.819> motor<00:04:01.650> painted<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.799> ready

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
have a completed motor painted and ready

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.430 
have a completed motor painted and ready
to<00:04:03.430> install

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
to install

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.100 
to install
