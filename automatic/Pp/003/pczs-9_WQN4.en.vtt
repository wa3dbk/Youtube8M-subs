00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.410
 traffic signs and rules 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:12.540
 what does it mean and what do we do with it 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.540
 c what pupils have to say 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.609
 hi this is it is a journal 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.829
 in traffic we have certain 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.930
 made agreements with each other 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:26.680
 agreements ensure that everyone 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.230
 knows what he or she must do that ensures 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.019
 so for safe situations it is 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.220
 important that you know these agreements in 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.379
 traffic we use 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.820
 traffic signs and signs 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.410
 traffic rules 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.449
 these indicate what we have together 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.400
 agreed in traffic 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.570
 rules that have to do, for example 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.399
 with priority 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.960
 suppose you want to turn and it will come 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.820
 meet you again 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.590
 you must know that you are the other 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.930
 must let go 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.850
 you can get traffic signs and traffic signs 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.609
 what about the road you are on that 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.530
 currently riding a sign indicating who 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.449
 for example, or has priority 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.760
 which direction you should cycle or where 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.679
 the cycle path is 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.570
 Road signs are the lines and signs 

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:09.460
 on the road, for example, shark teeth such as 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.539
 you have to give for one or the stripes of 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.950
 the cross-walk 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.660
 everyone here knows the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.970
 pedestrian pastors across the road 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.340
 want to cross when you see the whole movie 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.720

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.649
 Then check out www.schooltv.nl

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.590
 you'll have the best view into 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.200

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.759

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.380
 and he can call them so because because look 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.390
 where you tons and if you stand 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.179
 That means you get to order then 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.349
 you have to let the other feel that he is 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.739

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:54.849
 yes those are then 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 yes 3 each other and then you have to 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.700
 to hide 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.060
 if you go with the points to you 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.189
 you have to hide and watch 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.170
 parents arrive to the left and right 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.140
 you can also call a road 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.959
 and describe what that looks like 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.000
 call dog with a few billion euros 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:17.640
 on it and if that is and for example he 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.500
 is in your wrist and times it 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.739
 with your parties 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.489
 I know stop sign a kind of square where 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.950
 all hands 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.200
 where all the corners are from are one 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.620
 priority word 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.840
 which is a bit of a diamond and then 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.180
 it is that the more it is yellow and then 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.980
 a week toronto not what does this mean 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.260
 traffic sign 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.530
 yes only guide can cycle for days 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.080
 sweetspot is here to separate bicycles or 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.269
 bike path that you realize bike path now 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.269
 cycling what does this traffic sign mean 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.580
 And that means you might favor it 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.950
 one I think for a griefer 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.519
 you must give priority to the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.519
 from left 'and right' that you have to stop 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.590
 that for you a priority road is what is 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.090
 This traffic sign you must stop all stop 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.160
 wait you have to stop 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.500
 you have to stop and they turn right left 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.329
 watch and drive on 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.090
 you have to stop here because maybe there 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:21.000
