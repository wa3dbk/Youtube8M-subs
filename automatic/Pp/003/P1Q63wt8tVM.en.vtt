choo-choo it in Natick to be safe if

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.890 
choo-choo it in Natick to be safe if
you're<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:14.940> getting<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.360> ice<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.690> pond

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
you're just getting on the ice in a pond

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.269 
you're just getting on the ice in a pond
you<00:00:16.080> didn't<00:00:16.410> know<00:00:16.560> anything<00:00:16.800> about<00:00:17.010> you'd

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
you didn't know anything about you'd

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:35.020 
you didn't know anything about you'd
want<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.609> sample<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.570> ice<00:00:18.720> thickness

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:43.880 

and<00:00:36.030> then<00:00:36.180> once<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> through<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.050> it's

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
and then once you through so it's it's

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.119 
and then once you through so it's it's
thicker<00:00:44.220> than<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.900> ice<00:00:45.900> ladle<00:00:46.470> or<00:00:46.620> spoon<00:00:46.920> as

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
thicker than this ice ladle or spoon as

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.979 
thicker than this ice ladle or spoon as
ice<00:00:47.280> anglers<00:00:47.520> call<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.600> probably<00:00:48.930> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
ice anglers call it so it's probably a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.560 
ice anglers call it so it's probably a
good<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.489> environmental<00:00:50.940> police<00:00:51.059> officer

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
good as the environmental police officer

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.549 
good as the environmental police officer
told<00:00:51.720> us<00:00:51.930> 15<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> 18<00:00:52.800> inches<00:00:53.070> they<00:00:54.350> decided<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
told us 15 to 18 inches they decided to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.680 
told us 15 to 18 inches they decided to
fish<00:00:56.160> off<00:00:56.400> kind<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.790> off<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.030> point<00:00:57.420> here

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
fish off kind of off this point here

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.720 
fish off kind of off this point here
points<00:00:58.440> seem<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.830> a<00:00:58.860> good<00:00:59.100> place<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.340> fish

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
points seem to be a good place for fish

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.590 
points seem to be a good place for fish
to<00:00:59.879> congregate

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
to congregate

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.170 
to congregate
so<00:01:00.750> we've<00:01:00.900> drilled<00:01:01.199> our<00:01:01.379> hole<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.830> little<00:01:02.250> ladle

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
so we've drilled our hole a little ladle

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.450 
so we've drilled our hole a little ladle
and<00:01:03.330> cleared<00:01:03.600> out<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> ice<00:01:04.080> chips<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:05.250> have

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and cleared out the ice chips we have

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.310 
and cleared out the ice chips we have
what<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.610> call<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.820> sounder<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
what we call a sounder and what the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.050 
what we call a sounder and what the
sounder<00:01:07.740> does<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> tells<00:01:08.430> us<00:01:08.610> our<00:01:08.729> depth

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
sounder does is it tells us our depth

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.660 
sounder does is it tells us our depth
and<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.080> important<00:01:10.680> because<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:11.130> set<00:01:11.460> our

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and that's important because we set our

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.850 
and that's important because we set our
shiner<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> water<00:01:12.570> column<00:01:12.870> we<00:01:13.500> don't<00:01:13.710> want

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
shiner in the water column we don't want

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.649 
shiner in the water column we don't want
to<00:01:13.950> set<00:01:14.190> it<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.090> bottom<00:01:15.450> because<00:01:15.510> a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
to set it right on the bottom because a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.969 
to set it right on the bottom because a
lot<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> times<00:01:16.110> are<00:01:16.260> still<00:01:16.350> aquatic

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
lot of times are still aquatic

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.370 
lot of times are still aquatic
vegetation<00:01:17.490> down<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.600> shiner<00:01:19.020> will

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
vegetation down there the shiner will

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.010 
vegetation down there the shiner will
seek<00:01:20.070> cover<00:01:20.390> thank<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.600> are<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.720> gonna<00:01:21.810> use

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
seek cover thank you are you gonna use

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.050 
seek cover thank you are you gonna use
when<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.290> ice<00:01:22.440> fish<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> winter<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.640> what

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
when you ice fish in the winter is what

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.000 
when you ice fish in the winter is what
we<00:01:24.150> call<00:01:24.299> tip-ups<00:01:24.750> ice-fishing<00:01:25.290> traps<00:01:25.470> or

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
we call tip-ups ice-fishing traps or

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.289 
we call tip-ups ice-fishing traps or
types<00:01:26.250> they<00:01:26.640> go<00:01:26.760> by<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.940> couple<00:01:27.119> different

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
types they go by a couple different

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.440 
types they go by a couple different
names<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.810> basically<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.260> a<00:01:28.470> fancy<00:01:28.950> way<00:01:29.450> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
names and basically just a fancy way to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
names and basically just a fancy way to
get<00:01:30.600> your<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.770> bait<00:01:31.920> into<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> water

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
get your to get your bait into the water

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.950 
get your to get your bait into the water
so<00:01:32.939> you're<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.119> gonna<00:01:33.240> open<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.689> up<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.930> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
so you're just gonna open it up like a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.190 
so you're just gonna open it up like a
cross<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.180> gonna<00:01:36.420> sit<00:01:36.720> over<00:01:37.050> your

you're gonna put a shiner on and you can
let<00:01:48.300> that<00:01:48.390> swim<00:01:48.690> under<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:48.990> water<00:01:49.080> surface

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
let that swim under the water surface

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.810 
let that swim under the water surface
the<00:01:50.780> best<00:01:51.780> part<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.980> this<00:01:53.250> flag<00:01:53.580> right

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the best part of all is this flag right

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.580 
the best part of all is this flag right
here<00:01:53.880> you're<00:01:54.150> gonna<00:01:54.240> set<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> flag<00:01:54.960> once<00:01:55.350> that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
here you're gonna set the flag once that

here you're gonna set the flag once that
once<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.460> fish<00:01:56.760> or<00:01:56.970> shiner<00:01:57.240> was<00:01:57.480> on

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
once the little fish or shiner was on

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.940 
once the little fish or shiner was on
the<00:01:57.750> hook<00:01:57.900> and<00:01:58.050> in<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.200> water<00:01:58.410> and<00:01:58.830> what
