here<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.280> uplink<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.660> map<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:15.900> kind<00:00:16.590> of

all<00:00:29.130> these<00:00:29.580> maps<00:00:29.820> are<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.060> very<00:00:30.359> good<00:00:30.539> for

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
all these maps are not very good for

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.600 
all these maps are not very good for
trickshotting<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.470> uplink<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.340> best

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
trickshotting and uplink is the best

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.959 
trickshotting and uplink is the best
well<00:00:33.329> there's<00:00:33.780> like<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.260> good<00:00:34.890> two<00:00:35.190> spots<00:00:35.550> or<00:00:35.760> so

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
well there's like a good two spots or so

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.119 
well there's like a good two spots or so
for<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.290> actually<00:00:37.440> trick<00:00:37.829> shot<00:00:38.010> off

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
for that you can actually trick shot off

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.500 
for that you can actually trick shot off
this<00:00:38.280> map<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.120> them<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
this map and this is one of them that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.840 
this map and this is one of them that
spot<00:00:39.809> i<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.140> showed<00:00:40.320> right<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:40.850> it's

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
spot i just showed right there it's

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.819 
spot i just showed right there it's
that's<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.660> spot<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.930> everyone<00:00:43.379> knows<00:00:43.559> from

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that's the spot that everyone knows from

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.310 
that's the spot that everyone knows from
summit<00:00:44.250> from<00:00:44.370> black<00:00:44.610> ops<00:00:44.820> 1<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.300> then<00:00:45.840> there's

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
summit from black ops 1 and then there's

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.080 
summit from black ops 1 and then there's
this<00:00:46.530> spot<00:00:46.710> which<00:00:47.039> isn't<00:00:47.309> very<00:00:47.340> good<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:47.730> it's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
this spot which isn't very good but it's

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.990 
this spot which isn't very good but it's
it's<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:49.230> makeshift<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.070> there's<00:00:50.520> an<00:00:50.700> enemy

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
it's it's makeshift if there's an enemy

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.350 
it's it's makeshift if there's an enemy
over<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:52.370> now<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.430> next<00:00:53.610> map<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.210> is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
over there now the next map we have is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.799 
over there now the next map we have is
rush<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.789> this<00:00:56.789> map<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> very

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
rush and this map is really not a very

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.049 
rush and this map is really not a very
good<00:00:58.020> map<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.559> guys<00:00:58.800> see<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.160> map<00:00:59.370> try<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
good map if you guys see this map try to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.420 
good map if you guys see this map try to
vote<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.390> down<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.809> not<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.739> try<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.039> vote<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
vote it down do not like try to vote the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.759 
vote it down do not like try to vote the
other<00:01:02.609> map<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.809> maps<00:01:04.140> probably<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
other map because this maps probably the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.260 
other map because this maps probably the
worst<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.129> all<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.400> them<00:01:05.519> there's<00:01:06.119> only

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
worst out of all of them there's only

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.480 
worst out of all of them there's only
one<00:01:06.510> spot<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.140> map<00:01:07.380> really<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.189> could

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
one spot on this map really that I could

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.580 
one spot on this map really that I could
find<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.810> map<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.439> would

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
find because a lot of this map you would

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.080 
find because a lot of this map you would
think<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:11.070> up<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.310> roof<00:01:11.640> over<00:01:11.939> there

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
think you get up on that roof over there

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.690 
think you get up on that roof over there
but<00:01:12.720> no<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> can't<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.560> shows<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
but no you can't it just shows that you

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.730 
but no you can't it just shows that you
can't<00:01:14.970> get<00:01:15.119> up<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.689> anything<00:01:16.020> on

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
can't get up on it really anything on

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.429 
can't get up on it really anything on
that<00:01:17.310> map<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.970> that's<00:01:18.720> really<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.080> only<00:01:19.140> spot

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
that map so that's really the only spot

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.800 
that map so that's really the only spot
you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.799> get<00:01:20.159> up<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.570> map

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you can get up get up to on that map

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.859 
you can get up get up to on that map
black<00:01:22.770> ops<00:01:23.009> 2<00:01:23.310> they<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.850> Treyarch<00:01:24.600> really

anything and for Cove this is really the
only<00:01:30.900> spot<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:32.850> it's

a<00:01:33.420> little<00:01:33.659> bit<00:01:33.780> better<00:01:33.900> than<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> other<00:01:34.380> spots

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
a little bit better than the other spots

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
a little bit better than the other spots
there's<00:01:35.250> also<00:01:35.430> like<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.670> rock<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.240> just

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
there's also like a rock that I just

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.429 
there's also like a rock that I just
shot<00:01:36.689> at<00:01:36.869> which<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:39.110> which<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
shot at which is the which is like a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.649 
shot at which is the which is like a
good<00:01:40.619> suicide<00:01:41.159> spot<00:01:41.369> i<00:01:41.430> guess<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.509> like

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
good suicide spot i guess it you like

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.410 
good suicide spot i guess it you like
drown<00:01:42.990> right<00:01:43.020> afterwards<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.149> this<00:01:45.149> spot

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
drown right afterwards and this spot

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.649 
drown right afterwards and this spot
right<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.320> ok<00:01:46.799> too<00:01:46.860> um<00:01:47.659> honestly

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
right here this is ok too um honestly

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.480 
right here this is ok too um honestly
there's<00:01:48.960> not<00:01:49.079> much<00:01:49.290> box<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.070> map<00:01:50.250> either

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
there's not much box on this map either

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.359 
there's not much box on this map either
but<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.990> know<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.290> kind<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.619> makeshift<00:01:53.130> you

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
but you know it's kind of makeshift you

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.280 
but you know it's kind of makeshift you
just<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.880> what<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.060> want<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:55.170> these

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
just do what you want to do on these

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.859 
just do what you want to do on these
maps<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> last<00:01:57.090> map<00:01:57.329> its<00:01:57.509> detour

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
maps so this is the last map its detour

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.209 
maps so this is the last map its detour
it's<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.140> little<00:01:58.409> bit<00:01:58.530> better<00:01:58.680> than<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> other

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
it's a little bit better than the other

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.010 
it's a little bit better than the other
two<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.670> there's<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.329> nothing<00:02:00.750> about

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
two but there's really nothing about

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.289 
two but there's really nothing about
this<00:02:01.200> map<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.770> makes<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.430> any<00:02:02.549> anything

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
this map that makes it any anything

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.480 
this map that makes it any anything
special<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.860> really<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.189> only<00:02:05.219> good

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
special this is really the only good

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.459 
special this is really the only good
spot<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.030> when<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.780> might<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.140> able<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.439> a

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
spot is when you might be able to do a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.169 
spot is when you might be able to do a
ladder<00:02:07.740> stall<00:02:08.009> off<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.399> ladder<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.910> just

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
ladder stall off that ladder that I just

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.360 
ladder stall off that ladder that I just
went<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.110> truck<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:11.129> that's

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
went up on on the truck but that's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.940 
went up on on the truck but that's
really<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.790> only<00:02:11.819> spot<00:02:12.300> and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
really the only spot and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.949 
really the only spot and
like<00:02:13.129> like<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.730> said<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.510> know<00:02:14.629> there's<00:02:14.780> not

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
like like I said you know there's not

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.690 
like like I said you know there's not
many<00:02:15.140> good<00:02:15.410> spots<00:02:15.739> in<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.010> map<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:16.430> if<00:02:16.550> you

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
many good spots in this map so if you

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.869 
many good spots in this map so if you
see<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.030> map<00:02:17.300> from<00:02:17.330> your<00:02:18.140> map<00:02:18.319> packs<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:19.580> good

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
see a map from your map packs the good

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.880 
see a map from your map packs the good
summary<00:02:20.269> of<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:20.480> these<00:02:20.810> map<00:02:21.019> packs<00:02:21.319> would<00:02:21.650> be

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
summary of this these map packs would be

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.660 
summary of this these map packs would be
just<00:02:22.879> play<00:02:23.660> uplink<00:02:24.230> because<00:02:24.650> that's<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.250> the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
just play uplink because that's the the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.460 
just play uplink because that's the the
better<00:02:25.879> map<00:02:26.090> for<00:02:26.360> trick<00:02:26.540> shot<00:02:26.780> or<00:02:26.930> I'm<00:02:27.170> not

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
better map for trick shot or I'm not

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.500 
better map for trick shot or I'm not
gonna<00:02:27.650> lie<00:02:27.860> these<00:02:28.550> maps<00:02:28.760> are<00:02:28.940> not<00:02:29.000> very<00:02:29.209> good

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
gonna lie these maps are not very good

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.890 
gonna lie these maps are not very good
and<00:02:29.750> uplink<00:02:30.680> is<00:02:30.769> probably<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.190> best<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:31.910> see

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
and uplink is probably the best so see

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.600 
and uplink is probably the best so see
that<00:02:33.080> was<00:02:33.290> like<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.470> little<00:02:33.650> suicide<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.250> found

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
spots I found on these maps on some of

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.370 
spots I found on these maps on some of
what<00:02:52.519> I<00:02:52.549> think<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:53.030> these<00:02:53.120> maps<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:54.290> be

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
what I think of these maps and to be

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.600 
what I think of these maps and to be
honest<00:02:54.650> they're<00:02:54.769> not<00:02:54.920> very<00:02:55.099> good<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.519> know

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
honest they're not very good you know

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.009 
honest they're not very good you know
the<00:02:55.760> vengeance<00:02:56.120> dlc<00:02:56.510> does<00:02:56.660> not<00:02:56.810> look<00:02:56.959> like

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
the vengeance dlc does not look like

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.589 
the vengeance dlc does not look like
it's<00:02:57.319> going<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.530> be<00:02:57.620> one<00:02:57.769> for<00:02:57.950> trickshotting

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
it's going to be one for trickshotting

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.270 
it's going to be one for trickshotting
because<00:02:59.599> they<00:03:00.349> really<00:03:00.560> do<00:03:00.709> tease<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.130> on<00:03:01.250> a

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
because they really do tease you on a

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.460 
because they really do tease you on a
lot<00:03:01.459> of<00:03:01.519> these<00:03:01.670> spots<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.180> things<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:03.170> kind

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
lot of these spots the things that kind

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.020 
lot of these spots the things that kind
of<00:03:03.500> looks<00:03:03.739> like<00:03:03.829> you<00:03:03.950> can<00:03:04.220> get<00:03:04.340> up<00:03:04.459> onto<00:03:04.670> these

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
of looks like you can get up onto these

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.930 
of looks like you can get up onto these
spots<00:03:05.299> but<00:03:05.599> you<00:03:06.140> can't<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.650> just<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:07.400> just<00:03:07.430> kind
