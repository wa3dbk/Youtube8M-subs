so<00:02:03.759> you<00:02:03.789> can<00:02:04.119> finish<00:02:04.299> first<00:02:04.780> second<00:02:05.259> third<00:02:05.560> or

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
so you can finish first second third or

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.940 
so you can finish first second third or
fourth<00:02:06.390> based<00:02:07.390> on<00:02:07.689> how<00:02:08.019> you<00:02:08.080> do<00:02:08.410> in<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.739> game

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
fourth based on how you do in the game

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.580 
fourth based on how you do in the game
and<00:02:09.250> then<00:02:10.060> I'll<00:02:10.239> also<00:02:10.390> be<00:02:10.690> based<00:02:10.869> on<00:02:11.140> how<00:02:11.380> many

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
and then I'll also be based on how many

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.339 
and then I'll also be based on how many
enemies<00:02:12.099> you<00:02:12.340> defeat<00:02:12.730> as<00:02:13.630> well<00:02:13.930> as<00:02:14.080> how<00:02:14.290> many

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
enemies you defeat as well as how many

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.860 
enemies you defeat as well as how many
Mickey<00:02:14.769> heads<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.370> collect

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.619 

there's<00:02:19.470> also<00:02:19.739> power-ups<00:02:20.489> that<00:02:20.849> you'll<00:02:21.450> be

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
there's also power-ups that you'll be

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.660 
there's also power-ups that you'll be
getting<00:02:21.989> both<00:02:22.200> good<00:02:22.500> power-ups<00:02:23.099> as<00:02:23.310> well<00:02:23.489> as

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
getting both good power-ups as well as

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.290 
getting both good power-ups as well as
bad<00:02:23.940> power-ups<00:02:24.920> when<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.040> get<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.430> bad<00:02:26.610> powerup

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
bad power-ups when you get a bad powerup

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.750 
bad power-ups when you get a bad powerup
it's<00:02:27.510> actually<00:02:27.930> going<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.200> be<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.410> hex<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.160> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
it's actually going to be a hex and the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.820 
it's actually going to be a hex and the
hex<00:02:29.970> you'll<00:02:30.209> do<00:02:30.390> really<00:02:30.660> wacky<00:02:31.080> things<00:02:31.500> like

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
hex you'll do really wacky things like

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.289 
hex you'll do really wacky things like
turn<00:02:32.129> you<00:02:32.340> into<00:02:32.519> a<00:02:32.730> basketball<00:02:33.360> or<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:36.180> know

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
turn you into a basketball or you know

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.869 
turn you into a basketball or you know
you<00:02:36.360> might<00:02:36.599> be<00:02:36.780> turned<00:02:37.019> into<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.410> chicken<00:02:37.879> but

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
you might be turned into a chicken but

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.000 
you might be turned into a chicken but
the<00:02:39.030> fun<00:02:39.239> part<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.319> can<00:02:40.500> actually

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
the fun part is is that you can actually

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.199 
the fun part is is that you can actually
take<00:02:41.879> your<00:02:41.910> friends<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.930> give<00:02:43.560> them<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.980> hex

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
take your friends and give them the hex

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.640 
take your friends and give them the hex
so<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.720> don't<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.049> to<00:02:46.230> be<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.500> one

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
so that you don't have to be the one

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.949 
so that you don't have to be the one
that's<00:02:46.860> hexed<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.209> hand<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.569> off<00:02:48.690> to

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
that's hexed and you can hand it off to

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.559 
that's hexed and you can hand it off to
them<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.920> there's<00:02:50.280> lots<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.700> cooperative<00:02:51.420> play

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
them so there's lots of cooperative play

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.660 
them so there's lots of cooperative play
there's<00:02:52.079> also<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.470> lot<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.739> competitive<00:02:53.489> play

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
there's also a lot of competitive play

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.150 
there's also a lot of competitive play
you<00:02:54.420> kind<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.780> get<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:54.989> play<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.560> way<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.980> you

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
you kind of get to play the way that you

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.030 
you kind of get to play the way that you
want<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.730> play<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.360> that's<00:02:58.019> what<00:02:58.200> makes<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.650> so

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
want to play and that's what makes it so

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.190

much fun so right now I'm actually
having<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.980> find<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.400> ruby<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.890> I'm<00:03:04.890> also<00:03:05.040> going

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
having to find a ruby and I'm also going

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.170 
having to find a ruby and I'm also going
to<00:03:05.340> use<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.760> crank<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:07.640> that'll<00:03:08.640> position

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
to use this crank and that'll position

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.630 
to use this crank and that'll position
where<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.810> molten<00:03:10.680> lava<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.129> coming<00:03:11.220> out<00:03:11.610> of

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
where the molten lava is coming out of

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.530 
where the molten lava is coming out of
this<00:03:11.930> crazy<00:03:12.930> monkey

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.720 

and<00:03:20.049> I<00:03:20.200> need<00:03:20.379> to<00:03:20.500> actually<00:03:20.650> get<00:03:21.040> up<00:03:21.069> onto<00:03:21.610> that

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
and I need to actually get up onto that

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.059 
and I need to actually get up onto that
platform<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.689> get<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:22.989> Ruby<00:03:23.260> but<00:03:23.650> before<00:03:24.040> I

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
platform and get that Ruby but before I

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.660 
platform and get that Ruby but before I
do<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:24.400> I<00:03:25.980> need<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.310> actually<00:03:27.489> drag<00:03:28.120> this

actually hex me now let's see what kind
of<00:03:45.220> hex<00:03:45.430> I<00:03:45.640> get<00:03:45.879> uh-oh<00:03:46.569> I've<00:03:46.900> been<00:03:47.109> turned<00:03:47.319> into

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
of hex I get uh-oh I've been turned into

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.429 
of hex I get uh-oh I've been turned into
a<00:03:47.680> shoe<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.689> can<00:03:49.870> actually<00:03:50.019> use<00:03:50.409> this

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
a shoe and I can actually use this

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.710 
a shoe and I can actually use this
against<00:03:51.189> my<00:03:51.370> enemies<00:03:51.730> as<00:03:51.940> well<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.420> give<00:03:52.569> them

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
against my enemies as well and give them

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.119 
against my enemies as well and give them
a<00:03:52.840> good<00:03:52.989> big<00:03:53.200> kick<00:03:53.470> with<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.859> shoe<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:56.950> now

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
a good big kick with the shoe and so now

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.410 
a good big kick with the shoe and so now
I'm<00:03:57.370> gonna<00:03:57.579> pick<00:03:57.849> up<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.239> Ruby<00:03:58.629> and<00:04:00.150> bring<00:04:01.150> him

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
I'm gonna pick up the Ruby and bring him

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.740 
I'm gonna pick up the Ruby and bring him
over<00:04:01.450> here<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:04.920> use<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.159> Ruby<00:04:06.519> in<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.180> monkey

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
over here and use the Ruby in the monkey

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.250 
over here and use the Ruby in the monkey
and<00:04:08.909> what<00:04:09.909> that's<00:04:10.150> done<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:10.480> it's<00:04:10.720> actually

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
and what that's done is it's actually

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.050 
and what that's done is it's actually
created<00:04:11.680> a<00:04:11.769> new<00:04:11.920> platform<00:04:12.220> for<00:04:12.819> me<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.000> go<00:04:13.269> to

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
created a new platform for me to go to

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.640 
created a new platform for me to go to
which<00:04:16.060> will<00:04:16.209> get<00:04:16.359> us<00:04:16.389> to<00:04:16.539> a<00:04:16.750> new<00:04:16.959> spot<00:04:17.350> in<00:04:17.380> the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
which will get us to a new spot in the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.250 
which will get us to a new spot in the
game
