going to search for keys on so as you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.720 
going to search for keys on so as you
guys<00:00:34.980> down<00:00:35.190> you're<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> add<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.700> your

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
hand and then you'll have four more

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.889 
hand and then you'll have four more
counters<00:00:38.579> once<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:39.120> special<00:00:39.690> something

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
counters once you just special something

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.959 
counters once you just special something
keys<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.800> you'll<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.489> counter<00:00:41.790> one

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
keys on so you'll have one counter one

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.610 
keys on so you'll have one counter one
counter<00:00:42.300> at<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.540> counter<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> currently

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
counter at one counter so you currently

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.590 
counter at one counter so you currently
have<00:00:44.489> all<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> counters<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.239> get<00:00:45.420> another

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
have all the counters to get another

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.910 
have all the counters to get another
keys<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.079> basically<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.770> guys<00:00:46.890> know

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
keys on so basically as you guys know

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.860 
keys on so basically as you guys know
you<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.370> punch<00:00:47.670> something<00:00:48.000> auto<00:00:48.629> keys

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
you can just punch something auto keys

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.299 
you can just punch something auto keys
so<00:00:49.170> you'll<00:00:49.350> special<00:00:49.649> summon<00:00:49.829> all<00:00:49.980> your<00:00:50.129> keys

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
so you'll special summon all your keys

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.819 
so you'll special summon all your keys
on<00:00:50.539> so<00:00:51.539> once<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.350> keys<00:00:52.649> onto

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
on so once you have all your keys onto

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.850 
on so once you have all your keys onto
their<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.550> don't<00:00:53.670> want<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.940> overlay<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
will make a card over here called steel

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
will make a card over here called steel

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
to the Graveyard so you just detach 1

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.950 
to the Graveyard so you just detach 1
and<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.700> send<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.090> random<00:01:12.450> card<00:01:12.479> doesn't

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and you send one random card doesn't

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.899 
and you send one random card doesn't
matter<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.920> another

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
matter what it is here I have another

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.580 
matter what it is here I have another
cattle<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.390> I'll<00:01:15.570> heat<00:01:15.780> my<00:01:15.930> sector<00:01:16.229> caliber

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
cattle but I'll heat my sector caliber

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.710 
cattle but I'll heat my sector caliber
so<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.860> goes<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> graveyard<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.570> is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
so that goes to the graveyard and it is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.999 
so that goes to the graveyard and it is
sent<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.290> better<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.740> if<00:01:19.890> you're

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
sent so it's better like if you're

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.630 
sent so it's better like if you're
playing<00:01:20.130> against<00:01:20.340> our<00:01:20.460> holds<00:01:20.820> emits<00:01:21.240> not

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
playing against our holds emits not

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.010 
playing against our holds emits not
discarded<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> makes<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.240> difference<00:01:24.390> so

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
discarded and that makes a difference so

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.090 
discarded and that makes a difference so
now<00:01:25.229> you're<00:01:25.380> wondering<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:25.950> from

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
now you're wondering what do you do from

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.710 
now you're wondering what do you do from
here<00:01:26.220> okay<00:01:26.580> well<00:01:27.030> remember<00:01:27.299> when<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.509> got<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
here okay well remember when we got the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.300 
here okay well remember when we got the
last<00:01:27.900> keys<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.350> still<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.710> four<00:01:29.009> counter

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
last keys on we still have four counter

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.460 
last keys on we still have four counter
so<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> do<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.880> remove<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:31.320> more

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
so what you do is remove for more

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.440 
so what you do is remove for more
counters<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.009> we're<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> add<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> six

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
going to special summon all the keys on

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.420 
going to special summon all the keys on
once<00:03:02.440> again<00:03:02.650> because<00:03:03.010> we<00:03:03.040> have<00:03:03.250> all<00:03:03.370> these

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
once again because we have all these

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.340 
once again because we have all these
counters<00:03:03.730> from<00:03:03.850> gateway<00:03:04.239> and<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:04.900> can<00:03:05.050> see

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
counters from gateway and you can see

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.890 
counters from gateway and you can see
this<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.770> just<00:03:05.800> way<00:03:06.130> unfair<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.790> now<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:07.720> can

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
this is just way unfair and now I can

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.510 
this is just way unfair and now I can
just<00:03:07.989> make<00:03:08.140> another<00:03:08.170> one<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.770> I'll<00:03:09.340> go

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
just make another one and I'll go

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.670 
just make another one and I'll go
through<00:03:09.670> everything<00:03:09.970> just<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.380> you<00:03:11.470> get<00:03:11.560> an

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
through everything just so you get an

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.620 
through everything just so you get an
idea<00:03:11.709> of<00:03:11.920> how<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.130> works<00:03:12.430> then<00:03:13.330> we're<00:03:13.480> going<00:03:13.570> to

you<00:04:43.420> get<00:04:43.540> rid<00:04:43.660> of<00:04:43.780> that<00:04:44.620> gusto<00:04:44.920> emeril<00:04:46.320> by

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
you get rid of that gusto emeril by

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.780 
you get rid of that gusto emeril by
tributing<00:04:47.620> keys<00:04:48.010> on<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:50.160> then<00:04:51.160> we<00:04:51.580> still<00:04:51.730> have

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
tributing keys on and then we still have

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.700 
tributing keys on and then we still have
another<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.300> think<00:04:52.840> now<00:04:53.050> we<00:04:53.110> have<00:04:53.320> like<00:04:53.440> a<00:04:53.470> plus

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
another I think now we have like a plus

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.500 
another I think now we have like a plus
one<00:04:54.070> count<00:04:54.340> on<00:04:54.520> every<00:04:54.850> time<00:04:55.030> we're<00:04:55.150> doing<00:04:55.360> this

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
one count on every time we're doing this

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.140 
one count on every time we're doing this
because<00:04:55.720> of<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.440> other<00:04:56.650> extra<00:04:57.310> 6m<00:04:57.850> United

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
because of the other extra 6m United

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.570 
because of the other extra 6m United
that<00:04:58.270> we<00:04:58.360> sacked<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:58.810> we<00:04:58.900> drew<00:04:59.080> into<00:04:59.350> so<00:05:00.100> just

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
that we sacked and we drew into so just

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.220 
that we sacked and we drew into so just
make<00:05:00.730> it<00:05:00.760> again<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.420> then<00:05:03.270> yeah<00:05:04.270> so<00:05:04.750> pretty

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
make it again and then yeah so pretty

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.220 
make it again and then yeah so pretty
unfair<00:05:05.620> stuff<00:05:05.920> here<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:07.000> that's<00:05:07.480> why<00:05:07.720> gateway

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
unfair stuff here and that's why gateway

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.950 
unfair stuff here and that's why gateway
needs<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.500> be<00:05:08.560> banned<00:05:08.770> uh<00:05:09.040> and<00:05:09.550> that's

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
needs to be banned uh and that's

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.780 
needs to be banned uh and that's
basically<00:05:11.160> yeah<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:12.370> should<00:05:12.550> be<00:05:12.580> pretty

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
basically yeah it should be pretty

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.610 
basically yeah it should be pretty
simple<00:05:13.000> from<00:05:13.270> you<00:05:13.390> two<00:05:13.900> guys<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.080> understand

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
simple from you two guys to understand

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.040 
simple from you two guys to understand
that<00:05:14.950> basically<00:05:15.820> you're<00:05:16.060> pona<00:05:16.330> has<00:05:16.570> to<00:05:16.690> topic

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
that basically you're pona has to topic

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.690 
that basically you're pona has to topic
and<00:05:17.200> after<00:05:17.800> that<00:05:17.890> you<00:05:18.010> still<00:05:18.160> have<00:05:18.310> your

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
and after that you still have your

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.000 
and after that you still have your
gateway<00:05:18.940> if<00:05:19.330> you<00:05:19.420> and<00:05:19.600> as<00:05:20.140> you<00:05:20.440> guys<00:05:20.500> know<00:05:20.620> any

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
gateway if you and as you guys know any

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.290 
gateway if you and as you guys know any
time<00:05:21.160> when<00:05:21.280> you<00:05:21.340> open<00:05:21.550> up<00:05:21.610> a<00:05:21.730> gateway<00:05:21.880> you're

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
time when you open up a gateway you're

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.640 
time when you open up a gateway you're
in<00:05:22.420> such<00:05:22.660> an<00:05:22.810> advantage<00:05:23.110> versus<00:05:23.530> your

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
in such an advantage versus your

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.620 
in such an advantage versus your
opponent<00:05:23.980> anyways<00:05:24.310> as<00:05:25.210> long<00:05:25.360> as<00:05:25.480> they<00:05:25.540> don't

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
counters we can I'm pretty sure we I

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.400 
counters we can I'm pretty sure we I
don't<00:06:22.150> know<00:06:22.210> how<00:06:22.330> many<00:06:22.510> we<00:06:22.630> have<00:06:22.660> but<00:06:23.170> i'm<00:06:23.350> sure

that at this point you guys understand
how<00:06:25.720> the<00:06:25.780> loop<00:06:26.020> works<00:06:26.250> I'm<00:06:27.250> sorry<00:06:27.880> like<00:06:28.060> I<00:06:28.090> best

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
how the loop works I'm sorry like I best

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.930 
how the loop works I'm sorry like I best
up<00:06:28.480> like<00:06:28.600> I<00:06:28.720> tributed<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:30.340> monster<00:06:30.729> first

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
up like I tributed the monster first

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.460 
up like I tributed the monster first
once<00:06:31.270> but<00:06:31.540> like<00:06:31.660> it<00:06:31.840> doesn't<00:06:32.050> matter<00:06:32.260> if<00:06:32.320> you

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
once but like it doesn't matter if you

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.239 
once but like it doesn't matter if you
because<00:06:32.830> i<00:06:32.890> accidentally<00:06:33.250> tributed<00:06:33.850> this

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:44.839 
but you guys get the idea handed the 6am

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.569 
but you guys get the idea handed the 6am
right<00:06:45.019> basically<00:06:45.799> you<00:06:45.949> just<00:06:45.979> need<00:06:46.189> to<00:06:46.279> open<00:06:46.519> up

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:46.579 
right basically you just need to open up

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:49.299 
right basically you just need to open up
with<00:06:46.839> hand<00:06:47.839> into<00:06:48.019> the<00:06:48.049> six<00:06:48.289> samurai<00:06:48.619> more

00:06:49.299 --> 00:06:49.309 
with hand into the six samurai more

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:50.889 
with hand into the six samurai more
obviously<00:06:49.759> spoke<00:06:49.999> signal<00:06:50.299> surgeons<00:06:50.629> card<00:06:50.809> out

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:50.899 
obviously spoke signal surgeons card out

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:52.299 
obviously spoke signal surgeons card out
basically<00:06:51.379> your<00:06:51.589> stinking<00:06:51.799> gateway<00:06:52.039> in<00:06:52.129> this

00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:52.309 
basically your stinking gateway in this

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:53.979 
basically your stinking gateway in this
and<00:06:52.489> then<00:06:52.669> any<00:06:52.879> two<00:06:53.239> cards<00:06:53.449> that<00:06:53.659> could<00:06:53.779> hold

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:53.989 
and then any two cards that could hold

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:56.139 
and then any two cards that could hold
the<00:06:54.199> counters<00:06:54.799> because<00:06:55.099> there's<00:06:55.579> like<00:06:55.639> dojo

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:56.149 
the counters because there's like dojo

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.149 
the counters because there's like dojo
there's<00:06:56.749> some<00:06:56.899> bad<00:06:57.289> cards<00:06:57.649> that<00:06:57.769> you<00:06:57.949> can<00:06:58.069> add

00:06:58.149 --> 00:06:58.159 
there's some bad cards that you can add

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.619 
there's some bad cards that you can add
counters<00:06:58.549> to<00:06:58.729> as<00:06:58.849> well<00:06:58.999> the<00:06:59.149> 6am<00:06:59.419> rated

00:06:59.619 --> 00:06:59.629 
counters to as well the 6am rated

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:02.289 
counters to as well the 6am rated
players<00:06:59.839> don't<00:07:00.019> play<00:07:00.259> but<00:07:00.859> generally<00:07:01.519> I<00:07:01.669> it's

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:02.299 
players don't play but generally I it's

00:07:02.299 --> 00:07:04.269 
players don't play but generally I it's
going<00:07:02.479> to<00:07:02.539> be<00:07:02.629> 6m<00:07:03.169> United<00:07:03.559> or<00:07:03.739> it's<00:07:04.099> going<00:07:04.189> to

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:04.279 
going to be 6m United or it's going to

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:06.549 
going to be 6m United or it's going to
be<00:07:04.399> the<00:07:04.809> ones<00:07:05.809> you<00:07:05.839> can't<00:07:06.079> run<00:07:06.259> multiple

00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:06.559 
be the ones you can't run multiple

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:08.499 
be the ones you can't run multiple
gateways<00:07:06.919> although<00:07:07.519> if<00:07:07.969> you<00:07:08.089> could<00:07:08.269> add<00:07:08.360> this

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:08.509 
gateways although if you could add this

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:09.579 
gateways although if you could add this
would<00:07:08.659> be<00:07:08.749> amazing<00:07:09.110> but<00:07:09.259> yeah<00:07:09.409> that's

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:09.589 
would be amazing but yeah that's

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:11.979 
would be amazing but yeah that's
basically<00:07:09.860> how<00:07:10.369> the<00:07:10.669> loop<00:07:10.999> works<00:07:11.239> and<00:07:11.569> that's

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:11.989 
basically how the loop works and that's

00:07:11.989 --> 00:07:14.169 
basically how the loop works and that's
why<00:07:12.199> I<00:07:12.229> feel<00:07:12.799> a<00:07:12.860> gateway<00:07:13.219> the<00:07:13.339> 16<00:07:13.729> to<00:07:13.849> be<00:07:13.969> banned

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:14.179 
why I feel a gateway the 16 to be banned

00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:15.729 
why I feel a gateway the 16 to be banned
and<00:07:14.360> there's<00:07:14.959> the<00:07:15.079> explanation<00:07:15.499> of<00:07:15.559> how<00:07:15.679> to

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:15.739 
and there's the explanation of how to

00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:17.289 
and there's the explanation of how to
handle<00:07:16.009> up<00:07:16.129> with<00:07:16.549> six<00:07:16.729> samurais<00:07:17.059> if<00:07:17.239> you

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:17.299 
handle up with six samurais if you

00:07:17.299 --> 00:07:18.999 
handle up with six samurais if you
wanted<00:07:17.569> to<00:07:17.629> try<00:07:17.809> it<00:07:17.839> but<00:07:18.409> yeah<00:07:18.559> you<00:07:18.619> do<00:07:18.799> kind<00:07:18.979> of

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:19.009 
wanted to try it but yeah you do kind of

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:20.199 
wanted to try it but yeah you do kind of
have<00:07:19.069> to<00:07:19.159> open<00:07:19.399> up<00:07:19.489> a<00:07:19.519> little<00:07:19.639> bit<00:07:19.849> good<00:07:19.999> but

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:20.209 
have to open up a little bit good but

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:22.239 
have to open up a little bit good but
double-spoke<00:07:21.049> Sigma<00:07:21.319> plus<00:07:21.409> rota<00:07:21.709> your

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:22.249 
double-spoke Sigma plus rota your

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:24.039 
double-spoke Sigma plus rota your
chances<00:07:22.729> of<00:07:22.759> getting<00:07:22.819> hand<00:07:23.360> are<00:07:23.599> pretty<00:07:23.839> good

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:24.049 
chances of getting hand are pretty good

00:07:24.049 --> 00:07:25.479 
chances of getting hand are pretty good
I'd<00:07:24.349> say<00:07:24.379> but<00:07:24.860> thanks<00:07:25.039> for<00:07:25.159> watching<00:07:25.369> guys

let me know what you guys think of this

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:30.009

like<00:07:28.610> you<00:07:29.029> guys<00:07:29.149> think<00:07:29.209> it's<00:07:29.449> broken<00:07:29.659> I<00:07:29.809> think

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:30.019 
like you guys think it's broken I think

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:31.239 
like you guys think it's broken I think
it's<00:07:30.110> broken<00:07:30.349> that's<00:07:30.529> why<00:07:30.679> I<00:07:30.709> think<00:07:30.860> gateway

00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:31.249 
it's broken that's why I think gateway

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:32.739 
it's broken that's why I think gateway
should<00:07:31.399> be<00:07:31.489> banned<00:07:31.699> but<00:07:32.089> let<00:07:32.269> me<00:07:32.299> know<00:07:32.389> if<00:07:32.629> you

should be banned but let me know if you

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:34.149 
should be banned but let me know if you
guys<00:07:32.869> feel<00:07:33.259> gate<00:07:33.499> we<00:07:33.589> should<00:07:33.739> be<00:07:33.859> banned<00:07:34.039> as

00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:34.159 
guys feel gate we should be banned as

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.739 
guys feel gate we should be banned as
well<00:07:34.309> not<00:07:34.909> only<00:07:35.029> do<00:07:35.179> for<00:07:35.329> this<00:07:35.389> loop<00:07:35.569> but

00:07:35.739 --> 00:07:35.749 
well not only do for this loop but

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:37.569 
well not only do for this loop but
gateway<00:07:36.019> obviously<00:07:36.709> is<00:07:36.859> like<00:07:37.069> a<00:07:37.099> problematic

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:37.579 
gateway obviously is like a problematic

00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:39.459 
gateway obviously is like a problematic
card<00:07:37.939> like<00:07:38.149> if<00:07:38.419> they<00:07:38.599> open<00:07:38.749> up<00:07:38.839> a<00:07:38.899> gateway<00:07:39.019> it's

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:39.469 
card like if they open up a gateway it's

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:40.989 
card like if they open up a gateway it's
kind<00:07:39.860> of<00:07:39.889> over<00:07:40.129> but<00:07:40.429> thanks<00:07:40.669> for<00:07:40.759> watching
