00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
and we started out slow because you

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.950

can't really have wake when you're going
in<00:02:53.080> this<00:02:53.170> area<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:53.620> they<00:02:53.710> had<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:53.890> go<00:02:54.010> like<00:02:54.160> 15

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
in this area so they had to go like 15

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.250 
in this area so they had to go like 15
miles<00:02:54.760> an<00:02:54.910> hour<00:02:55.030> which<00:02:55.300> is<00:02:55.420> really<00:02:55.660> boring<00:02:55.960> but

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
miles an hour which is really boring but

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.410 
miles an hour which is really boring but
once<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.100> get<00:02:57.190> out<00:02:57.370> of<00:02:57.400> this<00:02:57.550> area<00:02:57.850> they<00:02:58.120> sped

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
once you get out of this area they sped

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.270 
once you get out of this area they sped
up<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.660> little<00:02:58.900> bit<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.650> was<00:02:59.860> just<00:02:59.890> really

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
up a little bit and I it was just really

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.610 
up a little bit and I it was just really
cool<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.490> see<00:03:00.700> what<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.600> one<00:03:02.110> percent<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.530> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
cool to see what the one percent of the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.520 
cool to see what the one percent of the
world<00:03:02.830> lives<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.630> think<00:03:05.170> one<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.380> the

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
world lives like so I think one of the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.520 
world lives like so I think one of the
next<00:03:05.740> clips<00:03:06.010> yep<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:06.610> there<00:03:06.820> are<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.120> houses

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
next clips yep so there are the houses

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.350 
next clips yep so there are the houses
guys<00:03:08.530> I'm<00:03:08.740> pretty<00:03:08.830> sure<00:03:09.100> these<00:03:09.330> houses<00:03:10.330> are

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.240 
guys I'm pretty sure these houses are
worth<00:03:10.720> definitely<00:03:11.440> more<00:03:11.590> than<00:03:11.620> 5<00:03:11.920> million

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
worth definitely more than 5 million

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.340 
worth definitely more than 5 million
just<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:13.090> way<00:03:13.210> that<00:03:13.420> they're<00:03:13.660> set<00:03:13.930> up<00:03:13.960> next<00:03:14.290> to

the<00:03:14.470> water<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:14.950> just<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.820> size<00:03:16.330> of<00:03:16.840> the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
the water and just the size of the

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.530 
the water and just the size of the
houses<00:03:17.440> themselves<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.459> yeah<00:03:19.270> there<00:03:19.450> we<00:03:19.510> go
