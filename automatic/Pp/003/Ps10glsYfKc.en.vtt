00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
going to be exact but um so the first

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.450 
going to be exact but um so the first
we'll<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.519> go<00:00:23.670> quick<00:00:24.300> whatever<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.460> first

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:48.930 

so

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:59.670 

one<00:00:49.940> more<00:00:50.180> time

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.060 

you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.260 

all<00:01:06.070> right<00:01:06.250> now<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.950> goes<00:01:09.310> on<00:01:09.490> for<00:01:09.550> federal

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
all right now this goes on for federal

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.060 
all right now this goes on for federal
that<00:01:10.540> sounds<00:01:10.840> like<00:01:10.990> super<00:01:11.350> suit<00:01:11.560> because<00:01:11.890> it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
that sounds like super suit because it's

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.870 
that sounds like super suit because it's
all<00:01:12.220> like<00:01:12.550> a<00:01:12.580> symphony<00:01:14.190> though<00:01:15.190> that<00:01:15.369> changes

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
all like a symphony though that changes

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.850 
all like a symphony though that changes
to<00:01:16.150> at<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:17.380> end

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.690 

No

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
No

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:38.110 
No
then<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.240> goes<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:26.600> there

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.880 

he<00:01:39.120> gets<00:01:39.360> into<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.690> changes<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:41.220> town<00:01:42.890> what

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
he gets into that changes the town what

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.010 
he gets into that changes the town what
you<00:01:44.040> play<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.990> go<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.050> see<00:01:47.150> and<00:01:48.150> then<00:01:48.870> what

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
you play is go to see and then what

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.340 
you play is go to see and then what
you're<00:01:49.110> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.290> pull<00:01:49.470> with<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:50.570> believe<00:01:51.570> is

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
you're going to pull with it believe is

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.490 
you're going to pull with it believe is
another<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.670> g

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
another the g

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.820 
another the g
yes<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.730> there<00:01:56.910> you<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:58.220> and<00:01:59.220> then<00:01:59.450> you<00:02:00.450> go<00:02:00.900> down

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
yes so there you go and then you go down

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:14.160 
yes so there you go and then you go down
to<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.070> free<00:02:02.780> and

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.190 

and<00:02:15.170> you're<00:02:15.290> going<00:02:15.379> to<00:02:15.440> play<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:17.209> B<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.930> then

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
and you're going to play the B and then

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:30.440 
and you're going to play the B and then
I<00:02:18.940> think<00:02:19.940> it's<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.420> G<00:02:20.720> flat

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.559 

and<00:02:31.450> then<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:32.470> second<00:02:32.830> time<00:02:32.980> around<00:02:33.010> oh<00:02:33.569> the

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
and then the second time around oh the

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.330 
and then the second time around oh the
same<00:02:34.810> note<00:02:35.459> well<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.490> think<00:02:36.730> it's<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.530> G

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
same note well I think it's is that G

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.090 
same note well I think it's is that G
sharp

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.610 

then<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:44.340> time<00:02:44.900> but<00:02:45.900> that's<00:02:46.080> enough<00:02:46.410> but

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
then this time but that's enough but

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:54.130 
then this time but that's enough but
then<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:46.920> play<00:02:47.160> e

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:12.040 

so<00:02:55.140> all<00:02:55.590> together<00:02:56.120> will<00:02:57.120> be<00:02:57.239> like

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.730 

like<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.640> seven<00:03:14.870> take<00:03:15.870> turn<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.380> speakers

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
like that seven take turn the speakers

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:25.810 
like that seven take turn the speakers
off<00:03:17.360> we<00:03:18.360> put<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.780> into<00:03:19.170> out<00:03:20.600> in<00:03:21.600> two<00:03:22.560> strings

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.300 

now<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:26.880> don't<00:03:27.060> put<00:03:27.270> on<00:03:27.330> slow<00:03:27.870> strings<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:29.040> put

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
now I don't put on slow strings and put

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.850 
now I don't put on slow strings and put
strings<00:03:29.610> on<00:03:29.760> for<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.090> right<00:03:30.270> half<00:03:30.860> normal

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
strings on for the right half normal

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.720 
strings on for the right half normal
strings<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.460> then<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.930> left<00:03:34.500> half<00:03:34.770> I<00:03:35.040> put

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
strings and then for the left half I put

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:53.540 
strings and then for the left half I put
on<00:03:35.850> slow<00:03:36.300> strings<00:03:38.240> show<00:03:43.040> okay<00:03:51.590> so<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:53.160> will<00:03:53.370> go

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
on slow strings show okay so it will go

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:12.369 
on slow strings show okay so it will go
a<00:03:53.580> transition<00:03:56.060> play

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.159 

that's<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:13.530> basic<00:04:13.920> right<00:04:14.099> there<00:04:14.310> with<00:04:15.299> the

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
that's the basic right there with the

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:43.370 
that's the basic right there with the
other<00:04:16.320> part<00:04:16.620> would<00:04:16.859> sound<00:04:17.160> more<00:04:17.310> like

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.879 

somewhat<00:04:44.380> like<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.840> through<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.620> entire

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
somewhat like that so through the entire

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:55.050 
somewhat like that so through the entire
thing<00:04:47.919> I<00:04:48.310> mean<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:49.000> can<00:04:49.180> play<00:04:49.740> see<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:53.729> mean<00:04:54.729> I

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060
