00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
quick is I'm going to square this piece

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.220 
quick is I'm going to square this piece
of<00:00:04.230> fabric<00:00:04.410> up<00:00:04.710> on<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.950> end<00:00:05.569> by<00:00:06.569> lining<00:00:07.049> up<00:00:07.200> my

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
of fabric up on the end by lining up my

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.100 
of fabric up on the end by lining up my
mark<00:00:07.680> on<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.950> bottom<00:00:08.510> so<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.719> can<00:00:09.960> get<00:00:10.050> a

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
mark on the bottom so that I can get a

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.680 
mark on the bottom so that I can get a
good<00:00:10.290> square<00:00:10.620> piece<00:00:10.830> now<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:12.000> particular

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
good square piece now this particular

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.570 
good square piece now this particular
piece<00:00:12.960> we're<00:00:13.889> going<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.070> we're<00:00:14.280> making

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
piece we're going to we're making

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.730 
piece we're going to we're making
binding<00:00:15.030> for<00:00:15.240> something<00:00:15.599> else

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
binding for something else

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.120 
binding for something else
so<00:00:16.949> what<00:00:17.250> we're<00:00:17.369> making<00:00:17.520> binding<00:00:18.119> for<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:19.130> an

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
so what we're making binding for is an

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.580 
so what we're making binding for is an
apron<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.240> know<00:00:21.300> when<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> do<00:00:21.810> my<00:00:22.109> binding

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
apron and I know when I do my binding

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.670 
apron and I know when I do my binding
aprons<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.369> only<00:00:24.000> need<00:00:24.390> about<00:00:24.420> 18<00:00:25.260> inches<00:00:25.500> of

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
aprons I only need about 18 inches of

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.470 
aprons I only need about 18 inches of
binding<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:27.119> as<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:28.369> do<00:00:29.369> my<00:00:29.550> 18<00:00:30.000> inches<00:00:30.300> of

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
binding so as I do my 18 inches of

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.380 
binding so as I do my 18 inches of
binding<00:00:30.869> I'm<00:00:31.199> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> cut<00:00:31.830> 18<00:00:32.160> inches<00:00:32.460> okay

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
binding I'm going to cut 18 inches okay

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.530 
binding I'm going to cut 18 inches okay
so<00:00:34.320> next<00:00:34.559> step<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.149> found

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
so next step is to do this I have found

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.790 
so next step is to do this I have found
that<00:00:37.500> instead<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.070> messing<00:00:38.399> with<00:00:38.640> selvages

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
that instead of messing with selvages

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.990 
that instead of messing with selvages
because<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.829> don't<00:00:41.100> want<00:00:41.340> my<00:00:41.460> selvage<00:00:41.879> is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
because I don't want my selvage is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.290 
because I don't want my selvage is
caught<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.540> my<00:00:42.690> binding<00:00:43.399> ever<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.969> don't<00:00:45.120> want

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
caught in my binding ever you don't want

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.389 
caught in my binding ever you don't want
that<00:00:45.360> little<00:00:45.539> white<00:00:45.809> strip<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.770> caught<00:00:47.039> I'm

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that little white strip to be caught I'm

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.160 
that little white strip to be caught I'm
going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.969> line<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.420> really<00:00:48.870> good<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
going to line this up really good and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.410 
going to line this up really good and
I'm<00:00:49.379> actually<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> cut<00:00:50.280> off<00:00:50.610> my<00:00:50.879> selvage

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
I'm actually going to cut off my selvage

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.860 
I'm actually going to cut off my selvage
and<00:00:51.920> I'm<00:00:52.920> actually<00:00:53.250> giving<00:00:53.820> myself<00:00:54.120> plenty<00:00:54.660> of

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and I'm actually giving myself plenty of

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.849 
and I'm actually giving myself plenty of
room<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:56.969> probably<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.170> may<00:00:58.410> cut<00:00:58.710> an

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
room so probably you know you may cut an

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.990 
room so probably you know you may cut an
inch<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.309> an<00:00:59.399> inch<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.730> half<00:01:01.010> okay<00:01:02.010> now

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
inch to an inch and a half okay now

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.789 
inch to an inch and a half okay now
we're<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> take<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.140> piece<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.409> fabric

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
we're going to take this piece of fabric

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.760 
we're going to take this piece of fabric
and<00:01:05.220> unfold<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:07.700> okay<00:01:08.700> our<00:01:09.000> first<00:01:09.720> step<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.350> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
and unfold it okay our first step is to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.969 
and unfold it okay our first step is to
bring<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.100> corner<00:01:11.520> down<00:01:11.729> towards<00:01:12.270> me<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.979> we

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
bring this corner down towards me and we

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.130 
bring this corner down towards me and we
are<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.549> line<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.630> perfect

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
are going to line that up just perfect

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.800 
are going to line that up just perfect
but<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.130> our<00:01:17.280> first<00:01:17.490> step<00:01:17.759> okay<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.659> then

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
but this is our first step okay so then

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.730 
but this is our first step okay so then
what<00:01:18.930> we're<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.470> we're<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.770 
what we're going to do is we're going to
fold<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.390> right<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.840> angle<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:23.780> on

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
fold this right up on this angle and on

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.780 
fold this right up on this angle and on
the<00:01:25.020> fold<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.770> prefer<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.310> press<00:01:26.580> that

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the fold and if you prefer to press that

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.069 
the fold and if you prefer to press that
fold<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.270> fine<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.930> don't<00:01:29.570> like<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.659> look<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
fold that fine I don't like a look and

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.429 
fold that fine I don't like a look and
then<00:01:31.380> we're<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.990> just<00:01:33.990> keep<00:01:34.170> folding

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
then we're going to just keep folding

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.910 
then we're going to just keep folding
this<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:36.049> now<00:01:37.049> gets<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> tricky

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
this up and now gets to be the tricky

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.950 
this up and now gets to be the tricky
part<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.460> sometimes<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.180> will<00:01:39.329> actually<00:01:39.750> take

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
part and sometimes I will actually take

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.819 
part and sometimes I will actually take
and<00:01:40.110> lay<00:01:40.290> my<00:01:40.530> ruler<00:01:41.299> like<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.560> can

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
and lay my ruler like this so that I can

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.240 
and lay my ruler like this so that I can
get<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.869> nice<00:01:45.869> straight<00:01:46.320> edge<00:01:46.350> I'm<00:01:47.189> going

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
get that a nice straight edge I'm going

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.679 
get that a nice straight edge I'm going
to<00:01:47.399> pull<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.610> back<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:50.390> very<00:01:51.390> carefully

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
to pull that back out very carefully

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:02.980 
to pull that back out very carefully
lift

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.470 

and<00:02:03.990> flip<00:02:04.440> that<00:02:04.650> that<00:02:04.950> way<00:02:05.160> and<00:02:05.430> you've<00:02:06.150> got<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
and flip that that way and you've got it

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.670 
and flip that that way and you've got it
folded<00:02:06.860> okay<00:02:08.000> so<00:02:09.000> at<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:09.600> point<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.320> so<00:02:10.619> you

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
folded okay so at this point and so you

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.260 
folded okay so at this point and so you
can<00:02:10.920> see<00:02:11.070> this<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.340> pretty<00:02:11.520> straight<00:02:11.910> because

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
can see this is pretty straight because

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.660 
can see this is pretty straight because
of<00:02:12.420> where<00:02:12.690> my<00:02:12.810> lines<00:02:13.110> are<00:02:13.350> coming<00:02:13.500> well<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.430> had

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
of where my lines are coming well I had

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.270 
of where my lines are coming well I had
it<00:02:14.790> there<00:02:14.970> straight<00:02:15.270> right<00:02:15.900> there<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:17.010> we're

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
it there straight right there so we're

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.800 
it there straight right there so we're
doing<00:02:17.340> pretty<00:02:17.580> good<00:02:17.760> there<00:02:17.820> okay<00:02:18.540> now<00:02:18.780> our

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
doing pretty good there okay now our

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.220 
doing pretty good there okay now our
next<00:02:19.110> step<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.710> we're<00:02:20.130> going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.430> take<00:02:21.230> line

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
next step is we're going to take line

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.810 
next step is we're going to take line
the<00:02:22.500> straight<00:02:22.800> edge<00:02:22.950> up<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.400> bottom<00:02:23.730> and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
the straight edge up on the bottom and

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.500 
the straight edge up on the bottom and
we're<00:02:23.910> going<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.090> cut<00:02:24.300> off<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:25.020> two<00:02:25.350> folds<00:02:25.770> so

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
we're going to cut off up two folds so

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.530 
we're going to cut off up two folds so
there<00:02:27.510> was<00:02:27.600> my<00:02:27.720> folded<00:02:28.140> piece<00:02:28.320> that<00:02:28.500> just<00:02:28.530> went

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
there was my folded piece that just went

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.970 
there was my folded piece that just went
and<00:02:30.540> then<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.840> kind<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.230> fold<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:31.590> up<00:02:31.770> on<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and then we kind of fold this up on the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.540 
and then we kind of fold this up on the
bottom<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.760> can<00:02:32.970> twist<00:02:33.270> this<00:02:33.450> around

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
bottom so that I can twist this around

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.000 
bottom so that I can twist this around
now<00:02:35.550> we're<00:02:36.450> making<00:02:36.780> binding<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.320> an<00:02:37.380> apron<00:02:37.770> so

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
now we're making binding for an apron so

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.250 
now we're making binding for an apron so
this<00:02:38.160> binding<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.730> actually<00:02:39.240> only<00:02:39.540> two<00:02:39.780> inches

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
this binding is actually only two inches

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
this binding is actually only two inches
wide<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:41.730> I'm<00:02:42.090> going<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.600> cut<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:43.200> every<00:02:44.010> two

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
wide so I'm going to cut this every two

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.090 
wide so I'm going to cut this every two
inches<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.960> line<00:02:49.260> up<00:02:49.290> on<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.740> bottom

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
inches and I line up on the bottom

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.370 
inches and I line up on the bottom
straight<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.950> we<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.160> proceed<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.700> cut<00:02:54.380> now

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
straight and we just proceed to cut now

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.600 
straight and we just proceed to cut now
I<00:02:56.270> will<00:02:57.270> cut<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:58.050> have<00:02:58.740> very<00:02:59.100> little<00:02:59.340> left
