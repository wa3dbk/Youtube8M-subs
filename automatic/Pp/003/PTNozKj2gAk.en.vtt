00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
sample size warrant some caution but

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.460

what<00:01:12.670> about<00:01:12.880> their<00:01:13.060> results<00:01:13.630> this<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.229> really

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
what about their results this is really

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.260 
what about their results this is really
a<00:01:14.500> story<00:01:14.740> about<00:01:14.890> glycogen<00:01:15.549> which<00:01:15.729> is<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:16.030> type

fatigue that makes it hard to even move
that's<00:01:42.159> a<00:01:42.280> lot<00:01:42.520> of<00:01:42.550> athletes<00:01:43.030> carbo-load

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
that's a lot of athletes carbo-load

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.200 
that's a lot of athletes carbo-load

glycogen<00:01:46.360> afterwards<00:01:47.200> is<00:01:47.380> super<00:01:47.680> important

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
glycogen afterwards is super important

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.280 
glycogen afterwards is super important
too<00:01:48.400> by<00:01:48.760> eating<00:01:49.060> lots<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.450> carbs<00:01:49.750> afterwards

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290

the<00:01:50.560> body's<00:01:50.800> glycogen<00:01:51.310> stores<00:01:51.610> are

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
the body's glycogen stores are

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.700 
the body's glycogen stores are
replenished<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.450> can<00:01:52.690> build<00:01:52.900> bigger<00:01:53.170> muscles

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710

with<00:01:53.860> more<00:01:54.100> glycogen<00:01:54.640> storage<00:01:55.000> capabilities

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
with more glycogen storage capabilities

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.840 
with more glycogen storage capabilities
for<00:01:55.900> future<00:01:55.960> exercise<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.430> is<00:01:57.549> basically

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
for future exercise so this is basically

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.640 
for future exercise so this is basically
what<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.090> study<00:01:58.360> focused<00:01:58.750> on<00:01:58.870> it<00:01:59.260> could<00:01:59.530> mean

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
what the study focused on it could mean

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.680 
what the study focused on it could mean
that<00:01:59.830> any<00:01:59.979> high<00:02:00.220> glycemic<00:02:00.430> index<00:02:00.850> foods<00:02:01.450> would

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
that any high glycemic index foods would

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.510 
that any high glycemic index foods would
restore<00:02:02.020> your<00:02:02.140> glycogen<00:02:02.409> levels<00:02:02.710> like<00:02:03.190> pasta

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
restore your glycogen levels like pasta

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.200 
restore your glycogen levels like pasta
pizza<00:02:04.299> bread<00:02:04.600> rice<00:02:05.049> pasta<00:02:05.979> did<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.400> say<00:02:06.610> pasta<00:02:06.880> I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
pizza bread rice pasta did I say pasta I

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.180 
pizza bread rice pasta did I say pasta I
mean<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.390> really<00:02:07.750> really<00:02:07.930> like<00:02:08.289> pasta<00:02:08.530> another

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
mean I really really like pasta another

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.499

way<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.489> looking<00:02:09.759> at<00:02:09.879> the<00:02:10.000> study<00:02:10.269> is<00:02:10.479> that

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
way of looking at the study is that

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.570 
way of looking at the study is that
sports<00:02:11.019> nutrition<00:02:11.590> supplements<00:02:12.069> work<00:02:12.220> just
