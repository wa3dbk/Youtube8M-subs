in<00:02:15.890> his<00:02:16.930> gives<00:02:17.930> me<00:02:18.080> energy

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
in his gives me energy

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.630 
in his gives me energy
it<00:02:18.710> gives<00:02:18.920> me<00:02:19.010> energy<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:21.040> energy<00:02:22.040> short-lived

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
it gives me energy to energy short-lived

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.680 
it gives me energy to energy short-lived
energy<00:02:23.150> okay<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.200> like<00:02:24.770> these<00:02:24.950> little<00:02:25.010> things

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
blocks so the recipe will say 250 mils

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.330 
blocks so the recipe will say 250 mils
makes<00:02:37.730> about<00:02:37.970> six<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.450> these<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:39.200> would<00:02:40.100> ate
