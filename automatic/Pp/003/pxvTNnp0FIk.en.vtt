is softer and lighter I don't know if
you<00:02:00.230> can<00:02:00.380> if<00:02:00.800> you<00:02:01.040> can<00:02:01.070> tell<00:02:01.520> but<00:02:01.930> this<00:02:02.930> is

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
you can if you can tell but this is

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.850 
you can if you can tell but this is
definitely<00:02:03.500> lighter<00:02:04.340> than<00:02:04.610> this<00:02:04.850> one<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:08.860> the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
definitely lighter than this one and the

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.040 
definitely lighter than this one and the
combs<00:02:10.190> are<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:11.720> combs<00:02:12.020> are<00:02:12.230> different<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:14.050> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
combs are the combs are different to the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.020 
combs are the combs are different to the
combs<00:02:15.440> are<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:18.680> cones<00:02:19.010> are<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.220> little<00:02:19.400> smaller

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
combs are the cones are a little smaller

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.270 
combs are the cones are a little smaller
on<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:21.560> one<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.810> cap<00:02:24.140> construction<00:02:24.470> is

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
on this one the cap construction is

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.900 
on this one the cap construction is
different<00:02:25.880> also<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:27.670> think<00:02:28.670> let's<00:02:29.510> see<00:02:30.880> now<00:02:31.880> i

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
different also I think let's see now i

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.180 
different also I think let's see now i
guess<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.330> cap<00:02:32.540> construction<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:37.780> similar

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
guess the cap construction is similar

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.190 
guess the cap construction is similar
it's<00:02:40.190> similar<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:42.470> combs<00:02:42.890> are<00:02:43.130> not<00:02:43.310> like<00:02:44.200> the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
it's similar the combs are not like the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.320 
it's similar the combs are not like the
combs<00:02:45.530> are<00:02:45.770> sewn<00:02:46.370> on<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:48.560> side<00:02:49.550> here<00:02:50.000> whereas

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
combs are sewn on the side here whereas

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.870 
combs are sewn on the side here whereas
the<00:02:50.480> comb<00:02:50.720> on<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.110> is<00:02:51.470> sewn<00:02:52.010> on<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.190> lace<00:02:52.520> and

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
the comb on this is sewn on a lace and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.030 
the comb on this is sewn on a lace and
not<00:02:53.120> on<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.330> side<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.500> doesn't<00:02:54.709> seem<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:54.950> be

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
not on the side so it doesn't seem to be

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.340 
not on the side so it doesn't seem to be
sewn<00:02:55.790> on<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.060> same<00:02:56.300> place<00:02:59.110> what<00:03:00.110> does<00:03:00.230> this

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
sewn on the same place what does this

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.060 
sewn on the same place what does this
say<00:03:01.420> it's<00:03:02.420> just<00:03:02.570> something<00:03:03.020> I<00:03:03.260> can<00:03:03.620> test

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
say it's just something I can test

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.970 
say it's just something I can test
something<00:03:04.160> written<00:03:04.610> on<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.970> but<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.180> can't

sure<00:04:27.120> this<00:04:28.310> does<00:04:29.310> not<00:04:29.430> look<00:04:29.490> like<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:30.030> lease

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
sure this does not look like the lease

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.850 
sure this does not look like the lease
of<00:04:30.389> rain<00:04:30.570> this<00:04:30.870> does<00:04:31.050> not<00:04:31.080> look<00:04:31.229> like<00:04:31.470> what's

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
of rain this does not look like what's

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.640 
of rain this does not look like what's
on<00:04:32.039> the<00:04:32.250> website<00:04:32.910> this<00:04:33.630> is<00:04:33.810> looks<00:04:34.139> like<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:34.289> beta

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
on the website this is looks like a beta

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:42.439 
on the website this is looks like a beta
of<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:38.810> veined<00:04:40.520> style<00:04:41.520> that<00:04:41.699> has<00:04:41.729> a<00:04:42.090> straight

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
of a veined style that has a straight

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.420 
of a veined style that has a straight
bank<00:04:42.690> across<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.169> front<00:04:43.380> is<00:04:43.889> what<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.250> looks

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
bank across the front is what it looks

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.189 
bank across the front is what it looks
like<00:04:44.639> so<00:04:44.699> I<00:04:44.910> think<00:04:45.270> they<00:04:45.510> might<00:04:45.720> have<00:04:45.750> sent<00:04:46.080> me

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
like so I think they might have sent me

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.170 
like so I think they might have sent me
the<00:04:46.889> wrong<00:04:46.919> way<00:04:47.099> call<00:04:47.490> though<00:04:47.639> that's<00:04:47.880> what<00:04:48.060> it

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
the wrong way call though that's what it

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.150 
the wrong way call though that's what it
says<00:04:48.330> on<00:04:48.449> the<00:04:48.479> card<00:04:48.840> don't<00:04:49.680> think<00:04:49.860> that's<00:04:49.979> what

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
says on the card don't think that's what

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.560 
says on the card don't think that's what
I<00:04:50.190> got<00:04:50.490> so<00:04:51.270> um<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:53.449> am<00:04:54.860> concerned<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:56.510> couple<00:04:57.510> of

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
I got so um I am concerned a couple of

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.210 
I got so um I am concerned a couple of
reasons<00:04:57.690> because<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.169> mean<00:04:58.349> even<00:04:58.560> in<00:04:58.860> my<00:04:58.889> notes

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
reasons because I mean even in my notes

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.710 
reasons because I mean even in my notes
I<00:04:59.400> said<00:04:59.550> this<00:04:59.729> was<00:04:59.880> my<00:05:00.000> second<00:05:00.389> wig<00:05:00.510> and

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
I said this was my second wig and

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.390 
I said this was my second wig and
supposedly<00:05:01.139> when<00:05:01.349> you<00:05:01.470> spend<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:02.010> certain

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
supposedly when you spend a certain

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.430 
supposedly when you spend a certain
amount<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:03.000> get<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.150> VIP<00:05:03.330> card<00:05:03.870> i<00:05:03.990> did<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.349> get

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
amount you get a VIP card i did and get

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.070 
amount you get a VIP card i did and get
the<00:05:04.590> VIP<00:05:04.740> card<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.550> then<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.060> got<00:05:06.270> this<00:05:06.750> wig

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
the VIP card and then I got this wig

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.860 
the VIP card and then I got this wig
which<00:05:07.320> is<00:05:08.030> not<00:05:09.030> what<00:05:09.470> I<00:05:10.470> thought<00:05:11.099> it<00:05:11.159> would<00:05:11.340> be

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
which is not what I thought it would be

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.010 
which is not what I thought it would be
so

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.040 

I'm<00:05:17.500> not<00:05:17.710> happy

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.860
