he was the first he-man to look

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.849 
he was the first he-man to look
completely<00:03:59.750> different<00:04:00.349> than<00:04:00.469> the<00:04:00.530> rest<00:04:00.739> of

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
completely different than the rest of

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.770 
completely different than the rest of
them<00:04:01.010> it's<00:04:01.969> pretty<00:04:02.209> obvious<00:04:02.569> they<00:04:02.689> were

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
them it's pretty obvious they were

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.659 
them it's pretty obvious they were
basing<00:04:03.200> his<00:04:03.349> look<00:04:03.590> off<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:03.799> Dolph<00:04:04.159> Lundgren's

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669
