I'm<00:02:34.940> not<00:02:35.480> suggesting<00:02:35.660> we<00:02:36.110> obsess<00:02:36.470> about<00:02:36.500> death

but<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.570> do<00:02:38.690> think<00:02:39.020> we<00:02:39.260> need<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.650> be<00:02:39.860> informed

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
but I do think we need to be informed

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.910 
but I do think we need to be informed
about<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.390> educated<00:02:41.960> about<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.440> understand

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
about it educated about it to understand

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.500 
about it educated about it to understand
it<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.160> accept<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.090> see<00:02:44.270> it<00:02:44.330> as<00:02:44.480> something

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
it to accept it to see it as something

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.550 
it to accept it to see it as something
that's<00:02:44.870> part<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.320> life<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:47.270> that<00:02:47.600> when<00:02:48.410> it

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
that's part of life so that when it

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.770 
that's part of life so that when it
comes<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.920> us<00:02:49.130> or<00:02:49.700> someone<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.240> we're<00:02:50.540> close

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
life oddly enough when you can be as

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.780 
life oddly enough when you can be as

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
close as you can get to somebody because

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.180 
close as you can get to somebody because

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
you know your time is limited so you

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.930 
you know your time is limited so you
tend<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.940> address<00:03:11.600> if<00:03:11.990> you're<00:03:12.430> not<00:03:13.430> frightened

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
of it every issue that you may have

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.000 
of it every issue that you may have
remaining<00:03:17.110> again<00:03:18.110> I<00:03:18.290> know<00:03:18.410> that<00:03:18.830> some<00:03:18.980> people

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
remaining again I know that some people

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.680 
remaining again I know that some people
don't<00:03:19.310> get<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.519> luxury<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.050> is<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.230> luxury

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
don't get that luxury and it is a luxury

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.020 
don't get that luxury and it is a luxury

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
but if you hold back from speaking

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
but if you hold back from speaking
because<00:03:26.540> then<00:03:27.170> it<00:03:27.500> feels<00:03:27.769> ugly<00:03:28.010> or<00:03:28.640> scary<00:03:29.239> to

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050

death in a realistic honest open way

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.390 
death in a realistic honest open way
because<00:04:44.780> I<00:04:44.960> think<00:04:45.050> part<00:04:45.410> of<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.680> reason<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:46.220> is

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
because I think part of the reason it is

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.770 
because I think part of the reason it is
so<00:04:46.780> fearful<00:04:47.780> is<00:04:48.380> because<00:04:49.330> we<00:04:50.330> really<00:04:50.660> don't

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
so fearful is because we really don't

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.350 
so fearful is because we really don't
know<00:04:50.990> very<00:04:51.020> much<00:04:51.440> about<00:04:51.500> it<00:04:52.010> a<00:04:52.130> balloon<00:04:52.460> sort
