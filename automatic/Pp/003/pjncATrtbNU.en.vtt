wide commercials down Carter where you

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.260 
wide commercials down Carter where you
think<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:04.980> action<00:00:05.310> so<00:00:05.460> far<00:00:05.670> today<00:00:05.819> oh<00:00:06.120> I

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
think of the action so far today oh I

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.210 
think of the action so far today oh I
think<00:00:06.420> it's<00:00:06.720> great<00:00:07.049> boy<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.560> really<00:00:07.799> do<00:00:08.069> and

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
think it's great boy I really do and

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.220 
think it's great boy I really do and
particularly<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.849> last<00:00:09.150> match<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:10.080> have

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
particularly this last match you have

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.129 
particularly this last match you have
such<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.530> contrast<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.370> styles<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.840> think

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
such a contrast in styles and I think

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.259 
such a contrast in styles and I think
today<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.130> lanes<00:00:14.340> are<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.580> little<00:00:14.880> bit<00:00:15.030> tighter

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
today the lanes are a little bit tighter

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.570 
today the lanes are a little bit tighter
and<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.599> think<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.960> would<00:00:16.470> favor<00:00:16.740> Walter<00:00:17.340> Ray

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
and I think it would favor Walter Ray

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.250 
and I think it would favor Walter Ray
they've<00:00:17.850> had<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> lot<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.390> swing<00:00:18.600> area<00:00:18.869> all<00:00:18.990> week
