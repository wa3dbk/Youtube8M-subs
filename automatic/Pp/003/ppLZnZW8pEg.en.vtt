00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
oh ho mates I'm gonna do a walk-around

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.299 
oh ho mates I'm gonna do a walk-around
of<00:00:06.089> an<00:00:06.540> e<00:00:06.660> X<00:00:06.870> 1200<00:00:07.799> -<00:00:08.099> six<00:00:08.580> front<00:00:09.240> shovel<00:00:10.309> it's

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
of an e X 1200 - six front shovel it's

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.200 
of an e X 1200 - six front shovel it's
got<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:12.769> 5.6<00:00:13.769> meter<00:00:15.350> bucket<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.500> there<00:00:17.210> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
got a 5.6 meter bucket on there the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.730 
got a 5.6 meter bucket on there the
reason<00:00:18.359> why<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:18.750> running<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.170> smaller<00:00:19.439> bucket

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
reason why it's running a smaller bucket

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.759 
reason why it's running a smaller bucket
is<00:00:20.070> because<00:00:20.660> it's<00:00:21.660> digging<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.230> stuff<00:00:22.529> right

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
is because it's digging this stuff right

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.330 
is because it's digging this stuff right
here<00:00:22.830> all<00:00:23.580> they're<00:00:23.789> doing<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.210> basically

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
here all they're doing is basically

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.310 
here all they're doing is basically
breaking<00:00:26.340> out<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.730> piling<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.570> then<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
breaking out and piling and then the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.990 
breaking out and piling and then the
loaders<00:00:28.650> will<00:00:28.859> tram<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.189> over<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> conveyor

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
loaders will tram it over to a conveyor

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.799 
loaders will tram it over to a conveyor
