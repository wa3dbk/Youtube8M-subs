00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.640
 I am using margarine and are four and 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:11.900
 It was meant to be hard because I was mild to 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.900
 recipe will put the milk 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:46.110

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:54.300
 powder and we'll take it to the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:56.630
 low fire and then it will stir with a spoon 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.630
 of stick 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.440
 there I'll have to be going yet 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:25.750
 put on low heat 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:37.320
 There are people who do not even have a mother. 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:49.080
 Shut the fuck up, but the botafogo was missing. 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:49.080
 get out will touch will still move 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.980
 we look almost good 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.920
 it's almost not good 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.810
 Look, he's going to stay like this and if you guys 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.730
 They think like that at first but it will get 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.019
 it will become clearer but then it goes 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.200
 to darken 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:32.569
 so do not put any more chocolate 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:36.599
 I will not get too dark clod field 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:39.870
 then the almost looking bottom is not 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:43.459
 showing up is still good 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.459
 so I do not keep on messing 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:00.569
 it is his choice looks will thicken more 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:06.000
 It will look like a tail or it will 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:09.409
 thickening is thicker and the bubbles 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.409
 very afraid america 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.709
 I'll keep stirring 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:29.370
 Well, we'll see, it's fine, it's fine. 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.479
 bottom of the pan I do not know if you can see if 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.479
 I'm going to turn off the fire. 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.669
 Then I'll get a glass container. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.580
 in the container 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.580
 I'll put it here 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:05:06.599
 Good, then it will be like this 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:14.099

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:16.410

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:20.840

 You liked what you and if you 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.810

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:46.340
