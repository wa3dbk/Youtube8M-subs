music in general you're probably know

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.680 
music in general you're probably know
like<00:00:18.680> this<00:00:18.830> this<00:00:19.490> application<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:20.570> it's

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
like this this application so it's

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.120 
like this this application so it's
called<00:00:20.840> more<00:00:21.080> foods<00:00:21.320> plates<00:00:21.590> right<00:00:21.859> there

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
called more foods plates right there

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.900 
called more foods plates right there
it's<00:00:23.119> available<00:00:23.539> on<00:00:23.990> iOS<00:00:24.349> I<00:00:24.920> believe<00:00:25.490> in<00:00:25.640> I'm

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
it's available on iOS I believe in I'm

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.640 
it's available on iOS I believe in I'm
not<00:00:26.089> sure<00:00:26.210> about<00:00:26.240> Android<00:00:26.720> but<00:00:27.470> it<00:00:27.589> is

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
not sure about Android but it is

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.130 
not sure about Android but it is
cross-platform<00:00:28.189> and<00:00:28.699> it's<00:00:29.330> actually<00:00:29.449> used<00:00:29.869> in

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
cross-platform and it's actually used in

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.310 
cross-platform and it's actually used in
the<00:00:30.259> real<00:00:30.470> world<00:00:30.740> for<00:00:31.630> music<00:00:32.630> and<00:00:32.750> theater<00:00:33.080> and

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
the real world for music and theater and

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.790 
the real world for music and theater and
DJing<00:00:33.740> so<00:00:34.450> essentially<00:00:35.450> what<00:00:35.630> is<00:00:35.780> in<00:00:36.410> a<00:00:36.560> way<00:00:36.680> of

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
DJing so essentially what is in a way of

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.740 
DJing so essentially what is in a way of
virtual<00:00:37.160> keyboard<00:00:37.610> but<00:00:38.060> that's<00:00:38.420> kind<00:00:38.720> of

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
virtual keyboard but that's kind of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.150 
virtual keyboard but that's kind of
where<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.050> similarities<00:00:39.650> end<00:00:39.650> from<00:00:40.040> a

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
where the similarities end from a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.180 
where the similarities end from a
keyboard<00:00:40.550> into<00:00:40.790> this<00:00:40.910> app<00:00:41.120> so<00:00:41.900> like<00:00:42.200> the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
keyboard into this app so like the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.100 
keyboard into this app so like the
keyboard<00:00:43.430> you<00:00:43.700> know<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:43.790> said<00:00:44.060> the<00:00:44.750> virtual

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
keyboard you know I said the virtual

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.960 
keyboard you know I said the virtual
illness<00:00:45.290> is<00:00:45.440> there<00:00:45.650> you've<00:00:46.100> got<00:00:46.310> your<00:00:46.460> notes

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
illness is there you've got your notes

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.030 
illness is there you've got your notes
on<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:47.300> top<00:00:47.510> you<00:00:48.080> can<00:00:48.290> change<00:00:48.440> your<00:00:48.620> octaves

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
on the top you can change your octaves

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.270 
on the top you can change your octaves
and<00:00:49.130> stuff<00:00:49.340> like<00:00:49.430> that<00:00:49.490> but<00:00:50.650> where<00:00:51.650> it<00:00:51.770> changes

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
and stuff like that but where it changes

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.460 
and stuff like that but where it changes
is<00:00:52.430> that<00:00:52.460> you<00:00:52.880> have<00:00:53.060> all<00:00:53.210> these<00:00:53.330> presets<00:00:53.960> okay

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
is that you have all these presets okay

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.760 
is that you have all these presets okay
so<00:00:54.530> we're<00:00:54.770> going<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:54.950> go<00:00:55.040> into<00:00:56.440> dream<00:00:57.440> machine

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
so we're going to go into dream machine

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.430 
so we're going to go into dream machine
so<00:00:57.980> this<00:00:58.100> is<00:00:58.250> pre-done<00:00:59.440> different

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
so this is pre-done different

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.920 
so this is pre-done different
synthesizer<00:01:00.890> settings<00:01:01.400> for<00:01:01.760> this<00:01:01.850> app<00:01:02.060> and<00:01:02.330> it

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
synthesizer settings for this app and it

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.600 
synthesizer settings for this app and it
can<00:01:03.080> let<00:01:03.200> you<00:01:03.410> go<00:01:03.890> through<00:01:04.189> and<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:04.430> can

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
can let you go through and you can

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.330 
can let you go through and you can
create<00:01:04.759> your<00:01:04.850> own<00:01:04.970> music

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.669 

and<00:01:12.340> then<00:01:12.880> we<00:01:12.969> can<00:01:13.149> go<00:01:13.270> through<00:01:13.299> and<00:01:13.810> if<00:01:14.590> we

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
and then we can go through and if we

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.370 
and then we can go through and if we
want<00:01:14.920> to<00:01:15.329> change<00:01:16.329> our<00:01:16.539> settings<00:01:16.869> ourselves

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
want to change our settings ourselves

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.630 
want to change our settings ourselves
and<00:01:17.499> we<00:01:17.560> don't<00:01:17.649> want<00:01:17.770> to<00:01:17.979> use<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.249> pre<00:01:18.460> done

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
and we don't want to use the pre done

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.029 
and we don't want to use the pre done
one's<00:01:18.909> definitely<00:01:19.899> can<00:01:20.200> so<00:01:20.469> you<00:01:20.530> can<00:01:20.710> go<00:01:20.829> in<00:01:20.950> to

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
one's definitely can so you can go in to

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.870 
one's definitely can so you can go in to
change<00:01:21.189> your<00:01:21.310> octave<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:24.280> real<00:01:24.459> time<00:01:24.700> you

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
change your octave and in real time you

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.730 
change your octave and in real time you
can<00:01:25.060> see<00:01:25.299> how<00:01:25.539> it's<00:01:25.780> how<00:01:26.079> it's<00:01:26.229> being<00:01:26.319> affected

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
can see how it's how it's being affected

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.749 
can see how it's how it's being affected
so<00:01:26.829> it's<00:01:26.950> go<00:01:27.069> all<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.250> way<00:01:27.280> up<00:01:27.399> to<00:01:27.429> after<00:01:27.759> six

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
so it's go all the way up to after six

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.760 
so it's go all the way up to after six
and<00:01:30.759> then<00:01:30.909> we<00:01:31.659> can<00:01:31.810> go<00:01:31.899> and<00:01:32.049> add<00:01:32.200> in<00:01:32.439> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
and then we can go and add in the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.740 
and then we can go and add in the
various<00:01:33.130> tones<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:33.670> colors<00:01:33.819> so<00:01:34.240> if<00:01:34.359> we<00:01:34.479> go<00:01:34.599> in

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
various tones and colors so if we go in

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.940 
various tones and colors so if we go in
here<00:01:35.049> we<00:01:35.349> can<00:01:35.439> add<00:01:35.500> them<00:01:35.829> all<00:01:35.979> in<00:01:37.049> or<00:01:38.049> if<00:01:38.859> you

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
here we can add them all in or if you

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.289 
here we can add them all in or if you
want<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.250> little<00:01:39.399> bit<00:01:39.520> more<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.849> rough<00:01:40.030> sound

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
want a little bit more of a rough sound

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.429 
want a little bit more of a rough sound
you<00:01:40.479> can<00:01:40.659> take<00:01:40.869> some<00:01:41.049> away<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:44.110> you<00:01:44.200> can<00:01:44.319> see

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
you can take some away and you can see

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.440 
you can take some away and you can see
it<00:01:44.560> just<00:01:44.590> is<00:01:45.009> more<00:01:45.219> spacing<00:01:45.759> between<00:01:45.909> each

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
it just is more spacing between each

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.020 
it just is more spacing between each
each<00:01:46.780> stone<00:01:47.259> we<00:01:48.039> can<00:01:48.189> definitely<00:01:48.310> change<00:01:48.640> and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
each stone we can definitely change and

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.389 
each stone we can definitely change and
go<00:01:49.899> up<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.200> scale<00:01:51.899> or<00:01:52.899> down<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.739> scale<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.280> get

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
go up the scale or down the scale to get

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.969 
go up the scale or down the scale to get
a<00:01:54.429> different<00:01:54.610> sound<00:01:55.469> so<00:01:56.469> let's<00:01:56.649> close<00:01:56.950> that

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
a different sound so let's close that

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.580 
a different sound so let's close that
let's<00:01:57.640> go<00:01:57.759> into<00:01:58.030> just<00:01:58.719> take<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:58.899> look<00:01:59.020> at<00:01:59.170> few

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
let's go into just take a look at few

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.010 
let's go into just take a look at few
other<00:01:59.739> ones<00:01:59.829> is<00:02:00.129> go<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.369> X<00:02:00.549> Factor<00:02:01.119> tilt<00:02:01.450> load

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
other ones is go to X Factor tilt load

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.869 
other ones is go to X Factor tilt load
that<00:02:02.229> up<00:02:02.259> I<00:02:02.590> said<00:02:03.429> it<00:02:03.489> just<00:02:03.609> gives<00:02:03.819> you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:03.879 
that up I said it just gives you
