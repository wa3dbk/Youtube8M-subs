00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
that these games have a very bad

that these games have a very bad
reputation<00:00:46.230> because<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> sort<00:00:47.789> of

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
and that sort of thing but I actually

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.820 
and that sort of thing but I actually
think<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.600> if<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:07.110> look<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.439> these<00:01:07.560> is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
think that I if you look at these is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.500 
think that I if you look at these is
sort<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.100> interactive<00:01:08.700> movies<00:01:09.210> actually

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
sort of interactive movies actually

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
sort of interactive movies actually
think<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.869> these<00:01:10.020> would<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.260> some<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
think that these would be some of the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.880 
think that these would be some of the
best<00:01:10.619> war<00:01:11.100> movies<00:01:11.460> I've<00:01:11.640> ever<00:01:11.729> seen<00:01:12.890> not

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
best war movies I've ever seen not

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.499 
best war movies I've ever seen not
necessarily<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:16.850> some<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.180> chaotic

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
necessarily the some of it is chaotic

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.050 
necessarily the some of it is chaotic
because<00:01:18.840> you're<00:01:19.080> playing<00:01:19.460> you're<00:01:20.460> playing<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
because you're playing you're playing a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.050 
because you're playing you're playing a
game<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> same<00:01:22.259> time<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.670> terms<00:01:23.880> of

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
game at the same time but in terms of

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
game at the same time but in terms of
the<00:01:24.150> overall<00:01:24.180> story<00:01:24.960> especially<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the overall story especially in the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.520 
the overall story especially in the
modern<00:01:25.920> warfare<00:01:26.100> series<00:01:26.570> I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
modern warfare series I think that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.960 
modern warfare series I think that
they're<00:01:28.710> they're<00:01:28.979> excellent<00:01:29.369> some<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
they're they're excellent some of it I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.550 
they're they're excellent some of it I
can<00:01:30.150> see<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.600> make<00:01:30.930> comparisons<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> other

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
can see I can make comparisons to other

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.770 
can see I can make comparisons to other
movies<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.280> black<00:01:32.549> hawk<00:01:32.759> down<00:01:32.790> Red<00:01:33.450> Dawn

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
movies like black hawk down Red Dawn

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.289 
movies like black hawk down Red Dawn
things<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
things like that and I can see with the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.499 
things like that and I can see with the
driving<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.049> from<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.820> doesn't<00:01:39.240> detract

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
driving it from but it doesn't detract

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.950 
driving it from but it doesn't detract
from<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> almost<00:01:40.350> makes<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.770> sort<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.960> more

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
from it it almost makes it sort of more

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.929 
from it it almost makes it sort of more
interesting<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.590> they<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.860> flesh<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
interesting that they can flesh out and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.030 
interesting that they can flesh out and
make<00:01:45.119> interactive<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:46.649> would<00:01:46.829> otherwise

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
make interactive what would otherwise

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.899 
make interactive what would otherwise
only<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.180> sort<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.439> know<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:50.100> movie

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
only be this sort of you know a movie

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.569 
only be this sort of you know a movie
that<00:01:51.180> you're<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.810> passively<00:01:52.590> watching<00:01:53.100> and

that you're just passively watching and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.179 
that you're just passively watching and
a<00:01:54.329> lot<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.840> people<00:01:55.200> seem<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.409> peg<00:01:55.710> these<00:01:55.920> things

a lot of people seem to peg these things

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.030 
a lot of people seem to peg these things
is<00:01:56.369> sort<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.869> propaganda<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.500> there's<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.860> lot

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
is sort of propaganda but there's a lot

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.429

subversive<00:02:02.040> aspects<00:02:02.490> these<00:02:02.729> games<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.270> think

subversive aspects these games I think

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.319 
subversive aspects these games I think

things that you'd see in a lot of war
movies<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.500> famous<00:02:32.769> no<00:02:33.220> Russian

2 I think I'll have to play through
modern<00:02:39.040> warfare<00:02:39.250> free<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:40.510> see<00:02:40.720> what<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:40.959> really

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
modern warfare free to see what I really

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.080 
modern warfare free to see what I really
think<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.769> this<00:02:41.889> story<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.519> second<00:02:42.879> time

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
think of this story the second time

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.649 
think of this story the second time
around<00:02:43.769> but<00:02:44.769> I<00:02:44.799> loved<00:02:45.670> that<00:02:45.819> in<00:02:46.060> black<00:02:46.420> ops

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
around but I loved that in black ops

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.069 
around but I loved that in black ops
they<00:02:47.079> brought<00:02:47.379> back<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.700> guy<00:02:49.090> from<00:02:49.450> world<00:02:49.900> at

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
they brought back the guy from world at

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.020 
they brought back the guy from world at
war<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.560> thought<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.799> was<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.069> nice<00:02:51.340> touch<00:02:51.639> and

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
war I thought that was a nice touch and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.990 
war I thought that was a nice touch and
I<00:02:52.450> loved<00:02:52.930> black<00:02:53.200> ops<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.859> story<00:02:54.370> line<00:02:54.519> mode<00:02:54.760> to

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
I loved black ops the story line mode to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.640 
I loved black ops the story line mode to
especially<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.510> way<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.109> moved<00:02:56.409> you

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
especially the way that it moved you

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.099 
especially the way that it moved you
around<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.909> Cold<00:02:58.180> War<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.689> so<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:58.930> almost

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
around the Cold War and so it almost

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.020 
around the Cold War and so it almost
gives<00:02:59.349> you<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.799> history<00:03:00.280> lesson<00:03:00.549> for<00:03:00.879> some

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
gives you like a history lesson for some

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.740 
gives you like a history lesson for some
people<00:03:01.329> I<00:03:01.569> mean<00:03:02.530> how<00:03:02.650> many<00:03:02.709> people<00:03:03.750> learned

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
people I mean how many people learned

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.649 
people I mean how many people learned
about<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.200> siege<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.650> Saigon<00:03:06.159> through<00:03:06.879> call

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
about the siege of Saigon through call

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.360 
about the siege of Saigon through call
of<00:03:07.810> duty<00:03:08.079> black<00:03:08.109> ops<00:03:08.349> or<00:03:08.919> something<00:03:09.189> like<00:03:09.310> that

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
of duty black ops or something like that

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.610 
of duty black ops or something like that
I<00:03:10.090> mean<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.689> that's<00:03:10.840> kind<00:03:11.139> of<00:03:11.230> that<00:03:11.439> it's

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
I mean that that's kind of that it's

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.159 
I mean that that's kind of that it's
probably<00:03:12.370> sad<00:03:12.970> for<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.419> state<00:03:13.689> of<00:03:13.720> our

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:14.169 
probably sad for the state of our

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:19.710 
probably sad for the state of our
history<00:03:14.769> classes<00:03:15.400> but<00:03:16.389> it's<00:03:16.959> also<00:03:18.329> fun<00:03:19.329> and

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
history classes but it's also fun and

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.930 
history classes but it's also fun and
interesting<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.470> almost<00:03:20.739> sort<00:03:21.069> of<00:03:21.190> has<00:03:21.909> a

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
interesting and almost sort of has a

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.420 
interesting and almost sort of has a
tinge<00:03:22.389> of<00:03:22.569> history<00:03:23.199> or<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.530> tinge<00:03:23.799> of<00:03:23.949> what<00:03:24.220> if

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
tinge of history or a tinge of what if

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.629 
tinge of history or a tinge of what if
and<00:03:24.729> there<00:03:24.879> I<00:03:25.090> don't<00:03:25.780> black<00:03:26.260> ops<00:03:26.530> 2<00:03:26.889> which<00:03:27.430> is

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
and there I don't black ops 2 which is

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.020 
and there I don't black ops 2 which is
set<00:03:27.909> in<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.150> near<00:03:28.180> future<00:03:28.449> and<00:03:29.190> I'm<00:03:30.190> looking

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
set in the near future and I'm looking

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.030 
set in the near future and I'm looking
forward<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.569> that<00:03:31.599> as<00:03:31.989> well<00:03:32.019> but<00:03:32.470> now<00:03:32.709> I'm<00:03:32.889> not

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
forward to that as well but now I'm not

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.270 
forward to that as well but now I'm not
going<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.430> play<00:03:33.579> online<00:03:34.199> but<00:03:35.199> the<00:03:35.650> video<00:03:35.949> game

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
going to play online but the video game

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.899 
going to play online but the video game
like<00:03:37.379> stories<00:03:38.379> in<00:03:38.769> video<00:03:39.040> games<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.579> think<00:03:39.790> that

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
like stories in video games I think that

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.099 
like stories in video games I think that
they<00:03:40.030> can<00:03:40.109> absolutely<00:03:41.109> be<00:03:41.590> art<00:03:41.919> because<00:03:42.900> if<00:03:43.900> we

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
they can absolutely be art because if we

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.349 
they can absolutely be art because if we
consider<00:03:44.379> movies<00:03:44.889> art<00:03:45.190> it's<00:03:45.579> almost<00:03:46.060> an

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
consider movies art it's almost an

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.050 
consider movies art it's almost an
extension<00:03:47.109> of<00:03:47.229> that<00:03:47.290> with<00:03:47.889> more<00:03:48.220> interaction

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
extension of that with more interaction

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.640 
extension of that with more interaction
and<00:03:49.299> at<00:03:50.199> the<00:03:50.319> same<00:03:50.500> time<00:03:52.229> they're<00:03:53.229> actually

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
and at the same time they're actually

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.679
