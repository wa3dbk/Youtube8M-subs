00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.259
 or the grandstand greets you dukes up and 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.570
 this time we are going to talk about what would be 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.250
 a future war of consoles Now 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.070
 we all know what happened with 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.260
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 true with the 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.080
 exclusive and others and there and good 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.449
 thus was born the word of fan boy you 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.210
 enjoyed the other console saying 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.480
 that his was better and handy and everyone 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.029
 We were hoping that in this next 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.819
 generation of consoles does not happen the same 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.129
 that is nothing exclusive that the other 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:36.890
 but it looks like the war of 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.410
 consoles comes yes or yes and you will say 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.859
 Well, I already knew that this was coming 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.019
 you'll say yes always sony and microsoft it 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.300
 they have worn very well very well 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.710
 perfect but because I say that it 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.769
 comes a console war more than 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.109
 nothing because it seems if it seems according to a 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.780
 report and it seems that people here 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:00.000
 from microsoft has claimed 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.620
 If you look at this, it's not a sure thing, it 's a 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.629
 very interesting report it seems that the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.740
 people have signed a contract 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.180
 exclusivity with respawn entertainment and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.070
 you had who are that for the people 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.590
 who already knows what is not responding 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.920
 entertainment are the former infinity ward 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.759
 those who created the video game with what 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.170
 the 4 not the multiplayer more than anything 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.259
 all very well it seems that they have signed 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.240
 as an exclusivity contract 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.899
 exclusive 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.320
 it would be something like that for something like a 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:36.229
 halo imagine an uncharted lewis box 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.330
 playstation 3 already answer answer 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.189
 timing will be exclusive to microsoft 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.830
 we all know that the people of respawn 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.080
 entertainment is creating a video game 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.549
 futuristic not a shooter in the first 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.369
 person or shooting and good too 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.549
 it seems that this report states that 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.370
 they answer is making several games 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.260
 sao sagas 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.090
 exclusive for the people of microsoft 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.700
 you can do all maybe two or three 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.660
 at the most but they will be exclusive 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.080
 for the new xbox 720 but the funny thing and 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.740
 the annoying thing is that it is also said that 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.020
 the respawn entertainment games 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.370
 first futurists so percent and 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.580
 It was mostly designed to 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.180
 multiplayer but the truth and what 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.550
 important is that apart from it being 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.520
 multiplayer will have to always use 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.140
 the game is online then of course for that 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.140
 Obviously multiplayer will be dedicated 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.180
 to the multiplayer but if out there people 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.000
 of respawn entertainment pulled out game like 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.460
 campaign or whatever on their part 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.730
 goes to your xbox you're going to have to be 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.470
 always connected to the internet if it is not 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.180
 connected to the internet does not play new 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.130
 campaign and obviously you do not play mode 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.810
 multiplayer this was the funny thing that I 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.670
 do not forget that part I said good 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.080
 obviously it 's new multiplayer 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.510
 it has to be with the internet but 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.150
 same if there is campaign mode or you do not have to 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.710
 be connected to the internet which will 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.990
 it seems like a tremendous shit 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.300
 but also this 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.320
 there was comparing some things 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.030
 between hardware and software there is a 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.190
 which is very true and I do not want to be 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.410
 super fanboy or anything or anything 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.540
 but you have to be realistic including 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.430
 several people who know consoles already 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.650
 have seen the actual specifications of 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.200
 the new xbox and they have said the following 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.150
 which are and is in a better state in 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.930
 software and hardware that the next 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.930
 xbox 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.129
 has already fallen I know that a lot of people are going to 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:37.499
 bother but this is saying what 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.939
 is saying people who have seen the 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:41.760
 critic durango who have seen the 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:44.459
 real specifications and claim that the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.880
 PlayStation 4 is going to be much better than 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.830
 the xbox 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.410
 will have to wait yet I'm not 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.440
 saying that it is not true but if 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.750
 say people who have seen the new 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.090
 xbox must be taken into account not 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.630
 painfully this of the exclusivities 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.690
 it's a total crap we all want 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.970
 have fun but always goes missing is 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.550
 that the gamer community is not offended 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.810
 from now they are being very very little 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.660
 true 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.000
 and this is not because the young people of now 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.940
 but so are businesses we 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.190
 they come back like that yes sir cat with these the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.870
 exclusivities with that my console 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.790
 is better or pulling when sending to another 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.730
 console and others is not that we 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.470
 we are being like that but the companies 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.200
 they make us in that you understand me 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.390
 but well those are some things 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.040
 this possible console war not you 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.560
 what do you think about this you think that 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.090
 exclusivities 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.280
 street of these consoles 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.600
 or you think it's okay or good 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.800
 company here says it's okay 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.259
 whatever 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.419
 but depriving a person of playing this 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.510
 if you do not have such a console or it seems to me 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.180
 silly not good 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.950
 I would say good suddenly put tlc is 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.680
 that is not exclusive but a game and 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.240
 unique not because I'm not sure 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.580
 that many xbox people would like to play 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.890
 I do not know a wide art 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.600
 or suddenly this 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.350
 I do not remember the playstation or being a 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.630
 chorus war 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.970
 an equal crash not the people of place him 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.190
 like to play a gel or software not 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.960
 but that are the days and exclusive I 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.370
 I agree ok if they are going to be 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.630
 to be the exclusive exercise the 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.250
 nice, there's going to be a little fanboy 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.050
 will have but with you have exclusive 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.480
 is perfect for the game, no, no, 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.100
 so I said goodbye I went dukes to the 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.780
 favorites 90 and obviously we'll see each other 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.010
 until the next step more in this way 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.010
 opinion on the war of consoles 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.800
 this happens more than anything for people 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.750
 of xbox exclusivity 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.160
 that will be the point a version that 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.160
 we have cat danced
