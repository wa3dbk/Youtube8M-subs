00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
from the guys over at XDA so it's

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.180 
from the guys over at XDA so it's
actually<00:00:59.460> build<00:00:59.789> three<00:01:00.230> version<00:01:01.230> 6<00:01:01.530> so

throwing<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> also<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> latest<00:01:03.390> kernel

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
throwing the also the latest kernel

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
throwing the also the latest kernel
which<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.049> two<00:01:04.170> point<00:01:04.379> six<00:01:04.619> point<00:01:04.949> three<00:01:05.010> five

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
which is two point six point three five

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.260 
which is two point six point three five
but<00:01:07.680> that's<00:01:07.890> that's<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.460> about<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> phone<00:01:09.000> so

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
but that's that's the about the phone so

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.880 
but that's that's the about the phone so
so<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.869> know<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.350> scanner<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
so you know it's not like a scanner and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
so you know it's not like a scanner and
overlay<00:01:11.869> I<00:01:13.340> wanted<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> mention<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.110> Android

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
overlay I wanted to mention that Android

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.980 
overlay I wanted to mention that Android
has<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> series<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.860> new<00:01:17.100> applications<00:01:17.990> they've

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
has a series of new applications they've

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.690 
has a series of new applications they've
redone<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> lot<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.740> their<00:01:19.830> applications<00:01:20.490> such

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
redone a lot of their applications such

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.490 
redone a lot of their applications such
as<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.909> browser<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.420> calculator<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> camera

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
as the browser the calculator the camera

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.580 
as the browser the calculator the camera
the<00:01:23.490> phone<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.600> camera<00:01:24.930> hasn't<00:01:25.110> yet<00:01:25.439> been

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the phone the camera hasn't yet been

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.469 
the phone the camera hasn't yet been
cracked<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:26.909> experience<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
cracked for this so it will experience a

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.420 
cracked for this so it will experience a
force<00:01:27.509> close<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.200> try<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> go<00:01:28.560> into<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
force close if we try to go into it the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.700 
force close if we try to go into it the
things<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> calculator<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
things like the calculator are up and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.090 
things like the calculator are up and
working<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:33.750> actually<00:01:34.170> has<00:01:34.619> allowed<00:01:34.829> me<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
working this actually has allowed me to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.280 
working this actually has allowed me to
make<00:01:35.250> phone<00:01:35.490> calls<00:01:35.759> when<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.780> get<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
make phone calls when I can get on the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.910 
make phone calls when I can get on the
network<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.610> has<00:01:38.790> allowed<00:01:39.060> me<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.540> that

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
network so it has allowed me to do that

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.380 
network so it has allowed me to do that
it's<00:01:40.920> by<00:01:41.130> no<00:01:41.159> means<00:01:41.340> stable<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.060> don't

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it's by no means stable I don't

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.639 
it's by no means stable I don't
recommend<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.840> flash<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.530> day-to-day

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
recommend you flash this for day-to-day

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.710 
recommend you flash this for day-to-day
use<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.549> won't<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:44.850> much<00:01:45.030> actual

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
use you won't get much actual

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.590 
use you won't get much actual
functionality<00:01:46.649> out<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.130> yeah<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.329> for

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
functionality out of it yeah it is for

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.940 
functionality out of it yeah it is for
developmental<00:01:49.290> purposes<00:01:50.159> right<00:01:50.280> now<00:01:51.950> but

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
developmental purposes right now but

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.219 
developmental purposes right now but
they've<00:01:53.159> also<00:01:53.369> ripped<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.020> background<00:01:55.020> which

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
they've also ripped the background which

they've also ripped the background which
is<00:01:55.259> really<00:01:55.500> cool<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.979> notice<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.790> heat

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
is really cool you notice the heat

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.289 
is really cool you notice the heat
sensitivity<00:01:57.450> when<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.780> tap<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:59.149> similar<00:02:00.149> one

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
sensitivity when you tap a similar one

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.830 
sensitivity when you tap a similar one
