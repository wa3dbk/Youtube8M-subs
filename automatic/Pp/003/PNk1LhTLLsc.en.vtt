about<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.900> might<00:01:10.049> end<00:01:10.200> up<00:01:10.290> getting

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
about it you might end up getting

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.859 
about it you might end up getting
injured<00:01:10.880> all<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> structures<00:01:12.299> your<00:01:12.659> body

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
injured all of the structures your body

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.230 
injured all of the structures your body
muscles<00:01:13.470> tendons<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.130> heart<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.400> lungs<00:01:14.640> all

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
muscles tendons your heart and lungs all

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.410 
muscles tendons your heart and lungs all
these<00:01:15.570> things<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.229> develop<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.909> terms<00:01:18.210> of

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
these things you develop in terms of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.140 
these things you develop in terms of
your<00:01:18.659> ability<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.110> exercise<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> idea<00:01:20.909> is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
your ability to exercise so the idea is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.870 
your ability to exercise so the idea is
to<00:01:21.270> start<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:21.720> slow<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.340> slowly<00:01:23.580> build

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
to start out slow and then slowly build

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.550 
to start out slow and then slowly build
yourself<00:01:24.270> now<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.020> could<00:01:25.170> mean<00:01:25.350> nothing

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
yourself now that could mean nothing

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.410 
yourself now that could mean nothing
more<00:01:26.490> than<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:26.729> out<00:01:26.880> running<00:01:27.150> around<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
more than going out running around the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.080 
more than going out running around the
block<00:01:27.829> may<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:28.950> right<00:01:29.400> around<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> block<00:01:29.880> once

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
block may be right around the block once

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.880 
block may be right around the block once
and<00:01:30.360> walk<00:01:30.479> around<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.810> block<00:01:30.900> once<00:01:31.140> maybe

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
and walk around the block once maybe

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.920 
and walk around the block once maybe
next<00:01:32.159> week<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.790> again<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.540> maybe<00:01:33.750> for

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
next week can do it again but maybe for

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.870 
next week can do it again but maybe for
a<00:01:33.960> little<00:01:33.990> bit<00:01:34.229> longer<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:35.369> idea<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
a little bit longer the idea is that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.700 
a little bit longer the idea is that
from<00:01:36.210> week<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.600> week<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.200> never<00:01:37.380> want<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
from week to week you never want to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.950 
from week to week you never want to
increase<00:01:38.009> more<00:01:38.280> than<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> couple<00:01:38.610> percent<00:01:39.150> so

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
increase more than a couple percent so

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.210 
increase more than a couple percent so
if<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.229> think<00:01:40.409> about<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.860> way<00:01:40.920> maybe

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
if you think about it this way maybe

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.800 
if you think about it this way maybe
this<00:01:41.430> week<00:01:41.670> you'll<00:01:41.850> go<00:01:42.000> out<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.299> try<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.659> run

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
this week you'll go out and try and run

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.569 
this week you'll go out and try and run
