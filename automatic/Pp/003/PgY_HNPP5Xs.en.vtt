00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.859
 what if they were not denied 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.279
 what if the hundred of thousands of people claim and 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.320
 In fact, having identifiable flying objects has consequences for 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.429
 resist the existence of extraterrestrial spacecraft 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.270
 what if the thousands of people around the world were the ones from 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.150
 their encounters with alien beings that means by friendly contact 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.199
 or even kidnapping in reality telling the truth 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.030
 What if our governments have long been aware of It's presence? 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.520
 Know and this has been for more than half a century 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.660
 Those in possession of extra-tip astra-chef technologies fight back the potential 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.240
 a change within which our planet is led will trigger 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.920
 could make the choice 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.650
 to the public in the dark 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.430
 with the help of a secret Campanet six information cover-up 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.320
 With this campaign something like penny chain around the shackles of humanity 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.450
 so it may discourage us from going to a completely new level 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.760
 to ascend consciousness to a new understanding of ourselves 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.460
 our planet is and the universe around us what if this 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.460
 Campaign tomorrow would find its end 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.150
 while it is 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.640
 it is one of those historical currents which is not denied 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.380
 become 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.789
 the truth will come out and if this happens important explosive 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.400
 once the house is over we will go and complete the twentieth century 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.040
 reassemble new ones somehow even new ones may be writing 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.250
 we also have to go there 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.640
 Keeps the criticism of the time span of the last 2000 years new writing 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.370
 this is stupid 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.049
 this is the biggest story in human history 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.819
 The reason is that this is the greatest history of humanity 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.849
 When 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:06.349
 There is nothing new about it that will occur in the field of physics 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.449
 the only thing left to do is to resign from Munich 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.859
 the world view which is portrayed in this statement emerged 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.410
 renowned scientists 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.579
 says Clausen in 1900 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.569
 where, however, only five years later it shatters than Albert Einstein Sempach 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.819
 breaking of the sheet issued on the subject of special 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.319
 theory of relativity 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.680
 new theories in it 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.670
 henceforth this is currently still out of understanding and thus forced the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.750
 scientific community Tat is looking for a wider perspective 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.469
 related to nature 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.669
 from BA does not keep open this event of the fundamentalist 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.189
 Change of paradigm shift 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:50.239
 Surprised the scholars of that time immensely, but we stop 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.510
 no difficulties the series of breakthroughs in science 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.570
 with the emergence of Einstein remains up to the gate of nuclear school time 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.329
 Althaus to follow 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.109
 we knew that the earth is a disk we knew that we were the center of the 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.759
 Be universe and we knew 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:10.529
 a man-made machine heavier than air itself impossible 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:11.839
 can fly 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.719
 through all stages of human history 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.829
 intellectual instances show things that are not in the context of 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.640
 accepted knowledge 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.460
 to suppress or ridicule 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.580
 the so-called father of modern science the Italian astronomer 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.990
 Galileo was even sentenced by the Catholic Church for life 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.020
 Under house arrest for putting out a book 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.090
 it is the idea that the earth was not the center of the universe 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.680
 supported 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.379
 his work was subsequently banned for more than 200 years 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:49.029
 are they really so different today that's our acceptance in terms of 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:52.069
 really changed what fits into these frames 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.180
 maybe there are still concerts within our reality 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.849
 the Viennese have to understand 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.430
 if we open our eyes we may recognize 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.430
 that they overlooked something 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.909
 one 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.689
 Dr 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.869
 my name is bought 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:00.080
 I worked for the Ministry of Defense within the 

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:04.039
 British government for the period of 20 years most of the time 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.429
 I was in the early nineties for the management of her visit to the USA and now 

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:10.849
 responsible the British Ministry of Defense has since the 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:15.399
 1950s research on Rousseau's sightings operated the number of 

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:19.399
 Reports amounts to about 12 thousand of the ORF all currently 1 

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:23.379
 from October 9 to 10 when I was employed there in the nineties 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:26.539
 He reported that he was about 200 to 300 years old 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:33.289
 In May 2008, the British government opened its first office AWO reports 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:35.040
 six acts not insight 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.700
 for the masses as the Internet this drew an immense public 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.690
 Interest and the media supervision there were over 20 000 downloads within 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.650
 the first weeks 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.770
 after clearance followed by many others 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:53.460
 France Beijing their request Denmark Turkey and Brazil Argentina 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.080
 Mexico 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.879
 despite stock law the most amazing stories came to light 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:00.530
 ship 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.530
 Mischief brisk landings and extraterrestrial Inti titles which 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.440
 were seen
