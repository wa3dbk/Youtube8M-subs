00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
to do a base drop for all you people who

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:08.560 
to do a base drop for all you people who
are<00:00:06.859> wondering<00:00:07.129> what<00:00:07.460> exactly<00:00:07.970> how<00:00:08.240> did<00:00:08.299> how

okay so I'll show you how I got this I
was<00:00:26.750> basically<00:00:26.900> fiddling<00:00:27.349> around<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:27.859> I<00:00:27.890> look

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
was basically fiddling around and I look

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.439 
was basically fiddling around and I look
for<00:00:28.220> something<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:28.580> went<00:00:28.760> to<00:00:28.820> analogue<00:00:29.150> mono

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
for something I went to analogue mono

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.080 
for something I went to analogue mono
check<00:00:29.810> this<00:00:29.929> out<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:31.010> you<00:00:31.070> go<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:31.279> analog<00:00:31.880> mono

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
check this out so you go to analog mono

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.850 
check this out so you go to analog mono
doesn't<00:00:32.840> matter<00:00:32.960> what<00:00:33.110> volume<00:00:33.290> you<00:00:33.470> set<00:00:33.650> it<00:00:33.739> to

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
I have a glide away up to the maximum

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.439 
I have a glide away up to the maximum
all<00:00:36.830> the<00:00:37.159> way<00:00:37.220> bright<00:00:37.580> and<00:00:37.820> brightness<00:00:38.180> is<00:00:38.299> all

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
all the way bright and brightness is all

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.180 
all the way bright and brightness is all
the<00:00:38.510> way<00:00:38.629> up<00:00:38.659> up<00:00:39.170> all<00:00:39.379> the<00:00:39.470> way<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:39.739> that's<00:00:40.010> for

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
the way up up all the way and that's for

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.619 
the way up up all the way and that's for
a<00:00:40.220> specific<00:00:40.430> reason<00:00:40.790> you'll<00:00:41.120> see<00:00:41.299> why<00:00:41.449> in<00:00:41.540> a

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
a specific reason you'll see why in a

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.490 
a specific reason you'll see why in a
second<00:00:41.960> cut<00:00:42.739> off<00:00:42.890> is<00:00:43.100> at<00:00:43.370> 30<00:00:44.080> residents<00:00:45.080> is<00:00:45.320> at

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
second cut off is at 30 residents is at

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.009 
second cut off is at 30 residents is at
10<00:00:45.860> it<00:00:46.370> didn't<00:00:46.729> you're<00:00:47.210> cut<00:00:47.449> off<00:00:47.479> really

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
10 it didn't you're cut off really

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.270 
10 it didn't you're cut off really
doesn't<00:00:48.260> matter<00:00:48.379> I<00:00:48.440> mean<00:00:48.589> like<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.890> further

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
doesn't matter I mean like the further

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.850 
doesn't matter I mean like the further
down<00:00:49.460> it<00:00:49.670> is<00:00:49.820> it<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.690> less<00:00:51.019> it's<00:00:51.260> gonna<00:00:51.379> really

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
down it is it the less it's gonna really

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.590 
down it is it the less it's gonna really
resonate<00:00:52.400> I<00:00:52.430> guess<00:00:52.640> it's<00:00:53.299> just<00:00:53.420> kind<00:00:53.570> of

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
resonate I guess it's just kind of

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.609 
resonate I guess it's just kind of
ironic<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:54.170> that<00:00:54.320> I'm<00:00:54.379> talking<00:00:54.530> about

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:54.619 
ironic is that I'm talking about

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:56.380 
ironic is that I'm talking about
resonates<00:00:55.040> every<00:00:55.519> attack<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:56.089> want<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:56.299> have

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
resonates every attack you want to have

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.520 
resonates every attack you want to have
a<00:00:56.420> little<00:00:56.570> bit<00:00:56.750> less<00:00:56.930> attack<00:00:57.260> because<00:00:57.440> you

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
a little bit less attack because you

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.689 
a little bit less attack because you
don't<00:00:57.650> wanna<00:00:57.769> hear<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:57.979> doom<00:00:58.159> doom<00:00:58.430> doom<00:00:58.460> doom

equalizer set to just basically that I
think<00:01:29.380> it's<00:01:29.470> like<00:01:29.530> for<00:01:29.740> vocals<00:01:30.130> or<00:01:30.280> something

zero so and then the compression I have

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
zero so and then the compression I have
this<00:01:42.310> all<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.490> way<00:01:42.670> down<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.030> bottom

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
this all the way down to the bottom

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.210 
this all the way down to the bottom
doesn't<00:01:43.690> matter<00:01:43.930> about<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.230> attack<00:01:44.500> or<00:01:44.740> ratio

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
doesn't matter about the attack or ratio

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.810 
doesn't matter about the attack or ratio
but<00:01:45.460> just<00:01:45.640> in<00:01:45.700> case<00:01:46.350> ten<00:01:47.580> milliseconds<00:01:48.580> and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
but just in case ten milliseconds and

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.609 
but just in case ten milliseconds and
threshold<00:01:49.240> it<00:01:50.020> doesn't<00:01:50.260> matter<00:01:50.380> about<00:01:50.500> the

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
threshold it doesn't matter about the

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.060 
threshold it doesn't matter about the
threshold<00:01:50.860> so<00:01:52.350> yeah<00:01:53.350> so<00:01:53.680> I'll<00:01:53.830> just<00:01:53.920> give<00:01:54.040> you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
threshold so yeah so I'll just give you

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.050 
threshold so yeah so I'll just give you
an<00:01:54.160> example<00:01:54.400> what<00:01:54.610> happens<00:01:54.850> if<00:01:54.940> you<00:01:55.030> change

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
an example what happens if you change

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.750 
an example what happens if you change
the<00:01:55.360> cutoff<00:01:55.570> it's<00:01:55.990> at<00:01:56.170> thirty<00:01:59.430> higher<00:02:00.430> cutoff

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
the cutoff it's at thirty higher cutoff

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.570 
the cutoff it's at thirty higher cutoff
means<00:02:01.750> that<00:02:01.930> higher<00:02:02.140> meets<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.740> more<00:02:03.010> kind

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
means that higher meets that more kind

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.650 
means that higher meets that more kind
of<00:02:03.610> gritty<00:02:03.910> sound<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.450> know<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:10.479> pretty

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
of gritty sound you know so it's pretty

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.580 
of gritty sound you know so it's pretty
intense<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.760> now<00:02:12.880> if<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.060> did<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.330> again<00:02:13.720> I'll

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
intense so now if I did that again I'll

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.260 
intense so now if I did that again I'll
just<00:02:14.620> do<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:14.890> like<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:18.840> gonna<00:02:19.840> cop<00:02:20.170> down

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
just do it like this gonna cop down

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.320 
just do it like this gonna cop down
I<00:02:23.220> set<00:02:24.220> mine<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.430> 30<00:02:24.760> because<00:02:24.910> that's<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.210> pretty

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
I set mine to 30 because that's a pretty

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.110 
I set mine to 30 because that's a pretty
decent<00:02:25.600> one<00:02:26.460> now<00:02:27.460> if<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.610> feel<00:02:27.760> around<00:02:27.880> with<00:02:28.000> the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
decent one now if I feel around with the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.990 
decent one now if I feel around with the
resonance<00:02:28.480> I'll<00:02:28.900> show<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.170> what<00:02:29.320> this<00:02:29.440> does

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
resonance I'll show you what this does

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.760 
resonance I'll show you what this does
10

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.800 

yeah<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.490> hear<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.820> nobody<00:02:36.600> wants<00:02:36.780> that

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
yeah you hear that nobody wants that

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:44.150 
yeah you hear that nobody wants that
clicking<00:02:37.200> noise<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:42.530> don't<00:02:43.530> let<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.800> resonance

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
clicking noise I don't let the resonance

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.670 
clicking noise I don't let the resonance
I'm<00:02:44.250> gonna<00:02:44.400> leave<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.580> at<00:02:44.670> zero<00:02:44.850> actually<00:02:45.680> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
I'm gonna leave it at zero actually the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.320 
I'm gonna leave it at zero actually the
attack<00:02:46.980> I'll<00:02:47.550> show<00:02:47.730> what<00:02:47.880> happens<00:02:48.150> if<00:02:48.240> I

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
attack I'll show what happens if I

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.420 
attack I'll show what happens if I
switch<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.590> zero<00:02:49.590> it's<00:02:49.950> at<00:02:50.040> twenty<00:02:50.280> right

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
switch that zero it's at twenty right

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.950 
switch that zero it's at twenty right
now<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:53.240> my<00:02:54.240> brother<00:02:54.420> doesn't<00:02:54.540> work<00:02:54.750> out<00:02:54.930> that

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
now so my brother doesn't work out that

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.170 
now so my brother doesn't work out that
well<00:02:55.290> actually<00:02:56.390> yeah<00:02:58.970> hello

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
well actually yeah hello

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.200 
well actually yeah hello
let's<00:03:01.020> leave<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.230> at<00:03:01.380> 20<00:03:02.090> okay<00:03:05.600> okay<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.660> stop

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
let's leave it at 20 okay okay you stop

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.850 
let's leave it at 20 okay okay you stop
sorry<00:03:09.210> has<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:10.140> probably<00:03:10.470> odd<00:03:10.590> annoying

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
sorry has that probably odd annoying

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.470 
sorry has that probably odd annoying
anyway<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.420> decay<00:03:13.310> richness<00:03:14.310> etc<00:03:14.970> etc<00:03:15.030> now

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
anyway so the decay richness etc etc now

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.670 
anyway so the decay richness etc etc now
to<00:03:15.870> make<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.410> sound<00:03:17.270> what<00:03:18.270> I<00:03:18.300> did<00:03:18.510> was<00:03:18.780> blend

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
to make that sound what I did was blend

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.230 
to make that sound what I did was blend
them<00:03:19.830> all<00:03:19.890> together<00:03:20.040> because<00:03:20.640> if<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:20.970> don't

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
them all together because if you don't

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.240 
them all together because if you don't
do<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.600> like<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:22.170> it's<00:03:22.590> not<00:03:22.800> going<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.070> sound

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
do it like this it's not going to sound

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.910 
do it like this it's not going to sound
great<00:03:23.430> because<00:03:23.760> only<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:24.570> mono<00:03:25.080> -<00:03:25.260> there's<00:03:25.860> a

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
great because only on mono - there's a

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.470 
great because only on mono - there's a
few<00:03:26.130> other<00:03:26.280> ones<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.580> think<00:03:26.730> that's<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.060> -<00:03:27.270> but

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
few other ones I think that's that - but

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.100 
few other ones I think that's that - but
check<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:30.510> don't<00:03:30.660> want<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.840> hear<00:03:30.990> that

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
check so you don't want to hear that

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.340 
check so you don't want to hear that
right

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
right

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.710 
right
so<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.280> mono<00:03:32.580> actually<00:03:33.090> what<00:03:33.210> you<00:03:33.270> could<00:03:33.420> do<00:03:33.570> is

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
so in mono actually what you could do is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.900 
so in mono actually what you could do is
you<00:03:33.810> can<00:03:33.900> select<00:03:34.080> all<00:03:34.410> these<00:03:34.790> extend<00:03:35.790> them

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
you can select all these extend them

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.700 
you can select all these extend them
over<00:03:36.180> top<00:03:36.390> just<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.200> it's<00:03:37.320> over<00:03:37.530> top<00:03:37.680> like

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
over top just so that it's over top like

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.460 
over top just so that it's over top like
this<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.250> then<00:03:38.520> you<00:03:38.580> get<00:03:38.700> this<00:03:38.880> sound<00:03:42.470> isn't

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
this and then you get this sound isn't

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.960 
this and then you get this sound isn't
that<00:03:43.650> beautiful

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
that beautiful

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.550 
that beautiful
alright<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:45.810> hope<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.020> guys<00:03:46.080> enjoyed<00:03:46.530> that
