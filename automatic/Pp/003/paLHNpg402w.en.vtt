here we're talking about close to the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.570 
here we're talking about close to the
same<00:01:46.350> amount<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.649> climbing<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.399> can

does<00:02:25.110> have<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.380> course<00:02:25.650> record<00:02:25.830> it's<00:02:26.459> over<00:02:26.760> 20

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
does have the course record it's over 20

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.089 
does have the course record it's over 20
hours<00:02:27.330> just<00:02:27.959> for<00:02:28.110> some<00:02:28.319> perspective<00:02:28.530> it's

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
hours just for some perspective it's

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.300 
hours just for some perspective it's
almost<00:02:29.819> six<00:02:30.120> hours<00:02:30.470> slower<00:02:31.470> than<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.830> western

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
almost six hours slower than the western

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.850 
almost six hours slower than the western
states<00:02:32.580> 100<00:02:32.910> course<00:02:33.870> record<00:02:34.260> time<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.680> that's

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
states 100 course record time so that's

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.770 
states 100 course record time so that's
the<00:02:34.980> kind<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.310> pace<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:35.940> we're<00:02:36.360> dealing<00:02:36.569> with

type<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.299> event<00:03:39.630> in<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.959> very<00:03:40.470> challenging

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
type of event in a very challenging

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.199 
type of event in a very challenging
grace<00:03:41.069> but<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.310> think<00:03:41.489> it'll<00:03:41.610> be<00:03:41.670> good<00:03:41.880> for<00:03:42.120> the

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
grace but I think it'll be good for the

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.229 
grace but I think it'll be good for the
build<00:03:42.450> up<00:03:42.630> on<00:03:43.220> going<00:03:44.220> into<00:03:44.340> UTM<00:03:44.760> because<00:03:45.120> it's

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
build up on going into UTM because it's

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.360 
build up on going into UTM because it's
