00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.660
 hello to all I'm sorry for the block of 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.740
 mec fashion.fr in this video I will 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.150
 offer you three ideas for 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.540
 customize your swimsuit for 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.540
 this summer 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.710
 for this first idea I'm going 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.029
 a two-piece swimsuit 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.380
 it is united so it's still more 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.580
 practical when you want to customize 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.439
 something for anything too 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.939
 loaded there is a node in the middle so I 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.020
 I'm going to take it off 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.700
 then you'll see I'm going 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.720
 emphasize all the contours of this 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.770
 swimsuit with a black ribbon so 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.940
 the swimsuit is ready there is 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.010
 nothing else that bothers me i'm going 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.270
 so use a thick black ribbon 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.340
 and as I told you I'm going 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.870
 underlined all the outlines of the jersey of 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.399
 bath and I 'm going to sew all that's it 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.550
 who will hold the best at the beach and in 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.550
 the water 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.390
 I know that many of you do not like 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.860
 not sew but really do not panic 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.510
 it's very simple it's just points 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.580
 go back so against you 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.170
 start from the inside to hide the 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.710
 little knot and then it's just a 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.790
 round trip 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.790
 throughout the ribbon 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.860
 before I go to the 2nd rooster I'm going 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.190
 also put a small piece of ribbon at 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.190
 middle 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.070
 an enclosure is over I will do the 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.460
 same thing with the bottom and the outlines 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.460
 from michael 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.020
 and here is the result a swimsuit 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.020
 trend that you have that yourself 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.220
 second idea still on a jersey 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.230
 two pieces it's going to be installed from 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.190
 little pumps have so there on the soul on 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.780
 bra to small 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.280
 pompons on the top and appears on the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.560
 panties I'll put them right in front 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.940
 not to do too much and the same on the part 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.800
 from the top so I found small 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.730
 pompoms already tied together so 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.670
 it's going to be a lot more 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.380
 quick than a pompom one by one so I 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.090
 I'm going to sew all that stuff for that 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.040
 hold well in the water is against I 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.600
 go remove the big nokia in front so 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.840
 like runners I used 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.840
 scissors 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.980
 the shirt looks more like what 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.629
 I wanted sometimes if you do not wear 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.190
 plus a jersey for not hesitating to cut 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.420
 little things that 's on top of that 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.709
 you like it more like that at least 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.709
 you know you can reach them 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.550
 it's gone for sewing so I 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.080
 am going to use a white wire since but 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.220
 pompom are white and you will see 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.510
 it's very simple it's just a 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.560
 return sewing 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.560
 Everyone can do it 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.569
 now that the water is over I 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.810
 am going to do the same thing on the top of 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.810
 my color 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.980
 and that's the result for this second 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.980
 idea swimsuit customization 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.210
 and finally third idea I'm going 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.620
 modernize this one-piece swimsuit 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.390
 in fact I'm going to sew small 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.580
 white flowers in fabric all over the 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.170
 part of the front they are like that and 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.270
 I will use small beads in 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.970
 mother-of-pearl to create the heart of the flower 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.830
 little advice maybe change lanes 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.660
 take a new son every 5-6 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.310
 flowers because if one day one of the sons 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.170
 was breaking you would not have for 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.010
 start what you do not want 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.010
 so I start right away 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.680
 so I start from inside the 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.800
 jersey I come out the eil close to the 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.870
 heart I put a small farm for 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.870
 to make the heart I go back to montebello 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.770
 and that's the result a cleavage more 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.770
 rich 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.139
 and here are the results three ideas for 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.610
 customize his swimsuit for this 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.199
 summer do not hesitate to do that on a 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.610
 shirt that you no longer wear for 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.199
 be sure to have a single cash on 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.699
 the towel to find more than 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.620
