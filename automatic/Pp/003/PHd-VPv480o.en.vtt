for<00:02:37.829> but<00:02:38.829> here<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.159> gets<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.400> be<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.549> little

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
for but here it gets to be a little

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.330 
for but here it gets to be a little
confusing<00:02:40.140> for<00:02:41.140> him<00:02:41.200> because<00:02:41.829> Phil<00:02:42.159> just

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
