just like it fresh and a pinch of salt

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.709 
just like it fresh and a pinch of salt
it<00:00:54.930> will<00:00:55.199> help<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:56.039> view<00:00:56.579> up<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.059> mixture

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
it will help to view up the mixture

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.709 
it will help to view up the mixture
faster<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.680> easier

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
faster and easier

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.049 
faster and easier
turn<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.960> your<00:01:01.020> mixer<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.219> highest<00:01:02.489> speed

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
turn on your mixer on the highest speed

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.020 
turn on your mixer on the highest speed
and<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.600> let<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.809> beat<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:05.100> will<00:01:05.519> increase

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
and just let it beat up it will increase

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.440 
and just let it beat up it will increase
in<00:01:06.240> volume<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.930> become<00:01:07.680> very<00:01:08.150> light<00:01:09.150> like

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
