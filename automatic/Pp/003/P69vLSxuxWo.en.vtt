00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.950
 where the whole youtube band is your 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.079
 defender so is good in this video les 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.660
 I bring the ipad mini unpacking 

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:09.860
 second generation or ipad mini 'retina 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.049
 display 'as you want to call it 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.459
 and good also in this video I'm going to 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.650
 do I will try to make a 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.840
 comparison between the iPad mini first 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.450
 generation and the second mini ipad 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.190
 generation in hardware issues in 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.140
 physical issues since in matters 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.120
 of speed we all know that the ipad 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.730
 mini second generation is superior to 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.500
 ipad mini first generation and good 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.930
 this is the second mini ipad case 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.420
 generation the for in the front 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.450
 tells us ipad mini brings us the logo of 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.520
 apple again here in the front 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.070
 tells us ipad mini and again I greet the 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.860
 apple logo the back is going to 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.900
 tell the specification how much from 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.550
 how much capacity is this ipad mini 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:55.340
 second generation in which I bought 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:01:00.320
 It is 32 but Apple released the 16 gb 32 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.940
 gb 64 and 128 gb the wi-fi version is going to 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.360
 Cost 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.790
 the one from 16 399 last year the first 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.460
 ipad mini generation cost 329 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:17.990
 Now you climb up the prices of 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:20.240
 32 499 64 gb 599 dollars and 128 gb 699 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.310
 dollars if I know that this is also going to 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.040
 depend in some countries but good 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.890
 these are the prices of the usa and maybe 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.970
 in some countries too and good in itself 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:36.009
 this is the ipad mini second generation 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.009
 I would have it that time do not wait for me 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.790
 let's see and pull the charger and good 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.390
 this is the incredible line here is the 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.930
 instructions and the logos and already ran 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.330
 the wall charger and here is like 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.300
 I'm not going to see much of the difference 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.800
 between the ipad mini first generation and 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.960
 second generation in matters of 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.460
 hardware in physical matters 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.040
 this is the ipad mini second generation 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.770
 and this is the iPad mini the first 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.459
 as you see 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.280
 the thickness will change and there is a 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.080
 little looks a lot difference the weight 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.510
 it's also going to change a bit simply 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.519
 this is the first generation weighs less 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.390
 and the second generation will weigh a 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:26.840
 little more the first generation weighs 308 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.030
 grams and the second generation weighs 331 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.910
 grams in screen questions are going to 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.290
 be the same at 7 points 9 inches from 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.299
 screen as in the second 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.940
 generation and also in the camera 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:43.940
 frontal the pixels are going to be the same 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:47.810
 are going to be 1.2 megapixels and this 720 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.819
 in facetime calls also in the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.430
 second generation and in the part of 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:58.670
 back the same is going to be the camera equal 5 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:00.709
 megapixels and 1080 pixels hd this one already 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.200
 I'm wrong which is the second one 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.900
 is not even turned on, this is not the second 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.819
 the first generation and this is the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.760
 second generation you come undertaken 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.960
 and as I tell you in questions there will be no 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.210
 Much difference 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.030
 brings the stelae horns in the part 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.590
 inferior on the side we will 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.630
 bring everything the same in them 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.020
 positions also something else that 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.200
 it just changes is going to be the microphone 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.590
 now it brings us two before nothing else is 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.090
 in the first generation he brought us one 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.490
 here is this is the second generation 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.000
 brings us two and this is the first 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.270
 generation also bring us one 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.100
 and this and other step 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.870
 other specifications of this ipad and 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.780
 second generation is in question the 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.270
 processor the processor is much more 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.420
 fast the megapixels is twice as 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.910
 the ipad first ipad mini first 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.430
 generation is going to bring us a ram gb 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.850
 in the first generation he brought us 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:09.430
 simply 512 of ram to the megapixels 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.750
 is going to be 1024 x 768 pixels is the 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.380
 first generation and the second 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:18.910
 generation now retina display is of 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:23.380
 2048 x 1536 pixels the processor already 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:26.110
 you know what the 7 to 64 bit processor is 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.910
 in the first generation it was simply 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.910
 the dual core the a5 chip 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.680
 the truth I do not know what happens to me more in 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.660
 issues of that 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.910
 and I think it 's all about this 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.090
 video I hope you like them 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.640
 As I say, I do not think I have to 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.220
 do this a speed comparison 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.870
 since it is the second mini ipad 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.500
 generation is going to be much more superior 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.960
 to the first generation ipad maybe 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.390
 a speed comparison of the ipad mini 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.820
 second generation with the ipad r maybe 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.010
 if there would be a good video itself it is 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.170
 especially about this video if you liked it 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.240
 thanks a video and good 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.660
 we'll see you in the next video 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.660
 bye
