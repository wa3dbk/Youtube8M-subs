00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
subscribers I feel like the subscribe

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.659 
subscribers I feel like the subscribe
button<00:05:49.719> needs<00:05:50.440> to<00:05:50.560> be<00:05:50.650> over<00:05:51.039> the<00:05:51.130> video<00:05:51.400> it

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
button needs to be over the video it

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.100 
button needs to be over the video it
just<00:05:51.819> kind<00:05:52.029> of<00:05:52.090> makes<00:05:52.270> sense<00:05:52.389> in<00:05:52.599> my<00:05:52.719> opinion

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
just kind of makes sense in my opinion

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.300 
just kind of makes sense in my opinion
because<00:05:53.259> if<00:05:53.440> you're<00:05:53.560> watching<00:05:53.830> oh<00:05:54.069> like<00:05:54.219> an

because if you're watching oh like an

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.830 
because if you're watching oh like an
old<00:05:54.550> browser<00:05:54.849> or<00:05:55.240> something<00:05:55.509> where<00:05:55.630> you<00:05:55.719> just

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
old browser or something where you just

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.749 
old browser or something where you just
have<00:05:56.050> the<00:05:56.199> video<00:05:56.409> really<00:05:56.710> really<00:05:56.979> big<00:05:57.190> you<00:05:57.580> may

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 
have the video really really big you may

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.550 
have the video really really big you may
have<00:05:57.969> to<00:05:58.150> scroll<00:05:58.389> down<00:05:58.449> and<00:05:58.930> you<00:05:58.990> may<00:05:59.139> not<00:05:59.319> see

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
have to scroll down and you may not see

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.930 
have to scroll down and you may not see
that<00:05:59.740> subscribe<00:05:59.949> button<00:06:00.190> if<00:06:00.610> that's<00:06:00.759> what's

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
that subscribe button if that's what's

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.519 
that subscribe button if that's what's
important<00:06:01.449> we<00:06:01.599> want<00:06:01.690> to<00:06:01.840> see<00:06:02.020> that<00:06:02.169> first<00:06:02.409> and

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:02.529 
important we want to see that first and

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.170 
important we want to see that first and
foremost<00:06:02.860> I<00:06:03.009> think<00:06:03.340> it<00:06:03.430> should<00:06:03.550> be<00:06:03.699> there<00:06:03.909> but

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
foremost I think it should be there but

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.999 
foremost I think it should be there but
again<00:06:04.300> I'm<00:06:04.779> behind<00:06:05.139> YouTube<00:06:05.590> with<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:05.770> whole

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
again I'm behind YouTube with the whole

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:07.529 
again I'm behind YouTube with the whole
let's<00:06:06.279> get<00:06:06.490> you<00:06:06.580> to<00:06:06.699> explore<00:06:07.000> I'm<00:06:07.270> totally

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
let's get you to explore I'm totally

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:08.730 
let's get you to explore I'm totally
behind<00:06:07.659> that<00:06:07.960> and<00:06:08.080> I<00:06:08.110> think<00:06:08.169> there's<00:06:08.529> ways<00:06:08.710> to

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
behind that and I think there's ways to

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.529 
behind that and I think there's ways to
make<00:06:09.069> this<00:06:09.190> work<00:06:09.460> I<00:06:09.580> just<00:06:09.789> think<00:06:09.940> right<00:06:10.000> now

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
make this work I just think right now

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:11.999 
make this work I just think right now
the<00:06:10.599> way<00:06:10.990> that<00:06:11.139> set<00:06:11.349> up<00:06:11.469> coming<00:06:11.740> from<00:06:11.889> a

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:12.009 
the way that set up coming from a

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:13.469 
the way that set up coming from a
computer<00:06:12.250> science<00:06:12.400> background<00:06:12.639> this<00:06:13.210> looks

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
computer science background this looks

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.409 
computer science background this looks
like<00:06:13.690> I'm<00:06:14.319> a<00:06:14.409> computer<00:06:15.009> person<00:06:15.219> and<00:06:15.669> this<00:06:16.240> is

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
like I'm a computer person and this is

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.120 
like I'm a computer person and this is
what<00:06:16.599> I<00:06:16.630> think<00:06:16.779> will<00:06:17.080> work<00:06:17.319> to<00:06:17.529> make<00:06:17.770> me<00:06:17.919> see

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
what I think will work to make me see

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.559 
what I think will work to make me see
more<00:06:18.370> and<00:06:18.639> I<00:06:18.729> think<00:06:19.000> what<00:06:19.150> we<00:06:19.240> need<00:06:19.270> is<00:06:19.419> a

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:19.569 
more and I think what we need is a

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:20.999 
more and I think what we need is a
little<00:06:19.750> bit<00:06:19.930> more<00:06:20.050> people<00:06:20.440> looking<00:06:20.889> at<00:06:20.979> it

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
little bit more people looking at it

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:22.769 
little bit more people looking at it
from<00:06:21.130> the<00:06:21.310> creative<00:06:21.759> side<00:06:22.000> and<00:06:22.029> like<00:06:22.300> what's<00:06:22.599> a

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:22.779 
from the creative side and like what's a

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.320 
from the creative side and like what's a
user<00:06:23.110> experience<00:06:23.770> person's<00:06:24.279> experience<00:06:25.210> with

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
user experience person's experience with

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.700 
user experience person's experience with
being<00:06:25.449> able<00:06:25.659> to<00:06:25.900> see<00:06:26.080> more<00:06:26.289> with<00:06:26.440> being<00:06:26.650> able

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
being able to see more with being able

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.499 
being able to see more with being able
to<00:06:26.830> explore<00:06:27.219> you're<00:06:27.520> like<00:06:27.729> they're<00:06:28.000> your

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:28.509 
to explore you're like they're your

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:30.330 
to explore you're like they're your
heart's<00:06:28.930> in<00:06:29.080> the<00:06:29.110> right<00:06:29.199> place<00:06:29.380> and<00:06:29.889> I<00:06:30.279> think

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
heart's in the right place and I think

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.800 
heart's in the right place and I think
it's<00:06:30.610> just<00:06:30.819> a<00:06:30.969> matter<00:06:31.180> of<00:06:31.330> the<00:06:31.569> right

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
it's just a matter of the right

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.779 
it's just a matter of the right
execution<00:06:32.590> to<00:06:32.680> make<00:06:32.830> it<00:06:32.979> work<00:06:33.130> properly<00:06:33.370> and

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
execution to make it work properly and

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:34.680 
execution to make it work properly and
this<00:06:33.880> is<00:06:33.969> gonna<00:06:34.090> be<00:06:34.150> kind<00:06:34.330> of<00:06:34.360> a<00:06:34.449> weird<00:06:34.630> thing

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
this is gonna be kind of a weird thing

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.389 
this is gonna be kind of a weird thing
to<00:06:34.839> say<00:06:34.960> but<00:06:35.199> I'm<00:06:35.320> also<00:06:35.500> gonna<00:06:35.740> say<00:06:35.979> that<00:06:36.190> think

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
like that may be the reason why YouTube

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.460 
like that may be the reason why YouTube
is<00:06:47.550> trying<00:06:47.699> to<00:06:47.850> put<00:06:48.090> so<00:06:48.240> much<00:06:48.389> of<00:06:48.600> exploring<00:06:49.320> on

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
is trying to put so much of exploring on

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.110 
is trying to put so much of exploring on
there<00:06:49.620> on<00:06:49.889> there<00:06:50.100> and<00:06:50.280> it's<00:06:50.699> maybe<00:06:50.850> weeds

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
there on there and it's maybe weeds

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.700 
there on there and it's maybe weeds
because<00:06:51.330> we're<00:06:51.660> not<00:06:51.810> maybe<00:06:52.020> doing<00:06:52.199> as<00:06:52.410> much<00:06:52.590> of

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710

and Facebook I know a lot of us say that

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.170 
and Facebook I know a lot of us say that
in<00:07:01.410> the<00:07:01.500> videos<00:07:01.830> it's<00:07:02.250> sometimes<00:07:02.970> kind<00:07:03.090> of

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
in the videos it's sometimes kind of

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.909 
in the videos it's sometimes kind of
annoying<00:07:03.389> I<00:07:03.600> understand<00:07:04.169> but<00:07:04.710> you<00:07:04.889> don't

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 
annoying I understand but you don't

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:07.610 
annoying I understand but you don't
realize<00:07:05.550> how<00:07:05.880> important<00:07:06.419> that<00:07:06.449> is<00:07:07.050> for<00:07:07.290> people

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
realize how important that is for people

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.439 
realize how important that is for people
not<00:07:08.160> only<00:07:08.190> yourself<00:07:08.580> but<00:07:08.910> for<00:07:09.150> other<00:07:09.360> people

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:09.449 
not only yourself but for other people

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.360 
not only yourself but for other people
who<00:07:09.930> are<00:07:10.020> experiencing<00:07:10.590> YouTube<00:07:10.889> or<00:07:11.010> watching

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
who are experiencing YouTube or watching

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.129 
who are experiencing YouTube or watching
videos<00:07:11.639> to<00:07:11.850> see<00:07:12.120> the<00:07:12.330> type<00:07:12.479> of<00:07:12.510> content<00:07:12.960> that

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 
videos to see the type of content that

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.740 
videos to see the type of content that
you<00:07:13.410> want<00:07:13.770> to<00:07:14.430> be<00:07:14.580> seen<00:07:14.880> it's<00:07:15.150> very<00:07:15.450> helpful

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
you want to be seen it's very helpful

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.200 
you want to be seen it's very helpful
and<00:07:16.110> I<00:07:16.290> think<00:07:16.320> if<00:07:16.680> we<00:07:16.950> collectively<00:07:17.669> do<00:07:18.000> more

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
and I think if we collectively do more

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.930 
and I think if we collectively do more
of<00:07:18.300> that<00:07:18.450> then<00:07:18.810> maybe<00:07:19.139> you<00:07:19.650> two<00:07:20.160> won't<00:07:20.340> try<00:07:20.880> to

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 
of that then maybe you two won't try to

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.120 
of that then maybe you two won't try to
force<00:07:21.360> it<00:07:21.540> but<00:07:22.080> there<00:07:22.290> are<00:07:22.350> various<00:07:22.830> changes

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.130 
force it but there are various changes

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.770 
force it but there are various changes
and<00:07:23.580> a<00:07:24.000> lot<00:07:24.270> of<00:07:24.300> it<00:07:24.450> can<00:07:24.510> just<00:07:24.630> happen

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
and a lot of it can just happen

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.540 
and a lot of it can just happen
naturally<00:07:24.960> so<00:07:25.500> now<00:07:25.650> I<00:07:25.680> want<00:07:25.919> to<00:07:25.950> hear<00:07:26.160> from<00:07:26.310> you
