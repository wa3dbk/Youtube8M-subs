00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
know if the camera got that you

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:50.069 
know if the camera got that you
certainly<00:02:19.690> would<00:02:19.810> have<00:02:19.900> heard<00:02:20.080> it

well<00:03:28.760> too<00:03:29.760> successful<00:03:30.060> invert

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.390 

successful<00:03:40.500> loop<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.860> two<00:03:40.980> successful

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
successful loop and two successful

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.790 
successful loop and two successful
inverse<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:42.000> holy<00:03:42.690> smokes<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:43.319> gets<00:03:43.530> ugly

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
inverse but holy smokes that gets ugly

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.380 
inverse but holy smokes that gets ugly
it<00:03:43.950> doesn't<00:03:43.980> want<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.430> pull<00:03:44.940> up<00:03:44.970> very<00:03:45.330> much

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
it doesn't want to pull up very much

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:53.150 
it doesn't want to pull up very much
either<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:50.840> don't<00:03:51.840> know<00:03:51.900> man<00:03:52.140> 3ds<00:03:52.950> ain't

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
either I don't know man 3ds ain't

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.820 
either I don't know man 3ds ain't
my<00:03:53.280> stuff

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
my stuff

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
my stuff
it<00:03:55.830> ain't<00:03:56.099> pretty<00:03:56.430> that's<00:03:56.700> why

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:28.580 

hope<00:04:04.420> this<00:04:04.630> is<00:04:04.750> recording

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:37.060 

I<00:04:28.650> don't<00:04:29.460> know

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.650 

the<00:04:37.550> no<00:04:37.700> against<00:04:37.970> stuff<00:04:38.240> seems<00:04:38.510> to<00:04:38.600> be<00:04:39.160> easier

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
the no against stuff seems to be easier

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.300 
the no against stuff seems to be easier
pressed<00:04:41.660> closer

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.300 

yeah<00:04:45.910> bell<00:04:46.420> pit<00:04:46.930> here<00:04:47.170> area<00:04:47.530> they're<00:04:48.010> on<00:04:48.190> it

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
yeah bell pit here area they're on it

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.120 
yeah bell pit here area they're on it
then<00:04:48.810> hold<00:04:49.810> radical<00:04:50.320> field<00:04:50.590> right<00:04:50.889> there

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
then hold radical field right there

00:04:51.130 --> 00:05:16.720 
then hold radical field right there
after<00:04:51.340> your<00:04:51.550> sin

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.370 

we<00:05:17.730> gotta<00:05:17.910> catch<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.210> believe<00:05:18.630> it<00:05:18.720> or<00:05:18.810> not

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:32.399 

probably<00:05:22.380> shouldn't<00:05:22.620> do<00:05:22.710> that

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.439 

I<00:05:32.729> hope<00:05:33.729> the<00:05:33.849> cameras<00:05:34.209> still<00:05:34.389> recording

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
I hope the cameras still recording

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:45.479 
I hope the cameras still recording
that's<00:05:37.449> pit<00:05:38.399> area<00:05:39.629> and<00:05:42.779> that<00:05:43.779> there<00:05:44.050> is<00:05:44.489> what's

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:45.489
