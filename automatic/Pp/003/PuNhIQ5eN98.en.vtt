righty you can use it lefty it's got a
couple<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.790> stages<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.240> here<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> want<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.900> point

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
couple of stages in here I want to point

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.120 
couple of stages in here I want to point
out<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.450> core<00:00:15.750> stage<00:00:16.170> this

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
out to you this is the core stage this

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.560 
out to you this is the core stage this
is<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:20.660> what<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.779> call<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.580> core<00:00:23.580> stage<00:00:23.939> is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
is a what do you call it core stage is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
is a what do you call it core stage is
tungsten<00:00:25.289> carbide<00:00:26.539> for<00:00:27.539> sharpening<00:00:27.900> blunt<00:00:28.380> or

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
tungsten carbide for sharpening blunt or

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.519 
tungsten carbide for sharpening blunt or
dull<00:00:28.800> knives<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> fine<00:00:31.140> stage

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
dull knives and this is the fine stage

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.110 
dull knives and this is the fine stage
fine<00:00:32.189> stage<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:33.050> small<00:00:34.050> ceramic<00:00:34.500> rods<00:00:35.120> for

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
fine stage is small ceramic rods for

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.420 
fine stage is small ceramic rods for
fine<00:00:36.480> honing<00:00:37.380> or<00:00:37.559> sharpening<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> knife

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
fine honing or sharpening of the knife

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.880 
fine honing or sharpening of the knife
so<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.149> these<00:00:39.270> two<00:00:39.329> stages<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.379> believe<00:00:40.710> it's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
so with these two stages I believe it's

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.590 
so with these two stages I believe it's
going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> work<00:00:41.160> very<00:00:41.520> well<00:00:41.610> I'm<00:00:42.270> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.450> try

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
it out first through the carbide a

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.830 
it out first through the carbide a
couple<00:00:48.539> times<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.670> through<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> ceramic<00:00:51.390> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
couple times and through the ceramic a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.709 
couple times and through the ceramic a
couple<00:00:52.440> times<00:00:56.180> okay<00:00:57.180> we're<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> try
