still there except for when I leave the
house<00:02:26.110> yeah<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:27.070> what<00:02:27.250> do<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.430> think<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:28.000> is

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
house yeah so what do you think this is

house yeah so what do you think this is
I'm<00:02:29.230> definitely<00:02:29.440> thinking<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.100> has<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.310> do

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
I'm definitely thinking it has to do

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.400 
I'm definitely thinking it has to do
with<00:02:30.580> my<00:02:30.820> dog<00:02:31.060> yeah<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:31.660> think<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:32.080> agree<00:02:32.110> with

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
with my dog yeah I think I agree with

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.050 
with my dog yeah I think I agree with
you<00:02:32.709> but<00:02:32.890> let's<00:02:33.010> just<00:02:33.190> check<00:02:33.280> out<00:02:33.520> your<00:02:33.670> vitals

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
you but let's just check out your vitals

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.030 
you but let's just check out your vitals
anyway<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:35.230> first<00:02:35.530> I'm<00:02:35.620> gonna<00:02:35.709> take<00:02:35.920> your

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
anyway so first I'm gonna take your

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.979 
anyway so first I'm gonna take your
temperature<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:37.090> best<00:02:37.300> place<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.570> take<00:02:37.840> the

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
temperature the best place to take the

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.440 
temperature the best place to take the
temperature<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.830> in<00:02:39.340> here<00:02:39.880> because<00:02:40.120> it's

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
temperature is in here because it's

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.210 
temperature is in here because it's
closest<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.020> brain<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:41.709> I'm<00:02:41.860> going<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.070> go

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
closest to the brain but I'm going to go

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.710 
closest to the brain but I'm going to go
and<00:02:42.370> put<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.670> under<00:02:42.910> your<00:02:42.940> tongue<00:02:43.090> because

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
and put it under your tongue because

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.809 
and put it under your tongue because
just<00:02:43.959> more<00:02:44.140> convenient<00:02:44.680> for<00:02:44.860> right<00:02:44.980> now

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.110 

so<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.989> average<00:02:51.349> temperature<00:02:51.770> in<00:02:51.980> 96<00:02:52.520> to<00:02:52.760> 99

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
so the average temperature in 96 to 99

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.800 
so the average temperature in 96 to 99
and<00:02:53.750> let's<00:02:54.260> do<00:02:54.500> this<00:02:54.680> it's<00:02:55.220> not<00:02:55.489> 8.6<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.629> that's

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
and let's do this it's not 8.6 so that's

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.790 
and let's do this it's not 8.6 so that's
completely<00:02:57.230> normal

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
completely normal

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.830 
completely normal
great<00:02:58.099> good<00:02:58.879> job<00:02:59.150> and<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:01.190> pulse<00:03:01.610> on<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.629> take

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
great good job and the pulse on to take

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.390 
great good job and the pulse on to take
your<00:03:02.989> pulse<00:03:03.140> right<00:03:03.440> now<00:03:03.470> let's<00:03:04.010> see<00:03:09.400> alright

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
your pulse right now let's see alright

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.790 
your pulse right now let's see alright
I'm<00:03:10.880> going<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:11.300> put<00:03:11.630> pressure<00:03:11.810> on<00:03:12.050> your<00:03:12.380> radial

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
I'm going to put pressure on your radial

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.850 
I'm going to put pressure on your radial
artery<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:13.640> then<00:03:14.030> I'm<00:03:14.150> going<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.330> lift<00:03:14.540> up

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
artery and then I'm going to lift up

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.440 
artery and then I'm going to lift up
lightning<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.099> I'm<00:03:16.580> going<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.819> wait<00:03:17.030> for<00:03:17.060> 30

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
lightning and I'm going to wait for 30

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.300 
lightning and I'm going to wait for 30
seconds<00:03:18.190> all<00:03:19.190> right<00:03:20.260> okay<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.590> about<00:03:21.709> 60

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
seconds all right okay so about 60

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.380 
seconds all right okay so about 60
seconds<00:03:22.730> passed

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
seconds passed

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.229 
seconds passed
I<00:03:23.420> took<00:03:23.810> 30<00:03:24.319> seconds<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:25.160> feel<00:03:25.370> your<00:03:25.580> pulse<00:03:25.819> and

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
I took 30 seconds to feel your pulse and

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.720 
I took 30 seconds to feel your pulse and
then<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.540> multiply<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.260> by<00:03:27.319> 2<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.069> your<00:03:28.489> pulse

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
then I multiply that by 2 and your pulse

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.830 
then I multiply that by 2 and your pulse
was<00:03:29.060> about<00:03:30.190> 72<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.880> that's<00:03:32.269> normal<00:03:32.630> because

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
was about 72 and that's normal because

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.259 
was about 72 and that's normal because
the<00:03:33.140> normal<00:03:33.380> range<00:03:33.650> is<00:03:33.860> about<00:03:33.980> 60<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.610> 100<00:03:35.090> I

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
the normal range is about 60 to 100 I

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.780 
the normal range is about 60 to 100 I
also<00:03:35.959> took<00:03:36.200> 30<00:03:36.650> seconds<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.370> watch<00:03:37.579> the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
also took 30 seconds to watch the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.360 
also took 30 seconds to watch the
respiratory<00:03:38.180> rate<00:03:38.690> normal<00:03:39.049> right<00:03:39.920> before<00:03:40.280> you

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
respiratory rate normal right before you

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.330 
respiratory rate normal right before you
rate<00:03:40.579> is<00:03:40.790> 10<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.720> 20<00:03:42.110> and<00:03:42.230> nurses<00:03:42.560> 12<00:03:42.829> so<00:03:43.130> also

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
rate is 10 to 20 and nurses 12 so also

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.000 
rate is 10 to 20 and nurses 12 so also
very<00:03:43.700> normal<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:45.049> while<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:45.319> was<00:03:45.560> watching<00:03:45.709> your

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
very normal so while I was watching your

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.770 
very normal so while I was watching your
respiratory<00:03:46.400> rate<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.150> was<00:03:47.269> watching<00:03:47.569> to<00:03:47.660> make

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
respiratory rate I was watching to make

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.539 
respiratory rate I was watching to make
sure<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.110> both<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.500> your<00:03:48.769> sides<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.430> your

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
sure that both of your sides of your

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.600 
sure that both of your sides of your
chest<00:03:49.610> were<00:03:50.000> riding<00:03:50.450> equally<00:03:51.610> symmetrically

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
chest were riding equally symmetrically

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.210 
chest were riding equally symmetrically
and<00:03:53.420> that<00:03:53.870> would<00:03:54.049> show<00:03:54.230> that<00:03:54.410> your<00:03:54.620> lungs<00:03:54.829> are

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
and that would show that your lungs are

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.039 
and that would show that your lungs are
working<00:03:55.579> properly<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:56.329> working<00:03:56.660> in<00:03:56.780> sync

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
working properly and working in sync

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:57.849 
working properly and working in sync
with<00:03:57.170> each<00:03:57.290> other

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
with each other

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.509 
with each other
that<00:03:58.370> was<00:03:58.549> good<00:03:58.760> they<00:03:58.910> were<00:03:59.739> with<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.920> pulse<00:04:01.190> I

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
that was good they were with the pulse I

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.090 
that was good they were with the pulse I
felt<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.209> was<00:04:02.299> very<00:04:02.480> strong<00:04:03.019> not<00:04:03.920> too

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
felt that it was very strong not too

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.789 
felt that it was very strong not too
strong<00:04:04.400> though<00:04:04.609> savings<00:04:05.030> out<00:04:05.209> of<00:04:05.239> two<00:04:05.799> three

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
strong though savings out of two three

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.710 
strong though savings out of two three
would<00:04:07.010> be<00:04:07.040> erratic<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.150> you<00:04:08.540> know<00:04:08.660> too

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
would be erratic and you know too

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.259 
would be erratic and you know too
excited<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.709> you<00:04:10.400> know<00:04:10.489> one<00:04:10.730> would<00:04:10.910> be<00:04:11.060> too

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
excited and you know one would be too

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.729 
excited and you know one would be too
weak<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.690> Derby<00:04:12.260> accent<00:04:12.709> so<00:04:13.040> we're<00:04:13.549> happy<00:04:14.739> it

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
weak and Derby accent so we're happy it

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.319 
weak and Derby accent so we're happy it
was<00:04:16.039> also<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:17.150> know<00:04:17.269> very<00:04:17.299> smooth

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
was also you know very smooth

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.449 
was also you know very smooth
what<00:04:18.810> didn't<00:04:19.169> seem<00:04:19.349> erratic<00:04:19.919> at<00:04:20.009> all<00:04:20.159> it<00:04:20.340> just

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
what didn't seem erratic at all it just

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.420 
what didn't seem erratic at all it just
had<00:04:20.759> an<00:04:21.090> American<00:04:21.359> girl<00:04:22.009> the<00:04:23.009> respiratory

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
had an American girl the respiratory

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.850 
had an American girl the respiratory
rate<00:04:23.759> was<00:04:24.360> not<00:04:24.780> perfect<00:04:25.259> it<00:04:25.409> said<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.710> was<00:04:25.830> in

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
rate was not perfect it said it was in

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.999 
rate was not perfect it said it was in
the<00:04:26.159> range<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.819> your<00:04:27.599> gain<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.349> elasticity

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
the range and your gain and elasticity

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.950 
the range and your gain and elasticity
which<00:04:29.490> we<00:04:29.669> find<00:04:29.879> in<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.210> elderly<00:04:30.569> that

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
which we find in the elderly that

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.749 
which we find in the elderly that
sometimes<00:04:31.349> the<00:04:31.560> arteries<00:04:31.949> can<00:04:32.129> Harden<00:04:32.520> and

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
sometimes the arteries can Harden and

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.790 
sometimes the arteries can Harden and
that<00:04:33.449> can<00:04:33.629> be<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.780> problem<00:04:34.050> but<00:04:34.440> you<00:04:34.680> know

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
that can be a problem but you know

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.890 
that can be a problem but you know
you're<00:04:35.129> gonna<00:04:35.340> sell<00:04:35.729> your<00:04:35.759> food<00:04:36.210> elasticity

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
you're gonna sell your food elasticity

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.869 
you're gonna sell your food elasticity
okay<00:04:37.289> all<00:04:38.039> right<00:04:38.159> so<00:04:38.340> I'm<00:04:38.430> going<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.610> take<00:04:38.699> your

blood pressure now okay so the golden

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.529 
blood pressure now okay so the golden
standard<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:43.139> blood<00:04:43.349> pressure<00:04:43.620> is<00:04:44.090> 120<00:04:45.090> over

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
standard of blood pressure is 120 over

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.409 
standard of blood pressure is 120 over
80<00:04:46.050> as<00:04:46.620> I<00:04:46.860> put<00:04:47.039> on<00:04:47.099> this<00:04:47.250> cup<00:04:47.550> I'm<00:04:47.789> making<00:04:48.150> sure

your pulse as I begin pumping up this

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.469 
your pulse as I begin pumping up this
coming<00:05:05.069> up<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.340> blood<00:05:05.520> pressure<00:05:05.759> machine<00:05:06.030> and

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
coming up the blood pressure machine and

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.119 
coming up the blood pressure machine and
is<00:05:06.629> there<00:05:06.780> any<00:05:06.960> sort<00:05:07.319> of<00:05:07.440> way<00:05:07.620> in<00:05:07.830> which<00:05:07.949> my

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.480 

all<00:05:55.540> right<00:05:55.690> great<00:05:55.990> so<00:05:56.590> I<00:05:56.620> did<00:05:57.100> is<00:05:57.250> that<00:05:57.310> I

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
all right great so I did is that I

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.460 
all right great so I did is that I
listen<00:05:57.850> for<00:05:57.880> the<00:05:58.180> first<00:05:58.360> part<00:05:58.780> sounds<00:05:59.290> and

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
listen for the first part sounds and

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.990 
listen for the first part sounds and
that<00:05:59.860> is<00:06:00.040> just<00:06:00.250> this<00:06:00.430> solid<00:06:01.080> hop<00:06:02.080> about<00:06:03.040> 117

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
that is just this solid hop about 117

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.210 
that is just this solid hop about 117
and<00:06:04.360> then<00:06:04.990> when<00:06:05.200> I<00:06:05.230> couldn't<00:06:05.620> hear<00:06:05.830> a<00:06:05.890> heart

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
and then when I couldn't hear a heart

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.830 
and then when I couldn't hear a heart
sound<00:06:06.400> e<00:06:06.520> and<00:06:06.670> that<00:06:06.730> very<00:06:07.030> last<00:06:07.300> heart<00:06:07.600> sound

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
sound e and that very last heart sound

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.750 
sound e and that very last heart sound
that<00:06:08.020> was<00:06:08.140> who<00:06:08.320> dis<00:06:08.530> solid<00:06:08.980> and<00:06:09.160> that<00:06:09.580> was

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
that was who dis solid and that was

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.300 
that was who dis solid and that was
about<00:06:09.910> 75<00:06:10.690> so<00:06:11.110> I<00:06:11.380> mean<00:06:11.560> it's<00:06:11.740> pretty<00:06:12.070> much

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
about 75 so I mean it's pretty much

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.580 
about 75 so I mean it's pretty much
perfect<00:06:13.000> you<00:06:13.390> know<00:06:13.510> I<00:06:13.540> mean<00:06:13.840> 120<00:06:14.230> over<00:06:14.320> 80

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
perfect you know I mean 120 over 80

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.190 
perfect you know I mean 120 over 80
sensible<00:06:15.190> standards<00:06:15.820> but<00:06:16.390> you<00:06:16.900> know<00:06:17.020> it

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
sensible standards but you know it

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.530 
sensible standards but you know it
wasn't<00:06:17.380> completely<00:06:17.950> abnormal<00:06:18.160> so<00:06:18.850> I<00:06:19.180> feel

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
wasn't completely abnormal so I feel
