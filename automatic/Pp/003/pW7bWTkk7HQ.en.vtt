00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
think this is one of their first events

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.650 
think this is one of their first events
that<00:00:46.200> they've<00:00:46.320> ever<00:00:46.410> gone<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:48.510> make<00:00:48.629> it

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that they've ever gone to and to make it

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.529 
that they've ever gone to and to make it
even<00:00:48.840> better<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:50.399> cost<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.239> event<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
even better the cost of this event is

even better the cost of this event is
only<00:00:51.809> fifty<00:00:52.260> dollars<00:00:52.620> which<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.789> really

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
only fifty dollars which is really

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.729 
only fifty dollars which is really
really<00:00:54.629> good<00:00:54.899> because<00:00:55.110> most<00:00:55.469> other
