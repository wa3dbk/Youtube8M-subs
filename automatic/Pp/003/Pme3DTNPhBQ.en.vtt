home builder this was our first design
and<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.190> engine<00:01:51.180> has<00:01:51.390> still<00:01:51.780> being<00:01:52.620> made<00:01:52.920> in

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
and this engine has still being made in

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.970 
and this engine has still being made in
a<00:01:53.820> different<00:01:54.270> form<00:01:54.570> now<00:01:54.900> it<00:01:55.170> has<00:01:55.320> evolved<00:01:55.800> all

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
a different form now it has evolved all

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.890 
a different form now it has evolved all
the<00:01:56.160> way<00:01:56.340> through<00:01:56.640> without<00:01:56.880> changing<00:01:57.690> its

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
size or its weight and it's now

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.830 
size or its weight and it's now
available<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> 10<00:02:01.770> kilogram<00:02:02.480> 22<00:02:03.480> pound
