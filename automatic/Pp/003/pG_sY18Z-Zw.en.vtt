00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.269
 Hi guys all right 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.580
 I'm here today to make a little party 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.440
 With you, I love that you have this 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.900
 I return the microsite when I come here 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.359
 There you talk a lot of things there. 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.189
 You respond, you know, it's very beautiful today. 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.900
 will make a video telling you 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.550
 something I learned in the last 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.800
 weeks we actually do some 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.990
 months at some point in recent months 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.269
 I found in the information on the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.880
 amount of water we should leave 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.130
 on the hair before applying the cream 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.690
 to comb a and was always a doubt 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.739
 too big for me actually need 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.140
 when I was younger 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.690
 some people draw I like 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.149
 leave enough water in my hair and then I 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.610
 cream step do affect etc to 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.219
 other people say do not leave too much 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.440
 water that will not be very diluted and 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.460
 there will not have a legal effect not 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.129
 will give the effect that crime really 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.289
 Work for us, what's the truth? 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.850
 truth is that both of the details and only 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.530
 four 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.969
 the truth is that the two information 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.739
 may be right 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.630
 sometimes you buy a whole cream 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.369
 world speaks well of you combing cream is 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.799
 especially the finalizers we 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.510
 we're talking here you've seen everyone 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.890
 well for example will master not yet 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.240
 I tested with this technician but I'm 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.740
 eager CEO of the company 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.750
 public good you as the time to 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.770
 to see the effect of that person and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.490
 When you pass your hair, do not 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.229
 it was very good 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.850
 the amount of water that you left your 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.439
 hair to finish the curls after 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.810
 that makes all the difference about 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.310
 final status with cream also then 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.869
 What is the new rule? 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.939
 the internet is not a rule people are one 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.220
 something that works for you a lot 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.829
 well if it does not work you continue 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.180
 already done but the new tip is that when 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.430
 you buy a cream that is more 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.810
 thicker heavier or heavier 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.250
 when you finalize your hair with a 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.899
 mask that usually also has a 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.700
 thicker texture and I've made a video 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.649
 Talking about it, I'm leaving Iraq. 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.630
 in the description the name of the video I can 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.189
 letting hair conditioner is a 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.530
 I ask you several things about 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.540
 leave the hair controller and on 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.830
 leave mask also has some rules 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.600
 for this is not any brand 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.490
 conditioner but finally when you 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.800
 I chose to believe that you will use you 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.810
 realize if he's grosser 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.899
 dense heavier you get yours 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.690
 hair with more water takes a little 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.310
 excess water because that water will 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.920
 reacting with cream will eventually decrease 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.740
 a little cream and leave your hair 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.750
 looking not so heavy and not hard 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.120
 also then if the crime is denser 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.250
 No problem or it's very good if 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.470
 you end the wettest hair ever 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.420
 the thinner it is likely that he will 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.550
 have more water in that composition or 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.800
 is less water in your hair as 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.350
 feel more about access to water and 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.510
 ends with that thinner cream 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.190
 fluid and it just ended up going light 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.840
 also sell this tip was done a lot 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.340
 difference to me as I use several 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.230
 kinds of beauty creams brands 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.430
 union by president ernesto monte de 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.050
 thing has given super right to choose the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.310
 how much water will be used with that 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.020
 hair cream 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.450
 You know I hope you have 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.980
 understood and liked hearing is bringing this 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.540
 Today's event because I thought a tip 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.130

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.140
