00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi girls today I you 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.060
 find to show you two ways 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.130
 different from doing your line hours 2 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.660
 minutes only for that you will have 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.700
 need a black kohl pencil 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.170
 it will serve us as a rough draft and thanks 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.570
 to that sion according to which one can easily 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.550
 a wheat and start over the technique is 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.350
 simple just do a first sort 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.779
 following the upper lash line 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.699
 without pulling on the eyelid to avoid 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.859
 have the effect of a falling eye because in 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.660
 general when releasing the thick line 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.810
 a disorder for the natural form of 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810
 the eye 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.710
 for the 2nd May 13 drawn for 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 step up to black 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.800
 and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.650
 for the comma nothing more simple 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.690
 follow the line of your spleen he 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.870
 then inferior to you to choose his 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.870
 cut 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.480
 to finish this trait you will need 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.490
 fire liner celuici everything is fine there 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.000
 is easy to handle and black is 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.000
 very intense 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.619
 with the felt or you just go 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.079
 iron the very black lines in pencil 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.219
 previously so like me you have a 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.869
 eye quite often 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.909
 the application would be simpler in 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.069
 pulling the eyelid if you want a 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.170
 thicker line you but the pc as you go 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:23.850
 and to measure thanks to the tip of me of the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.100
 felt that to me that's how I 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.959
 do and especially do not forget to fill 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.310
 all the holes at the decimal point 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:31.560
 because if you leave a little bit of 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.030
 white it will not look pretty at all 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.709
 that the trait is more aesthetic 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.689
 must then put black pencil 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.970
 in the upper mucosa so when 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.770
 is he going lower thanks to that the very 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.770
 really done and work 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.830
 to enlarge your look through the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.479
 light you can also put some 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.070
 white pencil this time bread will have 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.790
 it is inferior but in the mucous membrane 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.790
 inferior 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.369
 to finish putting together your eyelashes and put 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.369
 mascara 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 and 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.180
 if you do not like this technique I 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.950
 you propose another marc plan for 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.570
 this technique the beginning remains the same 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.350
 except that we pull the eyelid from the 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.910
 first stage 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.690
 as earlier we trace on 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.690
 black pencil sketch 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.900
 you will then need gel eyeliner 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.900
 and a beveled brush 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.990
 always pulling the eyelid just 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.620
 gently iron with the eyeliner 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.630
 I have this technique is nice for the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.610
 comma because the brush is doing all the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.140
 work we have nothing to do we need 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.480
 to pose it as if we continue and the 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.430
 hard line does it have less than your comma 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.780
 is drawn then it takes more or less 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.780
 enlarge it and fill in the holes 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.060
 as you can see the feature with 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.370
 the gel makes it possible to have an eye rather 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.520
 rounded while that with the felt 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.260
 allows to have an elongated forgiving eye 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.120
 so here it is up to you to choose your 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.680
 technique if you have a man rather 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.900
 round and you want the loin and 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.610
 choose the felt while if you 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.620
 have a rake August small you 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.730
 do you want art? 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.730
 not to use two genes 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.360
 here are the girls I hope this 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.130
 tutorial will have helped you and I apologize 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.570
 for the sound I recorded with 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.460
 the computer I know it's not 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.169
 nice but I did as I could 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.270
 I'm trying to stay serious enough to 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.830
 for this tutorial I hope you'll have 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.780
 well understood my explanations is that 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.080
 now it would be for you a game 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.080
 baby 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.610
 I now make you huge standards 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.940
 kiss and I tell you next time 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.940
 ciao
