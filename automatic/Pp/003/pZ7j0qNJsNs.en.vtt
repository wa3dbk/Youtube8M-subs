00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.320
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.500
 new video of el pais on saturday 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.900
 this time it goes on the starcraft 2 and and 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.090
 Although a very special motto 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.189
 this mod ice dick battlefield and 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.470
 allows you to play a role in one 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.359
 to hatch starcraft 2 unit and 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.590
 Although a cert person and first person 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:30.859
 the whole thing works well with pilot 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.760
 So of weapons a life number one 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:37.489
 level up yes and it is up to four 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.159
 Player of genre action actually has 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:45.650
 a very good rating and I show 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:48.470
 you once the gameplay so there we are 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.479
 again in the game 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.100
 this is the game that's like 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.210
 said it a big field of play 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.930
 actually just about the units like that 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.970
 test 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.979
 the units will automatically run on the 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.879
 opponents and the opponent sports too 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.799
 these units 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.200
 you can look at the individual units 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:09.829
 take and then when you picture up 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.710
 So press up image you go into the 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:17.299
 cirque person mode that's one more 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.850
 a bit packed you're almost the same 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:27.469
 with who is the man but only with dsds 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:30.969
 it works like this if you keep z pressed 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.630
 you can in the menu the purely the 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.469
 Special skills of the units 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.439
 activate 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.619
 So press and hold the mouse pointer 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.590
 you can take the special one 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.509
 skills eg a dig up 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.039
 and activate 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.770
 just ok so that the first man has 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.479
 So you have certain weapons since this 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.130
 how can you attack quite often 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.609
 Insert a row is mostly 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.950
 the units cafÃ© cc nonsense the 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:03.920
 ammo capacity at 20 and it does 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.920
 After that an autopilot takes about 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.149
 23 seconds 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.369
 if you hold shift you can 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.530
 also as you can see below right 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.720
 Sprint for a while that it 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.819
 Also very good and with the space bar you can 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.549
 jump 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.219
 Do you want to go to the first person? 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:27.730
 one presses but that is still one 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:29.439
 Bit packed if you go again 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.260
 in the normal starcraft mode 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:35.859
 Change then you just press picture 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.420
 down there you can completely here 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.939
 Just move that way you can with it 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.739
 every young unit can and can do it 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.139
 then also on the if it sounds then 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.930
 the damage and so is already relative 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:49.659
 cool and there is still a second 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.870
 Variant of this big battlefield and the 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:55.180
 I show you now so that is here 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.319
 the second variant of pick battlefield 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.159
 this is a bit different 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:03.340
 you only have three players maximum and 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.019
 On both sides you have ks 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.930
 but you can build independently 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.939
 also help with the tree and this 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.000
 make my door fast faster 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:19.480
 infinite minerals all three races 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:23.220
 one also has such ships work as folk 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.979
 and they can, for example, if the 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.479
 opponents can come here to these 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:31.319
 protected tower flamethrower and the 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.319
 to build rockets 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.590
 that's he lays down to the base and here 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.569
 you can also see that independently 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.629
 builds and sends units and 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.129
 Minerals supply makes upgraded and 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:50.290
 Here it is the same cover weltbild 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:52.689
 Hochrhein 20 from the first person mode 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.840
 and there you can with picture below again 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:58.359
 go out something else 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.090
 it has improved the graphics and it 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.819
 less lex is the only one of that 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.790
 The only thing that can go long is if you can 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.540
 it turns around in the field of vision that it is 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.769
 bit licking but that will be determined 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.639
 fixed so you can also choir 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.109
 play 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:25.470
 this mode is a bit heavier 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:29.470
 but yes that 's actually there this mod 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.630
 in total and you can do it 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.670
 Try it is funny too 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.660
 cool to play with friends together 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:39.430
 and that would say that is the end of the 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.860
 I forgot to subscribe to videos 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.930
 comment and liken not stop the 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.930
 he says again in 243
