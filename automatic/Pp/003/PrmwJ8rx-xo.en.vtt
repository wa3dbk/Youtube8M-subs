motor I'm going to show you exactly how

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.510 
motor I'm going to show you exactly how
this<00:00:28.500> works<00:00:28.769> now<00:00:30.560> in<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.740> chest<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.309> have

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
this works now in this chest we have

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.490 
this works now in this chest we have
three<00:00:33.030> different<00:00:33.300> type<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.630> rail<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
three different type of rail we have the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.470 
three different type of rail we have the
power<00:00:34.920> rail<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.910> activator<00:00:39.480> rail<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:41.480> detect

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
power rail the activator rail and detect

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.540 
power rail the activator rail and detect
the<00:00:42.629> rail<00:00:42.840> now<00:00:43.469> trust<00:00:43.829> me<00:00:43.920> guys<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the rail now trust me guys this is a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.400 
the rail now trust me guys this is a
real<00:00:44.850> pain<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> make<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.899> survival<00:00:46.379> mode

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
real pain to make in survival mode

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.529 
real pain to make in survival mode
because<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.160> takes<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.520> much<00:00:47.640> resources<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.390> do

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
because it takes so much resources to do

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:48.950 
because it takes so much resources to do
so

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
so

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.200

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.360 
little box area right here I'm going to
activate<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> lever<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.829> you'll<00:00:56.010> notice<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.529 
activate the lever and you'll notice the
pistons<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.210> back<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
pistons are going to be going back and

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.420 
pistons are going to be going back and

forth rapidly now all you have to
replace<00:00:59.730> one<00:01:00.649> rail<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.399> location<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
replace one rail on that location and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.660 
replace one rail on that location and
trust<00:01:03.629> me<00:01:03.750> you're<00:01:03.870> gonna<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.640> double<00:01:05.640> the

trust me you're gonna get double the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.510 
trust me you're gonna get double the
amount<00:01:05.930> every<00:01:06.930> time<00:01:09.439> look<00:01:10.439> at<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.950> all

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
amount every time look at that and all

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.039 
amount every time look at that and all
I'm<00:01:11.670> doing<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.060> placing<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.659> right<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.930> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
I'm doing is placing and right on that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.070 
I'm doing is placing and right on that
block<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.650> getting<00:01:13.979> twice<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.610> much<00:01:15.080> every

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
block and getting twice as much every

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.929 
block and getting twice as much every
single<00:01:16.439> time<00:01:18.500> which<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.650> perfect<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:20.850> you

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
single time which is perfect and all you

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.640 
single time which is perfect and all you
have<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> do<00:01:21.330> really<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.750> stay<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.380> block

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
have to do really is stay on that block

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.940 
have to do really is stay on that block
that<00:01:22.979> I'm<00:01:23.640> placing<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.950> just

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
that I'm placing it on and just

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 
that I'm placing it on and just
constantly<00:01:26.549> repeat<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> same<00:01:27.390> exact<00:01:27.780> process

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
constantly repeat the same exact process

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.480 
constantly repeat the same exact process
because<00:01:28.350> every<00:01:28.560> time<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.860> place<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> rail

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
because every time you place a rail

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.730 
because every time you place a rail
right<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.329> location<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:31.590> will

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
right there in that location you will

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.179 
right there in that location you will
always<00:01:31.979> get<00:01:32.400> two<00:01:32.880> back<00:01:34.100> which<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.250> perfect<00:01:37.189> now

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
always get two back which is perfect now

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.710 
always get two back which is perfect now
the<00:01:38.250> cool<00:01:38.490> thing<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.790> also<00:01:39.060> realized<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.659> is

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the cool thing is I also realized so is

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.140 
the cool thing is I also realized so is
also<00:01:40.079> an<00:01:40.200> update<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> PlayStation<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the Xbox so I tested it out on both

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.840 
the Xbox so I tested it out on both
consoles<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.740> know<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> see<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.520> update

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
consoles you know to see that the update

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.270 
consoles you know to see that the update
would<00:01:47.909> affect<00:01:48.270> anything<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.040> trust<00:01:50.040> me<00:01:50.130> guys

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
would affect anything and trust me guys

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.460 
would affect anything and trust me guys
it<00:01:50.520> works<00:01:50.729> perfectly<00:01:51.630> fine<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.200> shouldn't

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
it works perfectly fine you shouldn't

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.389 
it works perfectly fine you shouldn't
have<00:01:52.560> any<00:01:52.829> issues<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.710> know<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.009> tell<00:01:56.219> for

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
have any issues so you know to tell for

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670 
have any issues so you know to tell for
that<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.119> also<00:01:57.930> been<00:01:58.229> playing<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
that and I also been playing the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.889 
that and I also been playing the
survival<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> little<00:01:59.490> more<00:01:59.640> than<00:01:59.729> usual<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.450> I

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
survival a little more than usual and I

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.469 
survival a little more than usual and I
also<00:02:01.049> realize<00:02:01.649> how<00:02:02.040> difficult<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.149> get

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
also realize how difficult it is to get

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.929 
also realize how difficult it is to get
a<00:02:03.540> large<00:02:03.869> amount<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.259> rails<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.909> survival<00:02:05.909> mode

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
a large amount of rails in survival mode

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.180 
a large amount of rails in survival mode
because<00:02:06.360> as<00:02:06.479> such<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.439> takes<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.979> much

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
because as such it takes so much

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.670 
because as such it takes so much
resources<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:10.259> make<00:02:10.410> these<00:02:10.619> kind<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.950> rails

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
resources to make these kind of rails
