00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.519
 Hello everyone, today we fly to the very 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.340
 the world's smallest exe 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.780
 this model is x900 index and see what 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:24.080
 represents us and how they behave 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:24.080
 true cost volume 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.160
 windiness on the street today is required 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.160
 small bonus 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:47.159
 We look like a couple of holes in the mind rotates 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:47.159
 speed will of course be blown and and 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.370
 check rubber again 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.850
 drifting in the wind look good 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.850
 closer 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.400
 check the maximum gas 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.390
 once again the most bastard 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.570
 normal lifting speed of course i 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.060
 I thought that it would be more powerful than cx10 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.160
 but still the extra 2 motors 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.630
 additional battery load 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.400
 here is a full 180 milliamp hour and 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.240
 flight time standard five minutes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.240
 check clips 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.719
 clips run at third expense 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.479
 just by sticking either side 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.549
 so keep this in mind if you're on 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.090
 third costs are smooth discounts 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:11.950
 move it normally flies shaking 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:17.170
 engine stick produced flip leads 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.160
 yourself in the air is great even with such 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.560
 windy weather 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:29.319
 fly is a pleasure to switch 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.880
 costs double or even 1 1 and 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.069
 costs screwed check speed 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.940
 rotation of the equipment is very small 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.500
 speed sold 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.599
 the wind suffered from me brought you back 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.819
 consumption and check the maximum gas 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:49.019
 back and forth top speed forward I can 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:53.650
 the maximum speed is quickly updated back 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:56.850
 very well, well, of course, a beginner 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.970
 so he can't fly on him 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.970
 train at home 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.150
 hexa cool behaves normally in 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.150
 the air is of course a bit unaccustomed to what 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.440
 he has six engines but his orientation is 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.580
 the parties produced using 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.800
 LEDs 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.000
 from all sides she has blue LEDs on 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.510
 each motor except two LEDs 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.460
 installed on the front two engines 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.520
 actually on them and it is made 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.580
 orientation when you move away on 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.580
 short distance 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.880
 I will finish the battery to the end 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.250
 check the flight time is excellent yourself 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.260
 leads the air 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.840
 cost in my area 18 dollars 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.210
 smallest smallest 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.000
 hexacopter in the world we are the most like 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.560
 Cheap soon think will 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.070
 commercially available and some other 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.070
 models from different manufacturers top 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.859
 let's continue 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:16.169
 after the clip did not have enough pull 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:19.250
 continue to look for flight time on 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:22.470
 This moment already has about 4 minutes and 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.610
 Rod still has a husband, I feel that 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.430
 she is not like that when you start 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.669
 try to fly further range 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.100
 hole meters 10 I flew away now 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.440
 I think she is more distance 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.830
 this model is probably meaningless 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.900
 clicking 20 meters is very large 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.780
 distance for what size 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.710
 already simply not visible although the principle if 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.710
 you do not twist ruder while flying 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.650
 braid and for a greater distance 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.180
 LEDs don't blink yet 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.900
 fly forward back to maximum 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.789
 speeds 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.789
 meters 20 flew back 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.789
 maximum speed 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.900
 very well behaved the air is great 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.500
 aircraft wanted to say 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:19.250
 quadrocopter but this is no longer quadrocopter 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.430
 so I won't call him that 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.930
 us hexakopter six motor octacopter 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.630
 This is when the 8th round 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.260
 Well, while the budget oktokopter on sale 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:37.449
 no so the LEDs blinked when 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:37.449
 falls all rights to apply 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:47.000
 such a gleb and today he showed it 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.090
 index x 900 flight time 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.490
 five minutes forty all about seconds 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.400
 feel good in the air 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.810
 even with a slight wind 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.330
 coping with the management of this baby 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.340
 Normally definitely advise this 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.520
 buy stuff at least something 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.180
 new unusual cool design well 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.939
 fly 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.240
 it is clear that the battery is not removable 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:13.430
 capacity 180 there is a switch and 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.979
 charge this hexa using such 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.620
 a round connector 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.810
 I advise taking this hex 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.689
 powerbank any self cheap for 23 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.509
 dollars for 2 200 milliampere hour on one 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:28.789
 cast 1850 battery and then 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:30.919
 flight time five minutes after that 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.080
 put a bank of minutes on a charger 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:35.360
 by twenty and fly again and five minutes 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.740
 such is the model and today you showed 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.000
 Thank you all for subscribing 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.000
 on the channel all bye
