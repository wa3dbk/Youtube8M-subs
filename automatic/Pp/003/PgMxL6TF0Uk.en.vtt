00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
change course here because we normally

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.480 
change course here because we normally
start<00:00:13.320> off<00:00:13.500> with<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.650> GFS<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.309> give<00:00:14.400> an

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.390 
start off with the GFS and give an
overview<00:00:14.759> but<00:00:15.260> do<00:00:16.260> believe<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> GFS<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.130> lost

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
overview but do believe the GFS is lost

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.040 
overview but do believe the GFS is lost
right<00:00:17.670> now<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.060> we're<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.359> go<00:00:18.390> start

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
starting off the name here and we're

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.400 
starting off the name here and we're
gonna<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> system<00:00:36.840> building<00:00:37.110> across<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
gonna have a system building across the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.569 
gonna have a system building across the
south<00:00:37.739> here<00:00:38.010> now<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.340> surface

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
south here now this is the surface

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.819 
south here now this is the surface
reflection<00:00:39.239> normally<00:00:40.140> what<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> meteorologist

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
reflection normally what a meteorologist

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.770 
reflection normally what a meteorologist
looks<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.190> looks<00:00:41.430> at<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.090> upper<00:00:42.660> air

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
looks like looks at is the upper air

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.330 
looks like looks at is the upper air
patterns<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> upper<00:00:43.800> air<00:00:43.920> patterns<00:00:44.250> are

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
patterns and the upper air patterns are

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.250 
patterns and the upper air patterns are
very<00:00:44.520> favorable<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> name<00:00:46.079> is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
very favorable with the what the name is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.450 
very favorable with the what the name is
showing<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.770> even<00:00:46.980> though<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.190> at<00:00:47.280> max

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
showing here even though it's at max

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.709 
showing here even though it's at max
range<00:00:47.760> here<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.210> we're<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> move<00:00:48.600> ahead

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
range here so we're going to move ahead

forward<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:55.739> watch<00:00:55.920> how<00:00:56.070> this

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
forward here and as watch how this

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.760 
forward here and as watch how this
evolves<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:57.539> trough<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.050> such<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.500> turns

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
evolves the trough is such that it turns

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.580 
evolves the trough is such that it turns
negative<00:00:59.010> tilt<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.300> sends<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.780> system

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
negative tilt and it sends this system

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.060 
negative tilt and it sends this system
here<00:01:01.829> up<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.550> coast<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.329> bombs<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.899> out

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
here up the coast and just bombs it out

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.620 
here up the coast and just bombs it out
right<00:01:05.070> right<00:01:05.549> near<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> Delmarva<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.540> we're

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
right right near the Delmarva and we're

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.469 
right right near the Delmarva and we're
going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.780> stop<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> right<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
going to stop it right here you have a

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.910 
going to stop it right here you have a
996<00:01:09.479> millibar<00:01:09.930> low<00:01:10.110> sitting<00:01:10.500> right<00:01:10.710> about

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
996 millibar low sitting right about

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.480 
996 millibar low sitting right about
here<00:01:11.900> just<00:01:12.900> raped<00:01:13.170> right<00:01:13.710> south<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.159> Cape<00:01:14.310> May

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
here just raped right south of Cape May

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.580 
here just raped right south of Cape May
here<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.060> does<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> mean<00:01:15.590> probably

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
here so what does that mean probably

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.450 
here so what does that mean probably
means<00:01:16.740> we're<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.130> some<00:01:17.310> issues

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
means we're going to have some issues

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.210 
means we're going to have some issues
with<00:01:17.750> south<00:01:18.750> east<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.080> i-95<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:19.950> kind<00:01:20.159> of

or amp things a little bit so we'll just

yet however we're going to go to the
European<00:02:22.530> model<00:02:22.800> now<00:02:22.950> pretty<00:02:23.849> much<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.150> same

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
European model now pretty much the same

idea<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.720> little<00:02:24.930> bit<00:02:25.020> further<00:02:25.260> east<00:02:25.560> with<00:02:25.830> this

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
idea a little bit further east with this

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.290 
idea a little bit further east with this
the<00:02:26.190> track<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.640> actually<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> little<00:02:27.090> bit

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
the track is actually a little bit

the track is actually a little bit
further<00:02:27.510> east<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.930> offshore<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.680> therefore

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
further east and offshore and therefore

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.100 
further east and offshore and therefore
the<00:02:29.580> heaviest<00:02:29.849> snows<00:02:30.150> are<00:02:30.360> confined<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.930> little

the heaviest snows are confined a little

the heaviest snows are confined a little
bit<00:02:31.200> further<00:02:31.319> south<00:02:31.650> east<00:02:31.950> now<00:02:32.130> southeast<00:02:32.670> PA

into central and southern New Jersey

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.860 
into central and southern New Jersey
because<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:35.670> taking<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.060> more<00:02:36.239> East<00:02:36.450> track

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
because it's taking a more East track

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.770 
because it's taking a more East track
the<00:02:37.650> trend<00:02:37.950> has<00:02:38.010> been<00:02:38.099> tipid<00:02:38.730> has<00:02:39.209> been<00:02:39.510> to

the trend has been tipid has been to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.360 
the trend has been tipid has been to
shift<00:02:40.019> everything<00:02:40.290> Northwest<00:02:40.920> we'd<00:02:41.250> be

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
shift everything Northwest we'd be

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.699 
shift everything Northwest we'd be
looking<00:02:41.489> at<00:02:41.730> recently<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:42.510> does<00:02:43.440> not<00:02:43.620> look

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
the Canadian this is the last one that

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.340 
the Canadian this is the last one that
really<00:03:35.459> got<00:03:35.579> things<00:03:35.819> amped<00:03:36.209> up<00:03:36.299> here<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.720> this

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
really got things amped up here and this

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.059 
really got things amped up here and this
is<00:03:37.590> incredible<00:03:39.019> 966<00:03:40.019> millibars<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.739> showing

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
is incredible 966 millibars is showing

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.440 
is incredible 966 millibars is showing
off<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.340> coast<00:03:41.579> of<00:03:41.700> New<00:03:41.850> Jersey<00:03:42.180> or<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.359> little

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
off the coast of New Jersey or a little

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.319 
off the coast of New Jersey or a little
bit<00:03:42.630> too<00:03:42.750> far<00:03:42.959> east<00:03:43.519> but<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.060> same

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
bit too far east but this is the same

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.629 
bit too far east but this is the same
central<00:03:46.109> pressure<00:03:46.319> that<00:03:46.620> hurricane<00:03:47.100> sandy

central pressure that hurricane sandy

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.400 
central pressure that hurricane sandy
was<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:48.060> if<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:48.299> was<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.959> was<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.380> come

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
was so if this was so that was to come

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.970 
was so if this was so that was to come
true<00:03:49.950> which<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.519> highly<00:03:50.940> doubt<00:03:51.799> highly<00:03:52.799> doubt

true which I highly doubt highly doubt
the<00:03:53.130> solution<00:03:53.609> we've<00:03:54.060> been<00:03:54.120> having<00:03:54.359> some

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
the solution we've been having some

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.180 
the solution we've been having some
serious<00:03:54.660> problems<00:03:54.870> here<00:03:55.410> in<00:03:55.500> New<00:03:55.590> Jersey<00:03:55.980> but

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
serious problems here in New Jersey but

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.949 
serious problems here in New Jersey but
again<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.060> contains<00:03:57.329> a<00:03:57.389> little<00:03:57.540> bit<00:03:57.660> too<00:03:57.750> far

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
again it contains a little bit too far

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.170 
again it contains a little bit too far
east<00:03:58.230> still<00:03:58.920> gives<00:03:59.100> good<00:03:59.280> decent<00:03:59.519> snow<00:03:59.790> is<00:04:00.060> all

way back from eastern PA eastward but

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.340 
way back from eastern PA eastward but
you<00:04:02.910> see<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.239> very<00:04:03.450> short<00:04:03.780> cut<00:04:03.989> off<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.260> the

you see the very short cut off to the

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.509 
you see the very short cut off to the
west<00:04:04.560> here<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:04.950> that's<00:04:05.069> pretty<00:04:05.190> indicative

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
west here and that's pretty indicative

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.030 
west here and that's pretty indicative
on<00:04:05.819> it<00:04:05.970> on<00:04:06.450> all<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.840> models<00:04:07.260> Iran<00:04:07.560> today<00:04:07.709> is

on it on all the models Iran today is
there<00:04:08.489> going<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:08.639> be<00:04:08.700> with<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.030> wrapped-up

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
there going to be with a wrapped-up

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.420 
there going to be with a wrapped-up
system<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:10.019> pretty<00:04:10.230> sharp<00:04:10.440> gradient<00:04:10.889> cut<00:04:11.250> off

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
system a pretty sharp gradient cut off

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.039 
system a pretty sharp gradient cut off
to<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.670> west<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.090> where<00:04:12.239> that<00:04:12.389> sets<00:04:12.630> up<00:04:12.840> and

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
to the west and where that sets up and

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.050 
to the west and where that sets up and
where<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:13.620> track<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.220> is<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.880> going<00:04:15.000> to

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
where this track is is it going to

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.779 
where this track is is it going to
determine<00:04:15.239> who<00:04:15.480> gets<00:04:15.630> snow<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.139> who<00:04:16.229> doesn't

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
determine who gets snow and who doesn't

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.479 
determine who gets snow and who doesn't
right<00:04:17.789> now<00:04:17.940> our<00:04:17.970> best<00:04:18.419> idea<00:04:19.139> is<00:04:19.470> probably<00:04:20.220> for

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
right now our best idea is probably for

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.130 
right now our best idea is probably for
a<00:04:20.519> system<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.330> come<00:04:21.479> over<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.900> eastern

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
a system to come over to the eastern

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.110 
a system to come over to the eastern
North<00:04:22.349> Carolina<00:04:22.409> and<00:04:23.130> come<00:04:23.580> up<00:04:23.669> here<00:04:23.849> north

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
North Carolina and come up here north

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.020 
North Carolina and come up here north
north<00:04:24.360> near<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.840> Delmarva<00:04:25.349> but<00:04:25.500> probably

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
north near the Delmarva but probably

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.730 
north near the Delmarva but probably
just<00:04:26.150> east<00:04:26.389> of<00:04:26.480> New<00:04:26.600> Jersey<00:04:26.660> which<00:04:27.590> will

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
just east of New Jersey which will

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.680 
just east of New Jersey which will
present<00:04:28.070> some<00:04:28.100> mixing<00:04:28.880> issues<00:04:29.210> from<00:04:29.480> this

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
present some mixing issues from this

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.020 
present some mixing issues from this
area<00:04:30.080> southeast<00:04:30.650> and<00:04:31.010> I<00:04:31.160> think<00:04:31.220> southern<00:04:31.850> New

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
area southeast and I think southern New

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.340 
area southeast and I think southern New
Jersey<00:04:32.060> you're<00:04:32.480> not<00:04:32.600> looking<00:04:32.930> at<00:04:33.080> anything

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
Jersey you're not looking at anything

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.620 
Jersey you're not looking at anything
for<00:04:34.250> significant<00:04:34.820> snow<00:04:35.000> right<00:04:35.240> now<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:35.540> I

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
for significant snow right now and I

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.510 
for significant snow right now and I
think<00:04:35.660> your<00:04:35.960> big<00:04:36.139> area<00:04:36.530> for<00:04:36.770> snow<00:04:37.070> is<00:04:37.100> going<00:04:37.430> to

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
think your big area for snow is going to

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.700 
think your big area for snow is going to
be<00:04:37.610> up<00:04:37.700> in<00:04:37.850> this<00:04:37.940> area<00:04:38.120> right<00:04:38.419> here<00:04:38.480> but<00:04:38.960> again

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
be up in this area right here but again

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.960 
be up in this area right here but again
we're<00:04:39.860> going<00:04:39.950> to<00:04:40.040> narrow<00:04:40.190> this<00:04:40.340> down<00:04:40.400> here<00:04:40.880> in

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
we're going to narrow this down here in

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.250 
we're going to narrow this down here in
the<00:04:41.030> next<00:04:41.120> couple<00:04:41.330> days<00:04:41.600> here<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.050> hopefully

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
the next couple days here and hopefully

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.040 
the next couple days here and hopefully
get<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.820> very<00:04:43.820> nice<00:04:44.030> final<00:04:44.480> solution<00:04:44.900> here

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
coast like this is taken it and

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.120 
coast like this is taken it and
following<00:05:20.720> it<00:05:20.810> this<00:05:21.020> way<00:05:21.200> towards<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.740> area

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
following it this way towards the area

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.770 
following it this way towards the area
of<00:05:22.190> greatest<00:05:22.430> convection<00:05:23.060> that<00:05:23.630> is

course would take this well offshore it

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.600 
course would take this well offshore it
is<00:05:33.350> the<00:05:33.470> only<00:05:33.590> model<00:05:34.010> showing<00:05:34.220> that<00:05:34.460> at<00:05:34.550> the

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
is the only model showing that at the

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.070 
is the only model showing that at the
moment<00:05:34.729> so<00:05:35.030> i<00:05:35.060> would<00:05:35.330> not<00:05:35.479> bank<00:05:35.810> on<00:05:35.960> this

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
Carolina take a track up like this very

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.920
