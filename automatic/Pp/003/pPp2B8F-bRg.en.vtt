00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:04.040
 almost weekly but due to the cold winter they visit him less often 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.110
 organist at the helm send us a church in scheemda 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.570
 it is a second home a steep stair foot to the first floor it 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.570
 mecca for the organist 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.219
 the 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.589
 r she will have many different sounds 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.889
 and with a few shakes there you are actually a whole orchestra problem 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.640
 for me that is actually the current organ from the nineteenth 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.120
 century 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.250
 but the original organ from 15 26 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.320
 that is the property of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.530
 a group of activists reynders break dutch to top pieces off 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.320
 Amsterdam to get back in the church in Scheemda 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.620
 the national museum the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.510
 she has our, it is also official that in principle she wanted to cooperate 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.930
 because great achievement from being the netherlands to bring it back again 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.670
 ship 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.260
 last week it has a great location off to a depot of it 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.890
 national museum in this city 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.890
 but the 500 year old organ has been saved 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.190
 according to the chairman, everything must be put in every place to the showpiece again 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.970
 to get to its old place in the church that is good for the church and tourism 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.990
 This has been a very small area to everything that is never very expensive 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.640
 organ can afford 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.560
 I think I am back again when the weather is nice 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.630
 a 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.930
 the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.320
 special is of course 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.170
 Catholic Church was originally from this point on 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.979
 but that 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.030
 now it's up to three times for a merger with madonna van scheemda 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.450
 and the permanent organist look forward to the moment the monumental organ 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.960
 restored and each other for three hundred years who comes home 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.299
 you got it right 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.939
 That just sounds right for the church though it was and singer would 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.990
 have to think 10 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.149
 the the year award
