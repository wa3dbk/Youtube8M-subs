00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.110 

Regan's<00:00:36.130> has<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.460> be<00:00:36.580> one<00:00:36.760> of<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:36.910> most

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
Regan's has to be one of the most

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.270 
Regan's has to be one of the most

obvious calls in the book matter what

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.460 
obvious calls in the book matter what

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.799 

I<00:00:45.010> hope<00:00:45.609> that<00:00:45.850> was<00:00:46.000> worth<00:00:46.179> the<00:00:46.359> two<00:00:46.539> minutes

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
I hope that was worth the two minutes

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.360 
I hope that was worth the two minutes
because<00:00:46.960> that's<00:00:47.350> what<00:00:47.649> he's<00:00:47.769> getting

to<00:00:59.220> square<00:00:59.550> off

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.999 

to<00:01:19.020> compounded

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:47.950

that was a heckuva fight a real close

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.810 
that was a heckuva fight a real close
encounter<00:01:51.290> I<00:01:51.500> think<00:01:51.950> he<00:01:52.010> pulled<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.400> off<00:01:52.520> down

the<00:01:53.000> stretch

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950

us on that save and I was a great one
that's<00:02:12.770> for<00:02:13.010> sure<00:02:13.270> Cola<00:02:14.270> really<00:02:15.020> jumps<00:02:15.380> into

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
that's for sure Cola really jumps into

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.840 
that's for sure Cola really jumps into
the<00:02:15.590> play<00:02:15.830> well<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.250> haven't<00:02:16.400> seen<00:02:16.610> him<00:02:16.700> get

caught pinching yet wrist shot but he

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.550 
caught pinching yet wrist shot but he
was<00:02:19.430> all<00:02:19.580> over<00:02:19.880> he<00:02:20.180> really<00:02:20.690> saw<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:20.990> puck<00:02:21.320> well

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560

was all over he really saw the puck well
that<00:02:21.830> time<00:02:22.100> save<00:02:22.459> while<00:02:22.790> he<00:02:22.940> saw<00:02:23.209> that<00:02:23.480> one<00:02:23.690> all

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:35.320 
that time save while he saw that one all
the<00:02:23.990> way

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.660 

a<00:02:38.200> short-handed<00:02:39.200> goal<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.860> such<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.190> major

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
a short-handed goal in such a major

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:50.180 
a short-handed goal in such a major
boost<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.330> your<00:02:41.600> team

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.860 

this<00:02:50.880> guy<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.300> be<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.630> dangerous

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
this guy can be so dangerous

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.930 
this guy can be so dangerous
short-handed<00:02:52.860> because<00:02:52.950> he<00:02:53.250> only<00:02:53.400> needs<00:02:53.670> one

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
short-handed because he only needs one

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.760 
short-handed because he only needs one
chance<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.480> make<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.750> big<00:02:54.930> play<00:02:55.200> he

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
chance to make the big play he

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.170 
chance to make the big play he
definitely<00:02:56.250> makes<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.640> most<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:57.060> his

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
definitely makes the most of his

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:07.449 
definitely makes the most of his
opportunities

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.250 

pinpoint<00:03:08.459> accuracy<00:03:08.910> at<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.209> first<00:03:09.420> shot<00:03:09.629> what

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
pinpoint accuracy at the first shot what

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.670 
pinpoint accuracy at the first shot what
a<00:03:10.290> goal

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.640 

and<00:03:15.680> no<00:03:15.980> he's<00:03:16.719> when<00:03:17.719> he's<00:03:17.870> coming<00:03:18.230> down<00:03:18.319> on<00:03:18.560> the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
and no he's when he's coming down on the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.979 
and no he's when he's coming down on the
goalie<00:03:18.859> he<00:03:19.159> can<00:03:19.310> do<00:03:19.489> so<00:03:19.879> many<00:03:20.180> things<00:03:20.269> all

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
goalie he can do so many things all

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.630 
goalie he can do so many things all
because<00:03:21.409> of<00:03:21.439> that<00:03:21.560> wickedness<00:03:22.250> or

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.790 

but<00:03:24.910> it's<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.180> start<00:03:25.510> here<00:03:25.750> in<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.930> second

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
but it's a start here in the second

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.770 
but it's a start here in the second
I<00:03:27.860> think<00:03:28.460> he<00:03:28.580> knew<00:03:28.730> exactly<00:03:29.180> what<00:03:29.510> he<00:03:29.630> wanted

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
I think he knew exactly what he wanted

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.390 
I think he knew exactly what he wanted
to<00:03:29.990> do<00:03:30.140> with<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.410> puck<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.830> second<00:03:31.340> he

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
to do with that puck the second he

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.670 
to do with that puck the second he
picked<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:31.730> up<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:32.270> was<00:03:32.570> executed<00:03:33.110> to

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
picked it up it was executed to

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:43.460 
picked it up it was executed to
perfection

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:53.390 

because<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.620> witness

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.059
