00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 after what clearly not anthropologist 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.220
 I distinguish a woman of approximately 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.630
 twenty or thirty true years in a 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.139
 health of with a pretty condition 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.900
 athletic well-cared for chrono and next 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.990
 He does not want long years 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.020
 said his son because by the proportion 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.990
 that had just barely a third of the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.029
 body of the woman but a series of 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.429
 things that against said that this does not 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.769
 it can be a child maybe it's a man 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.180
 misshapen and start investigating 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.230
 investigate more deeply they said 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.320
 ladies and gentlemen it seems that this 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.190
 first test in the maxilla can be 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.190
 see the following 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.760
 and look does not advance a little bit the first 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.130
 in telemax and the many thanks to 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.170
 maxilla of the left side of a being 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.330
 normal human needs all this 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.880
 muscular ability to be able 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.400
 reset the entire lower jaw or 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.830
 be a little if you do not 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.080
 will normally feed with with the use 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.940
 of the teeth chew the meat if 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.310
 you had as one who says a great head 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.410
 but with a very small pear where 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.780
 just use your mouth you would have a 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.480
 maxillary muscular form like that of al 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.180
 side that is the body found in 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.070
 where only it is to adjust true 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.070
 the unap was very tiny to the rest of the 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.960
 body but nothing else on the other hand like 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.550
 enter the column of our body by 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.530
 where and what brain part is very 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.970
 important next support go 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.700
 listening to more steps 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.970
 thank you very much to the left side is the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.340
 of the human being the column enters almost in 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.310
 an average state 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.530
 because you need to irrigate the information to 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.929
 a specific part of the brain where 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.210
 they are gathered most of all 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.770
 our basic functions that's why it 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.689
 says that we occupy only 10 percent 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.420
 of our other brains because the 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.610
 Stone column is almost plugged in 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.250
 basic sector that is what interests us 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.380
 to move us to think about communicating in order 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.649
 however in this other skeleton that 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.289
 is the one on the right is almost like who 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.340
 needs to occupy the whole brain is there 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.170
 a distribution there is a distribution 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.430
 equitable balanced with respect to that 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.590
 all the information through your 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.370
 spinal cord occupies the entire network 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.870
 neuronal that the brain offers you another 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.520
 part the wind what we are seeing 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.000
 previously 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.100
 the tooth they found saying this did not 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.210
 can be a child because the roots that 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.300
 they formed are from an already adult person 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.180
 already developed if it was not enough inside 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.430
 from that tooth they found two teeth 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.560
 more information waiting to grow that 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.480
 this creature unlike us 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.400
 They are passing a process teeth 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.750
 milk that then change them for these 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.510
 that are definitive others in the feet 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.910
 resonant this creature when using them 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.950
 so little curious the way you feed 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.710
 that you have would have the ability to 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.620
 change throughout his life four 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.000
 times of teeth being all of it from a 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.950
 formation as we know it with 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.810
 very deep roots waiting to come out 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.780
 it's like he does not take care of them he's killing 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.240
 the end another important thing has 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.090
 to do with the thickness of a skull 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.670
 human being and you from this creature 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.519
 the right side is a human being the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.819
 thickness of a skull of a skull is 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.560
 practically almost where a little less 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.660
 needs to resist certain blows over 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.819
 everything also even when it's in its 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.040
 been more females when it goes through the 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.720
 your mother's vagina needs to have that 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.310
 elasticity but at the same time after 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.870
 like the little boy who calls him when 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.060
 it began to be several dry 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.340
 thank the thick however the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.170
 creature you will find that it is now 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.049
 a level of thinness has a thickness 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.530
 so fragile that does not say this naturally 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.599
 could not resist anything would be if it 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.060
 a child fell playing sebastián the 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.489
 head about two by three for nothing that 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.739
 not for something that does not have any 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.079
 creature in this world that is the other 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.960
 what is it that they discovered that 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.450
 inside the skeleton 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.270
 and inside of that inside the head 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.770
 has these fibers, so it's like a 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.780
 Tailor's plate when one opens a plate 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.360
 you can not take it out like and the clear good 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.600
 notice here that they can not be 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.390
 cut easily with a victory 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.370
 has like the kind of wires that 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.710
 interweave and that while it is thin 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.510
 they make it very firm and hard this is 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.700
 like a mesh is like a mesh 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.340
 interior that makes it suspense is like 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.690
 how the cars work I would say fragile 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.270
 outside but with the entire structure 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.430
 metal that do not deform that 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.770
 keep it to protect the driver who is 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.120
 double but that always keeps the 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.760
 liver and protect the brain something 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.640
 tremendously well thought out good 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.110
 finally when they already had all the 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.940
 confused world said ladies and 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.720
 gentlemen this is not a person as is 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.220
 we know it only until 2003 they could 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.570
 achieve what is called the study 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.400
 genetic and that is when the 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.580
 proof of who is the father's son 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.620
 discovered the following what is the contribution 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.120
 of the father and what is the contribution of the 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.040
 mother in this creature because all 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.530
 they thought that the treatment they treated him and 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.020
 they said look at what we're seeing there 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.740
 down 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:16.699
 is the contribution from mother to child 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.070
 father's contribution at that time is not 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.050
 he knew what the percentage was 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.850
 only until recently and because this 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.950
 again be a news is because today 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.620
 in exempt day there is an exam that 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.050
 mitochondrial nuclear flame is worth saying 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.030
 that today the city ​​is recorded a point of 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.040
 that you can divide the level of your 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.080
 cellular structure or what I say to the 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.180
 point of saying that if you are a 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.060
 product of a father a mother we can 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.730
 say that percentages of contributions at the 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.310
 of DNA was from each one and what are the 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.860
 components of each element is something that 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.580
 discovered the following the contribution of 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.090
 the mother would be exactly this that is 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.050
 a certain extract of calcium phosphorus 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.510
 silicon another thing that block the 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.240
 body but that of the holy father was that 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.310
 what red absolutely unknown 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.040
 but you know the effective choice of data is 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.950
 that all the components that the 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.470
 father do not exist on earth what 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.600
 put different proportions those of a 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.670
 human or those of another animal but that 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.700
 all the elements that this has 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.100
 creature does not exist on this planet not 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.289
 they are classified this are here by 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.379
 first time we are putting name 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:28.819
 there has never been a conclusion not average 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:32.779
 of the scientists is that the mother 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:35.059
 must be a normal woman true 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:37.039
 proper to the well-preserved era of 

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:39.199
 a beautiful girl given the proportions 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:41.300
 this was known because of the skeleton that 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.819
 makes this process of enlargement through 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.309
 to how they had four the 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.800
 son would be more or less like that what today 

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:51.919
 we understand the skeleton is expressed then 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.899
 is the way I would have with what today 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:56.240
 day we know how a hybrid would be a 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:59.830
 creature of this feature and the 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:05.029
 father we all know 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:07.539
 the father would be something else in our 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:07.539
 hands 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:12.680
 we would have the first probably not 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.180
 have a physical contact but at 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.669
 same as today as it has 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.259
 continued making time immemorial 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:21.529
 they occupied a woman as an ovule container 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:23.629
 to insert one would come an embryo of 

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:25.279
 these extraterrestrial for this race that 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:27.050
 they have always been searching because 

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:29.269
 we have the great secret of the 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.420
 life that all creatures that exceed 

00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:32.240
 t 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.760
 they are not touched by the divinity as 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.500
 We, as I have always said, are the 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:41.080
 imperfect and envied by this race 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.080
 damn of the treatment I said
