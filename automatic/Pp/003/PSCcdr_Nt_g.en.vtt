00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
hello tonight I'm going to do a little

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.400 
hello tonight I'm going to do a little
tutorial<00:00:04.680> about<00:00:05.100> how<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:06.180> do<00:00:06.390> MIDI<00:00:06.690> sync<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.350> a

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
tutorial about how to do MIDI sync on a

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.520 
tutorial about how to do MIDI sync on a
MPC<00:00:08.010> 1000<00:00:08.670> because<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.660> bugged<00:00:10.320> me<00:00:10.500> for

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
MPC 1000 because this is bugged me for

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.860 
MPC 1000 because this is bugged me for
about<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.950> year<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.969> never<00:00:12.150> really<00:00:12.540> figured

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
about a year and I never really figured

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.360 
about a year and I never really figured
out<00:00:12.960> how<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.139> do<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:13.740> I'm<00:00:13.830> sure<00:00:13.889> if<00:00:14.099> somebody

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
out how to do it so I'm sure if somebody

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.630 
out how to do it so I'm sure if somebody
else<00:00:15.020> doesn't<00:00:16.020> know<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.590> would<00:00:17.220> like<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.430> know

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
else doesn't know and would like to know

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.040 
else doesn't know and would like to know
so<00:00:18.560> basically<00:00:19.560> what<00:00:19.770> MIDI<00:00:19.920> sync<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.240> you

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
so basically what MIDI sync is is you

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.470 
so basically what MIDI sync is is you
hook<00:00:22.199> up<00:00:22.320> other<00:00:22.500> instruments<00:00:23.160> via<00:00:23.939> MIDI<00:00:24.210> and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
hook up other instruments via MIDI and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.410 
hook up other instruments via MIDI and
then<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.680> program<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> NBC<00:00:26.820> what<00:00:27.269> you

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
then you program on the NBC what you

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.640 
then you program on the NBC what you
want<00:00:27.599> them<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.810> play<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.230> it'll<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.500> like<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
want them to play and it'll be like a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.999 
want them to play and it'll be like a
player<00:00:28.920> piano<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.990> you<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.140> get<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.529> bunch<00:00:31.890> of

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
player piano so you can get a bunch of

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.799 
player piano so you can get a bunch of
different<00:00:32.279> instruments<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.850> at<00:00:33.000> once<00:00:33.210> so

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
different instruments going at once so

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.389 
different instruments going at once so
you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> full<00:00:34.710> band<00:00:34.920> with<00:00:35.190> just

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
you can have like a full band with just

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.760 
you can have like a full band with just
one<00:00:35.520> person<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.059> pretty<00:00:36.210> cool<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:39.500> what<00:00:40.500> we're

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
one person is pretty cool so what we're

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.770 
one person is pretty cool so what we're
going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> start<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.420> got<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.629> plug

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
going to start with is you got to plug

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.720 
going to start with is you got to plug
everything<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.890> back<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.370> know<00:00:44.460> it's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
everything in so back here I know it's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.420 
everything in so back here I know it's
kind<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> hard<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:45.989> even<00:00:46.110> read<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.559> but

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
kind of hard if you can even read it but

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.090 
kind of hard if you can even read it but
this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> midians<00:00:48.360> MIDI<00:00:49.140> outs<00:00:49.410> MIDI<00:00:49.950> in

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
this is the midians MIDI outs MIDI in

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.689 
this is the midians MIDI outs MIDI in
you<00:00:50.250> got<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.760> two<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.690> B<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.710> use

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
you got one and two out a and B so use

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.930 
you got one and two out a and B so use
their<00:00:53.820> own<00:00:53.940> guy<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:55.280> for<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> 1a<00:00:56.550> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
their own guy here for for the 1a and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
their own guy here for for the 1a and
then<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> mofo<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
then the mofo for the to be so then the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.750 
then the mofo for the to be so then the
1a<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> Theia

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
1a you do the Theia

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
1a you do the Theia
in<00:01:03.030> from<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> MPC<00:01:04.400> plug<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.519> into<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:07.049> out<00:01:07.260> on

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
in from the MPC plug it into the out on

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.690 
in from the MPC plug it into the out on
the<00:01:09.170> instrument<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.290> then<00:01:10.740> vice<00:01:10.950> versa<00:01:11.100> in

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the instrument and then vice versa in

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.429 
the instrument and then vice versa in
from<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> instrument<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.960> out<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
from the instrument to the out on the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.130 
from the instrument to the out on the
MPC<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.250> do<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> same<00:01:15.390> thing<00:01:15.689> with<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> two

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
MPC and do the same thing with the two

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.120 
MPC and do the same thing with the two
and<00:01:16.320> B<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:18.470> for<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.150> mofo<00:01:21.770> now<00:01:22.770> once<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> get

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and B for for the mofo now once you get

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.429 
and B for for the mofo now once you get
everything<00:01:23.250> plugged<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.970> correctly<00:01:24.229> you<00:01:25.229> hit

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
everything plugged in correctly you hit

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.270 
everything plugged in correctly you hit
now<00:01:25.650> mode<00:01:26.070> right<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.560> then<00:01:28.560> MIDI<00:01:28.920> sync<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
now mode right here and then MIDI sync I

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.289 
now mode right here and then MIDI sync I
don't<00:01:32.280> know<00:01:32.369> if<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:32.970> read<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
don't know if you can really read the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.359 
don't know if you can really read the
screen<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.840> doesn't<00:01:34.110> show<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.409> too<00:01:34.590> well<00:01:34.619> but

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
screen it doesn't show up too well but

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.649 
screen it doesn't show up too well but
once<00:01:35.549> you're<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> middle<00:01:36.150> sync<00:01:36.360> screen

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
once you're in the middle sync screen

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.780 
once you're in the middle sync screen
the<00:01:37.140> top<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.530> activate<00:01:37.950> track<00:01:38.189> received

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the top one activate track received

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.090 
the top one activate track received
channel<00:01:39.180> make<00:01:39.780> sure<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.259> switched<00:01:40.590> to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
channel make sure that is switched to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.920 
channel make sure that is switched to
all<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:43.670> then<00:01:44.670> hit<00:01:44.909> main<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.540> back<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
all and then hit main to get back to the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.950 
all and then hit main to get back to the
main<00:01:46.110> screen<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.030> right<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.860> now<00:01:50.960> what's

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
main screen and right there now what's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.170 
main screen and right there now what's
cool<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.220> track<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
cool on here is the this track it's the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.460 
cool on here is the this track it's the
third<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.570> down<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.750> can't<00:01:55.079> really<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.439> it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
third one down you can't really see it

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.100 
third one down you can't really see it
too<00:01:55.560> well<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.070> there's<00:01:57.060> 99<00:01:57.420> different<00:01:57.810> tracks

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
too well but there's 99 different tracks

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.649 
too well but there's 99 different tracks
so<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.560> write<00:01:58.829> not<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.729> 99<00:02:00.119> MIDI

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
so you can write not up to 99 MIDI

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.109 
so you can write not up to 99 MIDI
sequences<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> MPC<00:02:01.920> which<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.340> pretty

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
sequences on the MPC which is pretty

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.649 
sequences on the MPC which is pretty
cool

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
cool
