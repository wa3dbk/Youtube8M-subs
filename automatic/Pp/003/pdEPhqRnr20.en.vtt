00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
to modify our mass a little bit we

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.240 
to modify our mass a little bit we
select<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.670> edge<00:03:08.760> over<00:03:08.970> here<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:10.100> little<00:03:11.100> bit

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.370 
edges we select an edge right click add
edge<00:03:29.600> we<00:03:30.600> can<00:03:30.630> add<00:03:31.110> an<00:03:31.320> edge<00:03:31.560> on<00:03:31.890> our<00:03:32.070> surface

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
edge we can add an edge on our surface

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.260 
edge we can add an edge on our surface
now<00:03:34.380> we<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.650> divided<00:03:35.280> our<00:03:35.400> surface<00:03:35.940> we<00:03:36.150> have

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
now we have divided our surface we have

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.690 
now we have divided our surface we have
here<00:03:36.600> more<00:03:36.930> points<00:03:37.380> our<00:03:37.680> mass<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.250> what<00:03:38.580> is

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
here more points our mass and what is

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.400 
here more points our mass and what is
really<00:03:39.000> important<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.510> can<00:03:39.840> delete<00:03:40.170> all

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
to place our mass we have now de placed

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.750 
to place our mass we have now de placed
on<00:04:56.400> face<00:04:56.870> tool<00:04:57.870> activated<00:04:58.490> where<00:04:59.490> we<00:04:59.580> can

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
on face tool activated where we can

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.810 
on face tool activated where we can
place<00:04:59.970> our<00:05:00.150> mass<00:05:00.419> on<00:05:00.660> existing<00:05:01.050> faces<00:05:01.710> we<00:05:02.639> want

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
place our mass on existing faces we want

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.790 
place our mass on existing faces we want
to<00:05:02.910> place<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.240> on<00:05:03.330> level<00:05:03.660> one<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.380> we<00:05:04.500> select

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
to place it on level one so we select

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.180 
to place it on level one so we select
here<00:05:04.860> place<00:05:05.490> on<00:05:05.639> works<00:05:05.880> plane<00:05:06.590> is<00:05:07.590> activated

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
here place on works plane is activated

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.420 
here place on works plane is activated
and<00:05:08.370> we<00:05:09.000> place<00:05:09.240> it<00:05:09.270> over<00:05:09.419> here<00:05:10.190> this<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:11.250> a

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
and we place it over here this is a

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.790 
and we place it over here this is a
Revit<00:05:11.790> family<00:05:12.210> we<00:05:12.540> have<00:05:12.630> two<00:05:12.870> possibility<00:05:13.710> to

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
Revit family we have two possibility to

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.790 
Revit family we have two possibility to
place<00:05:14.040> it<00:05:14.280> several<00:05:14.760> times<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.360> we<00:05:16.290> can<00:05:16.530> easily

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
place it several times and we can easily

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.950 
place it several times and we can easily
rotate<00:05:17.430> it<00:05:17.580> by<00:05:17.820> using<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.389> space<00:05:18.960> bar<00:05:20.960> so

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
rotate it by using the space bar so

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.760 
rotate it by using the space bar so
that's<00:05:22.169> it<00:05:22.350> for<00:05:22.680> second<00:05:23.520> step
