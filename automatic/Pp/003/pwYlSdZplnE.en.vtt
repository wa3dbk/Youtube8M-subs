00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello welcome to my channel I'm male 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.660
 moral professional makeup artist and I'm 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.700
 here to teach you to highlight your 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.590
 beauty today's record I'm going to 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.759
 teach how to make up when they invite you 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.759
 to a day marriage 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.119
 do not 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.050
 first of all let's start 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.810
 moistening this little brightener with 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.730
 the fixer is super super super good 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.640
 because that make you last a lot longer 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.140
 of makeup better blurs the base and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.140
 it's going to look a lot more natural 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.290
 we will apply the corrector in this case is 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.420
 the web problem the mac one and then you 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.810
 I will give a touch of lighting with 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.140
 This one is a little clearer than namsa 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.140
 ah 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.340
 now let's apply this clearer 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.640
 to give a touch of lighting to the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.640
 shore 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.960
 now let's start to see the eyes 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.820
 First of all we are going to use a 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.570
 first so that the shadows 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.810
 durex very much more and in real color 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.080
 of the knee 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.120
 Y 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.100
 this time commercial first with the skin and 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.140
 later with the eyes because as equal 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.420
 it is a marriage I would say then the eyes 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.670
 they can not be too strong that's why 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.040
 let's make a very natural makeup 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.410
 and it will not associate us when so much 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.380
 The dark circles are going to start then with 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:49.010
 a matte coffee with this gap that is for 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.000
 blur and with the taboo tone of the 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.000
 paleta to the now cupbearer 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.060
 and to finish making up the basin or 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.159
 the middle eyelid which is a very 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.560
 important of the eyes because it is the one that 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.380
 marks us and divides us the mobile eyelid 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.200
 of the fixed eyelid then having the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.090
 hang very well marked you already know that 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.819
 you can not climb towards the fixed eyelid 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.950
 and you can not get off the eyelid either 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.890
 mobile since the mobile eyelid we owe it 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.190
 to have very well illuminates let's use 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.140
 a darker coffee martín that's the tone 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.140
 seybold of the parrot palette 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.070
 and with a much darker coffee I would say 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.850
 the espresso of the palette llorach but 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.580
 I'm going to start marking the tabs 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.440
 down I'll come out from the tabs 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.980
 lower 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:51.170
 in the direction of the eyebrow keeping this 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:56.140
 angle and as I'm going up 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.140
 I'm going to join him in the basin 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.239
 creating a horizontal web 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.850
 now you are going to apply on the mobile eyelid 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.750
 a shadow in this is right then it has 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.590
 a lot of brightness so that the 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.590
 eyelid 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.890
 you can not get on more than the eyelid 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.770
 middle of the basin you must now delineate 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.720
 the eyes that line up I like a lot 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.850
 is of benefit is new 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.190
 in gel but it seems like it's a 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.190
 prize then it 's much simpler 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.600
 Y 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.930
 to 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.420
 if you want to see step by step how 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.400
 make up the eyebrows you can see in my 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.659
 list of videos you will find the video 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.940
 special eyebrows 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.549
 now let's perform the outline with 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.979
 a bronze that I love is a 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.470
 delimited map is the edition of a for 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.600
 that a bit of brightness but it's very subtle 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.510
 how are we going to be in a marriage of 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.080
 day then you must do the outline very 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.080
 natural 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.650
 and we will finish the outline by marking 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.560
 the nose as you can already could see in 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.719
 my video of contours are going to see the duck 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.719
 I turn off that as you see I have not seen 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:50.590
 I'm going to light up the face with the sector 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.590
 face in the parts where I want to highlight 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.750
 I must blur it with the virulent one since 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.750
 this creamy by-product 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.389
 and ended by sealing them with a 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.389
 powder illuminator 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:18.539
 with the banana powder we are going to leave very 

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:21.240
 well the whole face so that we stay 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.919
 completely matte 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.259
 to make a harmony with our 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.930
 red dress then let's paint the 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:32.150
 mouth also completely red and so 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.150
 they will be smooth also for the night 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.520
 and 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.520
 I'm going to apply a not so pink blush 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.729
 to leave the protagonism to the 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.819
 lips 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.819
 Y 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.960
 and to finish we will apply quite 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.780
 tab so you do not have to use 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.360
 false eyelashes is here on chip 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.550
 I personally love it because it lets be 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.740
 very punctual and paint lashes for 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.600
 lashes then Havana will give them 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.670
 much more volume and they will see more 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.890
 bushy lashes
