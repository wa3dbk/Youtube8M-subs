doing so when I'm in the hub you can see

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.320 
doing so when I'm in the hub you can see
automatically<00:01:58.370> I'd<00:01:58.520> normally<00:01:58.640> compose<00:01:59.180> an

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
whole display is there for really

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.160

viewing
I'm<00:02:13.099> compromised<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.880> actually<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
I'm compromised and actually the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.930

keyboard down here you'll see is
actually<00:02:17.090> starts<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.540> predict<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.530> first

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
actually starts to predict so the first

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.040 
actually starts to predict so the first
rewrote<00:02:19.370> keyboards<00:02:19.849> and<00:02:20.000> what<00:02:20.630> you'll<00:02:20.750> see<00:02:20.930> is

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
rewrote keyboards and what you'll see is

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.990 
rewrote keyboards and what you'll see is
that<00:02:21.080> fourth<00:02:21.500> row<00:02:21.739> of<00:02:21.860> characters<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.520> dynamic

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
that fourth row of characters is dynamic

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.729 
that fourth row of characters is dynamic
and<00:02:23.450> at<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.780> top<00:02:23.989> you'll<00:02:24.260> see<00:02:24.319> that<00:02:24.560> these

and at the top you'll see that these

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.890 
and at the top you'll see that these
actually<00:02:24.950> change<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:26.150> are<00:02:26.300> always<00:02:26.510> there<00:02:26.870> for

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
actually change and are always there for

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
predictions are now starting to come

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.770 
predictions are now starting to come
through<00:02:37.100> for<00:02:37.250> me<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.610> what<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.239> can<00:02:38.300> do<00:02:38.569> is<00:02:38.690> I

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
through for me and what I can do is I

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.150 
through for me and what I can do is I
can<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:38.930> instantly<00:02:39.440> swipe<00:02:39.709> on<00:02:39.890> those<00:02:40.040> as

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
can just instantly swipe on those as

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.660 
can just instantly swipe on those as
well<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:40.340> how<00:02:40.670> are<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.510> do<00:02:42.250> really<00:02:43.250> intuitive

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
well so how are you do really intuitive

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.340 
well so how are you do really intuitive
saves<00:02:44.209> me<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.390> lot<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.540> time<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.050> it's<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.230> great

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
saves me a lot of time and it's a great

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.410 
saves me a lot of time and it's a great
experience<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:46.400> more<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.790> use<00:02:46.819> the<00:02:47.150> device

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
experience the more you use the device

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.090 
experience the more you use the device
the<00:02:47.989> more<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.260> learns<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.769> more<00:02:49.010> and

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
the more it learns that more and

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.699 
the more it learns that more and
understands<00:02:49.819> if<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.120> use<00:02:50.360> sort<00:02:51.049> of<00:02:51.110> short

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
understands if I use sort of short

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.289 
understands if I use sort of short
phrases<00:02:51.980> those<00:02:52.400> will<00:02:52.580> start<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:52.880> predict<00:02:53.180> in

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
phrases those will start to predict in

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.180 
phrases those will start to predict in
there<00:02:53.480> as<00:02:53.750> well<00:02:53.930> but<00:02:54.739> what's<00:02:54.920> great<00:02:55.160> about

there as well but what's great about
this<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.530> capacitor<00:02:57.530> keyboard<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.040> allows

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
this is the capacitor keyboard it allows

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.699 
this is the capacitor keyboard it allows
me<00:02:58.549> to<00:02:58.580> actually<00:02:59.150> do<00:02:59.750> more<00:02:59.959> actions<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.530> get

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
keys and you can see I've invoked there

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.520 
keys and you can see I've invoked there
it's<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.329> phone<00:03:26.510> cursor<00:03:26.870> control<00:03:27.170> now<00:03:27.320> so<00:03:27.500> I

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.500 
me to highlight those words there we go
to<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:40.070> property<00:03:40.280> now<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:41.000> then<00:03:41.120> again<00:03:41.390> I

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
to that property now and then again I

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.180 
to that property now and then again I
could<00:03:41.660> just<00:03:41.690> swipe<00:03:41.900> on<00:03:42.079> that<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.799> some<00:03:43.040> really

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
could just swipe on that so some really

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.160 
could just swipe on that so some really
great<00:03:43.459> actions<00:03:43.910> coming<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.359> on<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.810> keyboard

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
great actions coming in on the keyboard

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.949 
great actions coming in on the keyboard
to<00:03:45.380> allow<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.160> get<00:03:46.310> stuff<00:03:46.549> done<00:03:46.780> all<00:03:47.780> the

different icons continue to scroll

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.520 
different icons continue to scroll
through<00:03:49.549> so<00:03:50.329> I<00:03:50.359> can<00:03:50.570> actually<00:03:50.690> use<00:03:50.959> short<00:03:51.320> keys
