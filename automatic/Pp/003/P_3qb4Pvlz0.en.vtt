00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 continue the program izba strong constipation 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.950
 and the yard fence so if the fence on 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:14.280
 your cottage is about to fall apart most 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.480
 brother time with job old fence addition 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.880
 and look fall apart 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.320
 do not wait until it collapses better break 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.240
 it yourself and put a new one first thing 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.609
 drill a hole for support pillars 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.830
 these pipes need to be driven into the ground by one and a half 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.230
 meter but consider you only need to drill 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.360
 half the distance further we drive 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.930
 would only have a sledgehammer 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.969
 stand firm when you score became 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.969
 be sure to check your work 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.039
 level is the basis 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.379
 her crooked then skewed the whole fence 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.910
 there is another subtlety about it everyone knows 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.890
 but somehow they forget 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.940
 note that the pillar cap 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.980
 should be littered 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.079
 otherwise when driving it 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.780
 spins up and in the future may 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.260
 Moisture that leads to tearing 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.420
 pillar 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.049
 It would have set you can move 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.140
 Further we fasten the gate and the gate 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.400
 they are very heavy and can pull on 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.530
 yourself supporting pillars 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.560
 because of this, the whole construction will be bent 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.270
 therefore welded on top of the crossbar 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.670
 lest they bend over 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.560
 the weight of the gate now all the pillars 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.930
 we connect with each other like this 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.020
 crossbeam logs at the height of the fence 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.420
 up to two meters you can use 2 lags 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.729
 with a higher height a height of 3 and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.190
 more of it to moisture provide rigidity 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.530
 constructions 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.680
 down when the whole construction rattles me 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.160
 brewed time to strengthen the supporting 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.100
 pillars 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.970
 the best rubble the earth will be wrong 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.310
 reliably places of welding we paint 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.190
 boards color of a professional flooring 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.200
 Well, then the fence can be sheathed than 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.240
 pleasing the tree slate or like us and 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.730
 decking for this will need 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.500
 screw twist them every two 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.510
 waves on the profile sheet when fastening 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.730
 sheeting to logs we use 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.440
 self-tapping screws that has a rubber washer 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.410
 which provides a denser 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.270
 fit treasure everybody ready such a fence 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.430
 will guard you for many more years 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.430
