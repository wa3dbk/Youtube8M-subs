00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.430
 some cakes of charales with nopales in 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.610
 guajillo chile 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.340
 we are going to need 100 grams of charro 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.720
 of the micros 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.930
 so it 's so little 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.930
 that are kids are little fish 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.930

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:35.290

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:40.260
 chopped nopales in pictures 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:44.300
 100 grams of guajillo chili or puyas 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.310
 approximately are about 25 chilies 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.470
 this 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.120
 they're going to wonder if it's a lot, it's not 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.570
 a lot because we're going to take the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.270
 seeds and they will no longer apply the same 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.850
 we are going to need 4 eggs a piece 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.610
 small onion 2 garlic cloves a 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.690
 little note in pasta to the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:10.930
 needed the necessary water and oil 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.930
 to fry the panitos de charales 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.490
 I will now do the following the 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:22.220
 nopales I'm going to boil them with salt 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:26.050
 I'll toast the chiles in the comal 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.920
 and the charales I'm going to toast them too 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.030
 in a toasted casserole not burned here 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.280
 we are already toasting the little pieces 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.280
 we already see that they are changing color 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.540
 we are going to move another two minutes already 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.950
 that are 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.950
 we are going to let cool 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.259
 here we are going to try the chiles 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.580
 also cost the not to be burned 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.830
 because otherwise it would be this 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.240
 bitter sun 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.250
 the stew then let's go here be 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.950
 moving until they are completely 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.959
 toasted 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.080
 and the chiles are already toasted here 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:18.880
 are now I'm going to add the onion 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.810
 the garlic I'm going to add water 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.190
 until it is three quarters came the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.140
 glass and I'm going to grind it very well 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.950
 here I am hot oil now 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.950
 let's add fact 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.420
 and we are going to add another bit of 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.420
 Water 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.290
 we're going to let it start to boil 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.480
 here we observe that it is boiling 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.160
 we are going to add the nopales that 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.940
 we boil the drains, rinse them and 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.940
 he writes 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.299
 we are going to add your little box 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.299
 troublemaker 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.240
 the flavor we are going to put some branches of 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.130
 cilantro this is optional if you like it 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.230
 they can put them and if not then they do not 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.410
 they can admit to them and I'm going to 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.410
 add 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.490
 and we are going to put 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.290
 We're not going to let it boil for two minutes 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.260
 for her to turn it off now let's 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.060
 check the taste 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.810
 do not miss salt 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.110
 good for my taste is fine 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.690
 now we are going to pay 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.880
 and we are going to start to prepare the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.090
 cakes 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.090
 let's add here what are the 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.090
 eggs 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.650
 since we added the four eggs 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.530
 you have to incorporate everything very well 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.700
 now you have to incorporate very well 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.060
 to start making the pancakes 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.520
 here the oil is hot 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.910
 Now what we're doing is doing the 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.910
 Pancakes 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.830
 I'm not going to be so big I'm not going to 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.310
 make small 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.310
 a 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:01.499
 to turn it around 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:08.850
 here you will see a degree and I'm going to 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.850
 turn around the other 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.420
 I will not let it get brown in the other 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.910
 side so that it is ready 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.110
 and they are donated by both sides now what 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.110
 what I'm going to do is cover them 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.080
 and add them to those who invited that 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:35.130
 prepare well I will do all the 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.130
 letters that come out 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.850
