problem that the aldosterone line again

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.980 
problem that the aldosterone line again
needs<00:02:59.300> but<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.560> will<00:03:00.890> have<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.610> lot<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.510> create<00:03:02.960> a

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
needs but it will have a lot to create a

in that game in particular it's even

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.810 
in that game in particular it's even
more<00:03:08.660> important<00:03:09.290> than<00:03:09.410> in<00:03:09.740> any<00:03:09.980> other<00:03:10.340> game
