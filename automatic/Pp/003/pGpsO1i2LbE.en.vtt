00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.850 
wish I could feel that way everywhere
but<00:03:50.019> when<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.170> come<00:03:50.349> over<00:03:50.440> here<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.830> west

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
but when I come over here to the west

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.460 
but when I come over here to the west
coast<00:03:51.190> I'm<00:03:51.430> in<00:03:51.519> like<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.700> farmland<00:03:52.200> time<00:03:53.200> zones

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
coast I'm in like a farmland time zones

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.920 
coast I'm in like a farmland time zones
overhead<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.190> if<00:03:54.700> these<00:03:55.000> events<00:03:55.209> want<00:03:55.720> like

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
overhead and if these events want like

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.809 
overhead and if these events want like
bigger<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.830> rice<00:03:56.980> opposed<00:03:57.310> events<00:03:57.670> they're

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
bigger and rice opposed events they're

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.089 
bigger and rice opposed events they're
like<00:03:57.940> they<00:03:58.690> seem<00:03:58.930> more<00:03:59.140> substantial<00:03:59.890> just

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
like they seem more substantial just

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.530 
like they seem more substantial just
because<00:04:00.310> of<00:04:00.400> all<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.670> production<00:04:00.849> value<00:04:01.420> that

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
because of all the production value that

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.990 
because of all the production value that
goes<00:04:01.659> into<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.980> it's<00:04:03.129> a<00:04:03.190> little<00:04:03.310> harder<00:04:03.760> to

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
goes into it so it's a little harder to

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.960 
goes into it so it's a little harder to
relax<00:04:04.330> it's<00:04:04.569> like<00:04:04.659> more<00:04:04.810> pressure

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
relax it's like more pressure

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.870 
relax it's like more pressure
