00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.590 
form of a program to follow so the very
first<00:03:59.820> thing<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.090> consider<00:04:00.180> with<00:04:00.540> your

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
first thing to consider with your

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.450 
first thing to consider with your
program<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:01.020> follow<00:04:01.200> is<00:04:01.620> building<00:04:02.280> a

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
program to follow is building a

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.940 
program to follow is building a
well-rounded<00:04:03.210> body<00:04:03.690> in<00:04:03.990> particular<00:04:04.350> within

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
well-rounded body in particular within

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.700 
well-rounded body in particular within
the<00:04:05.130> shoulder<00:04:05.460> girdle<00:04:05.570> so<00:04:06.570> as<00:04:07.140> you've<00:04:07.530> been

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
the shoulder girdle so as you've been

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.050 
the shoulder girdle so as you've been
doing<00:04:07.950> lots<00:04:08.070> of<00:04:08.280> pushing<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:08.790> want<00:04:08.970> to

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
doing lots of pushing you want to

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.590 
doing lots of pushing you want to
balance<00:04:09.300> it<00:04:09.780> with<00:04:10.500> pulley<00:04:10.980> because<00:04:11.520> if<00:04:12.360> you

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
balance it with pulley because if you

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.450 
balance it with pulley because if you
build<00:04:12.900> you're<00:04:13.140> pushing<00:04:13.770> muscles<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.430> the

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
build you're pushing muscles to the

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.150 
build you're pushing muscles to the
exclusion<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.440> thoracic<00:04:16.440> extension<00:04:16.530> or<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
exclusion of thoracic extension or the

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.210 
exclusion of thoracic extension or the
muscles<00:04:17.550> that<00:04:17.930> maintain<00:04:18.930> instantaneous<00:04:19.890> axis

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
muscles that maintain instantaneous axis

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.160 
muscles that maintain instantaneous axis
of<00:04:20.340> rotation<00:04:20.430> within<00:04:21.090> your<00:04:21.209> shoulders<00:04:21.600> you're

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
of rotation within your shoulders you're

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.450 
of rotation within your shoulders you're
going<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.320> end<00:04:22.470> up<00:04:22.530> with<00:04:22.650> damaged<00:04:23.040> shoulders

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
going to end up with damaged shoulders

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.030 
going to end up with damaged shoulders
and<00:04:23.810> poor<00:04:24.810> performance<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.560> you're<00:04:25.680> pushing

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
and poor performance and you're pushing

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.350 
and poor performance and you're pushing
or<00:04:26.160> anything<00:04:26.370> else<00:04:26.580> did<00:04:26.760> you<00:04:26.850> decide<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.180> do

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
or anything else did you decide to do

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.290 
or anything else did you decide to do

so<00:04:30.300> one<00:04:30.870> of<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.020> best<00:04:31.200> exercises<00:04:31.350> to<00:04:31.860> create

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
so one of the best exercises to create

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.090 
so one of the best exercises to create
that<00:04:32.430> balance<00:04:34.880> our<00:04:35.880> inverted<00:04:36.570> rows<00:04:36.930> or<00:04:37.920> what

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
that balance our inverted rows or what

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.640 
that balance our inverted rows or what
some<00:04:38.250> people<00:04:38.280> call<00:04:38.550> reversed<00:04:39.120> push-ups<00:04:39.650> I'm

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
some people call reversed push-ups I'm

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.020

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.310 
can mess with you can increase the
intensity<00:05:55.590> by<00:05:56.100> adding<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:57.120> heavier<00:05:57.480> bands<00:05:58.140> as

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
intensity by adding the heavier bands as

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.220 
intensity by adding the heavier bands as
time<00:05:59.100> goes<00:05:59.370> on<00:05:59.580> so<00:06:00.210> if<00:06:00.330> you<00:06:00.450> use<00:06:00.630> a<00:06:00.660> light<00:06:00.960> band

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
time goes on so if you use a light band

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.800 
time goes on so if you use a light band
for<00:06:01.560> three<00:06:01.740> weeks<00:06:01.920> go<00:06:02.610> to<00:06:02.670> a<00:06:02.760> medium<00:06:03.030> band<00:06:03.450> for

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
for three weeks go to a medium band for

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.710 
for three weeks go to a medium band for
three<00:06:03.930> weeks<00:06:04.230> and<00:06:04.500> then<00:06:05.040> do<00:06:05.850> a<00:06:05.880> heavy<00:06:06.150> band<00:06:06.420> for

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
three weeks and then do a heavy band for

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.060 
three weeks and then do a heavy band for
three<00:06:06.840> weeks<00:06:07.050> that<00:06:07.560> will<00:06:07.740> increase<00:06:08.010> your

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
three weeks that will increase your

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.250 
three weeks that will increase your
pushing<00:06:08.430> ability<00:06:08.970> you<00:06:09.660> can<00:06:09.780> increase<00:06:10.050> the

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
pushing ability you can increase the

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.920 
pushing ability you can increase the
volume<00:06:10.470> bike<00:06:10.830> doing<00:06:11.070> simply<00:06:11.970> by<00:06:12.210> doing<00:06:12.630> more

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
volume bike doing simply by doing more

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.770 
volume bike doing simply by doing more
push-ups<00:06:13.560> at<00:06:14.070> each<00:06:14.670> sitting<00:06:15.240> so<00:06:15.480> if<00:06:15.570> you<00:06:15.690> were

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
push-ups at each sitting so if you were

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.500 
push-ups at each sitting so if you were
gonna<00:06:15.900> do<00:06:16.140> 10<00:06:16.650> push-ups<00:06:16.890> normally<00:06:17.520> and<00:06:17.730> you<00:06:18.150> do

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
gonna do 10 push-ups normally and you do

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.320 
gonna do 10 push-ups normally and you do
that<00:06:18.630> once<00:06:18.900> a<00:06:19.020> day<00:06:19.200> work<00:06:19.890> up<00:06:20.190> to<00:06:20.340> doing<00:06:20.370> 20<00:06:21.000> 30

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
that once a day work up to doing 20 30

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.660 
that once a day work up to doing 20 30
40<00:06:21.810> pushup<00:06:22.200> the<00:06:22.650> way<00:06:22.860> you<00:06:22.920> can<00:06:23.190> do<00:06:23.430> that

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
40 pushup the way you can do that

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.310 
40 pushup the way you can do that
especially<00:06:23.970> if<00:06:24.270> you're<00:06:24.420> you're<00:06:24.750> not<00:06:24.960> strong

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
enough at this particular time is to do

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.150 
enough at this particular time is to do
chunky<00:06:29.370> so<00:06:29.700> you<00:06:29.850> chunk<00:06:30.120> up<00:06:30.470> 10<00:06:31.470> push-ups

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
chunky so you chunk up 10 push-ups

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.430 
chunky so you chunk up 10 push-ups
take<00:06:33.000> a<00:06:33.030> rest<00:06:33.300> so<00:06:33.780> we<00:06:33.990> have<00:06:34.080> a<00:06:34.140> sip<00:06:34.290> of<00:06:34.320> water

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
take a rest so we have a sip of water

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.210 
take a rest so we have a sip of water
come<00:06:34.980> back<00:06:35.190> do<00:06:35.730> 10<00:06:36.000> more<00:06:36.240> go<00:06:37.080> back<00:06:37.290> take<00:06:37.950> a<00:06:38.010> rest
