00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
edge just trying something different the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.060 
edge just trying something different the
board<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:31.949> only<00:00:32.130> two<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.550> seven-eighths<00:00:34.070> but

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
board is only two and seven-eighths but

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.430 
board is only two and seven-eighths but
the<00:00:35.399> rails<00:00:35.610> are<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.030> little<00:00:36.570> bit<00:00:36.750> fuller<00:00:37.020> so

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the rails are a little bit fuller so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.990 
the rails are a little bit fuller so

on this board so one of the fun things
do<00:01:16.960> is<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.320> have<00:01:17.500> a<00:01:17.530> quiver<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.700> try<00:01:19.210> different

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
do is to have a quiver and try different

things so what I've done today is I
actually<00:01:21.970> got<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.840> board<00:01:23.170> that's<00:01:23.620> opposite<00:01:24.550> of

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
actually got a board that's opposite of

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.780 
actually got a board that's opposite of
what<00:01:24.910> I<00:01:24.960> normally<00:01:25.960> served<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.830> then<00:01:27.100> with<00:01:27.610> the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
what I normally served and then with the

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.720 
what I normally served and then with the
tail<00:01:28.530> having<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.650> edge

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
tail having the edge

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.330 
tail having the edge
sand<00:01:31.120> it<00:01:31.300> off<00:01:31.450> so

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
sand it off so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.410 
sand it off so
people<00:01:32.969> put<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.390> apt<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.899> but<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.420> sanded

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
people put the apt in but then we sanded

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.810 
people put the apt in but then we sanded
it<00:01:36.570> off<00:01:37.609> slightly<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.469> board

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
it off slightly so the board

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.790 
it off slightly so the board
sticks<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.690> pocket<00:01:43.080> very<00:01:43.200> nicely<00:01:43.560> and

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
sticks in the pocket very nicely and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.399 
sticks in the pocket very nicely and
very<00:01:46.800> easy<00:01:47.070> smooth<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.729> easy<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.120> search<00:01:48.409> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
very easy smooth and easy to search I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.450 
very easy smooth and easy to search I
will<00:01:50.130> say<00:01:50.370> having<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.270> fullness<00:01:51.510> on<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.870> rail

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
will say having the fullness on the rail

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.660 
will say having the fullness on the rail
was<00:01:53.660> pretty<00:01:54.660> big<00:01:54.930> difference<00:01:55.369> for<00:01:56.369> me

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
was pretty big difference for me

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.270 
was pretty big difference for me
the<00:01:58.630> board<00:01:58.869> tens<00:01:59.229> read<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.619> little<00:01:59.799> bit<00:02:00.009> higher

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
the board tens read a little bit higher

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.870 
the board tens read a little bit higher
up<00:02:00.580> on<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.790> wave<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:02.619> top<00:02:02.920> of<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.159> order<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:03.850> to

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
up on the wave on top of the order so to

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.660 
up on the wave on top of the order so to
speak<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:05.140> that's<00:02:05.860> such<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.100> couple<00:02:06.490> ways<00:02:06.610> to

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
speak so that's such a couple ways to

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.180 
speak so that's such a couple ways to
get<00:02:07.000> used<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.479> some<00:02:08.110> ways<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.619> felt<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:09.009> little

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
get used to some ways I felt a little

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.820 
get used to some ways I felt a little
corny<00:02:09.670> but<00:02:10.630> I<00:02:10.989> just<00:02:11.730> equipment<00:02:12.730> so<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.590> anyway

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
corny but I just equipment so so anyway

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:23.160 
corny but I just equipment so so anyway
the<00:02:16.680> fun<00:02:17.680> part<00:02:17.980> is

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.190 

or<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:23.890> off<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.220> fun<00:02:24.459> at<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> great<00:02:25.690> time<00:02:25.959> I

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200

or it is off the fun at a great time I
also<00:02:26.440> put<00:02:26.800> in<00:02:27.239> right<00:02:28.239> Finn<00:02:28.739> if<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:30.010> notice<00:02:30.340> man

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
also put in right Finn if you notice man

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.490 
also put in right Finn if you notice man
you<00:02:30.640> got<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.940> check<00:02:31.360> everybody<00:02:31.900> who<00:02:32.110> writes<00:02:32.380> a

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
you got to check everybody who writes a

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.050 
you got to check everybody who writes a
long<00:02:32.709> board<00:02:32.980> needs<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.340> get<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.550> set<00:02:33.819> of<00:02:33.849> these

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
long board needs to get a set of these

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.839 
long board needs to get a set of these
fins<00:02:34.360> look<00:02:34.989> at<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.260> flex<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.250> center<00:02:36.640> pin

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
fins look at the flex in that center pin

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.630 
fins look at the flex in that center pin
and<00:02:37.420> what<00:02:37.660> happens<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.260> then<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:39.250> come<00:02:39.459> off

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
and what happens is then you come off

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.390 
and what happens is then you come off
the<00:02:39.819> bottom<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.330> kind<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.569> loads<00:02:40.780> up<00:02:41.370> get<00:02:42.370> a

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
the bottom and it kind of loads up get a

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.250 
the bottom and it kind of loads up get a
little<00:02:42.580> spring<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:45.610> know<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.760> other

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
little spring so you know the other

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.009 
little spring so you know the other
component<00:02:47.260> I've<00:02:47.860> been<00:02:48.069> riding<00:02:48.310> actually<00:02:49.019> my

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
component I've been riding actually my

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
I actually have a feeling that I'll

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.649 
I actually have a feeling that I'll
discover<00:03:39.769> some<00:03:40.190> new<00:03:40.220> things<00:03:40.640> on<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.209> couple<00:03:41.599> of

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
discover some new things on a couple of

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.589 
discover some new things on a couple of
my<00:03:41.750> other<00:03:41.780> boards<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.379> I<00:03:42.500> ride<00:03:42.709> a<00:03:42.739> lot<00:03:43.599> and

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
my other boards that I ride a lot and

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.390 
my other boards that I ride a lot and
that's<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.989> fun<00:03:45.290> part<00:03:45.560> about<00:03:45.620> surfing<00:03:46.159> when<00:03:46.310> you

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
that's a fun part about surfing when you

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.479 
that's a fun part about surfing when you
bounce<00:03:46.579> around<00:03:46.849> on<00:03:47.000> these<00:03:47.150> different<00:03:47.569> boards

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
bounce around on these different boards

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.860 
bounce around on these different boards
and<00:03:49.489> ending<00:03:50.739> just<00:03:51.739> looks<00:03:52.010> like

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
and ending just looks like

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.950 
and ending just looks like
the<00:03:54.870> tail<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.650> round<00:03:56.310> eggy<00:03:56.700> rails<00:03:57.060> really

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
the tail and the round eggy rails really

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.390 
the tail and the round eggy rails really
kind<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.260> kept<00:03:58.470> me<00:03:58.560> right<00:03:58.710> in<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.890> pocket<00:03:59.130> on

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
kind of kept me right in the pocket on

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.870 
kind of kept me right in the pocket on
the<00:03:59.430> way<00:03:59.640> it's<00:04:00.480> probably<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.020> most

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
the way it's probably the most

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.760 
the way it's probably the most
surprising<00:04:02.880> thing<00:04:03.090> before<00:04:03.900> cat<00:04:04.140> speed<00:04:04.500> where

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
surprising thing before cat speed where

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.510 
surprising thing before cat speed where
I<00:04:05.040> needed<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:07.860> other<00:04:08.010> thing<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.340> I

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
I needed it to the other thing is I

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.040 
I needed it to the other thing is I
probably<00:04:08.790> noticed<00:04:09.060> is<00:04:09.240> just<00:04:09.480> with<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.810> big

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
probably noticed is just with the big

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.440 
probably noticed is just with the big
concave<00:04:10.590> had<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:11.700> work<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:11.940> little<00:04:11.970> harder<00:04:12.180> to

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
concave had to work a little harder to

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.130 
concave had to work a little harder to
catch<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.960> waves<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.710> generally<00:04:14.250> do<00:04:14.430> on

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
catch the waves that I generally do on

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.470 
catch the waves that I generally do on
