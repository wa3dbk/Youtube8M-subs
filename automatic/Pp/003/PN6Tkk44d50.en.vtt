00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.540
 we are at home cesare cornoldi or full professor of psychology 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.789
 of learning and memory at the University of Padua 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.310
 professor we talk about difficulty in understanding a text what it means 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.340
 well then we can talk about a specific difficulty with character 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.259
 more general 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.859
 that brings general when a child 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.630
 maybe it's not particularly 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.069
 equipment and therefore a source text will not be oriented towards understanding it 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.700
 we have also done cases of children who are in cognitively 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.950
 bandits 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.840
 and yet not difficult to find 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.260
 derive the meanings of the Simsons present in a written text 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.450
 this is how these difficulties can be faced 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.450
 grille. bearing in mind the two types 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 in the first case more than much you can't do it I try a little bit to stop 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.600
 the situation 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 instead if the child has the potential 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.760
 a lot can be done 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.490
 we have seen them on many researches that document defects and very high of 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.570
 very well organized programs 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.650
 the pooh new skills for understanding the written text 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.730
 typically these well-organized programs play on three levels 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.650
 the identification of specific components that create problems 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.970
 children 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.350
 the metacognitive aspect also of reflection 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.670
 I begin the relationship between oral comprehension of written comprehension 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.110
 here is precisely that 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.340
 connection to the enabled understanding of a text and the study here is another 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.729
 important relationship between that included in the study text because this guy 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.679
 does not understand a text it is difficult to memorize it if not 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.120
 mechanically 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.660
 but how much map of 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.590
 10 11 years you have to study 3 4 pages of high school text you can't mymovies have 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.710
 word by word 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.849
 Luckily 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.069
 and therefore must necessarily do a work of text analysis 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.829
 here are several reasons why some children fail to fix 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.909
 in the study of information they face 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.329
 not only this that I have this is definitely pc 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.839
 the more the superficial understanding as that I miss completely but stops 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.329
 from epidemic mirrors of the text 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.980
 so difficult all the more difficult that they fix mathematically 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.279
 therefore the school can favor acquisition of 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.089
 are of effective study with 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:44.289
 that I believe that 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.369
 nice star can do a lot 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:52.789
 however, there are not always cases of children that I have children who have their own 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.179
 the difficulty to organize 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.899
 and where you need to force individual control fan course 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:00.799
 instead 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.909
 and there are many kids with rome learning but who are not 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.749
 give up a moment of study for the school then 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.329
 can do much both in reflection 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.549
 and in the promotion of study competence
