00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.150
 hello everyone i'm miguel riera what 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.850
 you just heard is soft friend or me 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.040
 same in the song part of you from me 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.520
 old group me with him 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.450
 we were an album in the year 2005 it's fine 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.090
 is interested in your earnings 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.970
 completed on youtube looking for youth 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.150
 and / or more for teletypes something appears 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.160
 over there and also the score you can 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.440
 find in a link that is in the 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.850
 information section of this video in 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.420
 the last state be alone with him 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.880
 I know very well because the compound 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.440
 to explain something that is a doubt that 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.970
 many times the students pose that is 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.190
 when we use the pentatonic scale 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.710
 when we use a tonic day scale 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.600
 It's not easy to answer because music 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.730
 in many variations in their styles in 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.020
 which can do different things 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.000
 but if we rely on pop and rock 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.150
 and the blues the music 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.159
 more traditional that more listens 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.659
 in principle we are going to explain that the 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.329
 good pentatonic we are talking about 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.189
 example of the tonic of the minor and the 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.640
 tonic area of ​​the minor tonic half 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.640
 of the minor 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.810
 so that this one here the team fret and 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.810
 we make it resist 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:53.260
 third fifth and eighth 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:03:03.780
 and tonic is the typical of the organization only 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:03.780
 has been since la la la la la 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.019
 and the different the atomic plant 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.510
 basically the technical area are two 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.790
 notes in total has five is missing 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.980
 fa and yes while tonic varies 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.260
 have been my fa has re sun has 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.120
 they all have files and also then 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.370
 what happens is that we are in blues the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.370
 typical plus let's say we play 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.709
 with seventh chords of the basic blues 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.709
 let's say a chords 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.440
 of this euro wheel that has 12 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.440
 compasses 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.890
 once 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.500
 to give one more air of steel there are other 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.290
 tonic pathways that are sometimes used in 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.989
 people mix or fight but it's more 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.670
 advanced from the basic is a chord of 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.830
 the seventh receptive and they get up 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.959
 forming a structure of twelve measures 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.069
 and pentatonic now as soon as 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.780
 we have in pop-rock 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.739
 for example in this song we made a 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.739
 variation with the way 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.979
 good 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.580
 or chords that we call tonic day 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:33.060
 we do not stick to the seventh but 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.849
 we have the minor of the minor or greater 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.720
 we have chords more quantities that's why 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.720
 speakers are often used 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.200
 well here really the scale that you 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.200
 stick to these chords the scale that 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.040
 but when we touch it 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
 we analyze 

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:06.039
 recorded some effects with the volume touched to 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.039
 a presale 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:14.120
 here in this note 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:15.759
 catholic 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.000
 Oh 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.000
 what does 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.199
 start 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.250
 m 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.360
 so it's a phrase that starts 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.360
 as clearly 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.530
 in the error solos 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.030
 this is very usual or is the best 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.030
 you make a phrase 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.500
 and today life in the sense that it has 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.610
 both things and then you're having a good time 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.610
 the best in pentatonics 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.020
 but 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.630
 for all that 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:34.889
 we are in context some more let's say 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.270
 secondary and we use aviation 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.840
 cold when we will get everything that 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.840
 let's go to the note 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.310
 jumps 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.740
 during all that you are interested 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.280
 can see the score 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.139
 varies constantly between 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.700
 some phrases that are totally 30 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.940
 other techniques that are more day 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.510
 tonic 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.200
 what to do if you go and put packing 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.420
 tag 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:09.810
 if major for example is the best with j 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.850
 if major 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.610
 and will therefore have a machine with which 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.880
 You can use the scale as large as the 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.880
 same 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.400
 to the truth slow tonic of all the 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.400
 very expensive 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:40.950
 but I hope that at least 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:44.450
 application a little bit above 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.450
 some doubts have been resolved
