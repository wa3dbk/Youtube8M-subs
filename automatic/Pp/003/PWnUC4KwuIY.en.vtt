 dies en masse to attenuate ineter spoke for itself there are different 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.390
 to that person for example to cut this year and this person and this is 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.100
 that not only in this way 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.510
 in that way it is considered false works the trick and the smallest 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.000
 one more way 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.460
 what else equals 6 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.790

 three work letters put them up 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.510
 and if we go to this point
