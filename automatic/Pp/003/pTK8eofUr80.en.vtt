00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
kind of a new weapon in the game but

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.439 
kind of a new weapon in the game but
we're<00:00:25.740> gonna<00:00:25.890> start<00:00:26.189> off<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:27.029> spacey

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
we're gonna start off in a spacey

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.640 
we're gonna start off in a spacey
looking<00:00:27.930> thing<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.289> think<00:00:28.439> that's<00:00:28.560> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
looking thing you think that's a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.560 
looking thing you think that's a
supernova<00:00:29.070> or<00:00:29.460> something<00:00:29.730> like<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> nebula<00:00:30.210> of

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
supernova or something like a nebula of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.930 
supernova or something like a nebula of
the<00:00:31.410> galaxy<00:00:31.980> or<00:00:32.189> something<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the galaxy or something like that and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.750 
the galaxy or something like that and
then<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.840> turning<00:00:34.140> into<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.520> neuron<00:00:35.520> in

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
then it's turning into like a neuron in

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.430 
then it's turning into like a neuron in
the<00:00:35.790> brain<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.210> kind<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.630> Google<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.170> picture

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the brain I kind of Google a picture

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.750 
the brain I kind of Google a picture
that<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.829> what<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.070> looking<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
that this is what it's looking like and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.119 
that this is what it's looking like and
they<00:00:39.270> keeps<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.600> going<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.050> going<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.530> then

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
they keeps on going and going and then

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.000 
they keeps on going and going and then
it<00:00:41.280> goes<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:42.149> think<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.960> heart<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.890> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it goes to I think a heart is what it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.799 
it goes to I think a heart is what it
looks<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.309> me<00:00:44.489> because<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.390> starts<00:00:45.690> like

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
looks like to me because it starts like

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.330 
looks like to me because it starts like
beating<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.500> law<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.800> there's<00:00:46.920> like<00:00:46.980> veins

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
beating the law and there's like veins

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.690 
beating the law and there's like veins
in<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.910> then<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.719> zoom<00:00:49.079> into<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.950> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
in it and then you zoom into it and you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.939 
in it and then you zoom into it and you
see<00:00:50.879> these<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.210> wiry<00:00:51.539> things<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.829> in

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
see these like wiry things and like in

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.410 
see these like wiry things and like in
the<00:00:53.039> books<00:00:53.280> how<00:00:53.430> they<00:00:53.520> say<00:00:53.670> Spartans<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.210> made

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the books how they say Spartans are made

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.510 
the books how they say Spartans are made
how<00:00:54.930> they<00:00:55.020> inject<00:00:55.320> metal<00:00:55.920> into<00:00:56.070> them<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.309> see

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
how they inject metal into them they see

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.930 
how they inject metal into them they see
a<00:00:56.550> brain<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.010> wasn't<00:00:59.370> space<00:00:59.609> that

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
a brain and so that wasn't space that

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.660 
a brain and so that wasn't space that
was<00:01:00.000> actually<00:01:00.359> Master<00:01:00.780> Chief's<00:01:01.280> insides<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
was actually Master Chief's insides and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.759 
was actually Master Chief's insides and
then<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.090> get<00:01:03.239> Cortana<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:04.530> cool

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
then you have to get Cortana that's cool

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.190 
then you have to get Cortana that's cool
she's<00:01:04.979> still<00:01:05.189> going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.200> you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
she's still going to be in this and you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.109 
she's still going to be in this and you
have<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> jetpack<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.100> halo<00:01:08.340> reach<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:08.970> it's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
have a jetpack I can halo reach but it's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.240 
have a jetpack I can halo reach but it's
it<00:01:09.330> seems<00:01:09.750> more<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.290> built<00:01:10.560> into<00:01:10.830> your<00:01:10.920> suit

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
it seems more like built into your suit

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.609 
it seems more like built into your suit
and<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.330> get<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.659> weapon<00:01:12.930> here<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.439> think

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and then you get a weapon here you think

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.740 
and then you get a weapon here you think
it's<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> pistol<00:01:14.250> watch<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.299> grenade

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
it's the pistol watch it's a grenade

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.620 
it's the pistol watch it's a grenade
launcher<00:01:16.350> he<00:01:17.159> reloads<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
launcher he reloads it here it's not a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
launcher he reloads it here it's not a
pistol<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.770> may<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.950> pistol<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> grenade

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
pistol it may be pistol with a grenade

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.730 
pistol it may be pistol with a grenade
launcher<00:01:21.119> add<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.570> who<00:01:21.840> knows<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.409> still

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
launcher add on who knows but still

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.370 
launcher add on who knows but still
that's<00:01:23.009> cool<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.720> think<00:01:25.110> you're

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that's cool and then I think you're

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.929 
that's cool and then I think you're
going<00:01:25.590> into<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> halo<00:01:26.250> that's<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.729> looks

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
going into the halo that's what it looks

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.140 
going into the halo that's what it looks
like<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> me<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:28.340> this<00:01:29.340> better<00:01:29.579> not<00:01:29.729> be<00:01:29.759> crap

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
like to me and this better not be crap

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.300 
like to me and this better not be crap
like<00:01:30.360> halo<00:01:30.689> ODST<00:01:30.869> i<00:01:31.530> don't<00:01:31.770> think<00:01:31.799> i<00:01:31.950> will<00:01:32.100> tho

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
like halo ODST i don't think i will tho

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.760 
like halo ODST i don't think i will tho
think<00:01:33.180> will<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.479> something<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.170> halo<00:01:34.500> 3

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
think will be something like halo 3

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.069 
think will be something like halo 3
maybe<00:01:35.159> halo<00:01:35.369> 2<00:01:35.670> who<00:01:35.880> knows<00:01:36.090> now<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:36.960> gonna
