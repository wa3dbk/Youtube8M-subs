00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.610 
the world and I think that's what's
missing<00:02:11.959> for<00:02:12.739> people<00:02:13.129> is<00:02:13.340> connection<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:15.489> I

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
missing for people is connection and I

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.380 
missing for people is connection and I
think<00:02:18.620> if<00:02:18.739> we<00:02:18.890> have<00:02:19.099> connection<00:02:19.849> all<00:02:20.360> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
think if we have connection all the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.220 
think if we have connection all the
other<00:02:20.690> issues<00:02:21.319> life<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.780> mental<00:02:24.080> health

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
other issues life the mental health

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.800 
other issues life the mental health
system<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:25.069> know<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:26.239> can<00:02:26.390> get<00:02:26.569> through<00:02:26.750> it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
system you know you can get through it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.970 
system you know you can get through it
and<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.650> think<00:02:28.660> celebrating<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:30.319> know<00:02:30.349> some<00:02:30.799> of

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
and I think celebrating you know some of

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.630 
and I think celebrating you know some of
our<00:02:31.160> leaders<00:02:32.530> from<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.709> past<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.400> learning

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
our leaders from the past and learning

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.069 
our leaders from the past and learning
from<00:02:34.970> them<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:36.970> helps<00:02:37.970> us<00:02:38.180> get<00:02:38.450> through<00:02:38.720> the

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
from them is helps us get through the

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.690 
from them is helps us get through the
different<00:02:39.470> stages<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.370> new<00:02:41.380> experiences

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
different stages and the new experiences

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.220 
different stages and the new experiences
that<00:02:43.700> we're<00:02:43.910> going<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.180> experience<00:02:44.630> in<00:02:44.930> human

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
that we're going to experience in human

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.800 
that we're going to experience in human

poor selection shock all of those things

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.140 
poor selection shock all of those things
are<00:02:54.349> there<00:02:54.650> but<00:02:55.099> if<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.370> have<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.700> people

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
not just survivors of the system but all

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.860 
not just survivors of the system but all
people<00:03:16.160> who<00:03:16.549> want<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.819> fight<00:03:17.030> human<00:03:17.389> rights<00:03:17.600> I

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.470 
people who want to fight human rights I
just<00:03:18.290> think<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:19.310> we<00:03:19.670> all<00:03:19.910> should<00:03:19.940> be<00:03:20.269> working

just think that we all should be working

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.800 
just think that we all should be working
together<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.350> think<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.739> message<00:03:22.160> is<00:03:22.310> now

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
separate issue mental health over here

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.509 
separate issue mental health over here
mental<00:03:41.569> illness<00:03:41.870> over<00:03:42.139> here<00:03:42.350> it's<00:03:42.650> everywhere

mental illness over here it's everywhere

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.870 
mental illness over here it's everywhere
and<00:03:43.910> so<00:03:44.660> we<00:03:44.810> have<00:03:44.989> to<00:03:45.139> address<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:46.430> we<00:03:46.730> have

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
and so we have to address it and we have

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.039 
and so we have to address it and we have
to<00:03:47.000> let<00:03:47.209> people<00:03:47.269> know<00:03:47.630> there<00:03:48.019> are

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
to let people know there are

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.199 
to let people know there are
alternatives<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.160> people<00:03:49.639> that<00:03:49.790> are<00:03:49.970> there

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
alternatives that people that are there

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.849 
alternatives that people that are there
to<00:03:50.239> connect<00:03:50.989> with<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.349> don't<00:03:51.470> have<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.739> be

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
to connect with you you don't have to be

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.860 
to connect with you you don't have to be
afraid<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.720> I<00:03:53.720> but<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:53.989> do<00:03:54.109> think<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.799> label<00:03:55.069> is

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
afraid and I but I do think the label is

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.479 
afraid and I but I do think the label is
stigmatizing<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.799> know<00:03:57.919> whatever<00:03:58.250> people

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
stigmatizing you know whatever people

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.300 
stigmatizing you know whatever people
want<00:03:58.669> to<00:03:58.940> call<00:03:59.120> themselves<00:03:59.389> you<00:04:00.139> know<00:04:00.310> bipolar

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
want to call themselves you know bipolar

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.940 
want to call themselves you know bipolar
schizophrenia<00:04:02.060> whatever<00:04:02.540> you're<00:04:03.410> a<00:04:03.440> person

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
schizophrenia whatever you're a person

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.849 
schizophrenia whatever you're a person
first<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:05.480> think<00:04:05.569> that's<00:04:05.959> missing<00:04:06.530> in<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:06.829> I

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
first and I think that's missing in so I

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.820 
first and I think that's missing in so I
think<00:04:06.980> some<00:04:07.430> of<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.609> stigma<00:04:07.880> campaign

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
think some of the stigma campaign

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.700 
think some of the stigma campaign
have<00:04:08.980> not<00:04:09.220> been<00:04:09.550> that<00:04:10.180> successful<00:04:10.560> you're<00:04:11.560> not

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
have not been that successful you're not

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.800 
have not been that successful you're not
a<00:04:11.740> disease<00:04:12.190> you're<00:04:12.580> a<00:04:12.610> person<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.330> struggle

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
a disease you're a person I struggle

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.990 
a disease you're a person I struggle
with<00:04:13.840> that<00:04:14.170> with<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.530> label<00:04:14.710> am<00:04:15.220> i<00:04:15.430> somebody's

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
with that with the label am i somebody's

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.900 
with that with the label am i somebody's
daughter<00:04:16.480> and<00:04:17.410> my<00:04:17.650> somebody's<00:04:18.130> mother<00:04:18.430> I

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
daughter and my somebody's mother I

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.699 
daughter and my somebody's mother I
think<00:04:19.390> that's<00:04:19.570> what's<00:04:19.780> missing<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.410> that's

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
think that's what's missing and that's

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.770 
think that's what's missing and that's
why<00:04:20.950> it's<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.430> hard<00:04:21.790> for<00:04:22.000> people<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.570> really

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
why it's so hard for people to really

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.650 
why it's so hard for people to really
connect<00:04:23.380> with<00:04:24.240> mental<00:04:25.240> health<00:04:25.290> you<00:04:26.290> know<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:27.010> I
