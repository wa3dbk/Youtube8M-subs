so<00:00:00.359> yes<00:00:00.539> I'm<00:00:00.750> totally<00:00:00.900> stoked<00:00:01.380> that<00:00:01.650> the

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
so yes I'm totally stoked that the

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.800 
so yes I'm totally stoked that the
Olympics<00:00:02.159> are<00:00:02.310> here<00:00:02.520> right<00:00:02.700> now<00:00:02.760> if<00:00:03.149> you<00:00:03.629> guys

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
Olympics are here right now if you guys

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.079 
Olympics are here right now if you guys
are<00:00:04.080> following<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:04.890> playlist<00:00:05.549> that<00:00:05.790> we<00:00:05.879> put

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
are following this playlist that we put

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.760 
are following this playlist that we put
together<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.690> all<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.870> different<00:00:07.290> signs<00:00:07.529> for

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
together of all the different signs for

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.930 
together of all the different signs for
the<00:00:07.859> Olympics<00:00:08.250> pieces<00:00:08.670> that<00:00:08.849> we're

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
the Olympics pieces that we're

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.790 
the Olympics pieces that we're
collaborating<00:00:09.570> with<00:00:09.690> then<00:00:10.380> you'll<00:00:10.620> know<00:00:10.769> that

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
collaborating with then you'll know that

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.860 
collaborating with then you'll know that
right<00:00:11.309> now<00:00:11.340> we're<00:00:12.090> talking<00:00:12.450> about<00:00:12.540> ski

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
right now we're talking about ski

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.049 
right now we're talking about ski
jumping<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.590> you'll<00:00:13.769> probably<00:00:14.099> have<00:00:14.639> just

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
jumping and you'll probably have just

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.080 
jumping and you'll probably have just
visited<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.690> page<00:00:15.990> from<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.250> video<00:00:17.789> which

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
visited this page from this video which

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.910 
visited this page from this video which
is<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.300> basics<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.109> ski<00:00:19.350> jumping<00:00:19.710> if<00:00:19.830> you

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
is the basics of ski jumping if you

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.859 
is the basics of ski jumping if you
haven't<00:00:20.189> seen<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.369> one<00:00:20.730> check<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.449> out<00:00:21.570> first

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
haven't seen that one check it out first

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.750 
haven't seen that one check it out first
and<00:00:22.170> then<00:00:22.260> continue<00:00:23.070> watching<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.580> video

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
and then continue watching this video

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.089 
and then continue watching this video
okay<00:00:24.660> we're<00:00:25.199> gonna<00:00:25.289> look<00:00:25.500> though<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
okay we're gonna look though at the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.220 
okay we're gonna look though at the
variables<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:27.000> ski<00:00:27.359> jumping<00:00:29.750> okay<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.929> have

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
variables of ski jumping okay so I have

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.959 
variables of ski jumping okay so I have
thought<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> lot<00:00:31.890> about<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.309> physics<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.759> ski

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
thought a lot about the physics of ski

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.670 
thought a lot about the physics of ski
jumping<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.540> mean<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.960> get<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.320> physics

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
jumping I mean you get it in physics

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.870 
jumping I mean you get it in physics
problems<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.370> looked<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.579> little<00:00:35.610> bit<00:00:35.790> like

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
problems that looked a little bit like

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.389 
problems that looked a little bit like
this<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.450> skier<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.290> mass<00:00:37.469> X<00:00:37.739> heads<00:00:37.980> down<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
this a skier of mass X heads down the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.430 
this a skier of mass X heads down the
ramp<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.820> height<00:00:39.059> X<00:00:39.360> what<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> velocity

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
ramp with height X what is the velocity

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.100 
ramp with height X what is the velocity
as<00:00:41.100> he<00:00:41.309> leaves<00:00:41.579> what<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.450> distance<00:00:42.809> that

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
as he leaves what is the distance that

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.750 
as he leaves what is the distance that
you<00:00:43.230> can<00:00:43.440> go<00:00:43.590> now<00:00:44.190> here's<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.640> tell

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
you can go now here's what I can tell

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.790 
you can go now here's what I can tell
you<00:00:44.940> Olympic<00:00:45.450> ski<00:00:45.750> jumpers<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.230> not<00:00:46.410> easy<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you Olympic ski jumpers are not easy to

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.950 
you Olympic ski jumpers are not easy to
plug<00:00:47.219> into<00:00:47.460> an<00:00:47.640> equation<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.300> because

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
plug into an equation like this because

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.110 
plug into an equation like this because
of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> variables<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.820> are<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
of the variables so here are the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.420 
of the variables so here are the
variables<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.289> first<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.739> friction<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
variables the first is friction on the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
variables the first is friction on the
ramp<00:00:53.460> which<00:00:54.090> means<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.629> want<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:55.320> slick

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
ramp which means you want really slick

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.040 
ramp which means you want really slick
skis<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.730> very<00:00:56.969> little<00:00:57.449> friction<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
skis with very little friction and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.689 
skis with very little friction and
everyone<00:00:58.649> does<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> pretty<00:00:59.039> good<00:00:59.129> job<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.489> doing

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
everyone does a pretty good job of doing

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.119 
everyone does a pretty good job of doing
that<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.870> second<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.410> reducing<00:01:01.890> wind

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
that now the second is reducing wind

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.189 
that now the second is reducing wind
resistance<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:03.000> down<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.510> ramp<00:01:03.690> that

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
resistance going down the ramp that

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.929 
resistance going down the ramp that
means<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.589> need<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> crouch<00:01:05.220> down<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.850> an

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
means you need to crouch down in an

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.420 
means you need to crouch down in an
aerodynamic<00:01:06.270> position<00:01:06.920> again<00:01:07.920> pretty<00:01:08.340> much

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
aerodynamic position again pretty much

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
aerodynamic position again pretty much
everybody<00:01:08.970> does<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.420> easily<00:01:09.930> enough

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
everybody does that easily enough

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.130 
everybody does that easily enough
third<00:01:11.250> jumping<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> end<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> ramp<00:01:12.869> now

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
third jumping at the end of the ramp now

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.870 
third jumping at the end of the ramp now
this<00:01:13.320> seems<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.650> little<00:01:13.890> bit<00:01:14.010> trickier<00:01:14.460> this

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
this seems a little bit trickier this

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.149 
this seems a little bit trickier this
jump<00:01:15.270> gives<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.689> extra<00:01:16.140> height<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.009> also

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
jump gives you extra height but it also

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.640 
jump gives you extra height but it also
sets<00:01:17.640> up<00:01:17.790> your<00:01:17.850> angle<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.689> flight<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
sets up your angle for the flight to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.100 
sets up your angle for the flight to
upright<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.490> lots<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.850> drag<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
upright you have lots of drag to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.530 
upright you have lots of drag to
horizontal<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.280> really<00:01:23.729> risk<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.210> crash

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
horizontal and you really risk a crash

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719 
horizontal and you really risk a crash
now<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.320> flight<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.460> biggest

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
now this flight is actually the biggest

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.230 
now this flight is actually the biggest
variable<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.689> see<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.320> want<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.650> fly<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.340> boy

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
variable you see you want to fly and boy

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.719 
variable you see you want to fly and boy
can<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.840> ever<00:01:31.140> fly<00:01:31.680> when<00:01:32.009> you're<00:01:32.100> ski<00:01:32.310> jumping

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
can you ever fly when you're ski jumping

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.300 
can you ever fly when you're ski jumping
alright<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.560> give<00:01:34.680> me<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.829> feel<00:01:35.070> for

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
alright so just to give me a feel for

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.190 
alright so just to give me a feel for
how<00:01:35.490> much<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:35.909> humans<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.570> manipulate<00:01:36.780> our

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
how much we as humans can manipulate our

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.520 
how much we as humans can manipulate our
own<00:01:37.320> flight<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.950> wind<00:01:38.280> I've<00:01:39.030> come<00:01:39.530> right

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
own flight with the wind I've come right

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.370 
own flight with the wind I've come right
here<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.220> fly<00:01:41.790> Dallas<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.570> try<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.290> out

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
here to I fly Dallas to try it out

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.069 
here to I fly Dallas to try it out
myself<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:44.579> watch<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.450> actually<00:01:45.479> walk

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
myself so watch this I can actually walk

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.380 
myself so watch this I can actually walk
into<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> tunnel<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.149> wind

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
into the tunnel just like this the wind

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.179 
into the tunnel just like this the wind
doesn't<00:01:48.570> seem<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.079> anything<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.890> me<00:01:50.009> of

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
doesn't seem to do anything to me of

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.710 
doesn't seem to do anything to me of
course<00:01:50.729> that's<00:01:50.939> because<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> very

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720

sleek<00:01:52.049> body<00:01:52.229> position<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.520> sleek

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
sleek body position it's the sleek

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.090 
sleek body position it's the sleek
position<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.840> ski<00:01:55.079> jumpers<00:01:55.500> want<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.890> put

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
position that ski jumpers want to put

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.069 
position that ski jumpers want to put
forward<00:01:56.729> when<00:01:57.000> they<00:01:57.149> fly<00:01:57.450> into<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.930> oncoming

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
forward when they fly into the oncoming

I can just levitate above the ground how
freakin<00:02:09.610> cool<00:02:09.789> is<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.090> now<00:02:11.020> watch<00:02:11.290> how<00:02:11.470> you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
can move around the tunnel just by

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.360 
can move around the tunnel just by
manipulating<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.870> wind<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.260> little<00:02:14.440> bit<00:02:14.770> and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
manipulating the wind a little bit and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.910 
manipulating the wind a little bit and
I'm<00:02:15.459> not<00:02:15.580> even<00:02:15.790> moving<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.300> much<00:02:16.920> pretty

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
of course I'm not a pro so check out

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.070 
of course I'm not a pro so check out
this<00:02:30.790> footage<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.269> some<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.569> really<00:02:31.750> good

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
this footage of some of the really good

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:42.920 
this footage of some of the really good
free<00:02:32.319> flyers

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.270 

alright<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.590> point<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.920> me<00:02:45.010> doing<00:02:45.040> this

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
alright so the point of me doing this

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.830 
alright so the point of me doing this
was<00:02:45.580> just<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.850> show<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.060> how<00:02:46.269> people<00:02:46.450> can<00:02:46.780> use

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
was just to show you how people can use

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.070 
was just to show you how people can use
the<00:02:47.290> wind<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.769> really<00:02:48.190> fly<00:02:48.549> I<00:02:48.880> think<00:02:49.780> it's<00:02:49.870> ski

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
the wind to really fly I think it's ski

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.949 
the wind to really fly I think it's ski
jumping<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.590> not<00:02:50.739> all<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.100> different<00:02:51.790> from

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
jumping is not all that different from

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.300 
jumping is not all that different from
flying<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.200> tunnel<00:02:53.500> like<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:54.040> takes<00:02:54.190> a

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
flying and tunnel like this it takes a

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.640 
flying and tunnel like this it takes a
lot<00:02:54.549> of<00:02:54.790> time<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.150> get<00:02:55.299> good<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:56.049> have<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.530> lot

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
lot of time to get good so I have a lot

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.500 
lot of time to get good so I have a lot
more<00:02:56.680> respect<00:02:57.250> for<00:02:57.400> good<00:02:57.850> ski<00:02:58.090> jumpers

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
more respect for good ski jumpers

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.930 
more respect for good ski jumpers
because<00:02:58.780> it's<00:02:58.900> all<00:02:58.989> about<00:02:59.140> flying<00:02:59.730> alright<00:03:00.730> so

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
because it's all about flying alright so

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.280 
because it's all about flying alright so

see you next time yeah the way our

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.050 
see you next time yeah the way our
tunnels<00:03:23.350> set<00:03:23.560> up<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:24.190> fans<00:03:24.400> are<00:03:24.579> actually<00:03:24.700> on

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
tunnels set up the fans are actually on

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.390 
tunnels set up the fans are actually on
top<00:03:25.299> of<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.600> tunnel<00:03:25.780> not<00:03:26.079> below<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:27.220> whole

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
top of the tunnel not below the whole

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.039 
top of the tunnel not below the whole
building<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.910> actually<00:03:28.239> part<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.630> tunnel

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
building is actually part of the tunnel

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.509 
building is actually part of the tunnel
we<00:03:29.200> have<00:03:29.320> built<00:03:29.530> columns<00:03:29.920> down<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.220> side<00:03:30.400> of

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
we have built columns down the side of

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.330 
we have built columns down the side of
the<00:03:30.609> wall<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.720> basically<00:03:32.200> those<00:03:32.440> fans<00:03:32.739> sup<00:03:33.070> era

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
the wall so basically those fans sup era

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.069 
the wall so basically those fans sup era
shoot<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:33.850> down<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.269> sides<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.750> building

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
shoot it down the sides of the building

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.449 
shoot it down the sides of the building
and<00:03:35.260> back<00:03:35.380> up<00:03:35.560> through<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.739> basement<00:03:35.980> so<00:03:36.430> it

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
and back up through the basement so it

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.789 
and back up through the basement so it
cuts<00:03:36.730> out<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:36.880> turbulence<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:38.350> cuts<00:03:38.620> out<00:03:38.769> the

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
cuts out the turbulence it cuts out the

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.130 
cuts out the turbulence it cuts out the
dead<00:03:39.130> space

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
dead space
