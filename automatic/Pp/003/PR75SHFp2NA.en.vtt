00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello how are we going to try one today 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.180
 Tablet 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.019
 and that if a tablet of these as 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.750
 to draw 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:18.410
 digitally this is a genius tablet 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.360
 comes with this pencil and the model of the 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.669
 tablet with summer 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.620
 behind is the model genius 6 and penn and 405 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.630
 x 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.360
 as well 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.440
 as well as that sometimes you want to try for 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.140
 see if it does not draw better on the computer 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.440
 I borrowed this tablet to prove it a 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.420
 friend Gonzalo which told me good 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.219
 use it going to use a lot so let's see 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.640
 has a usb connection port and what 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.640
 let's connect 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.150
 and it is already 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.970
 the interface recognizes it automatically 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.030
 I have not required right driver for 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.450
 install it and this is windows xp service 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.990
 pack 3 and I'm going to open a program can 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.540
 work with pain that I use more 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.090
 Fireworks have a firewall to use something 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.010
 try it out let's try it with your pencil 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.540
 optical and this apparently is like 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.970
 out a mouse 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.030
 almost the same 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.740
 but this is more for the drawing 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.630
 let's see I'm not very expert with this 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.870
 but apparently with practice it 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.850
 achieve much co see that there is a square 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.440
 that apparently come to be the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.990
 limits of the screen this is as if 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.610
 outside the screen and these little buttons that 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.020
 they are here apparently serve to use 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.780
 organ function as photoshop for 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.210
 make some automatic tools 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.920
 set can be configured I do not know 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.910
 so basically I'm just going to 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.910
 draw to see what happens 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.250
 I go to the screen 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.510
 we have a drawing on the fly see that no 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.750
 come out 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.750
 we want to draw a landscape and let's see 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.120
 let's change color 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.400
 black color is 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.960
 do not take out 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.910
 Black school is fine 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.150
 and good to see 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.020
 more brush ok 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.330
 Yes now 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.890
 well let's draw something fast in 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.460
 because as you see it can be a 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.460
 landscape 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.950
 apparently this is as if it were 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.900
 draw with a pencil of this facility 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.470
 draw it easily 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.520
 if we have a couple of hills 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.520
 a river here 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.340
 a few little plants 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.230
 the ease of use comes with the 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.709
 practice I good just practice very 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.709
 little bit and well apparently 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.819
 already improved a little at the beginning 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.859
 it's a bit strange 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.299
 I did not know how to use these very well 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.719
 numbers was not taken out let's put a 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.719
 little color 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.400
 and this could be the river 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.270
 let's put color quickly 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.670
 obviously with the tools of 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.200
 photoshop you can use as a concert 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.460
 crop that has two buttons but in 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.440
 I do not really know how to use them 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.270
 press them, let's see what pressure 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.720
 a menu comes out on one side entrusting the 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.900
 right click on the other one bar like 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.420
 to move up and down 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.790
 but I do not know maybe to confirm the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.790
 confusions we put ourselves a bit more 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.340
 efe 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.340
 along 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.680
 it's easy to draw anything artistic 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.010
 really this is like a sketch 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.720
 nothing more than a landscape 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.720
 they are not green colors here 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.500
 to paint the tree 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.220
 by stoning 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.160
 ready 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.880
 what color do we put the good hills that 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.010
 they stay there 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.080
 a little greener here 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.520
 in chains that before 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.520
 monthly yellow 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.630
 is something interesting at least 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.630
 noticeable 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.170
 the color has given some life to the 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.170
 graphic we put the yellow sun 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.420
 and that 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.400
 they will catch 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:54.540
 at least 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:57.180
 If preaching is easy, this is the 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.550
 screen and this is what allows us 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.060
 do intervenimos has two buttons here 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.540
 sometimes without having light 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.630
 but 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.360
 I do not know what the two buttons are for 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.680
 well that has been a small revision 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.120
 this tablet that allows us 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 apparently having an interface 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.840
 drawing easier as if it were a 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.030
 pencil is drawn on paper or in 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.740
 the track was much easier to draw 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.400
 jonze great cartoonist but I try that 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.790
 that's it 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.790
 Thank you
