tough line braid and eight and eight is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.900 
tough line braid and eight and eight is
really<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> size<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.009> like<00:01:14.160> to<00:01:14.310> use<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> smaller

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
really the size I like to use a smaller

really the size I like to use a smaller
the<00:01:15.149> diameter<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> better<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.350> still<00:01:16.649> has

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the diameter the better but still has

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.249 
the diameter the better but still has
great<00:01:17.190> knot<00:01:17.430> strength<00:01:17.910> I<00:01:18.180> use<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> knot<00:01:19.020> called

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
great knot strength I use a knot called

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.650 
great knot strength I use a knot called
a<00:01:19.350> Tony<00:01:19.590> Pina<00:01:19.950> knot<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.610> really<00:01:21.360> small

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
a Tony Pina knot it's a really small

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.450 
a Tony Pina knot it's a really small
knot<00:01:21.929> not<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> easiest<00:01:22.649> one<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.950> tie<00:01:23.190> but<00:01:23.399> I

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
knot not the easiest one to tie but I

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.570 
knot not the easiest one to tie but I
believe<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:23.910> the<00:01:24.000> strongest<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.690> smallest

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
believe it's the strongest and smallest

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.950 
believe it's the strongest and smallest
