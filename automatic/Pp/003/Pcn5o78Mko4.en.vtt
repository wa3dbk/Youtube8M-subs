00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
measured distance between two points

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.069 
measured distance between two points
we'll<00:02:25.170> click<00:02:25.439> on<00:02:25.620> our<00:02:26.010> zoom<00:02:26.879> in<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:27.299> we'll

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
we'll click on our zoom in here we'll

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.509 
we'll click on our zoom in here we'll
get<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.439> top<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.920> helmet<00:02:29.069> here

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
get to the top of the helmet here

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.830 
get to the top of the helmet here
because<00:02:30.000> that's<00:02:30.150> where<00:02:30.299> our<00:02:30.329> head<00:02:30.540> would<00:02:30.719> be

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
because that's where our head would be

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.750 
because that's where our head would be
more<00:02:31.079> or<00:02:31.230> less<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.769> we're<00:02:32.400> going<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.549> click

okay so if our head is 13 and that's 330

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.470 
okay so if our head is 13 and that's 330
when<00:02:52.439> you<00:02:52.530> go<00:02:52.620> ahead<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.010> add<00:02:53.310> 20<00:02:53.579> for<00:02:53.909> that<00:02:54.060> to

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
when you go ahead and add 20 for that to

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.569 
when you go ahead and add 20 for that to
make<00:02:54.629> up<00:02:54.750> for<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.989> mohawk<00:02:56.659> so<00:02:58.129> we<00:02:59.129> are<00:02:59.219> now<00:02:59.400> at

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
make up for the mohawk so we are now at

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.979 
make up for the mohawk so we are now at
350<00:03:01.400> millimeters<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.609> then<00:03:03.060> we'll<00:03:03.810> go<00:03:03.959> back

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989

little zipper the dividing connect
button<00:04:15.269> going<00:04:15.930> ahead<00:04:16.109> click<00:04:16.530> on<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:16.889> I'm

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
button going ahead click on that I'm

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.000 
button going ahead click on that I'm
gonna<00:04:17.549> zoom<00:04:17.909> in<00:04:18.120> onto<00:04:18.359> my<00:04:18.599> pieces<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.260> just

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
gonna zoom in onto my pieces and just

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.969 
gonna zoom in onto my pieces and just
start<00:04:20.279> breaking<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.000> apart<00:04:21.529> where<00:04:22.529> I<00:04:22.560> think<00:04:22.740> it

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
start breaking it apart where I think it

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:23.950 
start breaking it apart where I think it
would<00:04:23.070> make

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
would make

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.170 
would make
easy<00:04:24.960> work<00:04:25.290> for<00:04:25.500> me<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.680> do<00:04:25.860> if<00:04:26.730> you<00:04:26.850> just<00:04:27.000> hover

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
easy work for me to do if you just hover

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.300 
easy work for me to do if you just hover
over<00:04:27.510> a<00:04:27.810> section<00:04:28.110> it'll<00:04:28.500> show<00:04:28.680> you<00:04:28.740> where<00:04:29.070> that

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
over a section it'll show you where that

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.600 
over a section it'll show you where that
piece<00:04:29.490> would<00:04:29.670> attach<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.320> so<00:04:31.320> I<00:04:31.680> see<00:04:32.460> this

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
piece would attach to so I see this

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.460 
piece would attach to so I see this
piece<00:04:32.820> right<00:04:33.000> here<00:04:33.060> attaches<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.720> this<00:04:33.870> one<00:04:34.140> so

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
piece right here attaches to this one so

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.380 
piece right here attaches to this one so
I'll<00:04:34.800> go<00:04:34.950> ahead<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.160> disconnect<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.730> and

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
I'll go ahead and disconnect that and

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.870 
I'll go ahead and disconnect that and
I'll<00:04:36.510> bring<00:04:36.690> these<00:04:36.900> together<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:38.430> same<00:04:38.670> with

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
I'll bring these together the same with

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.180 
I'll bring these together the same with
this<00:04:39.090> bring<00:04:39.450> this<00:04:39.570> together<00:04:39.900> because<00:04:40.710> bigger

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
this bring this together because bigger

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.220 
this bring this together because bigger
pieces<00:04:41.520> means<00:04:42.150> less<00:04:42.480> I<00:04:42.600> have<00:04:42.660> to<00:04:42.720> cut<00:04:42.960> out<00:04:42.990> and

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
pieces means less I have to cut out and

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.080 
pieces means less I have to cut out and
work<00:04:43.320> with<00:04:43.350> later<00:04:43.740> so<00:04:44.700> we'll<00:04:44.820> just<00:04:44.940> go<00:04:45.030> ahead

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
work with later so we'll just go ahead

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.300 
work with later so we'll just go ahead
and<00:04:45.240> start<00:04:45.360> moving<00:04:45.510> our<00:04:45.690> pieces<00:04:45.870> up<00:04:46.140> and<00:04:46.350> it

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
and start moving our pieces up and it

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.890 
and start moving our pieces up and it
doesn't<00:04:47.700> fit<00:04:47.820> within<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.210> parameters<00:04:48.420> here

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
doesn't fit within the parameters here

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.290 
doesn't fit within the parameters here
of<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.110> page<00:04:49.320> so<00:04:50.100> I<00:04:50.130> can<00:04:50.340> do<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.760> couple<00:04:51.210> things

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
of the page so I can do a couple things

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.060 
of the page so I can do a couple things
I<00:04:51.510> can<00:04:51.660> either<00:04:51.750> just<00:04:51.960> flip<00:04:52.290> it<00:04:52.470> one<00:04:52.620> way<00:04:52.770> 90

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
I can either just flip it one way 90

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.840 
I can either just flip it one way 90
degrees<00:04:53.750> drag<00:04:54.750> it<00:04:54.900> over<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.350> now<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:55.800> fits<00:04:56.070> so

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
degrees drag it over and now it fits so

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.480 
degrees drag it over and now it fits so
we<00:04:56.910> can<00:04:57.030> go<00:04:57.120> ahead<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:57.300> bring<00:04:57.480> our<00:04:57.600> pieces<00:04:57.870> up

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
we can go ahead and bring our pieces up

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:06.610 
we can go ahead and bring our pieces up
but<00:04:59.490> let's<00:05:00.270> say<00:05:01.760> we<00:05:02.760> have<00:05:03.530> just<00:05:04.530> a<00:05:04.710> completely

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
but let's say we have just a completely

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.740 
but let's say we have just a completely
odd<00:05:07.620> piece<00:05:10.370> so<00:05:11.370> let's<00:05:12.120> just<00:05:12.270> grab<00:05:12.420> this<00:05:12.540> piece

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
odd piece so let's just grab this piece

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.980 
odd piece so let's just grab this piece
for<00:05:12.960> instance<00:05:13.760> it<00:05:14.760> does<00:05:14.970> fit<00:05:15.150> like<00:05:15.300> this<00:05:15.540> but

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
for instance it does fit like this but

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.470 
for instance it does fit like this but
it's<00:05:16.110> also<00:05:16.230> kind<00:05:16.530> of<00:05:16.590> crooked<00:05:17.040> so<00:05:18.030> if<00:05:18.180> we<00:05:18.300> come

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
it's also kind of crooked so if we come

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.330 
it's also kind of crooked so if we come
here<00:05:18.630> to<00:05:18.720> the<00:05:18.750> rotate<00:05:19.170> parts<00:05:19.470> tool<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:20.100> little

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
here to the rotate parts tool the little

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.280 
here to the rotate parts tool the little
three<00:05:20.580> dots<00:05:20.610> all<00:05:21.000> connected<00:05:21.390> together<00:05:21.510> these

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
three dots all connected together these

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.690 
three dots all connected together these
pop<00:05:22.590> up<00:05:22.800> so<00:05:22.920> I'll<00:05:23.010> click<00:05:23.190> on<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.400> first<00:05:23.430> one

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
pop up so I'll click on the first one

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.610 
pop up so I'll click on the first one
click<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:24.750> hold<00:05:24.870> on<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.140> second<00:05:25.440> piece<00:05:25.590> and

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
click and hold on the second piece and

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.920 
click and hold on the second piece and
we<00:05:25.800> can<00:05:25.950> freely<00:05:26.250> rotate<00:05:26.400> this<00:05:27.060> in<00:05:27.300> any

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
we can freely rotate this in any

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.050 
we can freely rotate this in any
direction<00:05:28.280> so<00:05:29.280> now<00:05:29.310> let's<00:05:29.610> just<00:05:29.640> get<00:05:29.850> it<00:05:29.970> to

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
direction so now let's just get it to

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.690 
direction so now let's just get it to
stand<00:05:30.210> up<00:05:30.360> a<00:05:30.480> bit<00:05:30.690> more<00:05:30.870> straight<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:32.580> then

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
stand up a bit more straight and then

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.860 
stand up a bit more straight and then
we'll<00:05:32.820> go<00:05:32.940> ahead<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.120> move<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.450> piece<00:05:33.630> over

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
we'll go ahead and move the piece over

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.770 
we'll go ahead and move the piece over
and<00:05:34.410> now<00:05:34.560> we<00:05:34.620> have<00:05:34.860> plenty<00:05:35.070> of<00:05:35.220> room<00:05:35.520> to<00:05:36.510> add<00:05:36.630> in

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
and now we have plenty of room to add in

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.280 
and now we have plenty of room to add in
other<00:05:36.930> pieces<00:05:37.230> in<00:05:38.210> now<00:05:39.210> just<00:05:39.720> be<00:05:39.870> careful<00:05:40.200> when

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
other pieces in now just be careful when

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.860 
other pieces in now just be careful when
getting<00:05:40.440> to<00:05:40.530> these<00:05:40.710> clothes<00:05:41.070> edges<00:05:41.550> I<00:05:41.670> always

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
getting to these clothes edges I always

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.630 
getting to these clothes edges I always
go<00:05:42.870> a<00:05:42.900> couple<00:05:43.350> areas<00:05:43.710> away<00:05:44.100> with<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.460> arrow

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
go a couple areas away with the arrow

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.660 
go a couple areas away with the arrow
keys<00:05:45.170> just<00:05:46.170> so<00:05:46.290> that<00:05:46.440> way<00:05:46.620> I<00:05:46.920> don't<00:05:47.370> think

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
keys just so that way I don't think

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.460 
keys just so that way I don't think
it'll<00:05:48.180> be<00:05:48.420> printed<00:05:48.750> off<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:48.870> page<00:05:49.200> because

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
it'll be printed off the page because

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.780 
it'll be printed off the page because
sometimes<00:05:49.830> it<00:05:49.980> will<00:05:50.010> be<00:05:50.220> it's<00:05:50.400> not<00:05:50.580> perfect<00:05:51.440> so

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
sometimes it will be it's not perfect so

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.010 
sometimes it will be it's not perfect so
I'm<00:05:53.790> not<00:05:53.970> gonna<00:05:54.090> make<00:05:54.180> you<00:05:54.420> guys<00:05:54.510> watch<00:05:54.780> me

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
I'm not gonna make you guys watch me

a quick basics of how to do it and

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.040 
a quick basics of how to do it and
before<00:05:59.730> you<00:05:59.880> print<00:06:00.180> remember<00:06:00.660> to<00:06:00.720> always<00:06:00.840> go

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
before you print remember to always go

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.150 
before you print remember to always go
to<00:06:01.110> file<00:06:01.440> and<00:06:02.120> print<00:06:03.120> preview<00:06:03.830> when<00:06:04.830> this<00:06:04.980> pops

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
to file and print preview when this pops

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.460 
to file and print preview when this pops
up<00:06:05.400> a<00:06:05.730> part<00:06:06.390> of<00:06:06.450> development<00:06:06.960> may<00:06:07.080> not<00:06:07.230> fit<00:06:07.380> on

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
up a part of development may not fit on

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.170 
up a part of development may not fit on
the<00:06:07.530> particular<00:06:07.890> area<00:06:08.070> just<00:06:08.340> scale<00:06:08.550> know<00:06:08.970> cuz

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
the particular area just scale know cuz

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.340 
the particular area just scale know cuz
we<00:06:09.270> already<00:06:09.450> set<00:06:09.660> the<00:06:09.750> scale<00:06:09.990> to<00:06:10.020> what<00:06:10.230> we

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
we already set the scale to what we

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.230 
we already set the scale to what we
wanted<00:06:10.650> it<00:06:10.800> so<00:06:11.370> then<00:06:11.520> just<00:06:11.760> go<00:06:11.850> through<00:06:12.120> and

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
wanted it so then just go through and

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.930 
wanted it so then just go through and
make<00:06:12.390> sure<00:06:12.770> that<00:06:13.770> all<00:06:14.010> your<00:06:14.040> pieces<00:06:14.250> are

work with but if now when you zoom in
you'll<00:06:36.720> have

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
you'll have

you'll have
all<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.800> ID<00:06:38.610> pieces<00:06:39.210> here<00:06:39.360> so<00:06:39.390> you<00:06:39.600> know<00:06:39.720> what

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
all the ID pieces here so you know what

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.030 
all the ID pieces here so you know what
pieces<00:06:40.290> connect<00:06:40.650> where<00:06:40.920> and<00:06:42.740> there's<00:06:43.740> a<00:06:43.830> few

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
pieces connect where and there's a few

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.650 
pieces connect where and there's a few
other<00:06:44.190> tricks<00:06:44.550> I<00:06:44.820> can<00:06:45.060> show<00:06:45.330> you<00:06:45.390> right<00:06:45.600> now

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
working with one big solid piece like

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.320 
working with one big solid piece like
this<00:06:54.540> right<00:06:54.810> here<00:06:55.220> you<00:06:56.220> don't<00:06:56.400> want<00:06:56.670> to<00:06:57.240> have

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
this right here you don't want to have

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.650 
this right here you don't want to have
to<00:06:57.510> cut<00:06:57.840> cut<00:06:58.020> cut<00:06:58.260> go<00:06:58.560> in<00:06:58.770> dip<00:06:59.070> cut<00:06:59.400> cut<00:06:59.730> cut<00:06:59.970> you

to cut cut cut go in dip cut cut cut you

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.390 
to cut cut cut go in dip cut cut cut you
want<00:07:00.810> everything<00:07:01.080> to<00:07:01.110> be<00:07:01.200> on<00:07:01.290> one<00:07:01.500> side<00:07:01.530> so

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
want everything to be on one side so

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.430 
want everything to be on one side so
just<00:07:02.520> hit<00:07:02.850> this<00:07:03.060> v<00:07:03.420> button<00:07:03.720> in<00:07:03.840> right<00:07:04.020> here<00:07:04.230> a

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
just hit this v button in right here a

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.100 
just hit this v button in right here a
little<00:07:04.890> person<00:07:05.280> next<00:07:05.430> to<00:07:05.550> the<00:07:05.820> book<00:07:06.750> is<00:07:06.930> what

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
little person next to the book is what

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.530 
little person next to the book is what
it<00:07:07.200> looks<00:07:07.380> like<00:07:07.500> to<00:07:07.650> me<00:07:07.800> and<00:07:08.040> it<00:07:08.550> says<00:07:08.880> a<00:07:09.120> flap

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:09.540 
it looks like to me and it says a flap

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.440 
it looks like to me and it says a flap
tool<00:07:09.810> switch<00:07:10.260> so<00:07:11.070> if<00:07:11.220> you<00:07:11.280> do<00:07:11.370> that<00:07:11.550> see<00:07:12.270> right

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.450 
tool switch so if you do that see right

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.390 
tool switch so if you do that see right
here<00:07:12.600> how<00:07:12.780> the<00:07:13.470> flops<00:07:13.740> currently<00:07:14.100> on<00:07:14.190> this

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 
here how the flops currently on this

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.340 
here how the flops currently on this
side<00:07:14.610> go<00:07:15.300> ahead<00:07:15.330> and<00:07:15.480> click<00:07:15.690> on<00:07:15.810> that<00:07:15.960> it'll

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
side go ahead and click on that it'll

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.870 
side go ahead and click on that it'll
drag<00:07:16.590> to<00:07:16.740> this<00:07:16.860> side<00:07:17.100> so<00:07:17.280> now<00:07:17.370> you<00:07:17.430> can<00:07:17.700> just<00:07:17.760> do

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 
drag to this side so now you can just do

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.630 
drag to this side so now you can just do
a<00:07:17.940> clean<00:07:18.150> cut<00:07:18.480> down<00:07:18.750> that<00:07:19.020> way<00:07:19.280> and<00:07:20.280> we<00:07:20.400> can

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:20.640 
a clean cut down that way and we can

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.060 
a clean cut down that way and we can
move<00:07:20.940> move<00:07:21.630> this<00:07:21.900> one<00:07:22.110> out<00:07:22.230> of<00:07:22.290> here<00:07:22.410> and<00:07:22.710> bring

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.070 
move move this one out of here and bring

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.000 
move move this one out of here and bring
this<00:07:23.250> one<00:07:23.490> in<00:07:24.170> so<00:07:25.170> now<00:07:25.380> we<00:07:25.440> just<00:07:25.530> have<00:07:25.680> a<00:07:25.770> clean

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.010 
this one in so now we just have a clean

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.290 
this one in so now we just have a clean
cut<00:07:26.220> down<00:07:26.400> here<00:07:26.640> and<00:07:26.730> then<00:07:26.820> we<00:07:26.940> have<00:07:27.030> all<00:07:27.150> our

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
cut down here and then we have all our

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.220 
cut down here and then we have all our
flaps<00:07:27.540> on<00:07:27.750> one<00:07:27.990> side<00:07:28.640> so<00:07:29.640> this<00:07:30.240> is<00:07:30.300> step<00:07:30.720> two<00:07:30.990> on

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.230 
flaps on one side so this is step two on

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.430 
flaps on one side so this is step two on
making<00:07:32.220> your<00:07:32.340> pepakura<00:07:32.790> pieces<00:07:33.300> stay<00:07:34.230> tuned

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 
making your pepakura pieces stay tuned

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.910 
making your pepakura pieces stay tuned
for<00:07:34.680> step<00:07:34.920> three<00:07:35.250> until<00:07:36.060> then<00:07:36.350> I'll<00:07:37.350> see<00:07:37.560> you

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:37.920 
for step three until then I'll see you

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.340 
for step three until then I'll see you
next<00:07:37.950> time
