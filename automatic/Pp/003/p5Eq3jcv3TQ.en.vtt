00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.130

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.999
 took place the dreamhack and I came back 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.710
 with a great gift that I would like you 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:25.349
 introduce a little and also talk to you 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.449
 old helmets that I could have 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.089
 since since my partnership with them 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.899
 so already to start 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.059
 currently I am also with a 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.370
 headphones at 50 so that's the a50 I've 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.859
 received so it's a wireless headset that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.510
 send pate 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.039
 know that this helmet is a pure 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.899
 happiness the bass are phew 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.550
 so that's the gene of 1 there are two 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.649
 generations ago there is generation 1 so 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.969
 my old helmet fucking a generation 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.980
 which is a case castro to 40 pink so 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.179
 with son 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.100
 I also have a 40 gen2 so that one 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:00.239
 it's the frozen one she 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.699
 I was getting ready for the video 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.620
 so here's the a50 that I have here it's 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.410
 also a gene 2 is that of ce2 pic 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.740
 he won at a heroes tournament 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.950
 form that was carried out in December 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.410
 So therefore that's what I want 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.660
 to do in this video it's just you 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.160
 show a little why I like these 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.970
 helmets 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.860
 know it's a video I tell you 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.090
 sincerely what I think if I do not 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.720
 not think all that I will not realize 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.610
 this video 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.380
 so here you have seen I am a little 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.710
 own astros t-shirt around 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.000
 of quattro brews the astros here I am 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.750
 am told for the video that would do it 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.750
 so 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.500
 so re bank of bowl for me my 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.940
 headset had no battery 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.220
 so it happens to me very rarely 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.800
 normally he warns though but that's it 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.240
 so that we can talk to had 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.890
 flaws but it's not it's not a real 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.840
 lack of what I said so 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.240
 talk about what cases at age 5 so I 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.720
 received this headphone during the dreamhack 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.460
 because I had a generation one 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.050
 which I needed a generation 2 so I 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.990
 chose the 50 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.420
 why because this helmet helmet 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.180
 wireless I can go to the room 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.680
 bath on their balconies everywhere in 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.660
 the apartment with the helmet I can 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.170
 do the dishes while listening to the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.940
 music 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.610
 and frankly that makes the whole 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.780
 difference here so suddenly I want a 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.030
 can you introduce how it's going 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.860
 so I'm going to open it in front of you we're going 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.220
 test it see what's in it for 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.110
 convince you to buy it so here 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.120
 already know that when you receive 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.410
 your helmet so inside you 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.120
 have this beautiful box that I have 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.400
 kept so that was the box of 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.440
 world miss at 40 rose of the year 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.250
 last so the box and like to this 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.950
 magnificent 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.840
 the helmet is well put in with 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.570
 all you need and the wires etc etc 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.900
 so already me when I saw how 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:00.080
 got wrapped up I did ok I keep it 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.570
 I am in love so we will open 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.560
 this one so it's exactly the same 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.360
 that one but with a color 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.770
 different 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.560
 so I'm not very good at 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.900
 open the boxes it'll be funny to 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.320
 the one to this one I might have had 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.320
 take a hit 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.970
 so as I wanted to say beautiful 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:30.090
 personal box to fans 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:35.820
 and then it's on the other side we're going 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:37.710
 the open hockey as I say them the 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.350
 headphones super well from below one and 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.950
 not to say it's white it's white 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.030
 with vieira because it is lighter 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.440
 than the one I have on my head but I 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.920
 think it's in my head 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.500
 so here I show you a little bit so 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.150
 it's very simple headphone lights here it 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.560
 there is a little button here and here you 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.950
 can adjust the sound as you have 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.660
 desire 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:05.490
 and underneath you have the volume 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:09.120
 done tuned so you can more 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.510
 do a lot of things with one and for the 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.550
 to connect to the pc is the ease itself 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.650
 know this little box 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.200
 so I have a tool here that turns on and 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.760
 since frozen on the head 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.610
 you have so case here that you connect 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.900
 by a usb socket that is below 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.350
 the box underneath and it works 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.090
 alone 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.550
 here after you just have to plug in 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.980
 your headphones and so off to my 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.380
 notice will have to recharge the battery 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.900
 frankly I'm very happy what 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.890
 what is it then me the one 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.880
 that I have on the head it's not me who l 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.390
 opened so I was a little bit 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.990
 sad 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:50.340
 so there we have cable I do not know what it's 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.290
 will match will I look will go 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.390
 housings at his request to screw and for 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.740
 tidy up this day nothing that serves me I do not 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.800
 do not know I do not know the use 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.350
 of all that I have seen here that I have 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.580
 received finally I kidnapped just a helmet 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.860
 for the time being 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.390
 even if you have to find 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.180
 the use of all this so here I am 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.790
 just go to link it with with this 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.930
 small cable to charge you 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:19.300
 turn it on you connect it to your pc 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:23.319
 and that's all that's it and it works 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:26.050
 it's nickel so unfortunately I do not 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:27.729
 can not you do a diot test since 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.919
 it's up to you in my opinion it's up to you to 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.120
 test it for those who were there at the 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.560
 dreamhack you could have the opportunity 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.150
 to test this headset I was trying to 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.210
 bring back a few more people can the 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.400
 test any case know that at home 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.229

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.550
 astros at 40 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.610
 I think he just bought the a50 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.039
 that can convince you that was the 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.500
