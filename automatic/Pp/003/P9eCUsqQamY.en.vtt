years<00:00:39.719> ago<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.290> left<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.370> career<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.760> astronomy

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
years ago I left a career in astronomy

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.990 
years ago I left a career in astronomy
because<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.500> thought<00:00:43.710> there<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.100> only<00:00:44.129> one<00:00:44.760> way

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
because I thought there was only one way

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.600 
because I thought there was only one way
to<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.480> scientist<00:00:46.050> there<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.129> only<00:00:47.280> one

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
to be a scientist there was only one

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.520 
to be a scientist there was only one
kind<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.000> person<00:00:48.539> who<00:00:48.690> could<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> scientist

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
kind of person who could be a scientist

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.630 
kind of person who could be a scientist
and<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.370> wasn't<00:00:50.700> me<00:00:51.649> today<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.949> know<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:53.610> is

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and it wasn't me today I know there is

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.510 
and it wasn't me today I know there is
not<00:00:53.879> only<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.480> way<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> scientist<00:00:55.680> just

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
not only one way to be a scientist just

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.520 
not only one way to be a scientist just
like<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> researcher<00:00:57.750> I've<00:00:57.989> discovered

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
like as a researcher I've discovered

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.170 
like as a researcher I've discovered
that<00:00:58.800> ice<00:00:59.090> doesn't<00:01:00.090> behave<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.809> only<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.379> way

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
that ice doesn't behave in only one way

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.030 
that ice doesn't behave in only one way
say<00:01:03.180> there's<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.480> planet<00:01:04.019> orbiting<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.769> Sun

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
say there's a planet orbiting the Sun

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.270 
say there's a planet orbiting the Sun
with<00:01:05.460> some<00:01:05.670> bright<00:01:05.880> white<00:01:06.210> ice<00:01:06.479> at<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.780> poles

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
with some bright white ice at the poles

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.130 
with some bright white ice at the poles
most<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.580> sun's<00:01:08.820> light<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.420> light<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.049> we

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
most of the sun's light is light that we

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.160 
most of the sun's light is light that we
can<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:10.619> with<00:01:10.770> our<00:01:10.830> eyes<00:01:10.979> visible<00:01:11.640> light<00:01:12.170> ice

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
can see with our eyes visible light ice

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.320 
can see with our eyes visible light ice
on<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.619> planet<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.430> going<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> act<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.180> this

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
on that planet is going to act like this

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.109 
on that planet is going to act like this
white<00:01:15.810> shirt<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.400> reflect<00:01:17.400> most<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
white shirt and reflect most of the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.630 
white shirt and reflect most of the
visible<00:01:18.540> light<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.930> hits<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:20.460> ice

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
visible light that hits it if that ice

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.820 
visible light that hits it if that ice
could<00:01:20.939> talk<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.930> would<00:01:22.020> say<00:01:22.170> something<00:01:22.680> like

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
could talk it would say something like

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.520 
could talk it would say something like
this<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> sun's<00:01:23.880> visible<00:01:24.180> light<00:01:24.600> okay

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
this to the sun's visible light okay

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.810 
this to the sun's visible light okay
thanks<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.939> no<00:01:27.270> thanks<00:01:28.130> like<00:01:29.130> light<00:01:29.610> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
thanks but like no thanks like light is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.899 
thanks but like no thanks like light is
energy<00:01:30.390> an<00:01:30.600> energy<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.380> heat<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.700> I'm

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
energy an energy can heat so like I'm

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.940 
energy an energy can heat so like I'm
going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> take<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.200> your<00:01:34.409> light<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
going to take a little of your light and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.700 
going to take a little of your light and
give<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> rest<00:01:35.909> back<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.290> don't<00:01:37.470> want

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
give you the rest back like I don't want

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.060 
give you the rest back like I don't want
to<00:01:37.799> melt<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.460> want<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> grow<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.860> more

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to melt I want to grow and the more

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.800 
to melt I want to grow and the more
light<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.549> ice<00:01:41.729> reflects<00:01:42.329> back<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.630> space

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
light that ice reflects back to space

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.950 
light that ice reflects back to space
the<00:01:43.710> less<00:01:43.950> light<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.430> absorbs<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.450> cold<00:01:45.780> or

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the less light it absorbs the cold or

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.219 
the less light it absorbs the cold or
the<00:01:46.020> planet<00:01:46.320> gets<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:47.250> more<00:01:47.520> ice<00:01:47.729> forms<00:01:48.360> my

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the planet gets the more ice forms my

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.319 
the planet gets the more ice forms my
research<00:01:49.799> has<00:01:49.829> shown<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.460> without<00:01:51.000> any

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
research has shown that without any

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.330 
research has shown that without any
greenhouse<00:01:51.689> gases<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.619> atmosphere<00:01:52.649> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.609 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to
keep<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> planet<00:01:54.030> warm<00:01:54.270> planets<00:01:55.229> around

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
keep the planet warm planets around

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
keep the planet warm planets around
stars<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.399> are<00:01:56.460> even<00:01:56.670> brighter<00:01:57.149> than<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
stars that are even brighter than the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.179 
stars that are even brighter than the
Sun<00:01:57.750> could<00:01:58.560> become<00:01:58.740> ice-covered<00:01:59.719> snowballs

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
Sun could become ice-covered snowballs

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.010 
Sun could become ice-covered snowballs
but<00:02:02.189> see<00:02:02.369> here's<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.670> thing<00:02:02.759> ice<00:02:03.540> doesn't

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
but see here's the thing ice doesn't

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.350 
but see here's the thing ice doesn't
treat<00:02:04.409> all<00:02:04.619> types<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.250> light<00:02:05.490> equally<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
treat all types of light equally it

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.260 
treat all types of light equally it
doesn't<00:02:07.020> behave<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.469> only<00:02:07.649> one<00:02:08.039> way<00:02:08.270> let's

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
doesn't behave in only one way let's

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.330 
doesn't behave in only one way let's
take<00:02:09.509> stars<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.259> are<00:02:10.319> cooler<00:02:10.679> than<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.099> Sun

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
take stars that are cooler than the Sun

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.550 
take stars that are cooler than the Sun
most<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.209> their<00:02:12.420> light<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.080> for

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
most of their light is in for

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.699 
most of their light is in for

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
planet orbiting a much cooler star is

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.110 
planet orbiting a much cooler star is
going<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.500> act<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:19.800> these<00:02:20.160> black<00:02:20.520> pants

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
going to act like these black pants

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.320 
going to act like these black pants
towards<00:02:21.750> infrared<00:02:22.290> light<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.880> ice<00:02:24.030> could

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
towards infrared light if that ice could

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.120 
towards infrared light if that ice could
talk<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.900> would<00:02:25.170> say<00:02:25.349> something<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:26.010> little

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
talk it would say something a little

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.550 
talk it would say something a little
different<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.060> stars<00:02:27.360> infrared<00:02:27.930> light<00:02:28.110> it

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
different to it stars infrared light it

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.530 
different to it stars infrared light it
would<00:02:28.739> say<00:02:28.970> come<00:02:29.970> on<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.209> baby<00:02:30.720> i<00:02:31.849> want<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:33.300> i

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
would say come on in baby i want you i

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.910 
would say come on in baby i want you i
need<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.200> i<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.459> have<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:36.650> don't<00:02:37.650> worry

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
need you i have to have you don't worry

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.009 
need you i have to have you don't worry
baby<00:02:38.069> I'm<00:02:38.640> not<00:02:38.880> gonna<00:02:39.030> reject<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.989> and

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
baby I'm not gonna reject you and

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.360 
baby I'm not gonna reject you and
reflect<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:41.099> I'm<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:42.030> absorb<00:02:42.260> you

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
reflect you I'm going to absorb you

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.350 
reflect you I'm going to absorb you
that's<00:02:44.370> how<00:02:44.760> much<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.420> love<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:48.090> more

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
that's how much I love you and the more

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.050 
that's how much I love you and the more
light<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.959> ice<00:02:49.170> absorbs<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.370> warmer<00:02:50.880> that

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
light that ice absorbs the warmer that

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.960 
light that ice absorbs the warmer that
planet<00:02:51.569> gets<00:02:51.780> remember<00:02:52.560> light<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.100> energy<00:02:53.730> and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
planet gets remember light is energy and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.600 
planet gets remember light is energy and
energy<00:02:54.480> heats<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.410> warmer<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:55.980> planet<00:02:56.430> gets

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
energy heats the warmer that planet gets

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.539 
energy heats the warmer that planet gets
what's<00:02:57.420> going<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.660> happen<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.290> ice<00:02:58.549> it's

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
what's going to happen to that ice it's

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.270 
what's going to happen to that ice it's
going<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.819> melt<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:01.380> what<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.739> means<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:02.220> that

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
going to melt so what this means is that

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.789 
going to melt so what this means is that
we<00:03:02.489> may<00:03:02.730> not<00:03:02.940> see<00:03:03.330> much<00:03:03.599> in<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.989> way<00:03:04.019> of<00:03:04.140> ice<00:03:04.500> on

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
we may not see much in the way of ice on

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.190 
we may not see much in the way of ice on
planets<00:03:05.519> orbiting<00:03:06.060> cooler<00:03:06.480> stars<00:03:06.810> and

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
planets orbiting cooler stars and

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.160 
planets orbiting cooler stars and
smaller<00:03:07.980> cooler<00:03:08.459> stars<00:03:08.940> are<00:03:09.390> most<00:03:09.840> of<00:03:10.049> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
smaller cooler stars are most of the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.650 
smaller cooler stars are most of the
stars<00:03:10.380> in<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.680> universe<00:03:10.880> so<00:03:11.880> our<00:03:12.060> planet<00:03:12.540> with

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
stars in the universe so our planet with

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.199 
stars in the universe so our planet with
it's<00:03:12.870> bright<00:03:13.110> polar<00:03:13.590> caps<00:03:13.980> could<00:03:14.760> be<00:03:14.940> pretty

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
it's bright polar caps could be pretty

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.289 
it's bright polar caps could be pretty
rare<00:03:15.650> but<00:03:16.650> as<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:16.950> found<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:17.489> my<00:03:17.640> life<00:03:17.850> there<00:03:18.180> are

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
rare but as I found in my life there are

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.750 
rare but as I found in my life there are
many<00:03:18.630> ways<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.959> be<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> scientist<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.579> there<00:03:20.730> are

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
many ways to be a scientist so there are

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.910 
many ways to be a scientist so there are
likely<00:03:21.150> many<00:03:21.780> ways<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.440> make<00:03:22.680> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
likely many ways to make a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.319 
likely many ways to make a
life-sustaining<00:03:23.519> planet<00:03:24.359> ice<00:03:24.690> or<00:03:25.109> no<00:03:25.590> ice<00:03:25.620> in

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
life-sustaining planet ice or no ice in

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.110 
life-sustaining planet ice or no ice in
science<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.900> life<00:03:28.140> there<00:03:28.680> are<00:03:28.709> always

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
science and in life there are always

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.280 
science and in life there are always
many<00:03:30.120> possible<00:03:30.959> ways<00:03:31.280> thank
