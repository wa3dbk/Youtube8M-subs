00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.680
 the suspected co-pilot hypothesis 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:13.660
 suicide that is the plane's fault the 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:17.169
 marseille prosecutor said it was the 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.110
 co-pilot maneuvered to lower the 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:23.559
 height of the plane and make it impact 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.540
 against the Alps he locked the door for 

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:28.259
 that the pilot who had gone to the bathroom 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.759
 could not re-enter can be 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.290
 deliberately edgardo ferreyra throw 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.600
 a plane 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.210
 according to what the prosecutor says if the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.070
 justice is saying that it is one of the 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.140
 pilots got up to go to the bathroom and 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.510
 when he wanted to return the one that was 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.220
 inside you locked the door feels that 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.440
 there is a leak regarding a 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.840
 official research usually 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.010
 be of interested situations the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.440
 hypotheses can be of two medium types 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.239
 rare the official version I do not know my cousin 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.190
 the suspicious one seems strange to him that 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.660
 just the pilot went to the bathroom and left 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.790
 of the cabin just before reaching the 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.340
 alpes giving the perfect opportunity to 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.650
 suicide copilot and if the pilot was not going 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.869
 to the bathroom during the whole flight if the 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.910
 pilot left the cabin when he wanted 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.650
 enter the copilot put what not 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.750
 there were new ways that what we're 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.150
 seeing is how he put what the co-pilot does not 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.190
 there is no way there is no way 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.650
 in this case I bring the door but 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.320
 talking about enclosures in east cabins 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.920
 it was the last case that shook us 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.310
 minute 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.520
 begins the rescue there in Chile in 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.580
 copied in a capsule very similar to 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.479
 I tell you, I tell you sincerely, 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.640
 sensation is not nothing nothing simple 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.920
 things always happen please 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.460
 try to understand understand in the last 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.280
 moment new tracks appeared from the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.280
 Captain Schüller's hand and his intuition 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.740
 Chucha intuit what could have happened 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.170
 so that this has ended in tragedy 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.080
 the medical exams that they do to the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.430
 pilots are are really exhaustive or 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.340
 it was germanwings it's called is a 'low 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.980
 cost 'that tells you based on cost there 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.450
 theories where he says that maybe the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.720
 supervisions that they did to the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.870
 crew members were not so deep 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:30.290
 rigorous rigorous and there may be 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:32.310
 suffered a psychotic outbreak the copilot 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.590
 we have heard the voice of many 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.490
 experts but not the most finished theory and 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.490
 refined 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.530
 sometimes you can get dirty because it's 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.530
 pressed then also roasted 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.000
 let's not take them to suicide by 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.130
 those may have willingly 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.240
 been squeezing throw it we kill you to the 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.060
 family 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.920
 what a joy 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.630
 let 's put aside at least lucid of the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.430
 bar table and let's continue with what 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.650
 our to be saw the serious problems 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.920
 of takeoff that had gelblung 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.050
 raul fernandez guys this noise without 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.250
 support I can work yes by 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.290
 favor and today a colleague of yours is about 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.840
 to confuse with a rumor that they threw in 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.519
 germany some intruders of the show 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.080
 in off the record some friends 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.810
 people who would have knowledge 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.519
 directly from him they would be saying that in 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.330
 that pothole in training that he 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.370
 had and would be for the year 2008-2009 this 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.600
 person retired and this is recognized by the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.940
 retired company left the training 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.000
 for at least six months they say 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.760
 his friends who suffered from the nameless 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.709
 syndrome forgiveness of burnout would be 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.010
 literally this one had the head 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.690
 burned that is the burnout syndrome and 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.380
 the definition that seemed shorter and 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.209
 Clearer is emotional collapse symptoms 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.599
 of prolonged stress due to factors 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.140
 chronic fatigue emotional inefficiency 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:09.010
 and the denial of what happens 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.230
 this is what some friends say 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.480
 It would have been the reason for that blip that 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.299
 he had in training the one who lived 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.690
 still with his bosses and still with his 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.690
 people 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.940
 it was an accident it was unintentional 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.940
 wanting or perhaps the copilot became the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.659
 gabriel pasternak as forgettable the 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.449
 kings for planté months excuse me that 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:46.360
 interrupted us but I was listening to the 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.270
 conversation I can not believe so much 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.000
 I was a professor of gabriel 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.230
 pasternak at school number 7 of the sea 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.140
 Sea 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.449
 I had the difficult task of communicating that 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.240
 repeated the year 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:04.840
 efe that boy had but the 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.949
 professor legisamon if they are ignacio 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.949
 Fontana remembers 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.060
 do not 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.290
 but this is incredible here there is a 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.740
 cosmic connection 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.980
 just pasternak one was a companion 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.800
 yours if someone else knows gabriel 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.240
 pasternak here 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.849
 and good 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.229
 because you are on this plane you 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.229
 they took out the passages no no 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.540
 gabriel pasternak who is the commissioner of 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.990
 on board this flight 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.990
 the door was conspiring from tdt 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.320
 do not 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:07.460
 with double s 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.470
 With me please 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.389
 3 and 4 for years at some time 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.169
 increase too much the session was offended and 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:17.229
 it did not come anymore 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.419
 listen to me, it's not my fault 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:23.440
 I am the victim of this situation 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:26.440
 I say clearly says those who ruin you 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.440
 good 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.370
 we said that now from the version 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.130
 official everything points to the theory of 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.290
 suicidal copilot but for the end that 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.310
 the landing is in charge of guido and 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.310
 the mysterious 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.199
 if the commander wants to go to the bathroom 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:00.680
 wants to retire for some reason one of 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:02.460
 we have to enter that cabin 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.400
 It is the small cabin 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.979
 and be with the co-pilot waiting for the 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.099
 commander back there are two ways to 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:12.449
 enter one with a code that we 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:16.139
 we mark 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:18.000
 and we enter but they can close the 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.830
 inside so that we do not 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.620
 we can open it 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:25.319
 there is a code to emerge there is a code 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:29.370
 of emergency that I can not tell you 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:33.210
 because secret two modes and this I hope 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:36.370
 do not be messing up when you tell it 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:39.270
 and I want to be cautious 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.700
 there is a way to enter 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:46.890
 to the cockpit with the door closed and with 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:52.320
 the code if there is not a standard we 

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:58.340
 we are instructed to disturb lanseria 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:58.340
 and bliss-76 own faker
