all<00:00:05.580> my<00:00:05.609> stuff<00:00:05.940> apart<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.600> lot<00:00:06.720> my<00:00:06.899> wires<00:00:07.140> and

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
all my stuff apart a lot my wires and

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.870 
all my stuff apart a lot my wires and
rca's<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.130> stuff<00:00:08.280> because<00:00:08.370> I'm<00:00:08.580> having

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
rca's and stuff because I'm having

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.259 
rca's and stuff because I'm having
serious<00:00:09.540> ground<00:00:09.870> loops<00:00:10.849> I'm<00:00:11.849> thinking<00:00:12.179> is

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
serious ground loops I'm thinking is

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.890 
serious ground loops I'm thinking is
because<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.630> got<00:00:12.809> my<00:00:12.960> signal<00:00:13.200> lead<00:00:13.530> wires<00:00:14.900> too

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
because I got my signal lead wires too

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.570 
because I got my signal lead wires too
close<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.260> my<00:00:16.379> power<00:00:16.590> wires<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.190> kind<00:00:17.490> of

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
close to my power wires so I kind of

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.200 
close to my power wires so I kind of
broke<00:00:18.000> down<00:00:18.060> everything<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:20.029> think<00:00:21.029> my

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
broke down everything and I think my

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.370 
broke down everything and I think my
deck<00:00:21.510> my<00:00:21.720> Pioneer<00:00:22.170> 7-inch<00:00:22.680> double<00:00:23.070> din<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:25.230> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
deck my Pioneer 7-inch double din and I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.169 
deck my Pioneer 7-inch double din and I
kind<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.730> sold<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:28.460> upgraded<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:30.090> this

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
kind of sold it so I upgraded to this

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.580 
kind of sold it so I upgraded to this
right<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:31.309> set<00:00:32.309> JVC<00:00:32.899> 7-inch<00:00:34.280> kwa<00:00:35.280> v7<00:00:35.940> TBT<00:00:36.590> so

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
right here set JVC 7-inch kwa v7 TBT so

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.799 
right here set JVC 7-inch kwa v7 TBT so
I<00:00:37.980> kind<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.670> upgrade<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.239> think<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
I kind of upgrade it I think this is a

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.500 
I kind of upgrade it I think this is a
lot<00:00:40.079> better<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.680> mean<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.550> has<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> heatsink<00:00:42.300> on

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
lot better I mean this has a heatsink on

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.139 
lot better I mean this has a heatsink on
it<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.200> mean<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.190> tells<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.610> what<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
it so I mean it tells you what the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.119 
it so I mean it tells you what the
quality<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.660> our<00:00:45.930> JVC<00:00:46.620> trying<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.920> put<00:00:47.039> in

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
quality that our JVC trying to put in

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.610 
quality that our JVC trying to put in
today<00:00:47.340> decks<00:00:47.989> double<00:00:48.989> DNA<00:00:49.200> whatever<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.500> want

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
today decks double DNA whatever you want

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.369 
today decks double DNA whatever you want
to<00:00:49.680> call<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.449> this<00:00:51.449> deck<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.289> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to call it this deck is going to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.049 
to call it this deck is going to
probably<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.739> lot<00:00:52.890> easier<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.520> grow<00:00:53.760> because

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
probably be a lot easier to grow because

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.490 
probably be a lot easier to grow because
I<00:00:54.090> don't<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.390> use<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> relay<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> bypass

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
I don't have to use a relay to bypass

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.389 
I don't have to use a relay to bypass
the<00:00:55.739> video<00:00:56.010> over<00:00:56.219> here<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:58.039> it's<00:00:59.039> along<00:00:59.280> the

the video over here and it's along the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.720 
the video over here and it's along the
iPod<00:00:59.789> core<00:01:00.059> too<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:01.250> that's<00:01:02.250> easy<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.550> lot

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
iPod core too so that's easy a lot

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.899 
iPod core too so that's easy a lot
better<00:01:03.890> yeah<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.129> said<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> begin<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> lot<00:01:05.790> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
apart I'm trying to find a ground little

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.590 
apart I'm trying to find a ground little
I'm<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.250> grounded<00:01:20.610> my<00:01:20.759> stuff<00:01:21.030> I'm<00:01:21.299> making<00:01:21.330> my

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
ground shorter and it's real hard when

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.560 
ground shorter and it's real hard when
you<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.530> three<00:01:25.530> amps<00:01:26.180> trying<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> mount<00:01:27.450> them

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.599 
two subs and uh I guess you got a ground
this<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.740> West<00:02:01.740> parking<00:02:02.130> brake<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
this to the West parking brake to the

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.120 
this to the West parking brake to the
actual<00:02:03.000> ground<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:04.170> bypass<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:04.859> can<00:02:05.009> watch

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
actual ground to bypass we can watch

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.160 
actual ground to bypass we can watch
videos<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.079> uh<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:08.310> really<00:02:08.610> about<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:09.170> but

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
videos and uh I was really about it but

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.440 
videos and uh I was really about it but
uh<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.560> was<00:02:10.769> it<00:02:10.860> give<00:02:10.979> I'll<00:02:11.099> update<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:11.879> you

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
uh I was it give I'll update on that you

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.820 
uh I was it give I'll update on that you
know<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.569> got<00:02:12.810> rid<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:12.989> my<00:02:13.170> pioneer<00:02:13.650> tech

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
know I got rid of my pioneer tech

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.180 
know I got rid of my pioneer tech
because<00:02:14.819> uh<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:15.390> think<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.900> RCA<00:02:16.470> ground<00:02:16.860> on

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
because uh I think that RCA ground on

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.009 
because uh I think that RCA ground on
that<00:02:17.430> deck<00:02:17.640> was<00:02:17.849> bad<00:02:18.060> -<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.629> think<00:02:18.750> that's

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
that deck was bad - so I think that's

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.410 
that deck was bad - so I think that's
another<00:02:19.260> reason<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:20.060> hopefully<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.239> will

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
another reason so hopefully this will

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.690 
another reason so hopefully this will
solve<00:02:21.690> my<00:02:21.900> issues<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.470> me<00:02:22.920> regretted<00:02:23.430> my<00:02:23.519> am

solve my issues and me regretted my am

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.839 
solve my issues and me regretted my am
so<00:02:23.879> solve<00:02:24.120> my<00:02:24.269> issues<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.650> uh<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.670> got<00:02:26.790> to
