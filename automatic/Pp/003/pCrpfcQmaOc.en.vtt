00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.910 

but<00:01:42.000> she<00:01:42.119> looks<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.570> folks<00:01:42.869> nothing<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.770> it

but she looks like folks nothing to it
it's<00:01:44.750> easy<00:01:45.750> enough<00:01:45.930> even<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:49.610> and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
it's easy enough even I can do it and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.240 
it's easy enough even I can do it and
that<00:01:50.789> bait<00:01:51.030> pulls<00:01:51.719> beautifully

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.040 

you<00:01:56.820> see<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.270> nothing<00:01:57.630> more<00:01:57.810> than<00:01:58.020> just

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
you see it's nothing more than just

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.130 
you see it's nothing more than just
barely<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:59.280> through<00:02:02.480> the<00:02:03.480> point<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:04.050> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
barely going through the point of the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.490 
barely going through the point of the
mantle

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.600 

right<00:02:09.500> there

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.310 

and<00:02:15.030> your<00:02:15.180> stinger<00:02:15.600> hook<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:15.960> brought

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
and your stinger hook just brought

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:28.790 
and your stinger hook just brought
barely<00:02:16.830> right<00:02:17.040> back<00:02:17.280> there

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.980 

and<00:02:29.370> also<00:02:29.550> let<00:02:30.030> me<00:02:30.060> add<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.540> think<00:02:30.810> it's

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
and also let me add I think it's

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.880 
and also let me add I think it's
important<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:32.010> either<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.990> Snell<00:02:33.990> this<00:02:34.320> which

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
important to either a Snell this which

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.260 
important to either a Snell this which
I've<00:02:35.070> got<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.490> one<00:02:35.700> smelled<00:02:39.740> or<00:02:41.240> use<00:02:42.240> that

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
I've got this one smelled or use that

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.780 
I've got this one smelled or use that
cat's<00:02:42.720> paw<00:02:43.020> connection<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.800> think<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.640> is

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
cat's paw connection I think that is

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.360 
cat's paw connection I think that is
important<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:45.660> these<00:02:45.810> chin<00:02:46.110> weights<00:02:46.370> it

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
important with these chin weights it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.550 
important with these chin weights it
keeps<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.790> cost<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.270> pressure<00:02:48.570> pulling<00:02:49.050> down

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
keeps the cost of pressure pulling down

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.100 
keeps the cost of pressure pulling down
on<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> nose<00:02:50.550> cone<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.450> chin<00:02:51.690> weight<00:02:51.870> and

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
on the nose cone of the chin weight and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.640 
on the nose cone of the chin weight and
keeps<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.130> right<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.850> upright<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.260> think<00:02:55.380> it

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
keeps it right and upright so I think it

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:08.760 
keeps it right and upright so I think it
is<00:02:55.680> important

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.500 

someone<00:03:09.550> asked<00:03:09.820> me<00:03:09.880> here<00:03:10.120> on<00:03:10.210> frying-pan

you<00:03:31.750> mess<00:03:32.650> with<00:03:32.830> it<00:03:32.980> too<00:03:33.010> much<00:03:33.160> it'll<00:03:33.580> destroy

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
you mess with it too much it'll destroy

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.840 
you mess with it too much it'll destroy
it<00:03:34.630> but<00:03:35.500> let's<00:03:35.680> do<00:03:35.800> this<00:03:36.010> one<00:03:36.220> let's<00:03:36.520> take<00:03:36.700> this

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
it but let's do this one let's take this

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:46.500 
it but let's do this one let's take this
one<00:03:37.060> off

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:54.509 

I<00:03:47.549> set<00:03:48.549> this<00:03:48.670> one<00:03:48.849> to<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.150> side<00:03:52.470> this<00:03:53.489> skin<00:03:54.489> a

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
I set this one to the side this skin a

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.490 
I set this one to the side this skin a
squid<00:03:55.799> okay<00:03:56.819> make<00:03:57.819> a<00:03:57.849> little<00:03:58.750> small<00:03:58.989> cut<00:03:59.290> right

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
squid okay make a little small cut right

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.380 
squid okay make a little small cut right
here<00:04:00.599> barely<00:04:01.599> barely<00:04:02.230> barely<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:04.090> up<00:04:04.239> the

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
here barely barely barely and up the

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.930 
here barely barely barely and up the
back<00:04:07.019> okay<00:04:08.019> just<00:04:08.440> make<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.680> little<00:04:08.920> line<00:04:09.190> crease

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
back okay just make a little line crease

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.099 
back okay just make a little line crease
it<00:04:11.190> don't<00:04:12.190> cut<00:04:12.430> too<00:04:12.459> deep<00:04:12.879> and<00:04:13.569> just<00:04:13.690> peel<00:04:13.989> it

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
it don't cut too deep and just peel it

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:20.129 
it don't cut too deep and just peel it
away<00:04:15.419> and<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:16.570> see<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:17.109> this<00:04:18.720> little<00:04:19.720> thin

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
away and you see that this little thin

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:26.640 
away and you see that this little thin
membrane<00:04:20.769> will<00:04:21.250> just<00:04:21.430> peel<00:04:21.639> right<00:04:21.970> away

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.920 

that<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.759> part<00:04:28.000> that<00:04:28.060> will<00:04:28.360> fill<00:04:28.690> with

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
that is the part that will fill with

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.830 
that is the part that will fill with
water<00:04:29.229> bubbles<00:04:30.090> let<00:04:31.090> me<00:04:31.180> show<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.449> what<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.690> do

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
water bubbles let me show you what to do

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.550 
water bubbles let me show you what to do
up<00:04:31.960> underneath<00:04:32.290> here<00:04:33.750> make<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:35.020> nice

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
up underneath here make you a nice

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.110 
up underneath here make you a nice
little<00:04:35.949> thing<00:04:36.130> cut<00:04:36.340> it's<00:04:36.520> important<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.060> have

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
little thing cut it's important to have

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.270 
little thing cut it's important to have
a<00:04:37.210> sharp<00:04:37.449> knife<00:04:37.660> too<00:04:37.960> by<00:04:38.139> the<00:04:38.169> way<00:04:38.350> because<00:04:39.220> a

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
a sharp knife too by the way because a

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.770 
a sharp knife too by the way because a
dull<00:04:39.580> knife<00:04:39.820> will<00:04:40.060> not<00:04:40.210> cut<00:04:40.479> that<00:04:40.630> little

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
dull knife will not cut that little

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.930 
dull knife will not cut that little
membrane<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.940> just<00:04:43.180> peel<00:04:43.449> it<00:04:43.630> all<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:44.020> way

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.040 

now<00:04:48.940> it's<00:04:49.090> at<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.270> bottom<00:04:49.539> of<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.720> tube<00:04:49.960> and

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
now it's at the bottom of the tube and

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:57.499 
now it's at the bottom of the tube and
it'll<00:04:50.350> all<00:04:50.440> just<00:04:50.470> pull<00:04:50.830> off<00:04:54.570> there<00:04:55.570> you<00:04:55.720> go

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
it'll all just pull off there you go

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.210 
it'll all just pull off there you go
that's<00:04:58.509> all<00:04:58.750> of<00:04:59.139> that<00:04:59.260> membrane<00:04:59.620> off<00:04:59.949> of<00:05:00.130> the

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
that's all of that membrane off of the

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.520 
that's all of that membrane off of the
squid

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.830 

and<00:05:04.620> now<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.280> can<00:05:05.610> fast<00:05:05.880> roll<00:05:06.150> it<00:05:06.300> or<00:05:06.480> you

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
and now you can fast roll it or you

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.150 
and now you can fast roll it or you
control<00:05:07.230> it<00:05:07.410> faster

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
control it faster

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.550 
control it faster
you're<00:05:08.850> still<00:05:09.150> not<00:05:09.330> made<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.600> really<00:05:10.140> fast

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
you're still not made to really fast

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.920 
you're still not made to really fast
roll<00:05:10.920> but<00:05:11.130> you<00:05:11.160> certainly<00:05:12.120> get<00:05:12.390> five<00:05:12.630> six

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
roll but you certainly get five six

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.040 
roll but you certainly get five six
knots<00:05:13.140> out<00:05:13.320> of<00:05:13.470> them

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.110
