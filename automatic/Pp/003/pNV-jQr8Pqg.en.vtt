00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.270
 for animal dogs in these 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:08.460
 conditions we found them tied 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.830
 day and night in a space without 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.679
 barely light when they go outside this 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.719
 it's your food animal remains 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.060
 scattered on the ground is the life of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.740
 a score of dogs in this real already ' 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.300
 of port are no longer reported by 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.570
 animal associations that ask 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.430
 retire the owner custody he insures 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.530
 that have all the care that 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.690
 they need 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.780
 the animals can not even lie down 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.790
 on the ground because it would hang us 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.250
 we found animals that have water 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.050
 green in those cases where they have left 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.180
 water until we find images in the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.980
 that is literally putrefied water 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.080
 all the rules that I know and all 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.770
 the rules that exist in all areas 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.520
 all dogs are tied 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.170
 of 10 at night and barely light about 20 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.510
 dogs of a rehala in puertollano 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.340
 subsist in deplorable conditions not 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.280
 they have food and they live with remains 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.960
 Bones of other deceased animals is already 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.910
 difficult to get the images but 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.460
 thanks to an animal protector 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.290
 we have been able to discover the situation jose 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.270
 manuel sampedro good afternoon like this is 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.430
 victory good afternoon seemingly a 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.590
 normal country house until we 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.170
 we approach discovering through this 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.500
 window the barks and grunts of the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.580
 Look dogs go through this hard 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.979
 situation and discovered them veronica 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.960
 listening to the dogs barking a lot 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.180
 I make a lot of fuss that I walk around 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.000
 the outskirts of puertollano heard them 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.780
 calmly bark 30 animals tied 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.180
 with chains of less than one meter at most 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.960
 similar to a house of horrors for 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.659
 puppy dogs about eight months 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.330
 without water with remains of dead animals 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.030
 with his own camera he recorded them tied to the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.950
 neck day and night he slept standing 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.229
 because if he lay down to sleep he could 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.750
 hang can not move practically 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.300
 although the owner of the plot ensures 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.920
 today that it is something normal tied in 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.560
 that has to be tied or separated by 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.720
 if not so many dogs would be killed together 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.030
 there comes a day and there is one dead without 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.760
 However, the chains that bind them 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.770
 many to be continuously standing on 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.870
 that he enjoyed was lucky to enjoy 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.970
 a piece of pallet I slept on a piece of bread 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.340
 who does not sleep on top of the gib because 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.440
 apparently they feed on skeletons 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.330
 other animals the skeletons 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.690
 bloodied the ribs that's the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.730
 food 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.430
 leaves much to be desired but its 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.560
 owner does not see it that way and here's the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.150
 proof that there are some there are many 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.590
 dogs that I have to stop throwing 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.140
 a little bit of eating because I like that 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.330
 Eat and have fat and lustrous 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.850
 although from animal equality they have already 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.790
 denounced the facts decide to put it in 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.970
 knowledge of the local police but the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.100
 police action is only 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.810
 put a complaint to this person 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.480
 responsible for not having the animals 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.460
 registered but not act, let's say with 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.160
 Regarding the abuse they are suffering 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.530
 these animals because they assure if they are not 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.100
 people but I imagine they have the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.070
 same right to live 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.540
 worthily they only want what 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.060
 consider necessary is that these 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.950
 animals are requisitioned and placed 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.560
 available to responsible families 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.430
 that they adopt a decent life for 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.430
 These dogs
