00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.529
 hello how about very welcome 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.599
 portal coches.net we are going to give us a 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.500
 back in this audi a5 cabrio 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.500
 come with us please 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.590
 we started because I saw them outside 4 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.890
 meters and 62 centimeters 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.260
 a four- seater convertible and 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.420
 four seats really usable 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.300
 you can throw us back as you can 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.370
 see two adults can go quietly 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.590
 comfortable the truth that I carry the 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.910
 seat a little bit delayed but 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.240
 I promise you there must be an adult 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.940
 perfectly and good another subject is already the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.580
 issue of turbulence when you go 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.670
 descapotado because it is true that the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.409
 speed highway speed Yes 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.170
 it is true that 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.740
 back before you can go very well 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.049
 can talk talking high but behind 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.240
 yes that is impossible or it does not have 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.759
 no stop winds no 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.060
 windshield wipers nothing and if it is true 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.000
 that's good, everything sneaks up all that 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.830
 aerodynamic noise 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.360
 of the wind go for the rest that you 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.160
 I can count, well, I 've already seen it 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.010
 outside the four meters 62 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.160
 centimeters of this audi a5 cabrio that 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:09.429
 in its most modest version which is the one 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.409
 here we have worth 43 42 thousand 310 euros 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.900
 and it belongs to a six manual change 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.780
 speeds 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.420
 and the 170 horsepower tfsi gasoline engine 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.670
 are enough to move this wing 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.459
 five changes are not enough but that 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.290
 over 2500 laps I can 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.290
 ensure that this car pushes and pushes 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:37.280
 you can also make trips is a car 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.380
 that you can with which you can bet 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.240
 to be unique car because the trunk 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.200
 they are 380 liters with the hood 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.570
 bet 320 if we're talking about going to 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.090
 as now the truth has been discovered 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.980
 is that with those 320 liters they are quite 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.600
 usable man a suitcase 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.370
 voluminous because it will not fit anymore 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.100
 I say because the forms are a little 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.980
 capricious but the truth 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.420
 everything falls within normality what 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.140
 that does not fall within normal 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.150
 less according to us is that the figures 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.550
 consumer does not look anything like the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.650
 real to the officers because of a 6 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.200
 with 2 it seems to me or 6 with 9 I do not remember 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.540
 right now I think that's with 2 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.350
 intermediate consumption now when the 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.790
 average consumption a 8.6 plus 6 and we have 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.660
 I got quite a few kilometers of highway 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.310
 we have already done almost 1300 kilometers of 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.660
 test and the truth that is a consumption that 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.250
 it seems very high especially when it has 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.600
 a recommender of march and when it has 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.920
 the start &amp; stop system or that sincerely 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.380
 is one of the most polished we have 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.050
 seen going very, very well although 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.850
 it is true that when you go to very low 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.710
 speed when you are parking there 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.100
 sometimes that maybe in the switchboard 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.640
 understand that you have stopped and the 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.170
 engine if you're parking at two per hour 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.580
 It is very likely that this will happen to you then 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.800
 you have to be careful with that kind of 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.780
 things but the truth 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.200
 Also, quality audi finishes 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.000
 audi how can you see the dashboard as 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.490
 always responds to the guidelines of a 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.720
 premium car and little else I can tell you 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.190
 he can tell you many more things 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.870
 but in this video I think you already know that 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.490
 this video is a small preview of what 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.780
 what are you going to see in portal coches.net of the 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.910
 web page referring to the world the 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.040
 engine where you have a text that 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.290
 we analyze perfectly this audi a5 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.640

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.360
