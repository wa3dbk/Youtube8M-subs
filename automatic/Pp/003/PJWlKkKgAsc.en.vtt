00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.300
 so lively rise the autonomous sailboat to 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.340
 present oneself for measures 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.310
 oceanographic surface was created 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.110
 so at ifremer in a collaboration 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.530
 so enters the physics lab 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.820
 Oceans Haven is the laboratory of 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.340
 technological development research 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.260
 to brest too and school she sa 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.160
 Brittany for all who and how 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.670
 navigation algorithms so vemos has 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.409
 been created to meet a need that 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.659
 was the measurement of the thin layer of 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.050
 ocean surface that we are 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.710
 unable to achieve with the boats 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.110
 usually used at ifremer 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.540
 since there for them the water intake 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.030
 called surface is about 3 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.629
 meters 50 under the surface and so with 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.430
 ovulation 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.020
 it is considered as surface there the the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.790
 band of the first sale of 5 meters 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.950
 on the one hand with satellite studies 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.870
 which he measures as the first 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.100
 centimeters of water is then the 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.740
 all studies conducted on 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.450
 ocean exchanges atmosphere the need and 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.969
 was felt to measure 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.920
 really this thin layer on the ground the 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.810
 difference with the same measurement but a 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.280
 little deeper and while measuring 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.399
 same time atmospheric parameters 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.500
 so to be able to navigate for a long time 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.899
 total autonomy and without much disruption 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.789
 his environment he needed a craft of 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:44.009
 small size able to navigate 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:46.270
 long time from where propulsion to zellik and 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.310
 and then that does not disturb too much are 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.909
 dark are in environment it's 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.619
 an intrusive 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.909
 you have beautiful it took part in 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.679
 September 2012 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.689
 at its first oceanographic campaign 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.659
 near the thalassa a named campaign 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.340
 stress whose purpose was precisely to 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.229
 measurement and interface 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.539
 and puts it back to the thin surface layer 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.310
 salinity for the calibration of 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.259
 satellites 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.670
 so there that the boat was launched 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.250
 end of the month it was very heavy 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.010
 talent to holy and recovered eight times and 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.140
 he has traveled over 1000 miles in 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.430
 all by doing measurements and 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.260
 of which about 250 to 270 miles per 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.500
 exit in the space of three to four 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.780
 days 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.620
 now we have two possibilities 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.519
 we are able to find the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.799
 trading functionality and the 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.480
 functioning and capabilities of demos 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.540
 during other scientific campaigns in 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.850
 demand and on the other hand we 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.140
 wait for it 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.610
 result of the financing of some 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.440
 projects to see if it will be possible to 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.330
 rebuild 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.670
 others other boats better 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.530
 quality more suited to the high seas and 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.030
 saint trond an alley even further 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.850
 in the measures and improve 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.980
 the whole system 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.390
 we are here as part of the wrc 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.920
 ir and that's who's both so a 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.970
 conference around robotics and 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.240
 marine drones and at the same time so a 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.470
 a competition where this 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.260
 team is about 14 boats there the 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.430
 competition takes place over 5 days a 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.800
 number of tests were 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.800
 written and the participants when he 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.140
 would sign so this area a judge had 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.260
 that 11 on the water level of the thresholds of 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.930
 realize the evidence the different 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.390
 trials are quite extensive 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.350
 a part is a lot about the quality 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.270
 of navigation 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.640
 then on the quality also of 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.100
 making a triangle with the gap to 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.030
 the perfect line 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.180
 after we have a whole series 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.370
 of tests more oriented go with by 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.720
 two image processing on 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.970
 events like for example placing a 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.410
 zodiac on the road of a sailboat or a 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.790
 motor boat he is supposed to see him and 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.550
 avoid it by the same and resume its 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.930
 road behind and to finish we 're going 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.420
 a little more playful tests as 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.880
 catch him if you can 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.140
 where we put two worried boats 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.920
 try to escape and the other who 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.920
 try to catch him
