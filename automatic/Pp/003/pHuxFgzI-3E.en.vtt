the<00:00:34.890> store<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.250> Jax<00:00:35.489> comes<00:00:35.820> into<00:00:36.059> play

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the store for Jax comes into play

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.970 
the store for Jax comes into play
immediately<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.290> nice<00:00:37.590> kick<00:00:37.860> off

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
immediately so a nice kick off

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.619 
immediately so a nice kick off
immediately<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.670> Hoffmann<00:00:44.450> well<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.510> that

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
immediately for Hoffmann well in that

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.330 
immediately for Hoffmann well in that
respect<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.170> think<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.710> can't<00:00:46.980> really<00:00:47.100> focus

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
respect I think you can't really focus

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.610 
respect I think you can't really focus
on<00:00:47.730> because<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.690> fairy<00:00:48.899> dragon<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.410> so

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
on because the fairy dragon is so

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.319 
on because the fairy dragon is so
resilient<00:00:49.890> against<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.430> spells<00:00:50.760> from<00:00:50.910> shaman

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
resilient against the spells from shaman

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.490 
resilient against the spells from shaman
they<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> use<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> rock<00:00:52.140> player<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
they have to use like a rock player to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.680 
they have to use like a rock player to
get<00:00:52.590> rid<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.010> or<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.910> for<00:00:54.390> Jax<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.390> I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
get rid of it or a for Jax you know I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.020 
get rid of it or a for Jax you know I
just<00:00:58.230> think<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.739> coin<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.940> have

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
just think if you can coin and you have

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.400 
just think if you can coin and you have
a<00:01:00.120> two<00:01:00.300> three<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> three<00:01:01.199> two

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
a two three and you have a three two

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.429 
a two three and you have a three two
you're<00:01:01.620> going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.980> choose<00:01:02.190> doing<00:01:02.460> every<00:01:02.640> time

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
you're going to choose doing every time

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.980 
you're going to choose doing every time
yeah<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.710> guess<00:01:04.979> cuz<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> challenges<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.990> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
yeah I guess cuz it challenges the the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.350 
yeah I guess cuz it challenges the the
to<00:01:07.170> drop<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.500> whatever<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:07.830> opponent<00:01:08.130> does

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
to drop of whatever your opponent does

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.060 
to drop of whatever your opponent does
yeah<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> two<00:01:10.020> three<00:01:10.229> against<00:01:10.950> your

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
yeah like a two three against your

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.760 
yeah like a two three against your
furnace<00:01:11.369> three<00:01:11.610> drop<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.060> not<00:01:12.240> valuable

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
furnace three drop is not valuable

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.840 
furnace three drop is not valuable
mm-hmm<00:01:15.979> but<00:01:16.979> Bassam<00:01:17.280> will<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.549> keep<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
mm-hmm but Bassam will just keep the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.060 
mm-hmm but Bassam will just keep the
trench<00:01:18.119> art<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.689> push<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.229> more<00:01:19.439> minions<00:01:19.710> how

does have that shield master though

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.220 
does have that shield master though
which<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:13.850> pretty<00:02:14.330> annoying<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.900> deal<00:02:15.050> with

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
which is pretty annoying to deal with

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.840 
which is pretty annoying to deal with
because<00:02:15.380> hopefully<00:02:16.220> doesn't<00:02:16.489> have<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
because hopefully doesn't have the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:32.260 
because hopefully doesn't have the
immediate<00:02:17.239> answer<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:31.550> massan's<00:02:31.880> curve<00:02:32.180> is

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
immediate answer so massan's curve is

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.750 
immediate answer so massan's curve is
still<00:02:32.420> not<00:02:32.570> pretty<00:02:32.810> nicely<00:02:33.020> he<00:02:33.320> has<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.890> really

finish yeah

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.399 
finish yeah
perhaps<00:03:55.450> but<00:03:56.450> then<00:03:56.629> the<00:03:56.780> demolisher<00:03:57.230> just

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:57.409 
perhaps but then the demolisher just

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.759 
perhaps but then the demolisher just
dies<00:03:57.560> for<00:03:57.829> free<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:58.930> why<00:03:59.930> not<00:03:59.959> just<00:04:00.230> totem<00:04:00.680> I

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
dies for free so why not just totem I

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.270 
dies for free so why not just totem I
guess<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.189> that<00:04:01.220> in<00:04:01.610> that<00:04:01.790> point<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:04.040> kind<00:04:04.250> of

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
guess and that in that point it kind of

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.750 
guess and that in that point it kind of
serves<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.640> same<00:04:04.790> purpose<00:04:06.579> although<00:04:07.579> I<00:04:07.609> guess

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
serves the same purpose although I guess

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.369 
serves the same purpose although I guess
the<00:04:08.150> dommage<00:04:08.420> referred<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.840> curve<00:04:09.049> a<00:04:09.170> little

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
the dommage referred to curve a little

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.970 
the dommage referred to curve a little
better<00:04:10.780> maybe<00:04:11.780> Houston<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.319> think<00:04:12.709> I<00:04:12.920> don't

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
better maybe Houston I think I don't

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.110 
better maybe Houston I think I don't
think<00:04:13.280> what<00:04:13.400> something<00:04:13.640> I<00:04:13.760> don't<00:04:14.000> like

for<00:06:07.490> half<00:06:07.610> who<00:06:07.790> there<00:06:08.000> was<00:06:08.210> to<00:06:08.390> play<00:06:08.600> the<00:06:08.630> 44

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
for half who there was to play the 44

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.350 
for half who there was to play the 44
and<00:06:09.650> told<00:06:10.280> him<00:06:10.370> that's<00:06:11.030> it

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360

and told him that's it
not<00:06:11.660> playing<00:06:11.930> to<00:06:12.140> Tom's<00:06:12.460> two<00:06:13.460> talents<00:06:13.760> were

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
not playing to Tom's two talents were

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.510 
not playing to Tom's two talents were
not<00:06:14.000> very<00:06:14.240> good<00:06:14.300> that<00:06:14.600> turn<00:06:15.310> yeah<00:06:16.310> I<00:06:16.340> would

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
not very good that turn yeah I would

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.980 
not very good that turn yeah I would
have<00:06:16.640> it<00:06:16.970> would<00:06:17.060> have<00:06:17.180> still<00:06:17.360> challenged<00:06:17.900> the

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
have it would have still challenged the

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.560 
have it would have still challenged the
silver<00:06:18.290> hand<00:06:18.410> net<00:06:18.590> itself<00:06:18.920> and<00:06:19.250> the<00:06:20.240> result

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
silver hand net itself and the result

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.150 
silver hand net itself and the result
would<00:06:20.660> have<00:06:20.690> been<00:06:20.780> the<00:06:21.080> same<00:06:21.560> except<00:06:21.920> you<00:06:21.980> had

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
would have been the same except you had

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.350 
would have been the same except you had
the<00:06:22.340> Faro<00:06:22.580> Spears<00:06:22.850> to<00:06:23.030> reload<00:06:23.360> the<00:06:23.480> board<00:06:23.690> so

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
the Faro Spears to reload the board so

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.700 
the Faro Spears to reload the board so
yeah<00:06:26.360> I<00:06:26.480> guess<00:06:26.630> in<00:06:26.750> retrospect<00:06:26.990> you<00:06:27.380> could<00:06:27.560> go

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
yeah I guess in retrospect you could go

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.940 
yeah I guess in retrospect you could go
for<00:06:27.890> that<00:06:27.950> as<00:06:28.070> well<00:06:29.110> now<00:06:30.110> Mossad<00:06:30.470> has<00:06:30.620> realized

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
for that as well now Mossad has realized

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.230 
for that as well now Mossad has realized
he's<00:06:31.070> whittled<00:06:31.310> down<00:06:31.340> at<00:06:31.550> the<00:06:31.640> point<00:06:31.820> so<00:06:32.030> much

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
he's whittled down at the point so much

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.450 
he's whittled down at the point so much
that<00:06:32.480> he<00:06:32.600> can<00:06:32.750> start<00:06:33.200> to<00:06:33.350> build<00:06:34.010> the<00:06:34.250> board

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
that he can start to build the board

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.190 
that he can start to build the board
back<00:06:36.580> it's<00:06:37.580> not<00:06:37.700> that<00:06:37.820> he<00:06:38.000> won<00:06:38.120> it's<00:06:38.630> just<00:06:38.900> that

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
back it's not that he won it's just that

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.260 
back it's not that he won it's just that
I<00:06:39.470> don't<00:06:39.590> see<00:06:39.980> how<00:06:40.130> we're<00:06:40.370> gonna<00:06:40.550> do<00:06:40.820> this<00:06:41.000> last
