00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.160
 because when we're here already 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.120
 all the more crazy dams in front of Glasgow 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.060
 we do not know this world so to begin I'm very basic I'm doing 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.550
 call 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.590
 if you hear your moment for present to present 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.140
 eventually you raise your hand 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.020
 sheets 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.420
 horner

 at samu the air 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.310
 by the blow of the law 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.310
 agree the murdered little boy 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.880
 the tragic sequences rough in this group b 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.880
 to judge 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.550
 that's it that's all 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.420
 when he appears flanked by the spectacle offered to his pretensions to 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.500
 public to the exemption will not happen 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 at most german who came first in the room 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.920
 a hint above the expectations thanks to him that there was no one it's 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.930
 a first 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 we come back to haunt for the lady who was to maintain in the room 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.150
 France by the voice of Sir raised m 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.950
 I'm going out is very heavy at the end stunning 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.950
 so that people at home even if we will not get out of it 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.089
 in addition I easily mark the first row 1 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.089
 normally at this return of the show people looking at the eyes 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.069
 while the ipad a plus on arrival first 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:18.879
 miss was the first 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.739
 the expedition is a question of salary 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.739
 come save then courage 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.749
 according to witnesses 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.869
 you have to go alone 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.869
 so you get splitted into socks 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.649
 no for me it does not matter we know the years 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:55.319
 tennis for a lot 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.709
 you can check if it works 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.959
 yes okay very well 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.959

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.059
 let's remove the first week of the trial m 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:27.359
 on the menu of this day 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.629
 in the main if you do not want to talk about 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.599
 not cute it's a good show 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.490
 hortefeux after I know why you do not want to talk 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.069
 it's because you do not have your lighting 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.069
 sharp is there a lucifer shift of peace 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:53.929

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:57.349
 spectators before-show so had everything good finally I do not know you but me 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:58.989
 i see laurent 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.609
 the palois your experience as a spectator I can not quote a good 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:04.589
 pretentious 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:08.479
 % and that's maybe there and recommendations of the things humorist 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.039
 no longer in more polluted fear 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.959
 one of those dads and I of you have you studied young people well 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.279
 framed though not 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.729
 but it does not matter here we will do a small qcm a small questionnaire to 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.819
 multiple choices istanbul day I have a little bit and especially see the 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:27.819
 compatibility between your word and that this show 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.810
 it's not much but I advise you to apply if you 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.870
 want to keep my place 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.940
 and if you answer very well you know it's repeating the honor 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.199
 Supreme would be named 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.409
 spectator of the month 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:43.960
 it makes you happy 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.710
 it is seen alone 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.449
 compromise with the friendliest to use it 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.400
 it's better like that 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.199
 yes the body of the supporter I reassure you any case no trap is 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.330
 exactly what makes me laugh 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.870
 you answer the microphone 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.889

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.949
 two editions 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.159
 jean-pierre pernaut 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.449
 where to find it too much 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.190
 2 see in the distance 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.190
 three years I can not judge if my father 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:33.969
 highlight of this team 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:35.310
