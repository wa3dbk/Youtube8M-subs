then<00:04:41.980> a<00:04:42.980> hardware<00:04:43.580> company<00:04:43.970> it<00:04:44.090> goes<00:04:44.270> through

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
then a hardware company it goes through

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.400 
then a hardware company it goes through
the<00:04:44.540> process<00:04:44.660> of<00:04:45.170> analyzing<00:04:46.180> costs<00:04:47.180> and

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
the process of analyzing costs and

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.530 
the process of analyzing costs and
prototyping<00:04:48.410> it<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:48.830> you<00:04:49.730> know<00:04:49.850> resolving

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
prototyping it and you know resolving

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.770 
prototyping it and you know resolving
whether<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.080> thing<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.860> be<00:04:51.980> built<00:04:52.160> at<00:04:52.280> all
