demo for the articulate physics engine
we're<00:00:06.150> developing<00:00:06.859> so<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:08.550> order<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.970> make

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
we're developing so in order to make

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.540 
we're developing so in order to make
more<00:00:09.660> realistic<00:00:10.110> physics<00:00:10.769> simulation<00:00:11.280> and

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
more realistic physics simulation and

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.660 
more realistic physics simulation and
build<00:00:12.000> electronics<00:00:12.719> like<00:00:12.960> track<00:00:13.349> cars<00:00:13.920> we

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
build electronics like track cars we

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.359 
build electronics like track cars we
need<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.880> add<00:00:15.059> more<00:00:16.039> scalability<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
need to add more scalability and

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.700 
need to add more scalability and
performance<00:00:17.430> also<00:00:18.210> introduce<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.320> bunch<00:00:19.529> of

lab<00:01:27.450> later<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.410> try<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.220> awesome<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
lab later you can try this awesome of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:42.370 
lab later you can try this awesome of
yourself

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.120 

all<00:01:43.380> right<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.670> articulate<00:01:45.360> physics

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
all right so what is articulate physics

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.060 
all right so what is articulate physics
the<00:01:47.130> short<00:01:47.430> answer<00:01:47.760> is<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.390> truck<00:01:50.600> no<00:01:51.600> answer

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
the short answer is the truck no answer

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.230 
the short answer is the truck no answer
you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.250> read<00:01:53.460> yourself<00:01:55.430> but<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.640> will<00:01:57.030> give

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
you can read yourself but I will give

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
you can read yourself but I will give
you<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.420> few<00:01:57.750> slides<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.440> illustrate<00:01:59.070> that

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
you a few slides to illustrate that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.620 
you a few slides to illustrate that
first<00:02:01.260> in<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:02.010> pendulum<00:02:02.610> example<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.390> see

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
first in this pendulum example you see

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.080 
first in this pendulum example you see
three<00:02:03.990> segments<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.040> two<00:02:05.190> joints<00:02:05.640> not

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
three segments and two joints not

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.749 
three segments and two joints not
articulated<00:02:07.020> body<00:02:07.229> now<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.520> two

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
articulated body now you have two

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.720 
articulated body now you have two
pendulums<00:02:09.119> they<00:02:09.899> all<00:02:10.080> secretly<00:02:10.730> simulated

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
pendulums they all secretly simulated

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.020 
pendulums they all secretly simulated
with<00:02:11.850> high<00:02:12.180> accuracy<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.350> we<00:02:13.680> can<00:02:14.580> scale<00:02:14.820> up

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
with high accuracy and we can scale up

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.870 
with high accuracy and we can scale up
to<00:02:15.060> hundreds<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.780> them<00:02:15.959> there's<00:02:16.650> no<00:02:16.890> lag<00:02:17.190> they

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
to hundreds of them there's no lag they

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.680 
to hundreds of them there's no lag they
all<00:02:18.030> simulated<00:02:18.810> very<00:02:19.730> fluently<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.090> they

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
all simulated very fluently and they

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.020 
all simulated very fluently and they
collide<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.470> environment<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.850> is

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
collide with the environment so that is

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.540 
collide with the environment so that is
articulate<00:02:24.510> physics

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.910 

not<00:02:28.150> only<00:02:28.360> we<00:02:28.540> can<00:02:28.690> simulate<00:02:28.930> trucks<00:02:29.380> we<00:02:29.740> can

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
not only we can simulate trucks we can

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.450 
not only we can simulate trucks we can
also<00:02:30.070> simulate<00:02:30.490> our<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.690> cook<00:02:31.900> creature<00:02:32.710> such

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
also simulate our to cook creature such

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.930 
also simulate our to cook creature such

the amount of torque and the motor gain
are<00:04:12.440> way<00:04:13.190> higher<00:04:13.550> than<00:04:13.580> before<00:04:14.290> also<00:04:15.290> it's

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
are way higher than before also it's

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.430 
are way higher than before also it's

applied<00:04:24.620> everything<00:04:25.220> physics<00:04:25.910> simulated

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:41.350 

you<00:04:34.460> can<00:04:34.610> even<00:04:34.909> climb<00:04:35.210> vertically

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.230 

the<00:04:42.199> last<00:04:42.439> one<00:04:42.680> has<00:04:42.919> a<00:04:42.949> four<00:04:43.400> lakh<00:04:43.610> style<00:04:44.000> is

the last one has a four lakh style is

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.390 
the last one has a four lakh style is
almost<00:04:44.569> like<00:04:44.870> a<00:04:45.139> caller<00:04:45.590> with<00:04:46.340> four<00:04:46.939> lakhs<00:04:48.400> so

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
almost like a caller with four lakhs so

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.129 
almost like a caller with four lakhs so
the<00:04:49.490> idea<00:04:49.759> is<00:04:49.909> with<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:50.389> new<00:04:50.599> physics<00:04:51.020> we'll
