00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
you'll see these two things you might

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.680 
you'll see these two things you might
not<00:02:17.650> get<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.040> Python<00:02:18.550> file<00:02:18.730> thing<00:02:19.090> up<00:02:19.360> here

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
not get this Python file thing up here

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.570 
not get this Python file thing up here
and<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:20.230> might<00:02:20.380> just<00:02:20.680> say<00:02:20.890> normal<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.460> layer

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
and you might just say normal and layer

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.740 
and you might just say normal and layer
like<00:02:21.820> oh<00:02:21.970> crap<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.480> don't<00:02:22.630> know

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
like oh crap I don't know

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.050 
like oh crap I don't know
how<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.870> open<00:02:22.990> this<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.410> when<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.590> open<00:02:24.060> this

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
how to open this and when you open this

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.090 
how to open this and when you open this
it<00:02:25.360> does<00:02:25.540> nothing<00:02:25.840> right<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:26.770> what<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:26.980> want

or you go open and then search it's

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.570 
or you go open and then search it's
pretty<00:02:32.380> much<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.710> same<00:02:32.890> thing<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.310> can<00:02:33.460> go

pretty much the same thing and I can go

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.450 
pretty much the same thing and I can go
choose<00:02:33.940> default<00:02:34.210> program<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:35.320> it'll<00:02:36.250> come<00:02:36.400> up

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
choose default program and it'll come up

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.520 
choose default program and it'll come up
as<00:02:36.670> other<00:02:36.850> programs<00:02:37.120> but<00:02:37.660> I'm<00:02:38.080> gonna<00:02:38.230> browse

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
as other programs but I'm gonna browse

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.199 
as other programs but I'm gonna browse
and<00:02:38.890> go<00:02:39.090> search<00:02:40.090> for<00:02:40.590> Python<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:42.760> will<00:02:43.030> tell

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
and go search for Python this will tell

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.690 
and go search for Python this will tell
you<00:02:43.360> if<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.630> have<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.020> as<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.130> can<00:02:45.220> see<00:02:45.459> I
