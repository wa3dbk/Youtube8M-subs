so<00:00:04.550> if<00:00:04.730> you're<00:00:04.910> joining<00:00:05.300> the<00:00:06.170> squares<00:00:07.900> in

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
so if you're joining the squares in

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.369 
so if you're joining the squares in
diagonal<00:00:09.440> layout<00:00:10.240> then<00:00:11.240> you<00:00:11.719> know<00:00:11.900> that<00:00:12.169> this

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:12.379 
diagonal layout then you know that this

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.110 
diagonal layout then you know that this
is<00:00:12.589> your<00:00:12.830> side<00:00:13.160> right<00:00:13.519> here

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
is your side right here

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.180 
is your side right here
that's<00:00:14.389> corner<00:00:14.959> and<00:00:15.200> then<00:00:15.860> there<00:00:16.039> is<00:00:16.160> a

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
that's corner and then there is a

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.140 
that's corner and then there is a
continuation<00:00:16.970> of<00:00:17.450> the<00:00:17.660> side<00:00:17.930> over<00:00:18.170> there<00:00:18.320> and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
continuation of the side over there and

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.560 
continuation of the side over there and
you<00:00:20.150> actually<00:00:20.390> start<00:00:21.080> in<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:22.070> corner<00:00:22.730> with

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
you actually start in the corner with

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.160 
you actually start in the corner with
these<00:00:23.900> two<00:00:24.490> triangles<00:00:25.570> first<00:00:27.490> and<00:00:28.960> what<00:00:29.960> you

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
these two triangles first and what you

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.319 
these two triangles first and what you
would<00:00:30.320> do<00:00:30.560> is<00:00:30.740> you<00:00:30.950> would<00:00:30.980> place<00:00:31.400> them<00:00:31.730> back<00:00:32.029> to

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
would do is you would place them back to

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.720 
would do is you would place them back to
back

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
back

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.130 
back
and<00:00:34.730> you<00:00:35.090> would<00:00:35.300> start<00:00:35.600> crocheting<00:00:37.929> in<00:00:38.929> the

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
and you would start crocheting in the

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.430 
and you would start crocheting in the
corner<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:40.460> actually<00:00:41.300> if<00:00:41.449> you<00:00:41.600> have<00:00:41.809> a<00:00:41.839> tail

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
corner and actually if you have a tail

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.529 
corner and actually if you have a tail
like<00:00:42.739> this<00:00:42.769> you<00:00:43.249> can<00:00:43.399> place<00:00:43.699> it<00:00:43.909> on<00:00:44.089> top<00:00:44.329> of

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
like this you can place it on top of

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:51.099 
like this you can place it on top of
here<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:47.230> crochet<00:00:48.230> it<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:48.890> detail<00:00:49.670> on<00:00:50.109> the

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
here and crochet it the detail on the

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:52.299 
here and crochet it the detail on the
inside

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
inside

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.610 
inside
I'll<00:00:53.210> show<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:53.659> so<00:00:54.019> you<00:00:54.050> don't<00:00:54.230> have<00:00:54.469> to

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
I'll show you so you don't have to

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.229 
I'll show you so you don't have to
really<00:00:55.629> weave<00:00:56.629> in<00:00:56.899> all<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.319> ends<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.089> this<00:00:59.089> is

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
really weave in all the ends so this is

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.840 
really weave in all the ends so this is
our<00:00:59.390> first<00:00:59.809> stitch<00:01:00.289> right<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.190> then<00:01:01.609> you

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
our first stitch right and then you

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.620 
our first stitch right and then you
would<00:01:02.089> just<00:01:02.389> pick<00:01:03.350> up<00:01:03.550> each<00:01:04.550> stitch<00:01:05.120> and

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
would just pick up each stitch and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.310 
would just pick up each stitch and
crochet<00:01:06.549> single<00:01:07.549> crochet<00:01:09.340> stitch<00:01:10.340> and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
crochet single crochet stitch and

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.630 
crochet single crochet stitch and
another<00:01:12.320> single<00:01:12.950> crochet<00:01:14.200> stitch<00:01:15.219> this<00:01:16.219> stays

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
another single crochet stitch this stays

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.750 
another single crochet stitch this stays
right<00:01:16.939> there

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.030 

and<00:01:25.300> you<00:01:25.660> just<00:01:26.080> need<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.380> continue<00:01:27.100> like<00:01:27.610> this

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and you just need to continue like this

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.090 
and you just need to continue like this
leave<00:01:30.040> that<00:01:30.340> end<00:01:30.670> over<00:01:30.880> there<00:01:31.800> you<00:01:32.800> just

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
leave that end over there you just

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.210 
leave that end over there you just
continue<00:01:33.490> along<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.630> edge<00:01:36.930> until<00:01:37.930> you<00:01:38.440> reach

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
continue along the edge until you reach

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.420 
continue along the edge until you reach
the<00:01:39.520> corner<00:01:39.820> right<00:01:40.420> there<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:45.220> will

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
the corner right there and then you will

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.410 
the corner right there and then you will
continue<00:01:46.090> with<00:01:46.650> those<00:01:47.650> two<00:01:48.100> squares<00:01:49.030> right

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
continue with those two squares right

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.890 
continue with those two squares right
there<00:01:53.790> actually<00:01:54.790> I<00:01:54.820> will<00:01:55.180> continue<00:01:55.690> with

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
there actually I will continue with

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.960 
there actually I will continue with
those<00:01:56.050> two<00:01:56.350> squares<00:01:56.620> you<00:01:57.340> would<00:01:57.490> continue

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
those two squares you would continue

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:07.469 
those two squares you would continue
with<00:01:58.120> your<00:01:58.390> squares

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.749 

so<00:02:08.020> when<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.349> pick<00:02:08.560> up<00:02:08.679> all<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.250> stitches

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
so when you pick up all the stitches

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.330 
so when you pick up all the stitches
along<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.420> edge<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:11.200> crochet<00:02:12.069> single

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340

crochet you get to the corner and you
will<00:02:17.170> make<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.800> single<00:02:18.459> crochet<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.540> corner

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
will make a single crochet in the corner

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.170 
will make a single crochet in the corner
and<00:02:20.790> then<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:22.360> will<00:02:22.569> go<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.050> get<00:02:23.920> your<00:02:24.459> other

two<00:02:25.690> squares<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:28.030> case<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.780> it

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
two squares in this case this is it

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.440 
two squares in this case this is it
these<00:02:30.880> are<00:02:31.060> ours<00:02:31.300> these<00:02:32.290> are<00:02:32.500> our<00:02:32.709> squares

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
these are ours these are our squares

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.890 
these are ours these are our squares
again<00:02:34.450> back-to-back<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.879> just<00:02:36.879> continue<00:02:37.599> in

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
again back-to-back and just continue in

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.449 
again back-to-back and just continue in
the<00:02:38.140> line<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:39.459> we<00:02:40.030> will<00:02:40.209> start<00:02:41.280> with<00:02:42.280> the

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
the line and we will start with the

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.550 
the line and we will start with the
corners<00:02:43.000> first<00:02:45.360> we<00:02:46.360> will<00:02:46.540> make<00:02:46.599> single

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
corners first we will make single

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.610 
corners first we will make single
crochet<00:02:48.099> into<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.910> corners<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.780> then

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
crochet into the corners and then

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.000 
crochet into the corners and then
continue<00:02:51.370> with<00:02:51.849> each<00:02:52.150> stitch<00:02:52.690> along<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.769> edge

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
continue with each stitch along the edge

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.569 
continue with each stitch along the edge
so<00:02:54.459> we<00:02:54.849> will<00:02:55.030> go<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:56.200> put<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.739> first<00:02:57.040> stitch

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
so we will go and put in a first stitch

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.830 
so we will go and put in a first stitch
here<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.269> first<00:02:58.690> stitch<00:02:59.079> on<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.530> other<00:02:59.739> side

here and first stitch on the other side

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.110 
here and first stitch on the other side
and<00:03:01.840> make<00:03:02.220> single<00:03:03.220> crochet<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.750> continue

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.009 
and make single crochet and continue
along<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.420> edge<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:13.690> when<00:03:14.380> you're<00:03:14.560> finished

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
along the edge and when you're finished

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.640 
along the edge and when you're finished
you<00:03:17.019> pick<00:03:17.260> up<00:03:17.470> next<00:03:18.130> two<00:03:18.579> squares<00:03:19.150> in<00:03:19.650> those

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
you pick up next two squares in those

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.190 
you pick up next two squares in those
two<00:03:21.010> rows<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:21.819> in<00:03:22.090> my<00:03:22.329> case<00:03:22.389> it<00:03:22.750> would<00:03:22.900> be<00:03:23.019> this

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
two rows so in my case it would be this

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.050 
two rows so in my case it would be this
gray<00:03:23.530> one<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.100> that<00:03:24.489> blue<00:03:25.359> one<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:27.060> blue

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
gray one and that blue one and the blue
