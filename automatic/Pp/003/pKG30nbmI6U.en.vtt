 same time by having things at once 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.239

 that there is pleasure so it's 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.670
 hours of rehearsal that's a lot of

 solo sketches with two or three 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.890

 performance and foliage obviously 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.740
 sometimes fantastic situations 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.180
 like here number no through his 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.240
 history of menzel comes who indeed 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.590
 gets arrested at las vegas and and but 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.590
 it usually always ends well 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.799
 trickster and miss there is a 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.729
 complicity foolproof apology or 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.220
 it's a real artistic meeting 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.600
 because there is a way to work 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.680
 that correspond a lot and we are 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.539
 a bit like two kids in a yard 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.950
 of recess what does that mean when 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.500
 mounts a number it goes in all 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.979
 sense then it can be very risky 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.439
 to love each other but here I hope in everything 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.990
 case claimed a little bit my universe my 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.990

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.869
 [Music] 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.209
 the artist recently discovered this 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.209
 universe 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.890
 and even if the beginnings are difficult if 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.060
 you want to become an artist 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.000

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.560
 follow these tips I did not know 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.480
 my ability to be creative like that 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.209
 So it's things that at first his 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.739
 are difficult and suddenly goes into 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.220
 place and it's important to have a 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.510
 look outside because because 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.190
 it's good to do things by yourself 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.630
 even for me makes me feel letters in 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.420

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.920

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.490

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.620
 - to wear if one of the organ their regard 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.930
 the decisive interior but the most 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.180
 important is not to get away from 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.670
 childhood go get his little 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.220

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.470
