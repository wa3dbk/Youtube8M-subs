blade blade designs blade configurations
etc<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.370> here<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.300> camera<00:00:45.629> doesn't

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
etc so here it is the camera doesn't

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.510 
etc so here it is the camera doesn't

cool pocket clip zombie tech on it and
then<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> date<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.910> serial<00:01:00.300> number<00:01:00.600> are

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
then the date and the serial number are

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.170 
then the date and the serial number are
actually<00:01:01.920> inside<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.260> biohazard<00:01:05.180> toxic

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
actually inside of that biohazard toxic

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.500 
actually inside of that biohazard toxic
sign<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.510> 2012

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
sign there you can see to the right 2012

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.649 
sign there you can see to the right 2012
then<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:10.189> pretty<00:01:11.189> sure<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.549> says<00:01:11.850> 0<00:01:12.090> 0<00:01:12.390> 3
