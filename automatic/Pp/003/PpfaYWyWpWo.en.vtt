galaxy have planets orbiting around them
that<00:00:07.280> can<00:00:08.280> Harbor<00:00:08.730> life<00:00:09.179> now<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:09.750> is

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
that can Harbor life now this is

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.959 
that can Harbor life now this is
fascinating<00:00:10.170> because<00:00:10.650> it's<00:00:11.370> always

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
fascinating because it's always

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.610 
fascinating because it's always
interesting<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.389> hear<00:00:12.630> scientists<00:00:13.320> come<00:00:13.440> out

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
interesting to hear scientists come out

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.880 
interesting to hear scientists come out
and<00:00:13.769> say<00:00:13.920> yeah<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:15.210> know<00:00:15.470> we<00:00:16.470> haven't<00:00:16.740> seen

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
and say yeah you know we haven't seen

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.779 
and say yeah you know we haven't seen
life<00:00:17.270> but<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:18.420> out<00:00:18.570> there<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.990> mean<00:00:19.789> chances

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
life but it's out there I mean chances

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.769 
life but it's out there I mean chances
are<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.900> there<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.980> it

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
are it's out there and this just it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.200 
are it's out there and this just it
seems<00:00:24.779> like<00:00:24.990> every<00:00:25.289> month<00:00:25.529> there's<00:00:26.210> new

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
seems like every month there's new

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.450 
seems like every month there's new
research<00:00:27.590> that<00:00:28.590> comes<00:00:28.769> out<00:00:28.949> because<00:00:29.250> these

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
research that comes out because these

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.859 
research that comes out because these
satellites<00:00:30.000> are<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.330> getting<00:00:30.510> better<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
satellites are just getting better and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.540 
satellites are just getting better and
better<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.410> optics<00:00:31.830> are<00:00:32.009> getting<00:00:32.219> better<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
better the optics are getting better and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.069 
better the optics are getting better and
better<00:00:32.700> we're<00:00:33.030> being<00:00:33.239> able<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.750> further

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
better we're being able to see further

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.400 
better we're being able to see further
out<00:00:34.290> into<00:00:34.440> space<00:00:35.180> but<00:00:36.180> every<00:00:36.329> month<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:37.110> hear

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
out into space but every month we hear

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
out into space but every month we hear
details<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.250> hear<00:00:38.370> information<00:00:38.850> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
details and we hear information that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.670 
details and we hear information that
just<00:00:40.309> blows<00:00:41.309> our<00:00:41.879> minds<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.579> it<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.879> is

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
just blows our minds and it just is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.600 
just blows our minds and it just is
constantly<00:00:47.840> refreshing<00:00:48.840> what<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
constantly refreshing what we know and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.310 
constantly refreshing what we know and
what<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:51.210> think<00:00:51.750> about<00:00:53.000> our<00:00:54.000> role<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.870> this

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
what we think about our role in this

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.740 
what we think about our role in this
crazy<00:00:56.190> universe<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:58.789> red<00:00:59.789> dwarf<00:01:00.030> stars<00:01:00.270> it's

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
crazy universe the red dwarf stars it's

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.680 
crazy universe the red dwarf stars it's
interesting<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.230> these<00:01:01.530> stars<00:01:01.920> are

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
interesting because these stars are

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.179 
interesting because these stars are
burning<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:05.479> lower<00:01:06.479> intensity<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.890> our

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
burning at a lower intensity that our

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.630 
burning at a lower intensity that our
son<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.930> order<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.920> planets

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
son is and so in order for the planets

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.690 
son is and so in order for the planets
to<00:01:12.299> harbor<00:01:13.140> life<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.770> similar<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.220> here's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to harbor life that's similar to here's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.149 
to harbor life that's similar to here's
on<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.720> earth<00:01:16.020> where<00:01:16.590> there's<00:01:16.799> water

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
on to here on earth where there's water

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.160 
on to here on earth where there's water
and<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.750> terrain<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.619> artists<00:01:20.150> the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
and and the terrain like artists the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.520 
and and the terrain like artists the
planets<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.619> closer<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.390> the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
planets we have to be closer to the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.870 
planets we have to be closer to the
stars<00:01:25.530> which<00:01:26.280> would<00:01:26.640> mean<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:28.070> Rays<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
stars which would mean that the Rays the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.480 
stars which would mean that the Rays the
the<00:01:30.479> solar<00:01:30.780> rays<00:01:31.110> would<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.619> more<00:01:31.829> intense<00:01:32.189> and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the solar rays would be more intense and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.410 
the solar rays would be more intense and
so<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.939> think<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:35.420> different

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
so I think you would have just different

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.630 
so I think you would have just different
species<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.900> mean<00:01:37.140> they<00:01:37.920> would<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.220> different

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
species I mean they would have different

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.249 
species I mean they would have different
skin<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.270> would<00:01:39.450> possibly<00:01:40.970> have<00:01:42.259> different

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
skin they would possibly have different

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.039 
skin they would possibly have different
ways<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.710> breathing<00:01:44.430> air<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:45.030> different<00:01:45.810> Gill

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
ways of breathing air a different Gill

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.260 
ways of breathing air a different Gill
system<00:01:46.350> or<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> different<00:01:47.159> lung<00:01:47.369> system<00:01:47.850> than

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
system or a different lung system than

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.310 
system or a different lung system than
we<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.840> course<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:50.310> know<00:01:50.430> they<00:01:50.700> could<00:01:50.909> be

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
we have of course you know they could be

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.340 
we have of course you know they could be
60<00:01:52.320> feet<00:01:52.470> tall<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.240> six<00:01:54.750> inches<00:01:55.049> tall

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
60 feet tall or you know six inches tall

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.420 
60 feet tall or you know six inches tall
they<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> huge<00:01:58.049> variety<00:01:58.860> of

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
they can be have a huge variety of

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.870 
they can be have a huge variety of
species<00:02:00.320> they<00:02:01.320> could<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.560> fur<00:02:02.430> they<00:02:02.729> could

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
species they could have fur they could

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.870 
species they could have fur they could
be<00:02:03.000> skype<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> mean<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.340> it's<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.610> just

be skype I mean it's just it's it's just

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.619 
be skype I mean it's just it's it's just
fun<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.960> think<00:02:07.200> about<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:08.629> vast

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
fun to think about the vast

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.520 
fun to think about the vast
possibilities<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:11.720> what<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.959> crawler

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
possibilities of what is crawler

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.280 
possibilities of what is crawler
on<00:02:13.950> these<00:02:14.100> other<00:02:14.280> planets<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.840> also<00:02:15.990> just

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
on these other planets and it also just

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.520 
on these other planets and it also just
kind<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:17.480> makes<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.930> stand<00:02:19.230> back<00:02:19.470> and

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
kind of makes you just stand back and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.970 
kind of makes you just stand back and
say<00:02:20.270> okay<00:02:21.800> all<00:02:22.800> my<00:02:23.700> time<00:02:23.970> here<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.209> limited<00:02:24.300> and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
say okay all my time here is limited and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.760 
say okay all my time here is limited and
our<00:02:25.980> time<00:02:26.250> here<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.580> short<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.420> not<00:02:28.319> only<00:02:28.350> enjoy

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
our time here is short so not only enjoy

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.320 
our time here is short so not only enjoy
but<00:02:29.810> do<00:02:30.810> something<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.890> gonna<00:02:32.580> make<00:02:33.120> this

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
but do something that is gonna make this
