00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
changing but seems to be that's another

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.160 
changing but seems to be that's another
concept<00:01:35.930> isn't<00:01:36.140> it<00:01:36.260> that<00:01:36.470> this<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.130> now

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
concept isn't it that this this is now

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
door I don't know yeah will be my behind

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.539 
door I don't know yeah will be my behind
my<00:02:03.469> head<00:02:03.619> I'm<00:02:03.829> just<00:02:04.039> saying<00:02:04.280> what<00:02:04.429> I'm<00:02:04.520> saying

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549

my head I'm just saying what I'm saying
right<00:02:04.880> now<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:05.719> it<00:02:05.840> just<00:02:05.869> seems<00:02:06.409> that<00:02:07.399> the

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
right now so it just seems that the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.490 
right now so it just seems that the
awareness<00:02:07.909> this<00:02:08.420> awareness<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:09.019> looking<00:02:09.349> at

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
awareness this awareness is looking at

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.250 
awareness this awareness is looking at
just<00:02:09.769> in<00:02:09.950> this<00:02:10.280> very<00:02:12.040> simple<00:02:13.040> subtle<00:02:13.790> quick

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
just in this very simple subtle quick

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.880 
just in this very simple subtle quick
moment<00:02:15.260> which<00:02:15.799> is<00:02:15.830> gone<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:16.459> an<00:02:16.610> instant<00:02:16.700> and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
moment which is gone in an instant and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.770 
moment which is gone in an instant and
so<00:02:18.890> that's<00:02:19.040> that's<00:02:19.250> that's<00:02:19.549> time<00:02:19.849> that's<00:02:20.269> but

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
so that's that's that's time that's but

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.570 
so that's that's that's time that's but
that's<00:02:20.900> another<00:02:22.480> concept<00:02:23.480> ultimately<00:02:24.019> that

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
that's another concept ultimately that

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.970 
that's another concept ultimately that
there<00:02:25.580> is<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.730> moment<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:30.260> at<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.470> moment<00:02:30.650> is

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
there is a moment and at the moment is

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.860 
there is a moment and at the moment is
here<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.489> then<00:02:31.579> it's<00:02:31.700> gone<00:02:31.849> you<00:02:32.720> never

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
here and then it's gone you never

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.270 
here and then it's gone you never
actually<00:02:33.049> that's<00:02:33.620> never<00:02:33.829> part<00:02:34.099> of<00:02:34.160> your

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
actually that's never part of your

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.400 
actually that's never part of your
experience<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:35.660> never<00:02:35.810> experienced<00:02:36.349> a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
experience you never experienced a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.979 
experience you never experienced a
moment<00:02:36.709> being<00:02:36.829> there<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.160> then<00:02:37.390> leaving<00:02:38.390> no

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
moment being there and then leaving no

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.619 
moment being there and then leaving no
no<00:02:39.950> continent<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:40.940> can't<00:02:41.150> even<00:02:41.239> say<00:02:41.450> this

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
no continent so you can't even say this

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.270 
no continent so you can't even say this
is<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.900> economy<00:02:42.230> altima<00:02:42.829> tlie<00:02:42.920> quantum<00:02:43.160> and

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
is the economy altima tlie quantum and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.479 
is the economy altima tlie quantum and
say<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:43.819> this<00:02:44.360> moment<00:02:44.810> now<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:46.340> know<00:02:46.459> that

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
say this this moment now you know that

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.220 
say this this moment now you know that
implies<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:47.420> is<00:02:47.569> like<00:02:47.690> a<00:02:47.720> slither<00:02:48.049> of

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
implies that this is like a slither of

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.280 
implies that this is like a slither of
time<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:50.170> slither<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.349> time<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:51.890> between<00:02:53.290> the

time a slither of time in between the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.680 
time a slither of time in between the
past<00:02:54.560> then<00:02:54.980> pass<00:02:55.400> them<00:02:55.579> in<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.030> future<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.569> so

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
past then pass them in the future and so

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.000 
past then pass them in the future and so
no<00:02:56.810> that's<00:02:56.959> not<00:02:57.079> the<00:02:57.200> story<00:02:57.379> overlaid<00:02:57.829> onto

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.569 

there's<00:03:05.930> only<00:03:06.109> there's<00:03:06.620> not<00:03:06.829> this<00:03:07.160> moment

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
there's only there's not this moment
