00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
a puzzle game basically kind of like a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.770 
a puzzle game basically kind of like a
Tetris<00:00:36.649> Sailor<00:00:37.649> Moon<00:00:37.860> Tetris<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:39.540> it's

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
Tetris Sailor Moon Tetris is really it's

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.959 
Tetris Sailor Moon Tetris is really it's
really<00:00:39.930> kind<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.290> wild<00:00:40.649> we'll<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.550> into<00:00:41.700> it

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
really kind of wild we'll get into it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.720 
really kind of wild we'll get into it
and<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.710> player<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.040> player

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and you can do like one player to player

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.460 
and you can do like one player to player
you<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.719> continue

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
you can continue

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.100 
you can continue
I<00:00:47.530> think<00:00:48.190> we'll<00:00:48.310> just<00:00:48.460> do<00:00:48.550> one<00:00:48.730> player<00:00:48.970> today<00:00:49.210> I

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.330 

guess<00:00:53.110> it's<00:00:53.320> kind<00:00:53.500> of<00:00:53.530> like<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.680> Tetris<00:00:54.130> and<00:00:54.220> a

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
guess it's kind of like a Tetris and a

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.300 
guess it's kind of like a Tetris and a
puyo<00:00:54.580> puyo<00:00:55.050> mixed<00:00:56.050> together<00:00:56.170> you<00:00:56.950> got<00:00:57.100> all<00:00:57.220> the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
puyo puyo mixed together you got all the

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.510 
puyo puyo mixed together you got all the
different<00:00:57.610> characters<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:58.150> can<00:00:58.300> choose<00:00:58.540> from

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
different characters you can choose from

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.130 
different characters you can choose from
kind<00:01:00.520> of<00:01:00.550> like<00:01:00.700> this<00:01:00.880> one<00:01:01.090> but<00:01:01.330> just<00:01:01.900> because

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
kind of like this one but just because

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:27.720 
kind of like this one but just because
of<00:01:02.650> games<00:01:03.340> sais<00:01:03.790> quois

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.360 

so<00:01:29.170> as<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:30.200> can<00:01:30.410> notice<00:01:30.530> here<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:31.040> have<00:01:31.190> all

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
so as you can notice here you have all

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.890 
so as you can notice here you have all
these<00:01:31.460> different<00:01:31.520> colored<00:01:32.060> blocks<00:01:32.360> what<00:01:32.780> you

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
these different colored blocks what you

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.360 
these different colored blocks what you
want<00:01:33.050> to<00:01:33.140> do<00:01:33.260> all<00:01:33.680> these<00:01:33.830> different<00:01:34.040> colored

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
want to do all these different colored

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.670 
want to do all these different colored
parts<00:01:34.760> I<00:01:34.900> think<00:01:35.900> for<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.140> most<00:01:36.290> part<00:01:36.410> you<00:01:36.650> just

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
parts I think for the most part you just

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.000 
parts I think for the most part you just
want<00:01:36.980> to<00:01:37.040> clear<00:01:37.220> them<00:01:37.370> out<00:01:37.430> of<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.700> way<00:01:38.540> and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
want to clear them out of the way and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.310 
want to clear them out of the way and
you<00:01:40.010> can<00:01:40.220> do<00:01:40.370> different<00:01:40.580> attacks<00:01:41.320> depending

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
you can do different attacks depending

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.890 
you can do different attacks depending
on what<00:01:43.190> items<00:01:43.790> fall<00:01:44.120> down<00:01:44.330> in<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.630> hearts

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
on what items fall down in the hearts

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.250 
on what items fall down in the hearts
section<00:01:46.240> like<00:01:47.240> right<00:01:47.450> there<00:01:47.600> that's<00:01:47.840> an<00:01:48.020> item

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
section like right there that's an item

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.120 
section like right there that's an item
that<00:01:48.290> can<00:01:48.620> be<00:01:48.740> used<00:01:48.890> as<00:01:49.100> an<00:01:49.250> attack<00:01:54.100> it's<00:01:55.100> a

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
that can be used as an attack it's a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.490 
that can be used as an attack it's a
heart<00:01:55.370> attack<00:01:55.460> right<00:01:55.850> there<00:01:56.260> pardon<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.290> pun

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
heart attack right there pardon the pun

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.070 
heart attack right there pardon the pun
but<00:02:00.850> yeah<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:02.120> know<00:02:02.210> it's<00:02:02.360> kind<00:02:02.480> of<00:02:02.510> why<00:02:02.690> often

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
but yeah you know it's kind of why often

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.080 
but yeah you know it's kind of why often
as<00:02:03.680> far<00:02:03.890> as<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.100> concept<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.730> you<00:02:04.970> know

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
as far as the concept and you know

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.790 
as far as the concept and you know
exactly<00:02:05.540> what<00:02:06.200> you're<00:02:06.260> supposed<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.620> do<00:02:06.770> I

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
exactly what you're supposed to do I

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.760 
exactly what you're supposed to do I
think<00:02:06.920> you're<00:02:07.460> supposed<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.850> get<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:09.619> other

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
think you're supposed to get the other

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.760 
think you're supposed to get the other
side<00:02:10.070> to<00:02:10.340> where<00:02:10.520> there's<00:02:10.850> no<00:02:11.380> we<00:02:12.380> can't<00:02:12.620> really

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
side to where there's no we can't really

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.010 
side to where there's no we can't really
move<00:02:13.070> because<00:02:13.880> with<00:02:14.030> all<00:02:14.060> these<00:02:14.330> hearts<00:02:14.750> when

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
move because with all these hearts when

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.110 
move because with all these hearts when
they're<00:02:15.140> all<00:02:15.230> clear<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:16.550> can't<00:02:16.760> really<00:02:16.970> do

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
they're all clear you can't really do

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.940 
they're all clear you can't really do
much<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.050> think<00:02:18.320> if<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.530> can<00:02:18.650> get<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.830> other

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
much so I think if you can get the other

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.920 
much so I think if you can get the other
side<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.550> have<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:20.090> basically<00:02:20.450> all<00:02:20.660> clear

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
side to have just basically all clear

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.080 
side to have just basically all clear
hearts<00:02:21.260> then<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:21.770> can<00:02:21.950> cause<00:02:22.730> some<00:02:22.940> serious

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
hearts then you can cause some serious

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:34.240 
hearts then you can cause some serious
damage

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.920 

but<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.550> by<00:02:35.670> kind<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.330> jumping<00:02:36.630> over<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
but just by kind of jumping over the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.180 
but just by kind of jumping over the
hearts<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.290> stuff<00:02:37.470> like<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.890> turn<00:02:38.070> them

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
hearts and stuff like that you turn them

00:02:38.190 --> 00:03:16.220 
hearts and stuff like that you turn them
different<00:02:38.520> colors<00:03:14.870> musics<00:03:15.870> kind<00:03:16.140> of

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
different colors musics kind of

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
different colors musics kind of
interesting<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.800> know<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.920> concepts<00:03:19.250> pretty

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
interesting you know the concepts pretty

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.120 
interesting you know the concepts pretty
wild<00:03:20.580> as<00:03:20.700> well<00:03:21.440> never<00:03:22.440> really<00:03:22.710> played<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:22.950> game
