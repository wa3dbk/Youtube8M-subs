that everybody is talking about well

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.400 
that everybody is talking about well
France<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:17.970> called<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.570> ionic<00:00:19.170> foot

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
France this is called the ionic foot

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.599 
France this is called the ionic foot
bath<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.240> this<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> first<00:00:21.869> part<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.320> it

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
bath and this is the first part of it

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.420 
bath and this is the first part of it
this<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.670> called<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.539> ray<00:00:25.289> which<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.859> place<00:00:26.160> in

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
this is called a ray which we place in

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.570 
this is called a ray which we place in
the<00:00:26.460> water<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.349> we<00:00:28.349> have<00:00:28.529> Josette<00:00:29.010> here<00:00:29.279> today

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the water and we have Josette here today

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.970 
the water and we have Josette here today
and<00:00:29.849> she's<00:00:30.630> going<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> demonstrate<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
and she's going to demonstrate it and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.580 
and she's going to demonstrate it and
basically<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.930> know<00:00:34.050> overall

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
basically this is for you know overall

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.319 
basically this is for you know overall
health<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.280> pull<00:00:35.460> toxins<00:00:36.000> out<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.180> your

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
health it can pull toxins out of your

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.040 
health it can pull toxins out of your
body<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.440> forth<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.190> think<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:39.050> really

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
body and so forth so I think it's really

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.869 
body and so forth so I think it's really
something<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.680> would<00:00:41.129> benefit<00:00:41.550> everybody

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
something that would benefit everybody

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.030 
something that would benefit everybody
so<00:00:42.480> I'll<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.050> go<00:00:43.440> ahead<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.800> look<00:00:43.920> at

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
so I'll have you go ahead and look at

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.670 
so I'll have you go ahead and look at
the<00:00:44.190> array<00:00:44.460> mm-hm<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.780> that's<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.440> first

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the array mm-hm and so that's the first

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.740 
the array mm-hm and so that's the first
part<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.280> placed<00:00:47.670> into<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.329> water

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
part it's placed into the water

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.860 
part it's placed into the water
and<00:00:48.960> then<00:00:49.649> what<00:00:49.950> happens<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:51.120> fed<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
and then what happens is it's fed a

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.830 
and then what happens is it's fed a
positive<00:00:52.800> direct<00:00:53.340> current<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
positive direct current and then the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.470 
positive direct current and then the
second<00:00:55.320> part<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.739> ionizer<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.730> fed<00:00:57.090> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
second part of the ionizer is fed a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.130 
second part of the ionizer is fed a
negative<00:00:58.109> direct<00:00:58.469> current<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> when<00:01:00.960> this

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
negative direct current and so when this

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.680 
negative direct current and so when this
takes<00:01:01.379> place<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> water<00:01:02.399> is

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
takes place then the water is

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.100 
takes place then the water is
deconstructed<00:01:03.690> into<00:01:04.049> hydrogen<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.769> oxygen

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
deconstructed into hydrogen and oxygen

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
deconstructed into hydrogen and oxygen
molecules<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.500> when<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.280> happens<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
molecules and when this happens then you

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.270 
molecules and when this happens then you
have<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> negative<00:01:09.659> charge<00:01:09.930> here<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.890> right

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
have a negative charge here in right

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.710 
have a negative charge here in right
here<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> water<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.119> takes<00:01:12.180> place<00:01:12.600> right

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
here in the water it takes place right

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.270 
here in the water it takes place right
here<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> water<00:01:13.350> should<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.710> go<00:01:13.860> ahead<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
here in the water should I go ahead and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.429 
here in the water should I go ahead and
go<00:01:14.369> ahead<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.360> oh<00:01:15.689> wow<00:01:15.990> I'm

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
go ahead and have it in oh wow I'm

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.039 
go ahead and have it in oh wow I'm
curious<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.009> all<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.640> okay<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.689> then

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
curious to see all of this okay and then

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.620 
curious to see all of this okay and then
Josette<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:20.040> ahead<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.520> place<00:01:20.729> your<00:01:20.759> feet<00:01:21.360> in

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
Josette go ahead and place your feet in

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
Josette go ahead and place your feet in
the<00:01:21.780> water<00:01:22.020> well<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.770> might<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.280> add

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the water well not we might have to add

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.429 
the water well not we might have to add
a<00:01:23.430> little<00:01:23.640> more<00:01:23.880> water<00:01:24.090> okay

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.380 

thus<00:01:31.040> treatment<00:01:31.520> takes<00:01:31.729> about<00:01:31.880> 30<00:01:32.270> minutes

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
thus treatment takes about 30 minutes

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.100 
thus treatment takes about 30 minutes
and<00:01:33.020> this<00:01:33.710> energy<00:01:34.280> gets<00:01:35.000> in<00:01:35.270> into<00:01:35.780> your<00:01:35.810> body

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
and this energy gets in into your body

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.260 
and this energy gets in into your body
through<00:01:36.530> those<00:01:36.770> pores<00:01:37.219> of<00:01:37.520> your<00:01:37.549> feet<00:01:37.880> like<00:01:38.090> I

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
through those pores of your feet like I

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.670 
through those pores of your feet like I
was<00:01:38.450> telling<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:40.880> basically<00:01:41.680> it

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
was telling you and it it basically it

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.789 
was telling you and it it basically it
gets<00:01:43.369> into<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:44.020> meridians<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.229> your<00:01:45.530> body

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
gets into the meridians of your body

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.819 
gets into the meridians of your body
through<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.429> soles<00:01:46.700> of<00:01:46.909> your<00:01:46.939> feet<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.829> then

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
through the soles of your feet and then

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.520 
through the soles of your feet and then
it<00:01:48.979> flows<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.280> your<00:01:49.579> major<00:01:50.210> organs<00:01:50.659> causing

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
it flows to your major organs causing

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.130 
it flows to your major organs causing
your<00:01:51.950> major<00:01:52.189> organs<00:01:52.759> to<00:01:52.970> release<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.539> toxins

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
your major organs to release the toxins

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.039 
your major organs to release the toxins
into<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:55.069> water<00:01:55.399> my<00:01:55.939> goodness<00:01:56.420> gracious<00:01:56.600> it's

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
into the water my goodness gracious it's

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.319 
into the water my goodness gracious it's
already<00:01:57.439> changing<00:01:57.979> color<00:01:58.310> right<00:01:58.610> there<00:01:58.640> and

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
already changing color right there and

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.109 
already changing color right there and
so<00:01:59.960> that<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.649> like<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.310> heavy<00:02:01.520> metals<00:02:02.030> the

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
so that is like the heavy metals the

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.120 
so that is like the heavy metals the
free<00:02:02.420> radicals<00:02:02.959> and<00:02:03.110> things<00:02:03.380> like<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.770> huh

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
free radicals and things like that huh

free radicals and things like that huh
can<00:02:04.399> be<00:02:04.580> pulled<00:02:05.299> out<00:02:05.649> through<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.770> bottom<00:02:07.069> of

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
can be pulled out through the bottom of

can be pulled out through the bottom of
your<00:02:07.340> feet<00:02:07.520> that's<00:02:08.000> M<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:08.539> we'll<00:02:08.720> wait<00:02:08.959> for

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
your feet that's M so we'll wait for

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.160 
your feet that's M so we'll wait for
some<00:02:09.470> time<00:02:09.769> to<00:02:10.099> lapse<00:02:10.510> about<00:02:11.510> approximately

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
some time to lapse about approximately

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.440 
some time to lapse about approximately
30<00:02:12.560> minutes<00:02:12.799> and<00:02:13.160> then<00:02:13.730> we'll<00:02:13.910> take<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.120> look<00:02:14.360> at

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
30 minutes and then we'll take a look at

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.650 
30 minutes and then we'll take a look at
the<00:02:14.569> water<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.080> see<00:02:15.590> what<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:15.830> looks<00:02:15.860> like

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.350 

so<00:02:21.260> here<00:02:21.680> we<00:02:21.800> are<00:02:21.830> about<00:02:22.280> 30<00:02:22.580> minutes<00:02:23.030> later

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
so here we are about 30 minutes later

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.200 
so here we are about 30 minutes later
and<00:02:24.200> Josette<00:02:25.070> is<00:02:25.130> just<00:02:25.520> finishing<00:02:25.880> up<00:02:26.150> here
