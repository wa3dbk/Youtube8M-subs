00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.959 

the<00:00:13.320> relative<00:00:13.679> isotopic<00:00:14.040> mass<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.940> mass

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
the relative isotopic mass is the mass

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.740 
the relative isotopic mass is the mass
of<00:00:15.269> an<00:00:15.360> element<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.839> relation<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.320> carbon-12

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
of an element in relation to carbon-12

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.179 
of an element in relation to carbon-12
the<00:00:18.750> reason<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> isotopic

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the reason that this is the isotopic

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.040 
the reason that this is the isotopic
mass<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:21.029> some<00:00:21.240> elements<00:00:21.630> have

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
mass is because some elements have

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.939 
mass is because some elements have
different<00:00:22.439> isotopic<00:00:22.949> forms<00:00:23.689> for<00:00:24.689> example

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
different isotopic forms for example

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.550 
different isotopic forms for example
chlorine<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.189> found<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.670> chlorine-35<00:00:27.359> and

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
chlorine can be found as chlorine-35 and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.100 
chlorine can be found as chlorine-35 and
chlorine-37<00:00:31.850> the<00:00:32.850> isotopic<00:00:33.390> mass<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.780> not<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
chlorine-37 the isotopic mass is not the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.209 
chlorine-37 the isotopic mass is not the
mass<00:00:34.260> number<00:00:34.590> which<00:00:34.620> appears<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:35.160> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
of 37 in most cases to take a simple

of 37 in most cases to take a simple
average<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.640> would<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:29.909> add<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.299> values

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
average you would just add the values

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.359 
average you would just add the values
together<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.710> divide<00:01:32.070> by<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.280> number

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
together and then divide by the number

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.080 
together and then divide by the number
of<00:01:32.640> values<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.860> this<00:01:34.860> case<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.400> would<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.579> 35

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
of values in this case it would be 35

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.670 
of values in this case it would be 35
plus<00:01:36.420> 37<00:01:37.400> divided<00:01:38.400> by<00:01:38.490> 2<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.320> would<00:01:40.530> get

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
plus 37 divided by 2 and you would get

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.789 
plus 37 divided by 2 and you would get
an<00:01:40.860> average<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.340> 36<00:01:42.020> but<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.290> not<00:01:43.530> how<00:01:43.740> you

find out the total mass of the sample we

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.420 
find out the total mass of the sample we
do<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:45.989> by<00:02:46.170> multiplying<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.829> mass<00:02:46.980> each

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
do this by multiplying the mass each

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.699 
do this by multiplying the mass each

atom by the number of atoms present for
each<00:02:49.829> isotope<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.670> then<00:02:51.359> we<00:02:51.480> add<00:02:51.599> them

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
each isotope and then we add them

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.610 
each isotope and then we add them
together<00:02:53.000> for<00:02:54.000> chlorine<00:02:54.299> 35<00:02:54.599> there<00:02:55.079> are<00:02:55.200> 75

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.569 
atoms and the chlorine 37 there are 25
atoms<00:02:58.819> so<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.940> mass<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.269> 100<00:03:00.629> atoms<00:03:00.930> would<00:03:01.140> be

divided by the number of atoms so the

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.370

atomic mass has a very closer to 35

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.619
