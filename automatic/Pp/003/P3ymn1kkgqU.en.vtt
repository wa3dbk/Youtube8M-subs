00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
it's a unusual example of a tree that I

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.910 
it's a unusual example of a tree that I
run<00:00:23.039> into<00:00:23.340> every<00:00:23.640> single<00:00:23.820> day<00:00:24.350> but<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.410> don't

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
what's going on now one of the problems

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.399 
what's going on now one of the problems
when<00:01:05.970> you'll<00:01:06.150> start<00:01:06.540> looking<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.110> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
when you'll start looking is that you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.920 
when you'll start looking is that you
start<00:01:07.680> finding<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.790> there's<00:01:09.420> all<00:01:09.659> these

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
start finding and there's all these

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.399 
start finding and there's all these
potential<00:01:10.530> wood<00:01:11.280> ifs<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.729> know<00:01:11.909> here's<00:01:12.090> where

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
potential wood ifs you know here's where

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.320 
potential wood ifs you know here's where
branch<00:01:13.409> was<00:01:13.590> cut<00:01:13.799> off<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.950> long<00:01:14.369> time<00:01:14.790> ago<00:01:15.060> so

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
branch was cut off a long time ago so

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.960 
branch was cut off a long time ago so
there's<00:01:15.509> some<00:01:15.780> decay<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.350> there<00:01:16.580> this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.759> an

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
there's some decay in there this is an

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.530 
there's some decay in there this is an
included<00:01:18.450> crotch<00:01:18.960> right<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:20.009> some

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
included crotch right here with some

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.719 
included crotch right here with some
debris<00:01:21.540> down<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.460> do<00:01:23.670> do

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
debris down in there what do you do do

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.210 
debris down in there what do you do do
you<00:01:23.880> clean<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.390> out<00:01:24.540> does<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.650> happen

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
you clean it out does it happen

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.399 
you clean it out does it happen
does<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.610> hold<00:01:26.790> water<00:01:27.299> probably<00:01:30.079> you<00:01:31.079> check

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
does it hold water probably you check

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.920 
does it hold water probably you check
for<00:01:31.680> any<00:01:31.799> weaknesses<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.729> when<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> look<00:01:33.810> at

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
for any weaknesses but when you look at

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.910 
for any weaknesses but when you look at
this<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.479> big<00:01:36.479> Japanese<00:01:37.350> maple

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
this that is one big Japanese maple

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.569 
this that is one big Japanese maple
branch<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:39.240> has<00:01:39.630> an<00:01:39.900> awful<00:01:40.290> lot<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.189> weight<00:01:41.520> on

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
branch it has an awful lot of weight on

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.649 
branch it has an awful lot of weight on
it<00:01:42.020> does<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.170> need<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> cable<00:01:44.119> I'd<00:01:45.119> rather<00:01:45.360> not

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
it does it need a cable I'd rather not

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.800 
it does it need a cable I'd rather not
do<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> cable<00:01:46.320> unless<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.100> see<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> reason<00:01:48.570> for

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
do a cable unless you see a reason for

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.630 
do a cable unless you see a reason for
it

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
it

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.450 
it
suspecting<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.729> weakness<00:01:51.119> might<00:01:51.420> be

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
suspecting a weakness might be

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.660 
suspecting a weakness might be
justification<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:55.130> now<00:01:56.130> look<00:01:56.369> over<00:01:56.460> on

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
justification for that now look over on

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.810 
justification for that now look over on
this<00:01:56.759> side<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.350> don't<00:01:58.350> see<00:01:58.799> any<00:01:59.189> cracks

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
this side I don't see any cracks

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.999 
this side I don't see any cracks
developing<00:02:01.520> maybe<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:04.020> upper<00:02:04.140> canopy<00:02:04.619> looks

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
developing maybe the upper canopy looks

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.950 
developing maybe the upper canopy looks
reasonable<00:02:05.729> unfortunately<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.689> close<00:02:06.930> to

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
reasonable unfortunately it's close to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.229 
reasonable unfortunately it's close to
the<00:02:07.140> power<00:02:07.320> lines<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.009> they<00:02:08.099> do<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> little<00:02:09.060> bit

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the power lines and they do a little bit

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.550 
the power lines and they do a little bit
of<00:02:09.270> whacking<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.899> it

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
of whacking on it

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.870 
of whacking on it
but<00:02:11.130> wow<00:02:11.459> what<00:02:11.940> what<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> magnificent<00:02:13.880> specimen

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
but wow what what a magnificent specimen

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
but wow what what a magnificent specimen
yeah

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
yeah

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.830 
yeah
I've<00:02:16.620> seen<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.860> few<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.280> them<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:18.000> big<00:02:18.239> but

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
I've seen a few of them this big but

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.440 
I've seen a few of them this big but
really<00:02:19.500> really<00:02:20.130> rare<00:02:21.230> um<00:02:22.970> well<00:02:23.970> I'll<00:02:24.120> tell<00:02:24.360> you

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
really really rare um well I'll tell you

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.000 
really really rare um well I'll tell you
I<00:02:24.510> think<00:02:24.540> if<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.959> was<00:02:25.080> mine<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.349> wouldn't<00:02:25.860> do<00:02:25.980> it

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
I think if it was mine I wouldn't do it

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.780 
I think if it was mine I wouldn't do it
cable<00:02:26.489> but<00:02:27.330> uh<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.630> might<00:02:28.019> put<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.739> might<00:02:29.519> put

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
cable but uh I might put it I might put

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.110 
cable but uh I might put it I might put
a<00:02:29.819> support<00:02:30.269> prop<00:02:30.840> over<00:02:31.080> here<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.010> keep<00:02:32.940> it

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
a support prop over here just to keep it

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.390 
a support prop over here just to keep it
from<00:02:33.269> getting<00:02:33.450> too<00:02:33.750> heavy<00:02:34.010> maybe<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.220> could

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
from getting too heavy maybe you could

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.940 
from getting too heavy maybe you could
do<00:02:35.550> something<00:02:35.580> sort<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.239> decorative<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:37.080> make

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
do something sort of decorative and make

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.050 
do something sort of decorative and make
it<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.190> feature<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:39.290> hate<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.440> take<00:02:40.620> off<00:02:41.030> too<00:02:42.030> much

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
it a feature I hate to take off too much

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.140 
it a feature I hate to take off too much
weight<00:02:42.600> up<00:02:42.840> here<00:02:43.080> but<00:02:43.580> you<00:02:44.580> know<00:02:44.670> anything

best educated guess as what we believe a
tree<00:03:04.769> needs<00:03:05.120> I'm<00:03:06.120> always<00:03:06.390> surprised<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.470> what

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
tree needs I'm always surprised on what

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.039 
tree needs I'm always surprised on what
a<00:03:07.680> tree<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.400> capable<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.209> supporting<00:03:10.819> but<00:03:12.049> we

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
a tree is capable of supporting but we

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.460 
a tree is capable of supporting but we
get<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> weakness<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.950> got<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> weakness<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:16.290> if<00:03:16.380> I

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
get a weakness we got a weakness so if I

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.900 
get a weakness we got a weakness so if I
tell<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.769> client<00:03:17.160> it's<00:03:17.280> okay

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
tell the client it's okay

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.289 
tell the client it's okay
then<00:03:19.010> I'm<00:03:20.010> not<00:03:20.190> really<00:03:20.250> doing<00:03:20.640> my<00:03:20.850> job<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:23.299> how

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
then I'm not really doing my job so how

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.910 
then I'm not really doing my job so how
much<00:03:24.480> weight<00:03:24.780> can<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.170> get<00:03:25.320> off<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.500> there<00:03:25.739> by

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
much weight can I get off of there by

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.729 
much weight can I get off of there by
pruning<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.720> don't<00:03:27.720> believe<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.079> can<00:03:28.319> get<00:03:28.440> enough

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
pruning I don't believe I can get enough

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.069 
pruning I don't believe I can get enough
weight<00:03:28.980> because<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:30.090> much<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.540> weight<00:03:30.750> on

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
weight because so much of the weight on

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.039 
weight because so much of the weight on
this<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:32.060> associated<00:03:33.060> with<00:03:33.239> this<00:03:33.390> wood<00:03:33.720> weight

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
this is associated with this wood weight

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.849 
this is associated with this wood weight
and<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:35.010> can't<00:03:35.340> remove<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:36.470> so<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.500> think<00:03:37.620> I'll

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
and I can't remove that so I think I'll

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.780 
and I can't remove that so I think I'll
talk<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.250> him<00:03:38.370> about<00:03:39.170> about<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.319> prop<00:03:40.709> if<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.639> was

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
talk to him about about a prop if I was

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.000 
talk to him about about a prop if I was

there<00:03:44.340> over<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.180> something<00:03:45.720> up<00:03:45.870> here<00:03:46.139> and

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
there over to something up here and

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.680

I want to put a strain on so I think the

bit<00:04:41.580> concerned<00:04:42.500> so<00:04:43.500> I<00:04:44.810> don't<00:04:45.810> know<00:04:45.900> if<00:04:45.990> I'm

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
bit concerned so I don't know if I'm

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.350 
bit concerned so I don't know if I'm
going<00:04:46.200> to<00:04:46.260> be<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.410> whole<00:04:46.590> lot<00:04:46.740> of<00:04:46.770> help<00:04:47.060> but<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.300> do

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
going to be a whole lot of help but I do

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.340 
going to be a whole lot of help but I do
think<00:04:48.870> that<00:04:49.820> some<00:04:50.820> sort<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.330> support<00:04:51.870> maybe

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
think that some sort of a support maybe

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.740 
think that some sort of a support maybe
a<00:04:52.610> y-shaped<00:04:54.350> 4x4<00:04:55.350> onto<00:04:55.920> a<00:04:55.950> post<00:04:56.310> right<00:04:56.640> here

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
a y-shaped 4x4 onto a post right here

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.050 
a y-shaped 4x4 onto a post right here
just<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:58.170> kind<00:04:58.530> of<00:04:58.650> help<00:04:58.800> minimize<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.430> strain

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
just to kind of help minimize the strain

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.730 
just to kind of help minimize the strain
on<00:05:00.090> this<00:05:00.390> branch<00:05:00.690> maybe<00:05:00.960> put<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.290> little<00:05:01.500> bit<00:05:01.620> of

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
on this branch maybe put a little bit of

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.070 
on this branch maybe put a little bit of
rubber<00:05:01.920> on<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.250> back<00:05:02.400> of<00:05:02.670> the<00:05:02.850> of<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.600> saddle

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
rubber on the back of the of the saddle

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.810 
rubber on the back of the of the saddle
build<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.470> little<00:05:04.680> saddle<00:05:05.100> maybe<00:05:05.250> cut<00:05:05.520> one<00:05:05.700> out

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
build a little saddle maybe cut one out

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.600 
build a little saddle maybe cut one out
with<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.060> with<00:05:06.750> a<00:05:06.780> bandsaw<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.380> find<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.340> shape

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
with a with a bandsaw to find the shape

with a with a bandsaw to find the shape
of<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:09.620> of<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.980> limb<00:05:11.190> so<00:05:11.220> it's<00:05:11.580> going<00:05:12.000> to

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
of the of the limb so it's going to

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.690 
of the of the limb so it's going to
cause<00:05:12.750> minimal<00:05:13.320> damage<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:13.980> that<00:05:14.130> real<00:05:14.400> thin
