00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.000
 My home, my life, is the mayor who 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.220
 this represents for the community 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.469
 community for society to pay 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.629
 contemplated is the hope of realizing the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.940

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.299
 new tea apartment since no 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.280

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.450
 it's all together in an apartment he 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.340
 passed in the wallet 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.080
 forget to buy a cart I want 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.210

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.730
 So a kid from now on is only 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.470
 joy joy only thank God am 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.090
 today is a very happy day for the 246 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.740
 families is to get their own home 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.950
 through my house my life if the 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.470
 comment if it is really what people 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.180
 realize when we talk investment 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.790
 we talk about money, it's as if 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.460
 money was everything in life to us and me 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.470
 when I'm on a day like this and also 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.270
 for following many many deliveries 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.070
 buildings all over the valley of the bells 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.270
 we perceive thus any price 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.430
 of dignity 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.660
 how many will have families with 20 and 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.730
 few years he died in his house 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.830
 of Christian families was in the house 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.180
 own up to 60 years of age 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.550
 I think we can not do this. 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.340
 measure this from the point of view of 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.260
 socially and economically 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.960
 says that we have built 256 apartments 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.640
 invested US $ 13 million to 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.130
 have eight units for special people 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.220
 it's economically that 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.690
 but for this family that means I 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.430
 I think this is a social work, it 's a 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.250
 interesting social research make 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.080
 because some families are waiting 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.970
 for this moment for decades 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.820
 some are already waiting accompanying 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.970
 grandchildren and great-grandchildren and invariably 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.500
 we realize this is how this 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.090
 work that can sometimes be a thing 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.590
 common and common 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.630
 the box engineers for managers 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.239
 of the box the house staff 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.209
 for these families may be the change 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.610
 total life a total change of a 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.640
 social vision of social inclusion in 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.140
 community and simple fact of many 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.140
 times to have a home address
