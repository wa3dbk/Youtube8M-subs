00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.130
 that's good too, because this car newspaper that we already know today 

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:05.290
 are spoiled 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.569
 Everything is very difficult here - this is a case for the fitness friends 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.569
 Have made references 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.630
 however, when you press the accelerator pedal 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.949
 Nothing happens at first 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.189
 May 2003 a thousand partners still feel 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.419
 as if you were sitting in a normal Audi 80 from then but then 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.170
 over 3000 even the turbocharger are pretty fierce 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.020
 and then 7 of the heavy Ko just ask it straight ahead 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.370
 Towards the horizon 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.370
 v 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.569
 It takes some time to get used to a sports car 

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:51.850
 the home team border area is very good natured 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 despite seeing 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.610
 Reiner Sport Hans a 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.610
 from the mat the pictures are from Walter RÃ¶hrl or Paul Simon 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.370
 because you really know what the guys have already done there because I can only 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.480
 Let me repeat what I wanted to say it keeps growing 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 the sports observatory of the eighties 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.610
 in the 4 Series Bob Martens and seconds the car accelerates from zero 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.230
 a hundred and better 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.250
 in just 16 seconds from 0 to 200 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.290
 You will then, however, as in the start of a space shuttle in the seat 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.120
 squeezed because there are 550 Newton meters in front so it is better with it 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.320
 these folks go the previous year is not a fat roast to eat the 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.540
 By the way, top speed is 293, so you have to have the seats 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.930
 Put on laces and kill the dead, the suspension is even firmer 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.280
 tuned as are very interested but still the car is no more 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.130
 had 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.590
 his also short and Artur bumps of the business park have copied what im 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.990
 Boundary range concerns viewers 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.390
 to be infinitely far away in a completely different dimension than missed 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.390
 normally used 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.539
 So after a first contact, I can only talk about this car 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.660
 Best Â»I'm looking forward to it like Bleicher the end great talent 10 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.509
 To be allowed to live in Augsburg 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.300
 as the double German wave master 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.780
 also 84 and 86 if the Bulls 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.780
 of course on an Audi Quattro at the time 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:35.260
 So it should be Harald's murder case as a welcome after so long 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.259
 because we sat in the Sport Quattro how does that feel 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.319
 as it was then, maybe it was all familiar again 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.779
 Lengsdorf's 50plus instrument for everyone is also the college as it is 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.029
 it used to be really nice 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.029
 as sure 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.989
 Expect heavy criminals are very possible 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.670
 then there is more flexible and for the back are fast but no 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.229
 wants to catch quickly by buying Sal 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:20.489
 and the engine of the catalog sometimes to pull forward but also back to the 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.989
 Role of the underground, the Turkish laid all five comparisons with the 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.499
 Rental mirror images of the game 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.899
 because the value if we want to stop 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:33.969
 normal and you meanwhile much more agile by the short wheelbase 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.760
 At the same time they know he was warned 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.549
 she was working for the whole track that was really a tough one 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.559
 Piece of work on 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.869
 as a precaution was also done quickly 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:58.309
 Euro equals the suspension is to be kept 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:00.590
 Pupils already with the floods 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.999
 it's all until the 11th 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.409
 know more about him how important he is 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.739
 I'll finish soon looks like 12 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.739
 So I have to say 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.199
 I have the steering 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.979
 I really want to talk to Mindenerin 4 12 09 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:22.789
 and the performance 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.680
 a problem 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.529
 So let's get busy over the flowers 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.529
 Nuremberg 12 000 euros started 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.110
 gradually the citizens were taken to us 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.150
 and the many young Union 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150
 to have 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.659
 on Wednesday we want to win 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.120
 temporarily, the Renault is so mild 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.120
 that speaks naturally 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.069
 hor 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.400
 Â«We see employers use 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.150
 so far he is thrilled 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.920
 That's where we found what we were looking for 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.069
 really done a great job 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.230
 top prices 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.520
 and then there is with us 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.469
 but who Quadra Power 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:17.080
 percent 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.159
 a T-shirt 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.159
 Sarah 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.580
 Dr 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.870
 welcome back because engine vision is 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.610
 Today we are in the Quarto fever because our guests have all four-wheel drive 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.689
 except for Harald i would of course 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:43.360
 which until now drove both cars go Sport Quattro and the more that we from 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.409
 Birgit Brauer so we have both cars a lot of fun as is yours 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:48.289
 impression 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.279
 all absolute driving pleasure 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:51.550
 so far I do not come 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.099
 which of them will decide 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.279
 the woman who really wants 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:58.099
 thus starts
