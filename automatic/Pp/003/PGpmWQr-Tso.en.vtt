00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.670
 all healthy today let's talk about the game 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.450
 dying light which will be released on January 27 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.170
 2015 on platforms n to ps4 and xbox 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.059
 one 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.320
 Consider the system requirements for 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.189
 platforms pk 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.109
 and also talk about what in the end 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.850
 gameplay can be dying light 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.910
 at the exit, well, let's begin 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.699
 teach your talk about this game I 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.590
 I would like to say that the system requirements 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.260
 the developer of this game company at &amp; t 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.780
 helland and she put up the next 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.379
 system requirements for dying 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.489
 light and so let's consider them 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.850
 minimum system requirements 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.600
 processor intel core ai file 2500 by 33 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.320
 gigahertz mdf x 8320 for three and a half 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.469
 gigahertz 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.960
 RAM 4 gigabyte ddr3 here 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.289
 here is such a correction what ddr3 what 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.719
 really if i have ddr2 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.210
 for example 8 gigabytes and I can not play 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.580
 doubt in the dying light so well, or 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.590
 otherwise there is a hard disk 40 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.110
 gigabyte free video card 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.909
 nvidia geforce gtx560 or md radeon hd 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.740
 6870 for one gigabyte 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.689
 also that version is written here 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.850
 video cards for laptops can work 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.070
 but not officially supported as well, I think 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.380
 it won't affect much 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.930
 really powerful laptops this game 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.909
 it will generally be ok to go as in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.920
 in general, it was expected by me personally 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.070
 system requirements were high 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.000
 as this game goes on ps4 bye 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.829
 xbox one and does not go to xbox 360 and ps3 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.930
 Naturally connection with this game 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.420
 positioned as on cfgi new 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.189
 the requirement for it is relevant 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.170
 it is naturally motivated by the fact that 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.570
 old consoles are simply not 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.030
 will take out this game as it will in fact 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.740
 and what happens with the output graphics we 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.719
 see let's consider now 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.259
 recommended system requirements 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.460
 cpu intel core ai file 4670 k for 3 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.630
 4 gigahertz 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.030
 MDF x 8350 at 4 gigahertz operational 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.379
 memory 8 gigabytes again ddr3 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:18.870
 video card nvidia geforce gtx 780m d 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:20.700
 radeon r9 290 for 2 gigabytes in general 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.430
 what else I want to say can be noted 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.620
 the fact that the processors are not stepped on 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.989
 eisemann bar that is in the recommended 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.989
 configuration is worth that five at least in 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.879
 In this sense, the developers behaved 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.160
 much more adequate than a company 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.459
 ubisoft with its new assassin's creed 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.650
 which ends up by and large nothing 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.810
 not new and not pleased 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.480
 some kind of super secret picture 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.190
 and some kind of newest new ones are possible in 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.110
 overall looking at these system 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.930
 requirements I think I can put that 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.290
 for the minimum configuration fit and 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.290
 less powerful machines because I don't think that 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.480
 in this game there will be something beyond 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.790
 innovative we will see some kind of breakthrough 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.340
 technically well let's 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.409
 now we are on the gameplay in general 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.810
 there is a model moment very much 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:13.140
 different games on zombie themes and 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.140
 as the dying light developers assure us 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.060
 this game on among them will stand out in 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.800
 In general, the developers say that 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.040
 dying light will be action with elements 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.200
 horror and open world as far as this 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.780
 the world will be open and big 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.989
 remains a mystery but we are assured 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.879
 that he will be an extensive gameplay will be 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.370
 built on a system 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.739
 night is day that is daytime the players will be 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.519
 move around the city in search of 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.040
 who nitzyy provisions and various parts 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.379
 necessary to create weapons that is 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.970
 there will be crafting some 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.209
 moments it all reminds 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.220
 yes and z but at night the players try 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.159
 take cover from zombies and other monsters 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.379
 also judging because you showed dick 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.780
 dying light at various exhibitions 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.480
 will be an attempt to combine in yourself 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.939
 a lot of popular items 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.010
 There are various chips that 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.860
 have been present in other games on 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.560
 zombie themes and these basic elements 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.410
 such as as I said open world 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.910
 also 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.519
 will be present in some form 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.930
 Parkour in general, this seems to me 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.550
 pretty serious can 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.840
 Diversify gameplay get 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.470
 interesting if really this 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.510
 the system will be well built and 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.340
 thought out well and will also 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.680
 attend the game in co-op with 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.980
 synchronous multiplayer that is can 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.550
 You can also play for zombies in 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.710
 in general 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.620
 this has long been seen in loft 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.830
 photo well, in conclusion you can say about 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.130
 that major competitor in the genre on 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.790
 zombie theme in 2015 with dying light 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.710
 will be up to that lam 2 but the trick is that 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.660
 the developers of these games x is not the same 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.630
 that is, the company you are a member of course 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.960
 so play dying light and house-2 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.480
 will not be posted quarterly 2015 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.540
 years dying light will be released at the end 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.750
 January 5 and a landvo we expect around 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.570
 the second quarter of 2015 also want 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.000
 say about that in general so the company 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.120
 tapes flow did not produce the house of all 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.980
 of the moment as super brilliant projects 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.770
 most popular and common 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.490
 is just 1 d thailand which 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.470
 was released in 2011 after that worthy 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.960
 company projects flow tapes us in 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.120
 Generally not happy let's see how it is 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.550
 get a dying light case of course 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.830
 There are those prerequisites for which this game 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.050
 may be very good but looking 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.050
 on how PR is lately 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.750
 games in the gaming industry 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.790
 in the end here of course very often so 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.460
 it happens that the assigned expectations for 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.430
 The new game in the end is not justified 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.010
 maybe dying light will break this 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.950
 mainstream and at the output we get 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.140
 interesting quality zombie game 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.300
 mother well and as usual if you liked 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.370
 Like this video you can also 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.870
 ask your questions in the comments well 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.640
 of course subscribe to my channel 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.890
 to keep abreast of all the new videos 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:16.080
 there will be much more useful and 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.080
 interesting all the luck while all
