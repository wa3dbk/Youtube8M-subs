00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 but i'm king zita good for little 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.759
 apartments 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.309
 the right color will help 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.250
 fix the layout flaws and 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.530
 placement of small rooms though 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.630
 I think that for a small apartment 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.600
 need to use more serious 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.779
 neutral tones even desirable 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.010
 one maybe it will be white but it 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.170
 one kind of interior myth though share you 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.689
 the truth of course there is but such a color 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.180
 the solution greatly limits the possibilities 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.750
 design and makes the interior boring 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.550
 colorless did not lie than even in the interior 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.350
 Scandinavian style made 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.399
 practically in one white color 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.620
 there are bright accents and if you 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.460
 use only one color this 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.199
 visually reduces space 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.600
 the room is framed only for example in 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.129
 white color does not live up to the expectation she 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.260
 so it remains a little white remember 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.559
 for decorating a small apartment is better 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.720
 use two or three color choices 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.210
 two or three colors depends on 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.360
 your chosen interior style and your 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.330
 preferences with two colors and for 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.220
 more academic strictly two-tone 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.500
 a combination closer to the classics 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.320
 but the three colors are already more 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.460
 fantasy combinations which is typical for 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.170
 more free styles 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.390
 the basic principle of the selection of colors such 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.670
 the whole coloring of the apartment should be 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.300
 light without sharp contrasts 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.720
 but with bright details 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.870
 one color should be basic it will be 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.360
 most gun career 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.430
 base color can be walls 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.650
 architectural elements furniture therefore 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.680
 base color should be very light 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.140
 maybe white too but second color 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.330
 can be invited bright clean 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.020
 for example if you want to use the same 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.690
 at the bird 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.290
 then it must be just a little come 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.649
 the third kind is dandelion they are repairs and bottom 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.410
 carrot on the wall will give a second color 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.230
 placing depth in this color can 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.620
 be large pieces of furniture details 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.340
 walls or even a whole wall maybe 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.620
 decorated could importantly take into account that the second 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.260
 optional color may be a shade 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.070
 base color but he should 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.880
 vary significantly by saturated 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:36.010
 for example, a very light beige tooth color 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.360
 then the base complementary colors are not 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.910
 will be perceived as one color 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.200
 30 years can be just very bright 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.390
 or even subject allowed in black 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.770
 it gives color to the room 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.989
 expressive moods in him 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.230
 matched in decorative and soiree 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.680
 and on the shelf are small pieces of furniture 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:04.840
 mats and different becker ears of color 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.750
 must be combined in the proportion 6030 10 re 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.870
 60 percent is base lordship 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.110
 30 percent extra moderate 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.690
 bright to 10 percent is the brightest 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.150
 accents 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.430
 this proportion is the most optimal 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.420
 small apartment have color 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.450
 better this way darker bright 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.910
 the depth of the room and the light colors on 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.770
 foreground 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.269
 The brightest accents can be placed on 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.760
 the entire perimeter of the room 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.010
 but the bigger one is still better at 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.070
 in the background 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.709
 for example a bright orange chair 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.740
 put further from the entrance orange 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.450
 can stand where ucoz is better of course 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.850
 patronize the whole diversity 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.420
 and use color 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:57.000
 to select individual zones if by itself 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.390
 imagine your apartment is dark then choose 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.810
 worth 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.480
 warm colors and if your windows 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.600
 apartment overlooking the sunny side of the 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.360
 you can choose cold this rule 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.260
 As for as the complementary color and 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.630
 accessories to not only visually 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.870
 increase the size of the apartment but also 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.840
 lift ceilings can be unusual 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.210
 way to use base color 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.570
 For example, use on the walls is not one 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.000
 And several shades of one color so 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:34.310
 say with a banner from a darker 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.210
 colors sound brighter color at the top 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.600
 pick a color for their little 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.510
 apartments remember that in quality 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.740
 two primary colors can be used 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.720
 different shades color for example 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.900
 light beige dark beige 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.390
 or different shades of green of course 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.700
 Accessories must be different color but 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:00.150
 be sure to be combined with this color 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.800
 scales and that is certainly contraindicated 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.770
 interior of a small apartment 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.180
 so these are combinations like red 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:12.000
 green yellow blue and orange 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.190
 Violets themselves are very 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.740
 harmonious combination they even 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.670
 called contrasting color wheel 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.680
 but only suitable for large tractors 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.170
 a combination of black and white too 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.580
 it is advisable not to use it too 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:31.620
 sharp contrast on a small apartment and 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.330
 in conclusion let's connect into one 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.850
 integer all highlights 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.010
 let's call them the correct interior for 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.160
 small apartment 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:44.460
 what they are ceiling should 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.200
 to be lighter than the walls which visually gives 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.710
 additional five to ten centimeters 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.410
 landing is desirable to use only 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:57.050
 flat lamps or built 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:59.850
 ceiling pissing chandeliers steals space 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.880
 Wallpaper is better to use vertical 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.880
 patterned 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:08.229
 set in the end of the longest room 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:12.159
 wardrobe mirror fronted this 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:14.949
 visually expand the space drive for 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:16.930
 these closed mezzanine shelves in the bath and 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.629
 toilet where it will be possible to store 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.889
 non seasonal clothing shoes from stock 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:25.629
 household chemicals small apartment 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:29.199
 contraindicated now brush hard 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:30.460
 curtains became and middle legs a lot 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:33.250
 small items 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.060
 clutter up the workshop room 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.000
 mosquito 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.620
 and of course the main one is copper small 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.029
 apartments do not keep the house anything extra 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.120
 all than not used for two years 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:50.080
 throw the local branch otherwise 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.969
 case of the place will not remain even if 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.580
 completely sorry to part pastors 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:55.020
 things then use them as 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.180
 decorative 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.939
 for example make a decorative pillow 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.190
 an old sweater or a nice rug 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:05.810
 from yarn residues 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.270
