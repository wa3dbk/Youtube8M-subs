00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
can sprint to the flags like if you're

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.590

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
losing a fly you can sprint to the flag

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
really you know stock and clicked all

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.509 
really you know stock and clicked all
those<00:02:55.290> combined<00:02:55.830> really<00:02:56.100> helped<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.370> play<00:02:56.489> a

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
those combined really helped to play a

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.790 
those combined really helped to play a
lot<00:02:56.670> faster<00:02:57.060> get<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.750> objectives<00:02:58.230> capture

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
lot faster get to the objectives capture

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.350 
lot faster get to the objectives capture
the<00:02:58.920> objectives<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.610> win<00:02:59.880> the<00:02:59.940> fucking<00:03:00.060> game

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
the objectives and win the fucking game

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.670 
the objectives and win the fucking game
for<00:03:00.510> your<00:03:00.569> team<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.900> then<00:03:00.989> for<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.350> score

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
for your team and then for the score

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.170 
for your team and then for the score
streaks<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.130> decided<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.519> put<00:03:02.610> on<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.790> assault

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
streaks I decided to put on the assault

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.120 
streaks I decided to put on the assault
drone<00:03:03.450> as<00:03:04.080> one<00:03:04.319> of<00:03:04.350> them<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.620> know<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.800> UAV

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
drone as one of them you know the UAV

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.320 
drone as one of them you know the UAV
obviously<00:03:05.610> helps<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.819> lot<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.000> think<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.239> should

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
obviously helps a lot I think you should

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.120 
obviously helps a lot I think you should
have<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.480> UAV<00:03:06.810> on<00:03:06.900> every<00:03:07.290> single<00:03:07.620> class<00:03:07.830> setup

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
have the UAV on every single class setup

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.340 
have the UAV on every single class setup
no<00:03:08.760> matter<00:03:09.030> what<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.690> important<00:03:10.170> but

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
no matter what it is so important but

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.270 
no matter what it is so important but
the<00:03:10.500> assault<00:03:10.890> drone<00:03:11.310> with<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.560> AI<00:03:13.560> thing<00:03:14.069> or

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
the assault drone with the AI thing or

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.650 
the assault drone with the AI thing or
when<00:03:14.430> it's<00:03:14.610> like<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.850> actual<00:03:15.180> computer

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
when it's like the actual computer

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.390 
when it's like the actual computer
controls<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.230> instead<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.769> because<00:03:17.040> if

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
controls it instead of you because if

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.800 
controls it instead of you because if
you<00:03:17.489> have<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:17.700> fly<00:03:17.910> around<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.390> social<00:03:18.750> and

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
you have to fly around in the social and

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.090 
you have to fly around in the social and
you<00:03:18.930> know<00:03:19.019> -<00:03:19.290> we'll<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:19.620> run<00:03:19.739> around<00:03:19.860> with

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
you know - we'll just run around with

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.710 
you know - we'll just run around with
your<00:03:20.250> guy<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.760> you'll<00:03:20.880> get<00:03:21.000> more<00:03:21.239> points<00:03:21.510> for

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
your guy and you'll get more points for

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.180 
your guy and you'll get more points for
a<00:03:21.780> kill<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:21.989> don't<00:03:22.049> really<00:03:22.860> know<00:03:22.980> why<00:03:23.130> you

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
a kill I don't really know why you

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.800 
a kill I don't really know why you
wouldn't<00:03:23.400> use<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.760> AI<00:03:23.850> on<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.269> but<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.600> put

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
wouldn't use the AI on it but you put

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.330 
wouldn't use the AI on it but you put
the<00:03:24.930> AI<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.410> then<00:03:25.799> you<00:03:25.860> also<00:03:26.040> put<00:03:26.190> on<00:03:26.250> the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
the AI and then you also put on the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.920 
the AI and then you also put on the
Rockets<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.000> thing<00:03:27.180> will<00:03:27.329> just<00:03:27.360> destroy

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
Rockets and this thing will just destroy

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.440 
Rockets and this thing will just destroy
the<00:03:28.260> entire<00:03:28.530> map<00:03:28.829> every<00:03:29.220> single<00:03:29.329> person<00:03:30.329> on

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
the entire map every single person on

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.350 
the entire map every single person on
the<00:03:30.600> enemy<00:03:30.840> team<00:03:30.870> just<00:03:31.739> gets<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.250> know

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
the enemy team just gets you know

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.940 
the enemy team just gets you know
essentially<00:03:33.360> part<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.110> my<00:03:34.230> French<00:03:34.500> put<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> dick

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
essentially part of my French put a dick

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.259 
essentially part of my French put a dick
up<00:03:34.980> their<00:03:35.340> ass<00:03:35.489> because<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:35.970> thing<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.150> so

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
up their ass because this thing is so

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.270 
up their ass because this thing is so
good<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:36.690> definitely<00:03:37.560> put<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:37.860> kill<00:03:38.040> streaks

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
good so definitely put that kill streaks

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.920 
good so definitely put that kill streaks
on<00:03:38.400> it'll<00:03:38.640> literally<00:03:39.030> fly<00:03:39.299> around<00:03:39.450> it's<00:03:39.780> like

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
on it'll literally fly around it's like

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.140 
on it'll literally fly around it's like
having<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.320> seventh<00:03:40.709> teammate<00:03:41.160> essentially

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
having a seventh teammate essentially

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.670 
having a seventh teammate essentially
and<00:03:42.359> in<00:03:42.540> this<00:03:42.690> gameplay<00:03:42.930> you're<00:03:43.230> watching<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
and in this gameplay you're watching the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.539 
and in this gameplay you're watching the
one<00:03:43.859> on<00:03:44.209> recovery<00:03:45.209> it's<00:03:45.420> actually<00:03:46.019> me<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.590> a

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
one on recovery it's actually me and a

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.360 
one on recovery it's actually me and a
bunch<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:47.910> randoms<00:03:48.390> versus<00:03:48.810> an<00:03:48.930> entire<00:03:49.370> elite

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
bunch of randoms versus an entire elite

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.550 
bunch of randoms versus an entire elite
clan<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.450> they're<00:03:51.540> all<00:03:51.780> like<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.410> the

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
clan and they're all like in the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.069 
clan and they're all like in the
Grandmaster<00:03:53.220> prestiges<00:03:53.880> they<00:03:54.329> had<00:03:54.480> red<00:03:54.720> clan

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
Grandmaster prestiges they had red clan

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.080 
Grandmaster prestiges they had red clan
tag<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.650> was<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:55.980> party<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:56.910> could

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
tag so it was a party that you could

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.430 
tag so it was a party that you could
tell<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.359> experience<00:03:57.930> playing<00:03:58.140> with<00:03:58.320> each

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
tell it experience playing with each

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.920 
tell it experience playing with each
other<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.489> I<00:03:59.700> was<00:03:59.850> managed<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.420> managed<00:04:00.840> to

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
other and I was managed I managed to

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.569 
other and I was managed I managed to
keep<00:04:01.019> my<00:04:01.170> team<00:04:01.380> within<00:04:01.530> four<00:04:01.920> points<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.489> the

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
keep my team within four points of the

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.610 
keep my team within four points of the
enemies<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.420> entire<00:04:03.900> game<00:04:04.170> we<00:04:04.320> did<00:04:04.440> end<00:04:04.590> up

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
enemies the entire game we did end up

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.740 
enemies the entire game we did end up
losing<00:04:04.829> at<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.100> end<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.880> was<00:04:06.000> crazy<00:04:06.359> just

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
losing at the end but it was crazy just

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.380 
losing at the end but it was crazy just
all<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.989> stuff<00:04:07.380> that<00:04:07.650> like<00:04:07.859> I<00:04:08.100> had<00:04:08.519> to<00:04:08.670> do<00:04:08.850> for

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
all the stuff that like I had to do for

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.390 
all the stuff that like I had to do for
the<00:04:09.480> team<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.870> this<00:04:09.959> class<00:04:10.290> allowed<00:04:10.739> me<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.010> do

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
the team in this class allowed me to do

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.069 
the team in this class allowed me to do
so<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.090> class<00:04:12.329> is<00:04:12.390> probably<00:04:12.720> one<00:04:12.989> of<00:04:13.019> the

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
so this class is probably one of the

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.380 
so this class is probably one of the
best<00:04:13.260> objective<00:04:13.739> class<00:04:13.890> for<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.579> bal-27<00:04:14.910> that

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
best objective class for the bal-27 that

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.909 
best objective class for the bal-27 that
I<00:04:15.420> found<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:16.169> know<00:04:16.260> probably<00:04:16.500> something<00:04:16.829> like

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
I found you know probably something like

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.440 
I found you know probably something like
the<00:04:17.010> ask<00:04:17.190> someone<00:04:17.609> would<00:04:17.760> feel<00:04:17.940> fit<00:04:18.299> your

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
the ask someone would feel fit your

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.060 
the ask someone would feel fit your
playstyle<00:04:19.350> better<00:04:19.590> for<00:04:19.769> playing<00:04:19.979> the

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
playstyle better for playing the

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.860 
playstyle better for playing the
objective<00:04:20.130> for<00:04:20.849> this<00:04:20.940> class<00:04:21.209> definitely

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
objective for this class definitely

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.380 
objective for this class definitely
fucking<00:04:22.200> killed<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.710> so<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:23.280> did<00:04:23.940> make<00:04:24.120> another

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
fucking killed it so I did make another

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.180 
fucking killed it so I did make another
class<00:04:24.630> I<00:04:24.810> kind<00:04:25.289> of<00:04:25.380> came<00:04:25.560> up<00:04:25.710> with<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:25.860> dn

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
class I kind of came up with a dn

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.470 
class I kind of came up with a dn
a<00:04:26.220> bomb<00:04:26.430> classes<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:26.910> know<00:04:27.000> why<00:04:27.210> do<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.420> guys

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
a bomb classes I know why do you guys

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.810 
a bomb classes I know why do you guys
always<00:04:27.540> ask<00:04:27.900> for<00:04:28.020> DNA<00:04:28.470> bomb<00:04:28.680> tips<00:04:29.010> everything

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
always ask for DNA bomb tips everything

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.460 
always ask for DNA bomb tips everything
like<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.660> know<00:04:30.690> let's<00:04:31.110> get<00:04:31.320> on<00:04:31.440> to

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
like that so you know let's get on to

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.200 
like that so you know let's get on to
the<00:04:31.620> next<00:04:31.770> one<00:04:31.980> which<00:04:32.460> will<00:04:32.640> help<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.850> get<00:04:32.970> DNA

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
the next one which will help you get DNA

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.390 
the next one which will help you get DNA
bombs<00:04:33.510> now<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:33.990> DNA<00:04:34.230> bomb<00:04:34.560> class<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:34.980> a<00:04:35.010> little

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
bombs now the DNA bomb class is a little

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.830 
bombs now the DNA bomb class is a little
bit<00:04:35.520> easier<00:04:35.850> for<00:04:35.880> me<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.120> make<00:04:36.330> because<00:04:36.630> I<00:04:36.750> have

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
bit easier for me to make because I have

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.600 
bit easier for me to make because I have
a<00:04:36.900> lot<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.080> experience<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.800> getting<00:04:37.890> DNA<00:04:38.190> bombs

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
a lot of experience of getting DNA bombs

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.390 
a lot of experience of getting DNA bombs
and<00:04:39.300> stuff<00:04:39.450> like<00:04:39.690> that<00:04:39.870> so<00:04:40.140> this<00:04:40.860> one<00:04:41.100> kind<00:04:41.340> of

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
and stuff like that so this one kind of

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.740 
and stuff like that so this one kind of
came<00:04:41.580> naturally<00:04:42.000> this<00:04:42.090> is<00:04:42.240> one<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:42.420> my<00:04:42.510> go-to

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
came naturally this is one of my go-to

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.230 
came naturally this is one of my go-to
classes<00:04:43.500> for<00:04:44.310> getting<00:04:44.610> DNA<00:04:44.850> bombs<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.180> I

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
classes for getting DNA bombs and I

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.520 
classes for getting DNA bombs and I
think<00:04:45.450> you<00:04:45.540> guys<00:04:45.660> are<00:04:45.720> definitely<00:04:46.260> gonna<00:04:46.350> like

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
think you guys are definitely gonna like

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.320 
think you guys are definitely gonna like
this<00:04:46.680> one<00:04:46.740> so<00:04:46.980> it<00:04:47.130> is<00:04:47.220> essentially<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.120> same

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
this one so it is essentially the same

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.440 
this one so it is essentially the same
class<00:04:48.690> just<00:04:49.470> like<00:04:49.770> three<00:04:50.220> key<00:04:50.580> things<00:04:50.880> changed

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
class just like three key things changed

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.300 
class just like three key things changed
and<00:04:51.600> one<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:52.110> took<00:04:52.350> off<00:04:52.500> quick-draw<00:04:52.980> and<00:04:53.100> put<00:04:53.220> on

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
and one I took off quick-draw and put on

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.250 
and one I took off quick-draw and put on
the<00:04:53.430> suppressor<00:04:53.910> which<00:04:54.390> probably<00:04:54.810> isn't<00:04:55.230> a

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
the suppressor which probably isn't a

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.210 
the suppressor which probably isn't a
good<00:04:55.380> idea<00:04:55.440> if<00:04:55.680> you're<00:04:55.770> gonna<00:04:55.860> be<00:04:55.980> using<00:04:56.010> the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
good idea if you're gonna be using the

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.500 
good idea if you're gonna be using the
inferno<00:04:56.580> because<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:56.910> infernal<00:04:57.300> takes

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
inferno because the infernal takes

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.200 
inferno because the infernal takes
fucking<00:04:57.780> forever<00:04:58.170> tamed<00:04:58.800> on<00:04:58.980> site<00:04:59.280> so<00:04:59.880> you

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
fucking forever tamed on site so you

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.760 
fucking forever tamed on site so you
know<00:05:00.570> quick-draw<00:05:01.020> is<00:05:01.140> pretty<00:05:01.320> helpful<00:05:01.500> with

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
know quick-draw is pretty helpful with

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.050 
know quick-draw is pretty helpful with
the<00:05:01.860> infernal<00:05:02.310> but<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:02.730> know<00:05:02.820> when<00:05:02.940> you're

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
the infernal but you know when you're

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.850 
the infernal but you know when you're
going<00:05:03.210> for<00:05:03.390> an<00:05:03.450> evening<00:05:03.570> for<00:05:04.200> DNA<00:05:04.440> bombs<00:05:04.620> and

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
going for an evening for DNA bombs and

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.110 
going for an evening for DNA bombs and
you<00:05:04.950> aren't<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.190> high<00:05:05.250> killstreak<00:05:05.670> suppressor

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
you aren't a high killstreak suppressor

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.000 
you aren't a high killstreak suppressor
will<00:05:06.660> be<00:05:06.810> your<00:05:06.930> best<00:05:07.080> friend<00:05:07.320> also<00:05:07.500> I'd<00:05:07.710> put<00:05:07.920> on

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
will be your best friend also I'd put on

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.150 
will be your best friend also I'd put on
scavenger<00:05:08.790> instead<00:05:09.420> of<00:05:09.540> blast<00:05:09.840> suppressor

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
scavenger instead of blast suppressor

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.020 
scavenger instead of blast suppressor
because<00:05:11.160> you're<00:05:11.340> gonna<00:05:11.460> run<00:05:11.700> out<00:05:11.790> of<00:05:11.820> bullets

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
because you're gonna run out of bullets

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.300 
because you're gonna run out of bullets
there's<00:05:12.330> no<00:05:12.480> way<00:05:12.660> with<00:05:12.840> like<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.380> 150<00:05:13.980> bullets

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
there's no way with like the 150 bullets

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.890 
there's no way with like the 150 bullets
you<00:05:14.430> get<00:05:14.580> in<00:05:14.670> a<00:05:14.730> clip<00:05:15.000> with<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.240> inferno<00:05:15.570> just

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
you get in a clip with the inferno just

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.960 
you get in a clip with the inferno just
to<00:05:16.020> start<00:05:16.320> off<00:05:16.440> or<00:05:16.920> you<00:05:17.220> get<00:05:17.400> like<00:05:17.610> on<00:05:17.790> your

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
to start off or you get like on your

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.400 
to start off or you get like on your
guide<00:05:18.120> that's<00:05:18.420> you're<00:05:18.690> not<00:05:18.810> gonna<00:05:18.960> get<00:05:19.140> a<00:05:19.170> DNA

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
guide that's you're not gonna get a DNA

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.110 
guide that's you're not gonna get a DNA
bond<00:05:19.680> with<00:05:19.800> that<00:05:19.830> so<00:05:20.130> I<00:05:20.190> put<00:05:20.310> on<00:05:20.490> scavenger<00:05:20.970> and

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
bond with that so I put on scavenger and

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.270 
bond with that so I put on scavenger and
also<00:05:21.810> I<00:05:21.840> took<00:05:21.990> off<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.440> assault<00:05:22.830> drone<00:05:23.100> and

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
also I took off the assault drone and

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.700 
also I took off the assault drone and
put<00:05:23.460> on<00:05:23.550> system<00:05:24.120> hack<00:05:24.300> because<00:05:25.170> you<00:05:25.590> know

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
put on system hack because you know

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.080 
put on system hack because you know
there<00:05:25.860> aren't<00:05:25.980> really<00:05:26.160> any<00:05:26.280> kill<00:05:26.670> streaks<00:05:26.970> in

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
there aren't really any kill streaks in

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.180 
there aren't really any kill streaks in
con<00:05:27.300> a<00:05:27.330> warbird<00:05:27.870> or<00:05:28.290> an<00:05:28.500> assault<00:05:28.800> drone<00:05:29.040> or

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
con a warbird or an assault drone or

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.380 
con a warbird or an assault drone or
something<00:05:29.370> like<00:05:29.430> that<00:05:29.490> that<00:05:29.760> kills<00:05:29.970> that<00:05:30.240> your

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
something like that that kills that your

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.670 
something like that that kills that your
kill<00:05:30.570> streaks<00:05:30.780> it's<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.080> don't<00:05:31.380> count

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
kill streaks it's you don't count

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.710 
kill streaks it's you don't count
towards<00:05:32.250> your<00:05:32.430> DNA<00:05:32.760> bomb<00:05:32.940> so<00:05:33.120> -<00:05:33.450> well<00:05:33.600> have

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
towards your DNA bomb so - well have

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.510 
towards your DNA bomb so - well have
kill<00:05:33.930> streaks<00:05:34.200> that<00:05:34.560> help<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:34.830> find<00:05:35.100> enemies

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
kill streaks that help you find enemies

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.100 
kill streaks that help you find enemies
or<00:05:35.669> disable<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.300> enemies<00:05:36.630> so<00:05:36.780> you<00:05:36.840> can<00:05:36.960> kill

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
or disable the enemies so you can kill

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.080 
or disable the enemies so you can kill
them<00:05:37.230> with<00:05:37.320> your<00:05:37.440> gun<00:05:37.650> easier<00:05:38.010> like<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.760> UAV

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
them with your gun easier like the UAV

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.450
