just want to get incorporated for the
flavor<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.680> let's<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> little<00:01:53.520> bit<00:01:53.729> salt<00:01:54.259> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
flavor and let's do a little bit salt a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.910 
flavor and let's do a little bit salt a
little<00:01:56.570> bit<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.630> pepper<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.170> would<00:01:58.619> save<00:01:58.770> your

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
little bit of pepper I would save your

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.560 
little bit of pepper I would save your
soul<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.219> pepper<00:01:59.430> last<00:01:59.790> because<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.450> do

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
soul and pepper last because if you do

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.080 
soul and pepper last because if you do
that<00:02:00.689> before<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.170> cook<00:02:01.439> then<00:02:02.100> basically<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that before you cook then basically the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.670 
that before you cook then basically the
heat<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.750> take<00:02:03.930> all<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.320> flavor

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
heat is going to take all that flavor

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.350 
heat is going to take all that flavor
out<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.310> by<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.520> time<00:02:05.729> you're<00:02:05.909> done<00:02:05.939> you're

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
out so by the time you're done you're

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.490 
out so by the time you're done you're
going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.540> lose<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.750> salt<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.350> pepper

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
going to lose that salt and pepper

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.930 
going to lose that salt and pepper
flavor<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.250> always<00:02:08.399> best<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:08.910> it

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
flavor so it's always best to do it

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
flavor so it's always best to do it
towards<00:02:09.270> that

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
towards that

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.570 
towards that
