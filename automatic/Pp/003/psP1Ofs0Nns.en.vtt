ranch this of course is the canned
cannon<00:01:21.770> I've<00:01:22.579> I've<00:01:22.700> been<00:01:22.789> making<00:01:22.909> too<00:01:23.119> many

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
cannon I've I've been making too many

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.870 
cannon I've I've been making too many
can<00:01:23.479> cannon<00:01:23.810> videos<00:01:24.049> lately<00:01:24.289> I<00:01:24.590> don't<00:01:25.549> think

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
can cannon videos lately I don't think

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.880 
can cannon videos lately I don't think
so<00:01:26.060> apparently<00:01:26.990> neither<00:01:27.229> does<00:01:27.439> vortex

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
so apparently neither does vortex

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.399 
so apparently neither does vortex
because<00:01:28.219> vortex<00:01:28.880> out-of-the-blue<00:01:29.539> sent<00:01:30.259> me<00:01:30.380> a

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
because vortex out-of-the-blue sent me a

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.709 
because vortex out-of-the-blue sent me a
really<00:01:30.679> really<00:01:30.860> nice<00:01:31.280> scope<00:01:31.700> this<00:01:32.209> is<00:01:32.509> the

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
really really nice scope this is the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.260 
really really nice scope this is the
vortex<00:01:33.109> Viper<00:01:33.350> two<00:01:33.920> point<00:01:34.159> five<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.579> ten<00:01:34.880> by

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
vortex Viper two point five to ten by

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.340 
vortex Viper two point five to ten by
forty<00:01:35.600> four<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:37.659> putting<00:01:38.659> a<00:01:38.719> regular<00:01:39.049> scope

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
forty four and putting a regular scope

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.419 
forty four and putting a regular scope
on<00:01:39.530> a<00:01:39.740> canned<00:01:40.069> cannon<00:01:40.459> is<00:01:40.609> kind<00:01:41.390> of<00:01:41.479> silly

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
on a canned cannon is kind of silly

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.179 
on a canned cannon is kind of silly
especially<00:01:43.780> because<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.590> they're

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
especially because the they're

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.830 
especially because the they're
calibrated<00:01:46.369> for<00:01:46.700> bullets<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.179> so<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.569> bullet

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
calibrated for bullets and so the bullet

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.719 
calibrated for bullets and so the bullet
drop<00:01:48.020> compensator<00:01:48.560> is<00:01:48.649> on<00:01:48.770> there<00:01:48.950> are<00:01:49.520> not

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
drop compensator is on there are not

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.600 
drop compensator is on there are not
calibrated<00:01:49.969> for<00:01:50.299> cans<00:01:50.739> this<00:01:51.739> one<00:01:52.039> is<00:01:52.219> a<00:01:52.250> little

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
calibrated for cans this one is a little

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.609 
calibrated for cans this one is a little
bit<00:01:52.819> less<00:01:53.030> silly<00:01:53.299> because<00:01:54.020> it's<00:01:54.200> calibrated

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
bit less silly because it's calibrated

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.459 
bit less silly because it's calibrated
for<00:01:55.399> crossbow<00:01:56.179> bolts<00:01:56.509> this<00:01:56.659> is<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.840> crossbow

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
for crossbow bolts this is a crossbow

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.819 
for crossbow bolts this is a crossbow
scope<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:58.939> crossbow<00:01:59.450> bolts<00:01:59.869> fall<00:02:00.319> at<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.619> much

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
scope so crossbow bolts fall at a much

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.179 
scope so crossbow bolts fall at a much
faster<00:02:00.860> rate<00:02:01.399> than<00:02:01.849> bullets<00:02:02.209> to<00:02:02.950> cans<00:02:03.950> fall

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
faster rate than bullets to cans fall

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.559 
faster rate than bullets to cans fall
out<00:02:04.310> even<00:02:04.520> faster<00:02:04.909> rate<00:02:05.030> but<00:02:05.299> this<00:02:05.420> is<00:02:05.539> a

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
out even faster rate but this is a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.830 
out even faster rate but this is a
little<00:02:05.929> bit<00:02:06.049> closer<00:02:06.259> I've<00:02:06.709> shot<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.189> few<00:02:07.399> cans

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
little bit closer I've shot a few cans

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.059 
little bit closer I've shot a few cans
trying<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.989> figure<00:02:09.259> out<00:02:09.289> how<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.769> get<00:02:09.920> these

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
trying to figure out how to get these

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.069 
trying to figure out how to get these
sights<00:02:10.459> dialed<00:02:10.879> in<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.450> found<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.810> cans

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
sights dialed in and I found the cans

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.650 
sights dialed in and I found the cans
drop<00:02:12.410> really<00:02:12.920> fast<00:02:13.280> but<00:02:13.639> gotten<00:02:14.420> pretty<00:02:14.600> good

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
drop really fast but gotten pretty good

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.539 
drop really fast but gotten pretty good
at<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.019> so<00:02:15.049> let's<00:02:15.350> take<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.560> few<00:02:15.620> shots<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:16.190> have

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
at it so let's take a few shots I have

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.160 
at it so let's take a few shots I have
three<00:02:16.910> targets<00:02:17.090> set<00:02:17.420> up<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.720> black<00:02:17.959> one<00:02:18.139> here

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
three targets set up the black one here

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.050 
three targets set up the black one here
in<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.410> front<00:02:18.560> is<00:02:18.799> at<00:02:18.980> thirty<00:02:19.280> yards<00:02:19.639> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
in the front is at thirty yards the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.059 
in the front is at thirty yards the
white<00:02:20.420> one<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.959> left<00:02:21.139> is<00:02:21.350> at<00:02:21.590> sixty<00:02:21.920> yards

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
white one to the left is at sixty yards

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.309 
white one to the left is at sixty yards
and<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.790> tall<00:02:23.030> white<00:02:23.269> one<00:02:23.420> in<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.690> back<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:23.900> at

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
and the tall white one in the back is at

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.589 
and the tall white one in the back is at
90<00:02:24.739> yards<00:02:24.889> and<00:02:25.160> I've<00:02:25.519> realized<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:26.000> cannot<00:02:26.359> hit

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
90 yards and I've realized I cannot hit

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.750 
90 yards and I've realized I cannot hit
that<00:02:26.780> 90<00:02:27.139> yard<00:02:27.349> target<00:02:27.709> because<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.430> trees

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
that 90 yard target because the trees

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.509 
that 90 yard target because the trees
are<00:02:29.030> about<00:02:29.120> ten<00:02:30.019> to<00:02:30.200> 15<00:02:30.590> feet<00:02:30.889> off<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.160> ground

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
are about ten to 15 feet off the ground

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.160 
are about ten to 15 feet off the ground
there<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.940> need<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.150> be<00:02:32.239> able<00:02:32.359> to<00:02:32.480> arc<00:02:32.930> it

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
there and I need to be able to arc it

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.920 
there and I need to be able to arc it
higher<00:02:33.620> than<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:35.510> reach<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.870> target

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
higher than that to reach that target

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.750 
higher than that to reach that target
it'll<00:02:36.410> hit<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.799> but<00:02:37.099> not<00:02:37.220> with<00:02:37.370> those<00:02:37.459> trees

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
it'll hit that but not with those trees

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.000 
it'll hit that but not with those trees
in<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.030> way<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:39.019> one<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.380> probably<00:02:39.680> not

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
in the way so that one is probably not

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:48.130 
in the way so that one is probably not
going<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> work<00:02:40.489> out

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.440 

direct<00:02:49.140> hit<00:02:52.370> moving<00:02:53.370> reach<00:02:53.610> out<00:02:53.850> touch<00:02:54.180> that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
direct hit moving reach out touch that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.970 
direct hit moving reach out touch that
60-yard<00:02:55.140> target<00:02:58.640> this<00:03:00.440> 160<00:03:01.440> yards<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.800> where<00:03:01.950> I

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
60-yard target this 160 yards is where I

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.770 
60-yard target this 160 yards is where I
can<00:03:02.160> really<00:03:02.310> tell<00:03:02.670> how<00:03:02.970> much<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.420> bullet

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
can really tell how much this bullet

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.550 
can really tell how much this bullet
drops<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:05.190> drops<00:03:05.610> because<00:03:06.510> even<00:03:07.350> if<00:03:07.470> I

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
drops this can drops because even if I

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.250 
drops this can drops because even if I
put<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:07.980> down<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.550> scope<00:03:09.420> goes<00:03:09.660> down<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.960> 50

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
put it down the scope goes down to 50

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.350 
put it down the scope goes down to 50
yards<00:03:10.530> even<00:03:10.770> if<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:10.980> put<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.310> 50<00:03:11.640> up<00:03:11.850> above<00:03:12.120> that

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
yards even if I put the 50 up above that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.860 
yards even if I put the 50 up above that
it<00:03:12.570> still<00:03:13.380> lands<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.100> between<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:15.060> 30<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.600> 60

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
it still lands in between the 30 and 60

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.380 
it still lands in between the 30 and 60
yard<00:03:15.990> target<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.650> have<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.340> aim<00:03:17.520> up<00:03:17.850> in<00:03:18.180> that

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
yard target so I have to aim up in that

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.300 
yard target so I have to aim up in that
tree<00:03:18.720> about<00:03:18.990> 10<00:03:19.320> feet<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.830> get<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.160> reach

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
tree about 10 feet to get it to reach

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.830 
tree about 10 feet to get it to reach
there

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.700 

but<00:03:29.840> there's<00:03:30.020> a<00:03:30.080> hit<00:03:30.290> let's<00:03:30.470> see<00:03:30.560> maybe

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710
