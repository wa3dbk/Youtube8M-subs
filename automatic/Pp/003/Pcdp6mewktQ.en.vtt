the solar system of the nebulas as a

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.990 
the solar system of the nebulas as a
composer<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.880> became<00:00:51.510> very<00:00:52.340> dissatisfied<00:00:53.340> with

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
composer I became very dissatisfied with

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.260 
composer I became very dissatisfied with
traditional<00:00:54.540> form<00:00:54.980> thus<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.250> had<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.790> find<00:00:57.090> a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
traditional form thus I had to find a

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.490 
traditional form thus I had to find a
new<00:00:57.450> way<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.930> expressing<00:00:58.740> the<00:00:59.580> sound<00:00:59.880> of<00:01:00.120> my

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
new way of expressing the sound of my

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.400 
new way of expressing the sound of my
ideas<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.710> imagination<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.790> I<00:01:03.750> realized<00:01:04.199> at

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
ideas in imagination and I realized at

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.310 
ideas in imagination and I realized at
that<00:01:04.470> point<00:01:04.620> that<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.910> would<00:01:06.270> express<00:01:06.600> my<00:01:06.870> music

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that point that I would express my music

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:32.300 
that point that I would express my music
in<00:01:08.010> mandala<00:01:08.610> forms

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.429 

there's<00:01:33.310> an<00:01:33.729> underlying<00:01:34.450> message<00:01:34.749> behind<00:01:35.319> the

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
there's an underlying message behind the

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.340 
there's an underlying message behind the
music<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.759> if<00:01:37.450> people<00:01:37.689> just<00:01:37.990> give<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.289> a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
music that if people just give it a

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.319 
music that if people just give it a
chance<00:01:38.380> there's<00:01:38.979> something<00:01:39.429> deeper<00:01:39.819> there<00:01:40.030> to

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
chance there's something deeper there to

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.239 
chance there's something deeper there to
be<00:01:40.869> heard<00:01:41.140> felt<00:01:41.789> seen<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:44.380> become<00:01:44.709> known<00:01:44.979> and
