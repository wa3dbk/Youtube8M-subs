 screenshot from the bey nix bike 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.420
 interface software on the start 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.019
 screen will be the three components 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.880
 presented 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:22.550
 on the left in the picture we see the 3d console 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:26.550
 in the middle of the battery and on the right in the picture 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.920
 Engine the technical data below 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.900
 all components can be solved 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.900
 additionally open further 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.390
 Here is an overview of the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.789
 serial number the firmware british council 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.010
 scope speed limit 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:51.690
 battery type top speed etc pp 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.600
 at nik software offers three 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.449
 different attitudes the economy 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.309
 the the fort and the sport mode we 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.140
 look at us now in detail 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.590
 what that for the individual parameters 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.700
 means the three modes refer to 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.280
 the incision parameter 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.670
 filter settings 24 mesz 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:20.340
 signal gain 007 and that 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:24.409
 responsiveness a14 must and me 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.409
 switch to sports now 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.049
 we see a change in the three 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.990
 now mentioned parameters switch on 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.009
 the sport mode we are back to one 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.030
 adaptation of these parameters 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.400
 Unfortunately, who goes out of the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.560
 manual still from one 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.000
 other documentation which 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.540
 The effects are essentially those three 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.780
 have programs 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.570
 That's why we got away from 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.700
 vivantes technik.de made the effort and 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.920
 have on a standard test round with 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.189
 22 kilometer distance the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.200
 various programs we cycle through 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.910
 have continued in the field of 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.850
 custom settings the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.840
 parameters changed again extremely 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.450
 and have taken this into account 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.420
 maximum range of the batteries and up 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:28.570
 the spent on the used up 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:31.450
 thus prevail again reached the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.880
 area of the program buttons we see 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.970
 that also gives the possibility 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.500
 custom settings 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.800
 if we take the picture here 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.760
 click once 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.790
 Here we come in a curve mode and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.680
 the possibility exists by means of 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:57.910
 - manually touch the individual parameters 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.460
 to adjust normally and then this data 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:06.180
 online via the usb interface and 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.180
 to load the bd interface into the bike 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.990
 furthermore, we are watching the new ones 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.220
 nik software versions that are the 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.500
 top speed of 25 kilometers 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.750
 per hour so no longer change 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.330
 we'll get an older one 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.780
 version of the interface program 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.960
 there is still the possibility the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:32.280
 top speed up to 30 40 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.740
 adapt kilometers per hour 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.350
 here on the usb-stick is located 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.260
 another older version of the ball is 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.150
 at the interface software with it 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.050
 it was possible 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.460
 to set the speed limit 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.250
 We will do it once 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.990
 start and see what possibilities 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.640
 the old software 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:57.940
 here still offers so we have the here 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.930
 old at next bike interface software 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.350
 version 1.2.0 six started we see 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.380
 the individual components are components 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.670
 from the pictures we are a little older 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.930
 Just look at how we do that 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.370
 speed can change 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.790
 we go into the table mode here 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.790
 it is possible 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.950
 with the area the speed 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:31.280
 using buttons to customize 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:34.140
 up as well as down 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.930
 downstairs may have the 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.590
 Advantage that the range of the batteries 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.920
 extended again by a few kilometers 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.210
 becomes 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:48.030
 a comparative test on my evaluation 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.320
 has revealed that the difference in the 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.120
 reach between the 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.420
 default setting 25 kilometers per hour 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.220
 hour and a chosen maximum 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.730
 Settings of 31 kilometers per 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.420
 hour on the standard test round the 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:09.330
 Battery capacity nearly 50 percent 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:11.030
 reduced so check it out with the 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.690
 speed takeover worked out 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.860
 we start 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.990
 the current software version it takes 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:25.140
 now something before the program 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:29.430
 started up is a program starts 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:33.800
 Automatically updated searches that takes 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.800
 something now 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:41.710
 before using the program instead 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.330
 continues the 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.650
 speed changes to 27 meters 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:51.980
 per hour is still in accordance with the law 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:55.400
 according to legal requirements, the 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.470
 speed reality 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.890
 deviations from the new value 25 kilometers 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:07.600
 ten percent per hour 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:11.630
 are in this case 25 kilometers per hour 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:18.670
 set certainly go only whole 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:24.200
 So steps were ten kilometers would 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:26.540
 24 meters per hour still in frame 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.590
 you are curious about where the 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:37.670
 find speed in the area of 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:41.810
 photos they sometimes may and see here that 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.680
 the top speed at 27 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.380
 kilometers per hour 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:50.270
 was taken over and we can now 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:54.470
 without the speed still 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:57.430
 let's change the different ones up here 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.230
 parameter economy the researchers 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:05.320
 custom settings again 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:10.540
 select and discuss 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.540
 transfer this data in the system
