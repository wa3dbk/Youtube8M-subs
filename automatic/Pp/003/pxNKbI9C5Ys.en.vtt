little harder than that son I mean
that's<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:11.880> that's<00:02:12.180> why<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.570> have<00:02:13.140> such<00:02:13.410> an

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that's I think that's why I have such an

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.320 
that's I think that's why I have such an
extreme<00:02:13.890> sense<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.250> humours<00:02:14.580> because<00:02:15.000> that's

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
extreme sense of humours because that's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.560 
extreme sense of humours because that's
what<00:02:16.050> they've<00:02:16.230> been<00:02:16.260> doing<00:02:16.920> since<00:02:17.570> they

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
what they've been doing since they

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.150 
what they've been doing since they
started<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.140> pushing<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.590> envelope<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.130> I

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
started the pushing the envelope so I

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.670 
started the pushing the envelope so I
don't<00:02:20.370> know<00:02:20.550> any<00:02:20.970> different<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:22.080> when<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> try

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
don't know any different and when I try

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.320 
don't know any different and when I try
and<00:02:22.790> reel<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.940> in

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
and reel it in

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:34.250 
and reel it in
