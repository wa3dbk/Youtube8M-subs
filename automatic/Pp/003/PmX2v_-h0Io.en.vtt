doing<00:00:33.290> a<00:00:33.379> review<00:00:33.410> on<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.100> crossroad<00:00:34.610> this<00:00:35.480> is

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
doing a review on the crossroad this is

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.330 
doing a review on the crossroad this is
probably<00:00:35.930> one<00:00:36.079> of<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:36.199> most<00:00:36.379> versatile<00:00:37.010> balls

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
probably one of the most versatile balls

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.579 
probably one of the most versatile balls
I<00:00:37.670> have<00:00:37.820> ever<00:00:38.090> thrown<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:38.750> I<00:00:39.290> know<00:00:39.350> what

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:39.589 
I have ever thrown and I know what

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:40.150 
I have ever thrown and I know what
you're<00:00:39.769> saying

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
you're saying

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.490 
you're saying
everybody<00:00:40.730> loves<00:00:40.970> the<00:00:41.120> high<00:00:41.239> road<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:42.110> I'm

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
everybody loves the high road and I'm

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.840 
everybody loves the high road and I'm
right<00:00:42.800> there<00:00:42.980> with<00:00:43.070> you<00:00:43.129> I<00:00:43.309> had<00:00:43.430> two<00:00:43.580> of<00:00:43.730> them

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
right there with you I had two of them

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.210 
right there with you I had two of them
but<00:00:44.059> I'm<00:00:44.989> telling<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:45.440> I<00:00:45.500> think<00:00:45.650> this<00:00:46.010> is<00:00:46.190> a

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
but I'm telling you I think this is a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.329 
but I'm telling you I think this is a
much<00:00:46.460> better<00:00:46.670> piece<00:00:46.970> of<00:00:47.180> equipment<00:00:47.660> I<00:00:48.339> have

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
much better piece of equipment I have

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.369 
much better piece of equipment I have
never<00:00:49.910> thrown<00:00:50.269> a<00:00:50.360> ball<00:00:50.600> that<00:00:50.870> read<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.199> lane

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
never thrown a ball that read the lane

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.049 
never thrown a ball that read the lane
so<00:00:51.680> well<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.190> it<00:00:52.280> doesn't<00:00:52.580> matter<00:00:52.670> what

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
so well and it doesn't matter what

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.100 
so well and it doesn't matter what
surface<00:00:53.650> what<00:00:54.650> type<00:00:55.460> of<00:00:55.729> pattern<00:00:56.119> I'm<00:00:56.269> on<00:00:56.479> this

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
surface what type of pattern I'm on this

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.799 
surface what type of pattern I'm on this
ball<00:00:57.409> is<00:00:57.799> my<00:00:58.129> go-to<00:00:58.309> ball<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:59.000> is<00:00:59.210> the

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
ball is my go-to ball this is the

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.640 
ball is my go-to ball this is the
perfect<00:01:00.140> benchmark<00:01:00.769> ball<00:01:00.979> in<00:01:01.220> the<00:01:01.790> storm<00:01:02.089> line

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
perfect benchmark ball in the storm line

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.469 
perfect benchmark ball in the storm line
I'm<00:01:03.650> using<00:01:03.799> the<00:01:04.280> standard<00:01:04.640> box<00:01:04.850> surface<00:01:05.299> on

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
I'm using the standard box surface on

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:06.940 
I'm using the standard box surface on
screen<00:01:05.900> right<00:01:06.049> here<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.439> see<00:01:06.470> how<00:01:06.650> well

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
screen right here and you see how well

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.060 
screen right here and you see how well
it<00:01:07.460> rolls<00:01:07.850> on<00:01:08.090> this<00:01:08.299> it's<00:01:08.960> 1500<00:01:09.590> grit<00:01:09.680> polish

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
it rolls on this it's 1500 grit polish

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.100 
it rolls on this it's 1500 grit polish
all<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.640> pieces<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.240> equipment<00:01:11.360> today<00:01:11.930> are

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
all the pieces of equipment today are

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.740 
all the pieces of equipment today are
the<00:01:12.470> same<00:01:12.710> layout<00:01:12.920> which<00:01:13.340> is<00:01:13.369> 45<00:01:14.000> by<00:01:14.270> four<00:01:14.630> and

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
the same layout which is 45 by four and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.620 
the same layout which is 45 by four and
a<00:01:14.810> half<00:01:15.020> by<00:01:15.350> 45<00:01:15.979> so<00:01:16.970> I'm<00:01:17.090> comparing<00:01:17.390> it<00:01:17.570> with

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
a half by 45 so I'm comparing it with

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.130 
a half by 45 so I'm comparing it with
the<00:01:17.840> Victory<00:01:18.200> Road<00:01:18.439> pearl<00:01:18.799> you're<00:01:19.549> gonna<00:01:19.670> see

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
the Victory Road pearl you're gonna see

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.660 
the Victory Road pearl you're gonna see
the<00:01:21.140> Victory<00:01:21.439> Road<00:01:21.619> gets<00:01:21.920> up<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.220> lane<00:01:22.400> a

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
the Victory Road gets up the lane a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.880 
the Victory Road gets up the lane a
little<00:01:23.509> bit<00:01:23.659> more<00:01:23.900> it's<00:01:24.200> gonna<00:01:24.350> be<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.590> little

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
little bit more it's gonna be a little

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.740 
little bit more it's gonna be a little
more<00:01:25.010> snappy<00:01:25.490> down<00:01:25.670> laying<00:01:25.970> create<00:01:26.360> a<00:01:26.390> little

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
more snappy down laying create a little

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.310 
more snappy down laying create a little
more<00:01:26.990> entry<00:01:27.440> angle<00:01:27.590> for<00:01:28.040> you<00:01:28.210> for<00:01:29.210> me<00:01:29.420> it's<00:01:30.110> a

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
more entry angle for you for me it's a

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.840 
more entry angle for you for me it's a
small<00:01:30.800> adjustment<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.640> right<00:01:31.820> I

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
small adjustment to the right I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.320 
small adjustment to the right I
typically<00:01:32.450> go<00:01:32.690> a<00:01:32.720> two<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.170> one<00:01:33.940> but<00:01:34.940> this<00:01:35.120> ball

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
typically go a two in one but this ball

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.890 
typically go a two in one but this ball
just<00:01:36.250> again<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:37.610> also<00:01:38.120> reads<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.690> lanes

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
just again it also reads the lanes

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.890 
just again it also reads the lanes
pretty<00:01:39.260> well<00:01:39.670> this<00:01:40.670> is<00:01:40.850> my<00:01:41.000> step<00:01:41.360> down<00:01:41.600> from

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
pretty well this is my step down from

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.720 
pretty well this is my step down from
the<00:01:42.080> cross<00:01:42.290> road<00:01:42.650> when<00:01:42.980> the<00:01:43.250> crossroads

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
the cross road when the crossroads

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.300 
the cross road when the crossroads
getting<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.090> little<00:01:44.500> too<00:01:45.500> aggressive<00:01:46.040> on<00:01:46.190> the

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
getting a little too aggressive on the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.190 
getting a little too aggressive on the
lane<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:46.760> I<00:01:46.820> switched<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.930> victory

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
lane so I switched to the to the victory

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.690 
lane so I switched to the to the victory
red<00:01:48.380> pearl<00:01:48.620> and<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:48.979> seems<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:49.550> work<00:01:49.580> really

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
red pearl and it seems to work really

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.280 
red pearl and it seems to work really
well

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
well

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.570 
well
so<00:01:51.290> when<00:01:51.409> comparing<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.920> crossroad<00:01:52.370> to<00:01:52.490> the

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
so when comparing the crossroad to the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.270 
so when comparing the crossroad to the
modern<00:01:52.880> marvel<00:01:53.210> you're<00:01:53.390> gonna<00:01:53.479> see<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.950> MARTA

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
modern marvel you're gonna see the MARTA

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.060 
modern marvel you're gonna see the MARTA
marble<00:01:55.729> reads<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.450> lanes<00:01:56.659> a<00:01:56.870> good<00:01:57.140> two<00:01:57.920> to

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
marble reads the lanes a good two to

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.250 
marble reads the lanes a good two to
three<00:01:58.280> feet<00:01:58.490> earlier<00:01:58.880> than<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.180> crossroad<00:01:59.690> at

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
three feet earlier than the crossroad at

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.960 
three feet earlier than the crossroad at
least<00:02:00.560> with<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.340> know<00:02:01.460> with<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.760> same

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
least with this you know with the same

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.050 
least with this you know with the same
drilling<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.510> drilling<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:02.900> I'm<00:02:03.020> using

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
drilling the drilling that I'm using

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.789 
drilling the drilling that I'm using
because<00:02:05.060> of<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:05.330> this<00:02:05.690> is<00:02:05.900> my<00:02:06.080> step<00:02:06.409> up<00:02:06.590> from

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
because of this this is my step up from

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.199 
because of this this is my step up from
the<00:02:06.890> crossroad<00:02:07.280> when<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.490> crossroads<00:02:07.970> just

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
the crossroad when the crossroads just

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.660 
the crossroad when the crossroads just
not<00:02:08.629> quite<00:02:08.929> getting<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:09.349> done<00:02:09.560> or<00:02:10.369> I'm<00:02:10.519> playing

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
not quite getting it done or I'm playing
