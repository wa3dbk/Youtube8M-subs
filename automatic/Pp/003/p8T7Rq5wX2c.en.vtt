00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.860
 why settle for san stars 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.539
 lorenzo when you can have more 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.700
 have you ever dreamed of taking a ride 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.300
 in the universe to see with one's own eyes 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.039
 what is there much further and raise it 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.770
 the look and look at the sky beyond 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.250
 the horizon always makes the mind open e 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.230
 think of distant borders well everything 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.190
 this can be done and it is a journey 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.039
 virtual 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.190
 let's not new, but today 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.260
 available vision is even wider 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.620
 new record indeed for the sloan 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.109
 digital sky serves the most ambitious e 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.289
 advanced cartography project of 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:52.929
 cosmo after two years of data collection has 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.929
 recorded position and distance over 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:58.210
 a million galaxies covering a 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:02.940
 volume equivalent to that of a cube 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.940
 4 billion light years from the side 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.330
 the video proposes a journey into the 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.790
 galaxies mapped so far equal to one third 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.760
 of all those that the project will map 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.260
 in its six years of activity 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.600
 great commitment of industry experts 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.940
 to achieve this spectacular 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.910
 animation those you see in the video 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.000
 they are galaxies and not stars and in theirs 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.190
 real position means that everyone of 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.890
 those dots contains the beauty of 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.680
 hundreds of thousands if not millions of 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.200
 solar systems and potential planets 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.500
 habitable and then good trip 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.500
 the universe
