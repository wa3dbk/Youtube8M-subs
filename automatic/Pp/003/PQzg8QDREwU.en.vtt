00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:07.750
 this 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.000
 hello everyone with you fan planet today 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.549
 there will be a video about why lag games on 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.799
 android many often ask this 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.320
 question when buying a new smartphone on 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.119
 android operating system before 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.910
 what and think and figure out what 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.130
 the reason they start blaming companies and 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.330
 its quality or point to price type 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.330
 if than cheap topic 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.340
 definitely these people are wrong and it's the case 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.010
 not at all 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.440
 First you need to say that the games lag 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.030
 not at all on android but on device on 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.760
 operating system is installed 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.710
 android smartphone is the same 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.850
 computer only miniature on the other 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.620
 operating system 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.899
 depends on the device 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.610
 gaming performance and of course 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.820
 game optimization for this smartphone 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.739
 or tablet is basically the whole problem 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.809
 lag is either not enough 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.850
 powerful video accelerator and either in 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.059
 game optimization for this video 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.280
 accelerator due to a weak processor too 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.960
 can lag games but usually with 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.829
 A powerful video accelerator is not usually 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.789
 put a weak processor 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.069
 insufficient memory 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.170
 is only the reason for the departure of games or 

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:19.749
 periodic freezes so on fps 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.029
 it does not affect before choice should 

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:24.999
 learn everything that a smartphone 

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:26.880
 would you like to purchase not enough 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.590
 to know only what is written characteristic 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.829
 you need to learn everything in detail about the processor 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.079
 video boosters and ram 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.700
 for those who understand computers 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.829
 imagine that same video card on 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.439
 while this is also a video with measles tilly on 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.290
 smartphone just like it can not be replaced 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.180
 in some laptops 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.420
 characteristics of the video accelerator and there are 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.160
 the same description as its video card 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.140
 there is another very important reason because 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.820
 which lag games this high 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.630
 screen resolution with weak and and 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.150
 boosters 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.130
 in this case, you need to be able to count and 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.750
 visually represents for example there is 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.400
 certain video accelerator and 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.220
 specific screen resolution 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.660
 if the resolution is doubled then 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.509
 video accelerator u will have to process 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.229
 two times more information 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.410
 accordingly performance 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.910
 will decrease by half this is all basic 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.880
 what can the logo do 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.980
 on your smartphone or tablet hopefully 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.020
 This information helped you to put 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.700
 like subscribe to the channel leave 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.860
 comments and see the rest 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.330
 interesting video link to playlist in 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.330
 description all bye
