00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello to you, valera and the hall itself 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.800
 in this video I will review addons 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.680
 without which in construction almost 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.650
 can't do this addon is called smors 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.900
 the meaning of this house is that at the facility 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.900
 on which we aim is drawn 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.029
 auxiliary grid this grid we can 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.419
 configure by going to the main menu in 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.460
 option tab with player smart itself after 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.589
 when you download smart-lab or 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.140
 reset your settings and choose squat 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.239
 default all parameters will be standard 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.789
 and probably uncomfortable for construction 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.100
 Now I will show you the best in my 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.250
 a look at the timeline for a smart on which 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.290
 I always use myself 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.500
 so start the checkbox and on and we were 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.559

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.530

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.550

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.570
 slider edge and smart hub 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.480
 do not touch and check box bowden box 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.880
 on and will we leave 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.580
 so dash slider great wall distance 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.220
 this is the grid drawing range we can 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.030
 leave it as it is or put it 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.030
 at the very max 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.300
 scares it all that is indented 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.250
 still from the edge of the object 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.060
 we can leave as is or 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.990
 to put 0.1 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.090
 Freud transparency transparent mesh 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.369
 make it more noticeable 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.380
 the last but one slider maxim typing 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.560
 slam belt he's on kis we leave for now 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.450
 as is and the value in the last sliders 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.850
 minimum distance between each is no 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.850
 point we are replaced by a two from the eight 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.230
 we are left with the last flag garbage 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.960
 collection boost which we leave 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.820
 it 's not all me now 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.960
 I'll tell you about the meaning of the site 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.790
 the last but one sliders 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.250
 let's say you need to do so 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.479
 the grid lines coincided with the texture people 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.520
 phx trails 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.770
 for this we take the value of a slider 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.620
 max side with the sonic cis crowd 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.780
 multiple of squares before 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:28.120
 we crop 3 by 3 means the value 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:30.100
 the slider can take 3 6 9 12 15 and so 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.740
 Further 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.650
 irina4 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.550
 here you can use the value 1612 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.970
 or 8 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:46.290
 now about 5 on 1 here is a multiple 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.290
 5 that is 10 15 20 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.280
 in order to fix the sight 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.940
 any intersection need 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.860
 hold the action key or use 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.459
 silence is an English letter and or 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.459
 Russian 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.690

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.700

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.320
