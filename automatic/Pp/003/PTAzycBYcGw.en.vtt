now apparently the new Retina display is
so<00:01:32.189> good<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.840> once<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.020> use<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.650> you'll

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
so good that once you use one you'll

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.010 
so good that once you use one you'll

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
and everything but realistically

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.540 
and everything but realistically
speaking<00:04:32.110> they<00:04:32.530> did<00:04:32.710> what<00:04:32.889> they<00:04:32.919> needed<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.340> do

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
speaking they did what they needed to do

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.890 
speaking they did what they needed to do
and<00:04:33.580> although<00:04:34.330> there<00:04:34.509> were<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.630> lot<00:04:34.870> of

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
predictions people who predicted

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.040 
predictions people who predicted
correctly<00:04:36.340> because<00:04:36.759> it<00:04:36.970> was<00:04:37.060> hard<00:04:37.270> not<00:04:37.539> to<00:04:37.930> get

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
correctly because it was hard not to get

is<00:04:40.210> that<00:04:40.900> people<00:04:41.350> expected<00:04:42.160> things<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.669> they

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
is that people expected things and they

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.879 
is that people expected things and they
got<00:04:43.000> them<00:04:43.180> Apple<00:04:43.630> simply<00:04:44.139> gave<00:04:44.380> us<00:04:44.560> what<00:04:44.860> we
