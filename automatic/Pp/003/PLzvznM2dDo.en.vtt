what it's going to be used for we've

what it's going to be used for we've
discussed<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.220> whole<00:00:20.430> thing<00:00:20.670> already<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
discussed this whole thing already in a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.090 
discussed this whole thing already in a
video<00:00:21.689> which<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.080> much<00:00:22.230> longer<00:00:22.619> than<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.890> one

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
video which is much longer than this one

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.029 
video which is much longer than this one
and<00:00:23.960> it<00:00:24.960> has<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> admit<00:00:25.500> errs<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:25.890> which

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
and it has the admit errs here which

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.950 
and it has the admit errs here which
everybody<00:00:26.340> thinks<00:00:26.550> are<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.939> problem<00:00:27.660> which<00:00:27.810> we

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
everybody thinks are a problem which we

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.689 
everybody thinks are a problem which we
don't<00:00:28.080> really<00:00:28.380> think<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:29.099> will<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.490> we

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
don't really think that they will be we

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.070 
don't really think that they will be we
think<00:00:29.820> they<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.119> something<00:00:30.390> planned<00:00:30.869> for

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
think they have something planned for

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.770 
think they have something planned for
that<00:00:31.880> but<00:00:32.880> what<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.090> want<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.360> today<00:00:33.510> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that but what we want to do today is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.970 
that but what we want to do today is
test<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.170> see<00:00:34.260> how<00:00:34.380> dangerous<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
test and see how dangerous is the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.370 
test and see how dangerous is the
beating<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.399> if<00:00:35.870> these<00:00:36.870> are<00:00:37.170> actual

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
beating you if these are actual

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.590 
beating you if these are actual
lightsaber<00:00:38.309> blades<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.360> blade

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
lightsaber blades just like this blade

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.569 
lightsaber blades just like this blade
here<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.800> understand<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> lore

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
here so what we understand on the lore

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
here so what we understand on the lore
there<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.450> containment<00:00:42.780> field<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
there is a containment field or a

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.139 
there is a containment field or a
magnetic<00:00:43.800> containment<00:00:44.040> field<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:44.969> mean

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
magnetic containment field that I mean

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.850 
magnetic containment field that I mean
you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.390> almost<00:00:45.809> technically<00:00:46.379> touch<00:00:46.620> one

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
you can almost technically touch one

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.709 
you can almost technically touch one
without<00:00:47.190> getting<00:00:48.059> your<00:00:48.120> finger<00:00:48.480> cut<00:00:48.660> off

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
without getting your finger cut off

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.450 
without getting your finger cut off
because<00:00:49.649> there's<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> Texan<00:00:50.190> amount<00:00:50.370> of

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
because there's the Texan amount of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.130 
because there's the Texan amount of
force<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.850> push<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> blade<00:00:51.719> or<00:00:51.870> something

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
force to push like a blade or something

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.110 
force to push like a blade or something
to<00:00:52.260> actually<00:00:52.590> cut<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.489> let's<00:00:53.640> say<00:00:53.789> that's<00:00:53.910> not

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
to actually cut but let's say that's not

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.549 
to actually cut but let's say that's not
true<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.570> they're<00:00:54.719> extremely<00:00:54.930> dangerous<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
true and they're extremely dangerous and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.779 
true and they're extremely dangerous and
if<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.920> touches<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.610> Nick

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
if just touches you just going to Nick

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.130 
if just touches you just going to Nick
you<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.059> cut<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.660> did<00:00:57.780> something<00:00:57.960> like

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you or cut you if you did something like

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.160 
you or cut you if you did something like
that<00:00:58.320> we're<00:00:58.980> gonna<00:00:59.070> see<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.550> go<00:00:59.699> through

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
that we're gonna see if you go through

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.650 
that we're gonna see if you go through
proper<00:01:01.170> motions<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.680> techniques<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.660> pairing

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
proper motions and techniques of pairing

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750 
proper motions and techniques of pairing
moving<00:01:03.989> around<00:01:04.229> cutting<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.640> you

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
moving around cutting and so on what you

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.760 
moving around cutting and so on what you
hit<00:01:05.939> yourself<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.170> came<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:07.710> with

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
hit yourself so the way we came up with

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.470 

and<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:17.020> course<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.590> supposed<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.950> be<00:02:18.130> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
and of course this is supposed to be the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.080 
and of course this is supposed to be the
big<00:02:19.480> determining<00:02:20.080> one<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.880> did

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
big determining one that you did

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.690 
big determining one that you did
something<00:02:22.360> like<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:24.190> would<00:02:24.310> hit<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.550> or

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
something like this you would hit you or

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.330 
something like this you would hit you or
something<00:02:25.240> I<00:02:25.770> don't<00:02:26.770> know<00:02:26.920> I'm<00:02:27.100> just<00:02:27.160> not

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
something I don't know I'm just not

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.730 
something I don't know I'm just not
seeing<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:28.240> hurting<00:02:28.750> yourself<00:02:29.260> with<00:02:29.350> them<00:02:29.650> in

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
seeing you hurting yourself with them in

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.380 
seeing you hurting yourself with them in
these<00:02:29.800> rooms<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.280> way<00:02:30.370> we<00:02:30.490> long<00:02:30.670> for<00:02:30.760> yours<00:02:31.120> I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
these rooms the way we long for yours I

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.710 
these rooms the way we long for yours I
mean<00:02:32.200> these<00:02:32.350> are<00:02:32.500> like<00:02:32.530> ridiculous<00:02:33.340> even

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
mean these are like ridiculous even

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.460 
mean these are like ridiculous even
doing<00:02:34.720> classic<00:02:35.170> style<00:02:35.410> techniques<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.250> stuff

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
doing classic style techniques and stuff

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.450 
doing classic style techniques and stuff
I'm<00:02:38.470> not<00:02:38.680> picturing<00:02:39.010> any<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:45.160> with<00:02:45.430> a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
I'm not picturing any of it and with a

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.980 
I'm not picturing any of it and with a
lightsaber<00:02:45.940> blade<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.330> think<00:02:46.660> this<00:02:46.780> would<00:02:46.960> be

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
lightsaber blade I think this would be

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.800 
lightsaber blade I think this would be
pretty<00:02:47.440> much<00:02:47.790> fatal<00:02:48.790> for<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.090> person<00:02:49.480> one

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
pretty much fatal for the person one

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.170 
pretty much fatal for the person one
thing<00:02:50.020> I<00:02:50.170> noticed<00:02:50.530> about<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:51.040> blade<00:02:51.340> is<00:02:51.640> it

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
thing I noticed about this blade is it

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.660 
thing I noticed about this blade is it
seems<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.450> be<00:02:52.570> longer<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.710> actual<00:02:54.070> trailer

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
seems to be longer in the actual trailer

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.030 
seems to be longer in the actual trailer
than<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.270> other<00:02:55.390> lightsabers<00:02:56.050> like<00:02:56.710> a<00:02:56.740> long

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
than the other lightsabers like a long

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.340 
than the other lightsabers like a long
sword<00:02:57.400> or<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.700> handed<00:02:58.450> hassle<00:02:58.810> or<00:02:58.900> bastard

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
sword or a handed hassle or bastard

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.380 
sword or a handed hassle or bastard
sword<00:02:59.560> not<00:03:00.190> quiet<00:03:00.520> great<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:00.910> we<00:03:01.060> can't<00:03:01.240> really

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
sword not quiet great so we can't really

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.270 
sword not quiet great so we can't really
tell<00:03:01.600> because<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:01.900> goes<00:03:02.020> off<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.320> camera<00:03:02.710> but

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
tell because it goes off the camera but

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.200 
tell because it goes off the camera but
I<00:03:03.310> noticed<00:03:03.670> that<00:03:03.820> with<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:03.970> conventional

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
I noticed that with a conventional

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.970 
I noticed that with a conventional
lightsaber<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:04.960> would<00:03:05.200> be<00:03:05.290> able<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.530> attack<00:03:05.770> him

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
lightsaber I would be able to attack him

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.760 
lightsaber I would be able to attack him
way<00:03:06.190> before<00:03:06.550> he<00:03:06.700> could<00:03:06.820> ever<00:03:06.880> akid<00:03:07.420> me<00:03:07.690> did<00:03:08.680> he

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
way before he could ever akid me did he

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.800 
way before he could ever akid me did he
look<00:03:08.890> here<00:03:09.040> he<00:03:09.160> doesn't<00:03:09.310> even<00:03:09.460> have<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.670> blow<00:03:10.000> if

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
look here he doesn't even have a blow if

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.380 
look here he doesn't even have a blow if
he<00:03:10.930> reaches<00:03:11.230> straight<00:03:11.560> out<00:03:11.880> he'd<00:03:12.880> be<00:03:13.000> missing

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
he reaches straight out he'd be missing

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.880 
he reaches straight out he'd be missing
so<00:03:13.810> that's<00:03:13.930> one<00:03:14.080> advantage<00:03:14.170> on<00:03:14.500> them<00:03:14.620> but

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
so that's one advantage on them but

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.440 
so that's one advantage on them but
let's<00:03:15.040> say<00:03:15.190> we<00:03:15.400> do<00:03:15.520> something<00:03:15.760> different<00:03:16.270> here

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
let's say we do something different here

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.640 
let's say we do something different here
and<00:03:17.140> he<00:03:17.320> comes<00:03:17.650> in<00:03:17.860> from<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.100> top<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:19.150> parry

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
and he comes in from the top and I parry

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.490 
and he comes in from the top and I parry
and<00:03:20.650> just<00:03:20.890> bring<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.280> down<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:22.320> still<00:03:23.320> have<00:03:23.470> a

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
and just bring it down I still have a

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.200 
and just bring it down I still have a
quillian<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.400> that's<00:03:24.580> kind<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:24.970> interesting

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
quillian so that's kind of interesting

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.760 
quillian so that's kind of interesting
there<00:03:25.570> I<00:03:25.630> can<00:03:25.900> still<00:03:26.080> come<00:03:26.260> up<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.500> take<00:03:26.590> the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
there I can still come up and take the

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.820 
there I can still come up and take the
hand<00:03:26.980> if<00:03:27.100> I<00:03:27.190> wanted<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:29.290> I<00:03:29.320> mean<00:03:29.620> there's<00:03:29.770> a

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
hand if I wanted to so I mean there's a

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.440 
hand if I wanted to so I mean there's a
lot<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:32.920> having<00:03:33.130> quillin's<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:34.210> only

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
lot of just having quillin's the only

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.610 
lot of just having quillin's the only
question<00:03:34.810> is<00:03:34.930> everybody<00:03:35.230> wants<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.470> know<00:03:35.560> is

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
question is everybody wants to know is

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.900 
question is everybody wants to know is
if<00:03:35.740> you<00:03:35.830> can<00:03:35.950> cut<00:03:36.160> these<00:03:36.340> off<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:36.820> I'm

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
if you can cut these off and I'm

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.370 
if you can cut these off and I'm
assuming<00:03:37.330> if<00:03:37.420> they<00:03:37.510> have<00:03:37.750> them<00:03:37.960> on<00:03:38.110> there<00:03:38.260> the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
assuming if they have them on there the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.830 
assuming if they have them on there the
way<00:03:38.500> they<00:03:38.650> do<00:03:38.820> unless<00:03:39.820> it's<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.120> flaw<00:03:40.390> desire

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
way they do unless it's a flaw desire

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.910 
way they do unless it's a flaw desire
the<00:03:41.050> guy<00:03:41.170> really<00:03:41.470> doesn't<00:03:41.590> know<00:03:41.710> what<00:03:41.830> he's

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
the guy really doesn't know what he's

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.690 
the guy really doesn't know what he's
doing<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:43.240> can't<00:03:44.140> there's<00:03:45.010> some<00:03:45.220> reason<00:03:45.550> you

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
doing you can't there's some reason you

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.010 
doing you can't there's some reason you
can't<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.120> I'm<00:03:46.300> thinking<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.630> quillion<00:03:46.870> x'

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
can't so I'm thinking the quillion x'

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.970 
can't so I'm thinking the quillion x'
would<00:03:47.140> be<00:03:47.200> way<00:03:47.380> better<00:03:47.410> than<00:03:47.710> not<00:03:47.950> having

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
would be way better than not having

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.120
