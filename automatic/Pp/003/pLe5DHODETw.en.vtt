00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:13.520 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.450 

okay<00:00:15.170> yeah<00:00:16.170> let's<00:00:16.470> see<00:00:16.800> if<00:00:16.860> we<00:00:16.950> can<00:00:17.130> kind<00:00:17.340> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
okay yeah let's see if we can kind of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.430 
okay yeah let's see if we can kind of
flow<00:00:17.850> through<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:19.340> and<00:00:20.869> feeling<00:00:21.869> all<00:00:22.230> these

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
flow through it and feeling all these

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:37.740 
flow through it and feeling all these
various

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.290 

hmm

hmm
yeah<00:00:40.220> so<00:00:41.220> much<00:00:41.340> fun<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.840> that's<00:00:42.960> so

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
yeah so much fun it's that that's so

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.190 
yeah so much fun it's that that's so
much<00:00:43.320> fun<00:00:43.590> isn't<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:45.200> we're

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
much fun isn't it it's it's we're

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.850 
much fun isn't it it's it's we're
working<00:00:46.800> see<00:00:47.400> we're<00:00:48.240> working<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> deepest

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
working see we're working at the deepest

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.200 
working see we're working at the deepest
levels<00:00:50.310> of<00:00:50.660> body<00:00:51.660> mind<00:00:51.989> coordination<00:00:53.210> using

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
levels of body mind coordination using

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.760 
levels of body mind coordination using
our<00:00:54.690> Yi<00:00:55.080> our<00:00:55.350> imagination<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.520> help<00:00:57.390> us

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
our Yi our imagination to help us

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.880 
our Yi our imagination to help us
control<00:00:58.770> our<00:00:58.830> internal<00:00:59.580> energies<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.710> we<00:01:01.710> can

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
control our internal energies and we can

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.329 
control our internal energies and we can
imagine<00:01:02.480> certainly<00:01:03.480> how<00:01:03.900> this<00:01:04.620> could<00:01:04.949> benefit

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
imagine certainly how this could benefit

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.000 
imagine certainly how this could benefit
ourselves<00:01:05.520> say<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.510> had<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> liver<00:01:07.140> problem

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.740 

well<00:01:11.010> don't<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.430> think<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.940> would<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.300> we

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
well don't you think it would be we

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.190 
well don't you think it would be we
could<00:01:12.960> lead<00:01:13.560> our<00:01:13.860> energy<00:01:14.430> into<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> liver

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
could lead our energy into the liver

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.100 
could lead our energy into the liver
using<00:01:16.200> our<00:01:16.350> mind<00:01:16.820> using<00:01:17.820> our<00:01:17.970> mind<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.420> bring

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
using our mind using our mind to bring

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.040 
using our mind using our mind to bring
our<00:01:19.350> physical<00:01:19.920> energy<00:01:20.759> into<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.690> particular

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
our physical energy into this particular

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.889 
our physical energy into this particular
spot<00:01:22.880> for<00:01:23.880> our<00:01:24.360> own<00:01:24.660> healing<00:01:25.550> or<00:01:26.550> whatever<00:01:27.180> or

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
spot for our own healing or whatever or

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.650 
spot for our own healing or whatever or
for<00:01:28.410> any<00:01:28.649> action<00:01:29.160> that<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.460> want<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
for any action that we want to do to

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.840 
for any action that we want to do to
make<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.869> beautiful<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.830> make<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.160> balance<00:01:32.399> and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
make it beautiful to make it balance and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.520 
make it beautiful to make it balance and
to<00:01:32.970> make<00:01:33.149> it<00:01:33.300> complete<00:01:35.630> okay<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.690> this<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.200> how

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
to make it complete okay so this is how

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.340 
to make it complete okay so this is how
Tai<00:01:38.280> Chi<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.820> made<00:01:39.300> formed<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.380> perfected<00:01:42.350> we

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
Tai Chi is made formed and perfected we

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.070 
Tai Chi is made formed and perfected we
start<00:01:43.679> off<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.910> two<00:01:45.420> form

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
start off with the two form

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.469 
start off with the two form
we<00:01:46.619> start<00:01:47.340> with<00:01:47.459> understand<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> application

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
we start with understand the application

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.710 
we start with understand the application
and<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:49.590> start<00:01:50.009> breaking<00:01:50.550> up<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.940> figuring

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
and then start breaking up and figuring

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.440 
and then start breaking up and figuring
out<00:01:51.990> where<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:52.950> need<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.789> make<00:01:54.240> our

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
out where we need to make our

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.930 
out where we need to make our
counterbalances<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:56.220> in<00:01:56.280> order<00:01:56.429> to<00:01:56.610> perfect

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
counterbalances to in order to perfect

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.320 
counterbalances to in order to perfect
this<00:01:57.240> movement<00:02:01.039> so<00:02:02.039> let's<00:02:02.250> look<00:02:02.610> at<00:02:02.940> another

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
this movement so let's look at another

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.260 
this movement so let's look at another
movement<00:02:04.289> I<00:02:04.440> think<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:04.890> time<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.399> look<00:02:06.119> at

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
movement I think we have time to look at

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.800 
movement I think we have time to look at
another<00:02:06.600> movement<00:02:06.929> and<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:08.399> one<00:02:08.750> is<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
another movement and this one is a

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.360 
another movement and this one is a
little<00:02:10.229> bit<00:02:10.440> bigger<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.459> more<00:02:12.300> varied<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:14.040> let

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
little bit bigger and more varied so let

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.270 
little bit bigger and more varied so let
me<00:02:14.490> do<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.849> movement<00:02:15.270> now<00:02:15.900> let's<00:02:16.080> do<00:02:16.260> us<00:02:16.530> if

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
me do this movement now let's do us if

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.949 
me do this movement now let's do us if
you<00:02:17.400> back<00:02:17.580> up<00:02:17.610> just<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.060> little<00:02:18.090> bit<00:02:18.270> let's<00:02:18.720> do

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
you back up just a little bit let's do

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.530 
you back up just a little bit let's do
this<00:02:19.260> one<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.590> called<00:02:22.520> fists<00:02:23.520> under<00:02:23.700> elbow<00:02:24.030> so

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
this one is called fists under elbow so

00:02:24.540 --> 00:03:00.700 
this one is called fists under elbow so
here's<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.020> here's<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.709> movement

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.820 

there's<00:03:01.710> a<00:03:01.770> lot<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.070> opportunities<00:03:02.880> there<00:03:03.210> for

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
there's a lot of opportunities there for

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.100 
there's a lot of opportunities there for
for<00:03:04.830> work<00:03:05.160> are<00:03:05.430> there<00:03:05.580> there's<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.820> lot<00:03:06.270> of<00:03:06.480> many

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
for work are there there's a lot of many

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:19.360 
for work are there there's a lot of many
many<00:03:07.760> varied<00:03:08.760> things<00:03:09.270> going<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.140> body

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.570 

she<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.640> lot<00:03:20.819> of<00:03:21.030> chances<00:03:21.540> here<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.380> get<00:03:22.620> going

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
she a lot of chances here to get going

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.180 
she a lot of chances here to get going
in<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.819> wrong<00:03:24.000> during<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:25.830> wrong<00:03:26.010> direction

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
in the wrong during the wrong direction

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.800 
in the wrong during the wrong direction
and<00:03:26.489> lose<00:03:26.760> one's<00:03:27.120> balance<00:03:32.209> okay<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.569> that's

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
and lose one's balance okay so that's

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.559 
and lose one's balance okay so that's
the<00:03:34.020> form<00:03:34.319> let's<00:03:35.190> look<00:03:35.400> at<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.730> let's<00:03:36.269> look<00:03:36.360> at

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
the form let's look at the let's look at

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.140 
the form let's look at the let's look at
the<00:03:36.690> application<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.800> this<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.610> figure<00:03:38.910> up

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
the application of this and figure up

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.979 
the application of this and figure up
where<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.349> why<00:03:40.700> these<00:03:41.700> things<00:03:42.000> happen<00:03:42.510> okay

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
where and why these things happen okay

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.339 
where and why these things happen okay
so<00:03:43.670> maybe<00:03:44.670> if<00:03:44.880> rec<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.360> if<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.630> come<00:03:45.900> over<00:03:46.110> here

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
so maybe if rec so if you come over here

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:54.470 
so maybe if rec so if you come over here
okay<00:03:49.349> so<00:03:49.940> in<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.600> movement<00:03:52.519> in<00:03:53.519> Tai<00:03:53.850> Chi<00:03:53.880> some

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
okay so in this movement in Tai Chi some

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.390 
okay so in this movement in Tai Chi some
things<00:03:54.810> some<00:03:55.170> movements<00:03:55.680> follow<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.160> others

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
things some movements follow the others

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.130 
things some movements follow the others
and<00:03:56.670> others<00:03:56.940> don't<00:03:57.360> they<00:03:57.690> just<00:03:57.930> sort<00:03:58.049> of

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
and others don't they just sort of

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.740 
and others don't they just sort of
strung<00:03:58.920> together<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.670> we<00:04:00.120> make<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.360> little

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
strung together and we make a little

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.979 
strung together and we make a little
transition<00:04:01.350> just<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:02.610> so<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:03.390> this<00:04:03.569> is<00:04:03.750> one

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
transition just just so so this is one

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.559 
transition just just so so this is one
of<00:04:04.170> them<00:04:04.349> in<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:05.069> I've<00:04:05.519> just<00:04:05.790> come<00:04:06.120> from

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
of them in that I've just come from

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.160 
of them in that I've just come from
being<00:04:07.440> doing<00:04:08.190> something<00:04:08.549> over<00:04:08.640> here<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.599> now

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
being doing something over here so now

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.660 
being doing something over here so now
what<00:04:10.470> I'm<00:04:10.560> going<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.890> do<00:04:11.099> is<00:04:11.459> turn<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:13.670> come

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
what I'm going to do is turn and come

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.099 
what I'm going to do is turn and come
into<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.919> place<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:17.000> where<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.030> am<00:04:18.180> kind<00:04:19.019> of

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
into a place of where I am kind of

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:27.050 
into a place of where I am kind of
comfortable<00:04:19.560> facing<00:04:20.310> this<00:04:20.430> person<00:04:23.180> now<00:04:24.800> as<00:04:26.060> as

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
comfortable facing this person now as as

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.200 
comfortable facing this person now as as
I<00:04:27.360> turn<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:28.110> would<00:04:28.320> be<00:04:28.470> very<00:04:28.680> easy<00:04:29.030> for<00:04:30.030> me<00:04:30.180> to

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
I turn it would be very easy for me to

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.520 
I turn it would be very easy for me to
turn<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:31.530> far<00:04:31.890> if<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.820> let<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:35.100> hands<00:04:35.490> do<00:04:35.789> it

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
turn to far if I let the hands do it

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.850 
turn to far if I let the hands do it
what's<00:04:37.530> going<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.860> happen<00:04:38.250> here<00:04:41.570> is<00:04:42.570> as<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.020> turn

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
what's going to happen here is as I turn

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.820 
what's going to happen here is as I turn
to<00:04:44.340> face<00:04:44.610> him<00:04:45.020> this<00:04:46.020> route<00:04:48.410> if<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:49.500> can<00:04:49.680> look

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
to face him this route if you can look

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.510 
to face him this route if you can look
at<00:04:49.979> this<00:04:50.190> foot<00:04:50.610> here<00:04:50.960> this<00:04:51.960> right<00:04:52.200> foot<00:04:52.470> as<00:04:52.889> I

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
at this foot here this right foot as I

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.110 
at this foot here this right foot as I
turn<00:04:54.470> this<00:04:55.470> foot<00:04:56.780> becomes<00:04:57.780> very<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.620> heel

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
turn this foot becomes very the heel

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.620 
turn this foot becomes very the heel
becomes<00:05:00.120> very<00:05:00.570> solid

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.530 

at<00:05:05.720> the<00:05:06.320> same<00:05:06.620> time<00:05:07.990> this<00:05:08.990> left<00:05:09.860> leg<00:05:10.540> becomes

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
at the same time this left leg becomes

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:20.050 
at the same time this left leg becomes
solid<00:05:15.430> so<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.730> if<00:05:17.720> I'm<00:05:17.960> coming<00:05:18.290> here<00:05:18.860> a<00:05:19.060> he

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
solid so that if I'm coming here a he

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.340 
solid so that if I'm coming here a he
could<00:05:20.300> pull<00:05:20.720> me<00:05:21.910> so<00:05:22.910> I<00:05:22.940> need<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.540> be<00:05:23.690> able<00:05:23.900> to

could pull me so I need to be able to

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.490 
could pull me so I need to be able to
deal<00:05:24.980> with<00:05:25.190> that<00:05:25.430> at<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.390> same<00:05:26.420> time<00:05:26.750> he<00:05:27.320> could

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
deal with that at the same time he could

push me and I need to be able to route

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:41.500 
push me and I need to be able to route
it<00:05:31.340> into<00:05:32.000> this<00:05:32.240> heel<00:05:35.380> so<00:05:36.380> as<00:05:36.710> I'm<00:05:37.340> turning<00:05:40.510> this

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
it into this heel so as I'm turning this

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.500 
it into this heel so as I'm turning this
is<00:05:41.870> saying<00:05:42.440> a<00:05:42.620> really<00:05:42.920> good<00:05:43.190> solid<00:05:43.670> connection

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.790 

because<00:05:47.510> I'm<00:05:47.750> turning<00:05:48.140> on<00:05:48.230> a<00:05:48.290> horizontal

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
because I'm turning on a horizontal

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.610 
because I'm turning on a horizontal
plane<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:52.280> energy<00:05:52.790> is<00:05:53.030> staying<00:05:53.510> in<00:05:53.810> my<00:05:54.050> Center

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
plane the energy is staying in my Center

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.970 
plane the energy is staying in my Center
it's<00:05:55.370> not<00:05:55.640> going<00:05:56.030> up<00:05:56.180> it's<00:05:56.810> not<00:05:57.020> going<00:05:57.350> down

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
it's not going up it's not going down

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.700 
it's not going up it's not going down
the<00:05:58.400> horizontal<00:05:59.180> plane<00:05:59.330> that<00:05:59.720> Don<00:06:00.050> Tian<00:06:00.440> is

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
the horizontal plane that Don Tian is

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.350 
the horizontal plane that Don Tian is
revolving<00:06:02.620> my<00:06:03.620> Don<00:06:03.920> Tian<00:06:04.310> is<00:06:04.520> revolving

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
revolving my Don Tian is revolving

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:14.520 
revolving my Don Tian is revolving
around<00:06:05.890> like<00:06:06.890> so

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.710 

this<00:06:15.530> is<00:06:15.710> solid<00:06:15.920> and<00:06:16.340> this<00:06:16.460> asada<00:06:16.820> okay<00:06:17.210> let's

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
this is solid and this asada okay let's

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.430 
this is solid and this asada okay let's
say<00:06:17.990> he<00:06:18.020> were<00:06:18.560> to<00:06:18.890> then<00:06:19.220> push<00:06:19.700> me<00:06:20.110> but<00:06:21.110> to<00:06:21.260> hands

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
say he were to then push me but to hands

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.210 
say he were to then push me but to hands
he<00:06:21.560> could<00:06:21.710> push<00:06:21.920> me<00:06:22.070> to<00:06:22.220> answer

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
he could push me to answer

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.940 
he could push me to answer
no<00:06:26.020> it'd<00:06:27.020> be<00:06:27.170> very<00:06:27.200> easy<00:06:27.500> to<00:06:27.860> get<00:06:28.370> pushed<00:06:28.820> off

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
no it'd be very easy to get pushed off

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.430 
no it'd be very easy to get pushed off
the<00:06:30.950> shifting<00:06:31.550> of<00:06:31.850> this<00:06:32.330> weight<00:06:32.660> very<00:06:32.960> easy<00:06:33.170> to

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
the shifting of this weight very easy to

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.160 
the shifting of this weight very easy to
get<00:06:33.590> shift<00:06:33.920> pushed<00:06:34.670> off<00:06:34.910> so<00:06:35.750> what's<00:06:35.960> going<00:06:36.140> to

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
get shift pushed off so what's going to

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.380 
get shift pushed off so what's going to
happen<00:06:36.230> here<00:06:36.830> is<00:06:36.920> I<00:06:37.460> am<00:06:37.550> going<00:06:37.790> to<00:06:38.060> neutralize

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
happen here is I am going to neutralize

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:45.910 
happen here is I am going to neutralize
him<00:06:39.200> down<00:06:42.100> at<00:06:43.100> the<00:06:43.280> same<00:06:43.520> time<00:06:44.470> this<00:06:45.470> leg<00:06:45.740> is

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:45.920 
him down at the same time this leg is

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:52.200 
him down at the same time this leg is
going<00:06:45.980> to<00:06:46.220> fill

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.480 

this<00:06:52.660> hip<00:06:53.050> is<00:06:53.259> going<00:06:53.380> to<00:06:53.620> cause<00:06:54.039> going<00:06:54.400> to

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
this hip is going to cause going to

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:01.100 
this hip is going to cause going to
gather<00:06:54.699> energy

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.480 

and<00:07:02.970> this<00:07:03.970> hand<00:07:04.450> is<00:07:04.720> going<00:07:04.780> to<00:07:05.080> fill<00:07:05.350> as<00:07:06.070> this

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
and this hand is going to fill as this

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:12.720 
and this hand is going to fill as this
side<00:07:06.790> empties<00:07:09.870> this<00:07:10.870> side<00:07:11.169> fills<00:07:11.530> so<00:07:12.520> that<00:07:12.700> I

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730 
side empties this side fills so that I

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:18.350 
side empties this side fills so that I
just<00:07:13.060> don't<00:07:13.980> go<00:07:14.980> this<00:07:15.220> way<00:07:15.460> I<00:07:15.760> need<00:07:16.690> to<00:07:16.840> have

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
just don't go this way I need to have

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:30.590 
just don't go this way I need to have
this<00:07:19.360> balance<00:07:25.950> okay<00:07:27.270> now<00:07:28.440> the<00:07:29.440> energy<00:07:29.650> is<00:07:30.160> now

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:30.600 
this balance okay now the energy is now
