00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
though I phone I'll actually show you

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.990 
though I phone I'll actually show you
that<00:01:51.960> here<00:01:52.259> right<00:01:52.470> now<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.640> see

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
that here right now but you can see

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.760 
that here right now but you can see
there's<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.450> new<00:01:54.600> dock<00:01:54.869> connector<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
there's the new dock connector there and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.370 
there's the new dock connector there and
if<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.909> look<00:01:57.090> very<00:01:57.119> closely<00:01:57.570> which<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.259> might

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
if you look very closely which you might

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.770 
if you look very closely which you might
not<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.649> able<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.829> see<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.250> video<00:01:59.780> but

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
not be able to see in this video but

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.380 
not be able to see in this video but
there's<00:02:00.990> only<00:02:01.110> pins<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:01.890> side<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:03.000> that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
there's only pins on one side so that

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.800 
there's only pins on one side so that
allows<00:02:04.040> this<00:02:05.040> connector<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.969> go<00:02:06.630> right

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
allows this connector to just go right

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.680 
allows this connector to just go right
into<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.259> jack<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.300> go<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.450> either<00:02:09.569> direction

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
into the jack and go in either direction

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.530 
into the jack and go in either direction
kind<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.530> your<00:02:10.649> car<00:02:10.860> keys<00:02:11.120> nowadays<00:02:12.120> so

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
kind of like your car keys nowadays so

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.270 
kind of like your car keys nowadays so
there<00:02:13.470> we<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.830> that's

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
there we have it that's

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.820 
there we have it that's
the<00:02:14.370> brand-new<00:02:14.910> 8-pin<00:02:15.840> what<00:02:16.319> they<00:02:16.440> call<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
the brand-new 8-pin what they call the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.510 
the brand-new 8-pin what they call the
lightning<00:02:17.280> connector<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.950> looks<00:02:19.950> good<00:02:20.250> works

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
lightning connector and looks good works

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.940 
lightning connector and looks good works
great<00:02:20.910> it's<00:02:21.540> got<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> nice<00:02:22.050> tight<00:02:22.410> fit<00:02:22.440> I'll

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
that needs the larger connector or an

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.410 
that needs the larger connector or an
