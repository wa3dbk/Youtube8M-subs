00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
you guys are my predictions for what I

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.970 
you guys are my predictions for what I
think<00:00:02.639> are<00:00:02.879> going<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.629> be<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.810> top<00:00:04.020> toxic<00:00:04.529> format

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
think are going to be a top toxic format

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.490 
think are going to be a top toxic format
this<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.819> just<00:00:05.910> my<00:00:06.089> opinion<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.810> it's<00:00:07.350> pretty

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
this is just my opinion and it's pretty

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.049 
this is just my opinion and it's pretty
much<00:00:07.620> based<00:00:08.040> off<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.429> theory<00:00:09.320> so<00:00:10.320> yeah<00:00:11.059> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
much based off of a theory so yeah the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.060 
much based off of a theory so yeah the
first<00:00:12.269> step<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.660> Twilight<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.380> think<00:00:13.920> that's

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
first step is Twilight I think that's

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.180 
first step is Twilight I think that's
going<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.280> be<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> very<00:00:14.549> good<00:00:15.500> deck<00:00:16.500> next<00:00:16.680> format

this<00:02:25.200> tyvek<00:02:25.530> um<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:26.340> don't<00:02:27.240> think<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:28.920> tier

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
this tyvek um I don't think this is tier

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.430 
this tyvek um I don't think this is tier
one<00:02:29.520> but<00:02:29.820> who<00:02:30.630> knows<00:02:30.780> my<00:02:31.620> next<00:02:31.950> song<00:02:32.100> bees<00:02:32.280> um

with<00:02:34.440> pain<00:02:34.710> painter<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.310> think<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:35.910> could<00:02:36.180> be

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
with pain painter I think this could be

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.500 
with pain painter I think this could be
a<00:02:36.330> potential<00:02:36.870> tier<00:02:37.080> 1<00:02:37.290> deck<00:02:38.210> and<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.300> could

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
a potential tier 1 deck and you could

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.180 
a potential tier 1 deck and you could
also<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:40.380> change<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.430> Twilight<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:43.190> who

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
also just change it to Twilight so who

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.190 
also just change it to Twilight so who
knows<00:02:44.340> um<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.300> could<00:02:45.450> exceed<00:02:45.750> along<00:02:46.050> with

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
knows um and you could exceed along with

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.960 
knows um and you could exceed along with
this<00:02:46.320> without<00:02:47.570> dog<00:02:48.570> exceed<00:02:49.580> rulings<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.730> think

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
this without dog exceed rulings I think

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.040 
this without dog exceed rulings I think
