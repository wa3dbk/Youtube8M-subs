00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.580
 wonderful well just awesome so 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.309

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.500
 prompted today I tried and you 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.080
 Know not regretted and you can 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.930
 imagine that this is the amount of juice 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.619
 yes here is almost five liters four with 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.500
 half a liter that's just needed for 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.240
 this 2 oranges 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.660
 you probably will not believe it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.540
 nonsense, it can not possibly be as we 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.540
 and you think that here we drink to the store 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.190
 we buy in packs like this 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:48.600
 just need 2 oranges but let's 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.700
 order to cook by 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.160
 This recipe is up to date. 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.320
 orange juice which will be 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.809
 It is written here if you pack it in a pack 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.370
 one hundred percent will be written 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.949
 orange juice in because a hundred 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.890
 percent oranges there is truth and 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.619
 only two but he's pretty good 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:14.420
 juice is obtained here take two oranges 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:16.650
 boiled water kettle and oranges 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.720
 doused before doused 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.210
 boiled water poured boiled water 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.150
 ki rather hot boiling water from for what 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.250
 in order to first wash it 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.600
 here is this paraffin on which it is possible 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.509
 as if covering and remove bitterness 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.000
 then place the orange in 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.860
 a freezer but about two hours but not 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 less than two hours here they will freeze 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.509
 for which again for the same reason 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.020
 to remove the bitterness from the rind then 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:00.180
 take them out of the freezer and the meat grinder 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 well cut to pieces right along with 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.469
 skinned with all the seeds and stuff and in 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.890
 and in this meat grinder missed through 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.890
 meat grinder 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.560
 then poured took half a liter 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.510
 boiled water on the already cooled well, warm 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.070
 still can be there so here not hi not boiling water 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.220
 in short, they poured this one 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:32.860
 gruel yes that's poured a half and a half 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:35.880
 liters of water here further brew from 10 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:42.370
 before half an hour in general does not hurt and 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:46.120
 half an hour and 10 minutes then filtered through 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.520
 This colander is all that happened 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.300
 it then took the marlechka there still pressed 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.320
 squeezed all the leftovers and you got 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.730
 much more than one and a half liters of juice 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:04.290
 then take two and a half liters 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:08.530
 boiled water and pour 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.000
 pour out the same juice later 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:16.870
 Throw a packet of citric acid 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.540
 Here is such a 15 grams for this amount 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.180
 15 grams although it is of course individually 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.700
 to taste i'm not what i did before 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.720
 what the recipe told me here 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.730
 a pack of citric acid there and 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.150
 generally did not say need to throw there 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.950
 half a kilo of sugar but I would go there 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.840
 just threw such a mug 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:45.370
 sugar on this amount 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:50.470
 and then all this is mixed and you can 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.930
 so well, just to cool down well, someone 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.489
 Of course, as if warm is not very nice 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.340
 drink though here I drank warm fine 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:04.450
 shorter than cool and it turns out like this 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.600
 that's how here is in any 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:12.040
 the case is the same as the store here 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:16.060
 that what we drink from the store 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:20.020
 be well not the best but for the price 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.300
 it turns out well in general average normal 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.500
 store juice here I don't even know why 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.440
 it stands there 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:31.530
 in the store a liter pack probably 50 rubles 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:34.560
 ohm or 70 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:41.520
 probably citric acid 15 rubles 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:45.370
 grams here 250 300 sugar 2 oranges 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.530
 boiling water well and electricity to 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.860
 to boil 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.650
 but it turns out anyway more than 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.940
 two times cheaper than this juice to buy in 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.250
 here you see this optic shop 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.669
