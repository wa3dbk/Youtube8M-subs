00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello friends 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.780
 I wanted to show you today how 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.010
 change an hd or add another hd in 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.950
 your computer 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.960
 okay you need to do you take the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.100
 cover of your computer 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.970
 Your computer is fine 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.840
 before you tamper inside the computer. 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.080
 house puts your hands 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.380
 I'll be going to try to be the camera in the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.530
 hands at the office without ink to 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.520
 take static electricity pa 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.950
 good after you have done it now you can 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.410
 a boss inside your computer 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:53.489
 here this part I have my hd 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.789
 first you take the shovel 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.550
 I can take the h10 but before that I 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:06.930
 I wanted to show you two types of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:12.630
 entry is that hdt a guarantee the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:22.460
 entrance and entrance of Fatah that I go 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:25.110
 show now I'm going to take it out here and great 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.650
 toad input 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.640
 you first have to know what kind of 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.540
 hd your board bear 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.630
 if you have this type of input that 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.140
 I have here is this kind of input 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.479
 so it's idea you need to buy an HD 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.549
 eb 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.409
 if you have this type of input that 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.659
 I do not know if you can see entrance 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.970
 black small 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.920
 this one is sata pa then you go 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.649
 need a hapa sapa 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:04.320
 Okay, I wanted to talk about this too. 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.829
 For those who do not understand anything to not 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.590
 confuse this entry in the black with 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.860
 This entry from quihita aeb 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:18.600
 But this is the flop here. 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.900
 the old floppy disk that computers 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.770
 More oldest old had in a 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:34.890
 Computer is showing that you can not 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:39.230
 to err because here is the floppy floppy and 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:43.770
 hd and ta or dvd player 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:50.100
 the difference is so you can not go wrong 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:53.430
 Good, I'll leave it aside and we'll see it here. 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.130
 input that little fruity on the plate 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.950
 mother usually is written flop okay 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.209
 so it does not work, there's no way 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:08.100

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:10.830

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.510

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.930

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.570
 Motherboard supports both 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:34.019
