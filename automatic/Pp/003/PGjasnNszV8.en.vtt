now<00:00:26.570> let's<00:00:26.870> take<00:00:27.170> a<00:00:27.200> look<00:00:28.180> at<00:00:29.200> the<00:00:30.200> duck

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
now let's take a look at the duck

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.420 
now let's take a look at the duck
temperature<00:00:31.340> leaving<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.390> coil<00:00:33.129> now<00:00:34.129> let's

temperature leaving the coil now let's

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.729 
temperature leaving the coil now let's
look<00:00:34.640> at<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:35.149> evaporating<00:00:35.930> temperature<00:00:36.469> now

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
look at the evaporating temperature now

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.529

don't<00:00:38.839> have<00:00:39.050> that<00:00:39.320> gauge<00:00:39.649> hooked<00:00:40.640> up<00:00:42.460> but<00:00:43.460> the

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
don't have that gauge hooked up but the

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.910 
don't have that gauge hooked up but the

two<00:00:48.980> as<00:00:50.050> an<00:00:51.219> evaporating<00:00:52.390> temperature<00:00:54.069> so<00:00:55.069> we

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:55.429 
two as an evaporating temperature so we

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.299 
two as an evaporating temperature so we
are<00:00:55.609> below<00:00:55.999> dew<00:00:56.300> point<00:00:56.690> on<00:00:56.929> our<00:00:57.559> evaporating

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
the dew point at least the duck tempter

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.330 
the dew point at least the duck tempter
doesn't<00:01:17.180> show<00:01:17.360> I've<00:01:17.479> reached<00:01:17.719> a<00:01:17.960> new<00:01:18.110> point<00:01:18.380> so

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
doesn't show I've reached a new point so

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.840 
doesn't show I've reached a new point so
while<00:01:19.610> I'm<00:01:19.820> am<00:01:20.090> i<00:01:20.329> finessing<00:01:20.899> water<00:01:21.789> okay<00:01:22.789> you

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
while I'm am i finessing water okay you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.200 
while I'm am i finessing water okay you
can<00:01:23.210> see<00:01:23.509> we<00:01:24.380> do<00:01:24.619> have<00:01:24.649> condensate<00:01:25.610> draining

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
can see we do have condensate draining

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.069 
can see we do have condensate draining
out<00:01:26.360> of<00:01:26.509> this<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.020> we<00:01:27.229> are<00:01:27.259> condensing<00:01:28.130> water

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
out of this so we are condensing water

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.800 
out of this so we are condensing water
in<00:01:30.079> this<00:01:30.380> coil<00:01:30.759> so<00:01:31.759> now<00:01:32.030> we're<00:01:32.329> going<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.539> take

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
in this coil so now we're going to take

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.499 
in this coil so now we're going to take
a<00:01:32.840> look<00:01:33.200> at<00:01:33.530> an<00:01:34.219> indoor<00:01:34.670> coil

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
a look at an indoor coil

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.880 
a look at an indoor coil
remember<00:01:36.500> our<00:01:37.180> evaporating<00:01:38.180> temperature<00:01:38.899> was

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
remember our evaporating temperature was

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.670 
remember our evaporating temperature was
36<00:01:40.700> degrees

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
36 degrees

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.830 
36 degrees
okay<00:01:42.680> I'm<00:01:42.920> evaporating<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:43.880> thirty-six<00:01:44.420> that's

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
okay I'm evaporating a thirty-six that's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.719 
okay I'm evaporating a thirty-six that's
well<00:01:45.049> under<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.880> 41<00:01:46.880> dew<00:01:47.119> point<00:01:47.450> however

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
well under that 41 dew point however

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.899 
well under that 41 dew point however
virtually<00:01:49.729> no<00:01:50.090> part<00:01:50.570> of<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:51.350> coil<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:52.100> 36

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
virtually no part of this coil is 36

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.230 
virtually no part of this coil is 36
degrees<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:55.340> going<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.759> somewhere

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
degrees it's going to be somewhere

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.599 
degrees it's going to be somewhere
between<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.810> 36<00:01:57.770> degrees<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.439> the<00:02:00.609> supply

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
between the 36 degrees and the supply

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.399 
between the 36 degrees and the supply
air<00:02:01.909> temperature<00:02:02.210> which<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:02.929> think<00:02:03.140> was<00:02:03.259> about

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
air temperature which I think was about

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.580 
air temperature which I think was about
54<00:02:04.399> this<00:02:05.359> looked<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.689> little<00:02:05.780> closer<00:02:06.140> at<00:02:06.380> this

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
54 this looked a little closer at this

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.249 
54 this looked a little closer at this
coil<00:02:07.130> now<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.270> is<00:02:08.390> an<00:02:08.479> air<00:02:08.690> conditioning

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
coil now this is an air conditioning

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.699 
coil now this is an air conditioning
coil

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
coil

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.569 
coil
and<00:02:11.599> it<00:02:12.599> has<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.109> Finns<00:02:13.409> very<00:02:13.859> close<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.519> each

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
and it has the Finns very close to each

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.119 
and it has the Finns very close to each
other<00:02:15.349> you<00:02:16.670> can<00:02:17.670> see<00:02:17.969> they're<00:02:18.180> really<00:02:18.209> close

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
other you can see they're really close

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.660 
other you can see they're really close
okay<00:02:20.129> its<00:02:20.730> copper<00:02:21.209> tubes<00:02:21.510> inside<00:02:22.049> there<00:02:22.409> and

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
okay its copper tubes inside there and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.349 
okay its copper tubes inside there and
aluminum<00:02:23.670> fins

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
aluminum fins

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.020 
aluminum fins
now<00:02:25.109> the<00:02:25.170> fins<00:02:25.530> are<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:26.010> there<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.700> extend

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
now the fins are just there to extend

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.429 
now the fins are just there to extend
the<00:02:27.389> surface<00:02:27.689> area<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.650> coil<00:02:29.329> now<00:02:30.329> if<00:02:30.689> I

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
the surface area of the coil now if I

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.170 
the surface area of the coil now if I
took<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.889> temperature<00:02:32.579> of<00:02:34.579> this<00:02:35.579> tubing

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
took a temperature of this tubing

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.610 
took a temperature of this tubing
temperature<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:37.019> here

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
temperature in here

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.759 
temperature in here
perhaps<00:02:38.430> one<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.909> one<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.239> these<00:02:39.359> u-tube<00:02:40.109> bends

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
perhaps one to one of these u-tube bends

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.300 
perhaps one to one of these u-tube bends
I<00:02:40.950> would<00:02:41.790> get<00:02:41.939> a<00:02:41.969> closer<00:02:42.420> temperature<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:44.040> that

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
I would get a closer temperature to that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.509 
I would get a closer temperature to that
of<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:45.450> evaporating<00:02:46.230> temperature<00:02:46.799> because

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
of the evaporating temperature because

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.339 
of the evaporating temperature because
the<00:02:47.549> refrigerant<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.359> evaporating<00:02:49.139> right

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
the refrigerant is evaporating right

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.039 
the refrigerant is evaporating right
inside<00:02:49.859> and<00:02:50.250> all<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.849> has<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.180> do<00:02:51.359> is<00:02:51.480> travel

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
inside and all it has to do is travel

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.619 
inside and all it has to do is travel
through<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.430> thin<00:02:53.790> walled<00:02:54.030> copper<00:02:54.919> but<00:02:55.919> if

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
through the thin walled copper but if

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.649 
through the thin walled copper but if
you<00:02:57.629> look<00:02:57.840> at<00:02:57.959> these<00:02:58.139> fins<00:02:58.760> these<00:02:59.760> fins<00:02:59.819> can<00:03:00.510> be

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
you look at these fins these fins can be

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.649 
you look at these fins these fins can be
all<00:03:00.900> sorts<00:03:01.409> of<00:03:01.469> different<00:03:01.650> temperatures<00:03:02.659> the

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
all sorts of different temperatures the

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.409 
all sorts of different temperatures the
closer<00:03:03.959> they<00:03:04.290> are<00:03:04.319> to<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.709> pipe<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.879> colder

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
closer they are to the pipe the colder

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.390 
closer they are to the pipe the colder
they're<00:03:06.569> going<00:03:06.719> to<00:03:06.780> be<00:03:06.959> but<00:03:07.889> because<00:03:08.219> they're

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
they're going to be but because they're

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.459 
they're going to be but because they're
transferring<00:03:09.120> heat<00:03:09.389> they're<00:03:09.959> going<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.169> warm

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
transferring heat they're going to warm

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.039 
transferring heat they're going to warm
as<00:03:10.859> they<00:03:11.069> get<00:03:11.310> farther<00:03:11.669> away<00:03:12.030> from<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.629> tubing

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
as they get farther away from the tubing

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.409 
as they get farther away from the tubing
you<00:03:13.919> have<00:03:14.159> all<00:03:14.430> sorts<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.209> different

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
you have all sorts of different

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.460 
you have all sorts of different
temperatures<00:03:16.760> going<00:03:17.760> through<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.269> coil<00:03:18.629> you

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
temperatures going through this coil you

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.460 
temperatures going through this coil you
know<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.739> this<00:03:20.129> coil<00:03:20.430> changes<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:21.599> lot<00:03:21.959> 20

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
know this this coil changes a lot 20

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.409 
know this this coil changes a lot 20
degrees<00:03:22.859> well<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:23.699> will<00:03:23.940> drop<00:03:24.209> the

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
degrees well it will drop the

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.319 
degrees well it will drop the
temperature<00:03:24.810> about<00:03:24.989> 20<00:03:25.290> degrees<00:03:25.349> and<00:03:26.329> so

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
temperature about 20 degrees and so

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.000 
temperature about 20 degrees and so
different<00:03:27.810> points<00:03:28.229> in<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.439> coil<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:28.889> all

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
different points in this coil it's all

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.949 
different points in this coil it's all
going<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.459> be<00:03:29.579> all<00:03:29.819> sorts<00:03:30.389> of<00:03:30.629> different

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
going to be all sorts of different

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.770 
going to be all sorts of different
temperatures<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.739> at<00:03:32.340> different<00:03:32.659> parts<00:03:33.659> of

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
temperatures and at different parts of

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.890 
temperatures and at different parts of
the<00:03:33.900> fins<00:03:35.269> there<00:03:36.269> will<00:03:36.419> be<00:03:36.449> different

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
the fins there will be different

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.129 
the fins there will be different
temperatures<00:03:37.409> so<00:03:38.129> what<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:38.760> result<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:39.449> very

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
temperatures so what the result is very

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.869 
temperatures so what the result is very
simple<00:03:40.769> is<00:03:42.229> you'll<00:03:43.229> be<00:03:43.470> condensing<00:03:44.220> on<00:03:44.400> areas

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
simple is you'll be condensing on areas

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.749 
simple is you'll be condensing on areas
like<00:03:44.909> this<00:03:45.560> because<00:03:46.560> these<00:03:46.739> are<00:03:46.949> closer<00:03:47.310> and

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:47.759 
like this because these are closer and

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:51.319 
like this because these are closer and
probably<00:03:48.180> below<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:49.620> dew<00:03:49.859> point<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:51.120> they

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
probably below the dew point so they

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.149 
probably below the dew point so they
will<00:03:51.629> actually<00:03:52.409> condense<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.009> you'll

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
will actually condense and you'll

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.179 
will actually condense and you'll
usually<00:03:53.519> see<00:03:53.729> water<00:03:54.389> on<00:03:54.720> these<00:03:54.989> things<00:03:55.349> as<00:03:55.530> you

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
usually see water on these things as you

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.920 
usually see water on these things as you
get<00:03:56.340> into<00:03:56.699> the<00:03:56.819> passes<00:03:57.359> and<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.689> fins

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
get into the passes and the fins

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.140 
get into the passes and the fins
themselves<00:03:58.620> these<00:03:59.579> are<00:03:59.819> going<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.030> be

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
themselves these are going to be

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.569 
themselves these are going to be
progressively<00:04:00.900> warmer<00:04:01.259> and<00:04:01.680> will<00:04:01.949> not<00:04:02.129> have

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
progressively warmer and will not have

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.949 
progressively warmer and will not have
any<00:04:02.879> condensate<00:04:03.569> on<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:04.009> so<00:04:05.689> sometimes<00:04:06.689> we<00:04:06.870> get

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
any condensate on it so sometimes we get

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.839 
any condensate on it so sometimes we get
a<00:04:07.019> lot<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.319> condensate<00:04:08.009> sometimes<00:04:08.519> we<00:04:08.669> get<00:04:08.790> a

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
a lot of condensate sometimes we get a

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.469 
a lot of condensate sometimes we get a
little<00:04:08.939> bit<00:04:09.299> of<00:04:09.419> condensate<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:12.030> amount<00:04:12.389> of

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479 
little bit of condensate the amount of

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.990 
little bit of condensate the amount of
condensate<00:04:13.109> is<00:04:13.319> generally<00:04:14.250> B<00:04:14.519> if<00:04:14.729> you're

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
condensate is generally B if you're

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.810 
condensate is generally B if you're
using<00:04:15.180> same<00:04:15.599> coil<00:04:15.870> same<00:04:16.289> fan<00:04:16.560> speed<00:04:16.889> the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
using same coil same fan speed the

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.019 
using same coil same fan speed the
amount<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.989> condensate<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:20.010> going<00:04:20.669> to<00:04:20.729> depend

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:21.029 
amount of condensate is going to depend

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.230 
amount of condensate is going to depend
on<00:04:21.209> relative<00:04:21.779> humidity<00:04:22.409> simply<00:04:23.310> because<00:04:23.700> more

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
on relative humidity simply because more

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.620 
on relative humidity simply because more
of<00:04:24.270> this<00:04:24.630> coil<00:04:25.110> will<00:04:26.010> be<00:04:26.279> below<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.360> dew<00:04:27.840> point

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
of this coil will be below the dew point

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.629 
of this coil will be below the dew point
like<00:04:30.630> if<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:30.870> have<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.110> lower<00:04:31.469> relative<00:04:31.710> humidity

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
like if I have a lower relative humidity

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.790 
like if I have a lower relative humidity
a<00:04:32.849> lot<00:04:33.330> of<00:04:33.450> this<00:04:33.570> coil<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:34.139> going<00:04:34.349> to<00:04:34.409> be<00:04:34.560> above

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
a lot of this coil is going to be above

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.649 
a lot of this coil is going to be above
the<00:04:34.979> dew<00:04:35.130> point<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.669> will<00:04:35.849> condense<00:04:36.180> nothing

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
the dew point and will condense nothing

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.620 
the dew point and will condense nothing
but<00:04:37.500> if<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.710> have<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:37.950> very<00:04:38.340> high<00:04:38.700> dew<00:04:39.270> point

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
but if I have a very high dew point

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.959 
but if I have a very high dew point
close<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.529> ambient<00:04:41.039> temperature<00:04:41.279> or<00:04:41.580> high

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969 
close to the ambient temperature or high

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:45.680 
close to the ambient temperature or high
relative<00:04:42.570> humidity<00:04:42.889> then<00:04:43.889> more<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.580> this<00:04:44.849> will

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
relative humidity then more of this will

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.420 
relative humidity then more of this will
be<00:04:45.900> condensing<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.680> you'll<00:04:46.830> condense<00:04:47.219> more

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
be condensing and you'll condense more

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.699 
be condensing and you'll condense more
water
