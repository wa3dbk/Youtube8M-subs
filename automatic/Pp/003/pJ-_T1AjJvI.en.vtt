doing at the time i ended up freshman
year<00:03:05.640> with<00:03:05.880> i<00:03:06.090> think<00:03:06.270> like<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.420> 3.8<00:03:07.380> GPA<00:03:07.740> which

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
year with i think like a 3.8 GPA which

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.310 
year with i think like a 3.8 GPA which
is<00:03:08.070> kind<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.700> bad<00:03:08.910> because<00:03:09.270> i've<00:03:09.780> been<00:03:09.840> told

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
is kind of bad because i've been told

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.500 
is kind of bad because i've been told
and<00:03:10.860> for<00:03:11.160> my<00:03:11.250> experiences<00:03:11.790> i'm<00:03:12.000> pretty<00:03:12.330> sure

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
and for my experiences i'm pretty sure

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.270 
and for my experiences i'm pretty sure
that<00:03:12.540> freshman<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.620> easiest<00:03:13.920> year<00:03:14.130> in

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
