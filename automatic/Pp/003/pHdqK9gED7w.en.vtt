00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 and you are still lord sir in acquaintances 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.370
 Argentines and now we are with the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.890
 sweet potato garnish a sweet potato 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.530
 ante directly grasps the lavas 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.809
 well washed and without the need to peel them 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.360
 which is perhaps the most problematic 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.490
 he has because he has all the little hand 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:23.100
 stained the short 100 slices of 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.350
 cassette types and then then the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.289
 Put a little oil well 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.539
 On the side isolated, he loves worshiping 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.329
 game pretty soft first so that 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.610
 take a nice tan color and then 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.040
 we're going to put a good 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.950
 amount of broth and they are going to finish 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.469
 cook in the broth then remember 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.750
 first dora and then we're going to 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.270
 cover with lime now we are giving 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.100
 turns to gold or be 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.469
 same side and side and on the other hand 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.480
 you will see that to my right here I have 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.789
 another pan or cacerolita to make the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.270
 sauce so let's start the sauce 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.730
 how we ripped it out first the pan 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.619
 the pan the crazy pot that you 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.869
 have put it over the fire and it does 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.260
 heat then once it is each 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.170
 day 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.080
 you throw the sugar like that and the idea is to make 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.120
 a candy yes lady a candy no 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.720
 too burned you know that if the 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.550
 sugar burns too much loses the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.040
 sweetener I want to make a 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.220
 blond candy therefore in the hand 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.770
 I have the doubts while I see how it 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.740
 is generating that candy that is going 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.170
 Toasting that does not get too 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.590
 I have orange juice when I eat 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.229
 you then see that the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.930
 candy you throw the juice of 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.280
 orange as to lower the temperature 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.550
 immediately that candy is 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.520
 vitrify look how good is there 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.729
 it does not matter what's left there and it's going to 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.100
 Dissolve in the heat at the temperature 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.830
 of the orange juice was our 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.810
 I keep finishing up adding everything 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.290
 the orange cube logically that to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.170
 this aside you have to add a little 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.179
 of ketchup sauce a spoonful and a 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.760
 A little more must be worked on 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.020
 little is ideal with a beater cited 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.170
 because it generates brun 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.620
 so that it dissolves perfectly 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.240
 salsita is what we like so much 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.760
 of tomatoes and if you do not put a little bit of 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.820
 canned tomato or a little tomato 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.430
 this pureed form the matter is that 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.010
 dissolves well remember and I repeat 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.590
 sugar some candy but for that 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.170
 it has to be total good to the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.750
 cacerolita tu ta ta your calentita 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.180
 there the orange juice and the ketchup and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.740
 let's go with salt and let's go with ground chili 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.960
 because if he has orange juice I 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.670
 I want to give it a contrast of itch to 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.610
 that this is not the idea of ​​a sauce 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.020
 a dessert saw this is going to accompany a 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.420
 meat that is baked that has a 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.490
 oil filling a bacon and onion 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.140
 of green and that I did not tell him I do not know if 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.720
 He saw because I think I ate it 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.510
 I told him tried with mustard or be 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.910
 which is a flavor pump we put salt 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.100
 we put you here ground we have this for 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.620
 another side well golden our cows 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.400
 or sweet potato or sweet potato as it says in 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.829
 different places of america 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.650
 now let's cover with the broth a 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.110
 broth there directly so that it 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.269
 finish cooking in the broth then 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.360
 the sweet potato although it seems super super 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.250
 hard is faster to cook than the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.840
 papa although it seems very hard in the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.310
 time to peel it and others but when 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.470
 wash kitchens and cook faster than 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.510
 papa so keep not leave her not 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.040
 I want to make this a puree I want 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.530
 they are golden I want them to be tender 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.840
 but that they are not undone with respect 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.790
 to the sauce remember the caramel the juice 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.310
 orange salt pepper if you want 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.599
 the ketchup and what is missing me 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.909
 put a nose a pepper that you 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.370
 directly when you have it can be 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.440
 colorado can be green you grab it 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.510
 he pricks it with a stick of over brooches 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.450
 that has ximena and deposits it 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.829
 directly on the stove 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.230
 literally what most has them that 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.000
 to be bold with the black shoe is going 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.950
 turning so he put black black 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.750
 black you say but you are crazy you are 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.639
 burning them and I'm burning it knows 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.380
 that you have them more does not matter because a 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.170
 Once it is well burned it grabs it 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.620
 I put in a bag I let it concentrate 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.200
 condensate heat see it and then in 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.080
 matter of a minute I pass it by the 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.610
 cold tap water and peel 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.420
 absolutely once it is pegadito 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.340
 then you have it cooked tenderly and very 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.600
 okay, smoked anita 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.680
 so what remains for us to do is 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.680
 we go to vision 7 and then we go back
