the<00:01:33.060> advantages<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.530> weight<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.460> is

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the advantages of the weight of it is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.139 
the advantages of the weight of it is
that<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:37.049> dog<00:01:37.320> or<00:01:37.770> cat<00:01:38.310> can't<00:01:38.670> move<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.060> around

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
that the dog or cat can't move it around

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.380 
that the dog or cat can't move it around
as<00:01:39.810> quickly<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.500> mean<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.549> doesn't<00:01:41.880> budge<00:01:42.210> at

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
as quickly I mean it doesn't budge at

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.240 
as quickly I mean it doesn't budge at
all<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.929> can<00:01:43.109> see<00:01:43.289> as<00:01:43.439> she's<00:01:43.710> eating<00:01:44.100> and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
all as you can see as she's eating and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.889 
all as you can see as she's eating and
changing<00:01:44.670> her<00:01:44.789> direction<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.570> stuff<00:01:45.780> like

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
changing her direction and stuff like

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:54.380 
changing her direction and stuff like
that<00:01:46.189> and<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:50.780> lot<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:52.579> cat<00:01:53.579> owners<00:01:53.609> have<00:01:54.090> also

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that and a lot of cat owners have also

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.810 
that and a lot of cat owners have also
talked<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.719> me<00:01:54.840> about<00:01:54.960> how<00:01:55.859> their<00:01:56.189> cat<00:01:56.490> knocks

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
talked to me about how their cat knocks

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.819 
talked to me about how their cat knocks
over<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.179> bowl<00:01:57.479> or<00:01:57.749> the<00:01:57.899> dog<00:01:58.109> knocks<00:01:58.439> over<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
over the bowl or the dog knocks over the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.679 
over the bowl or the dog knocks over the
bowl<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.549> you<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.450> kind<00:02:00.659> of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
bowl so if you have that kind of

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.810 
bowl so if you have that kind of
situation<00:02:00.929> with<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> water<00:02:01.770> bowl<00:02:02.070> for<00:02:02.340> example

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
situation with a water bowl for example

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.419 
situation with a water bowl for example
and<00:02:02.999> you<00:02:03.030> get<00:02:03.210> sick<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.570> cleaning<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:04.429> knocked

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
and you get sick of cleaning up knocked

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.069 
and you get sick of cleaning up knocked
over<00:02:05.729> water<00:02:05.939> bowls<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.570> also<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.899> great

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
over water bowls this is also a great

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.160 
over water bowls this is also a great
solution<00:02:07.499> for<00:02:07.859> that<00:02:07.890> because<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.170> weight

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
solution for that because of the weight

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.580 
solution for that because of the weight
of<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.590> it's<00:02:10.890> very<00:02:11.220> difficult

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
of it it's very difficult

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.390 
of it it's very difficult
knock<00:02:12.769> over<00:02:13.239> unless<00:02:14.239> they're<00:02:14.629> very<00:02:14.959> talented

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.800

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
we're in other words are some cats that

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.740 
we're in other words are some cats that
have<00:05:34.280> issues<00:05:34.729> with<00:05:34.910> their<00:05:35.060> whiskers<00:05:35.419> being

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
have issues with their whiskers being

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.260 
have issues with their whiskers being
touched<00:05:36.110> when<00:05:36.380> they<00:05:36.530> eat<00:05:37.160> food<00:05:37.490> out<00:05:37.760> of<00:05:37.789> a<00:05:38.060> bowl

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
touched when they eat food out of a bowl

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.950 
touched when they eat food out of a bowl
so<00:05:39.080> a<00:05:39.110> lot<00:05:39.349> of<00:05:39.380> people<00:05:40.419> feed<00:05:41.419> them<00:05:41.510> on<00:05:41.660> plates

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
so a lot of people feed them on plates

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.659 
so a lot of people feed them on plates
and<00:05:42.169> that<00:05:42.260> sort<00:05:42.470> of<00:05:42.530> thing<00:05:42.590> but<00:05:42.860> then<00:05:43.099> you<00:05:43.430> have

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
and that sort of thing but then you have

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.050 
and that sort of thing but then you have
a<00:05:43.700> whole<00:05:44.030> new<00:05:44.240> mess<00:05:44.479> in<00:05:44.750> that<00:05:44.930> situation<00:05:45.289> and

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
a whole new mess in that situation and

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.620 
a whole new mess in that situation and
so<00:05:47.200> the<00:05:48.200> the<00:05:48.650> deluxe<00:05:49.099> might<00:05:49.310> be<00:05:49.610> a<00:05:49.970> better

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
so the the deluxe might be a better

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.969 
so the the deluxe might be a better
solution<00:05:51.729> for<00:05:52.729> a<00:05:52.760> whisker<00:05:53.210> problem<00:05:53.630> cat<00:05:53.979> just
