00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
we have data now which suggests that

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.110 
we have data now which suggests that

they take it into adulthood what is the

outcome low self-esteem stigmatization

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.990 
outcome low self-esteem stigmatization
it<00:01:09.869> interferes<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:11.369> personal

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it interferes with personal

it interferes with personal
relationships<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.860> work<00:01:14.159> environment<00:01:14.729> so

relationships the work environment so

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.740 
relationships the work environment so
looking<00:01:16.560> at<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.100> psychological<00:01:17.750> component

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
looking at the psychological component

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.560 
looking at the psychological component
of<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.020> disease<00:01:19.610> quality<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.640> life<00:01:20.759> studies

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
of this disease quality of life studies

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.960 
of this disease quality of life studies
I<00:01:21.810> think<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.740> important<00:01:23.580> for

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
I think it is so important for

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
I think it is so important for
dermatologist<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.080> cognizant<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.860> these

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
dermatologist to be cognizant of these

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.030 
dermatologist to be cognizant of these
issues<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:28.110> become<00:01:28.470> much<00:01:28.979> more

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
issues so that we become much more

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.690 
issues so that we become much more
aggressive<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:29.909> treating<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.630> disease<00:01:30.810> as

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
aggressive in treating the disease as

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.090 
aggressive in treating the disease as
well<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:33.030> being<00:01:33.390> willing<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.439> refer<00:01:34.920> these

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
well as being willing to refer these

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.950 
well as being willing to refer these
patients<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.759> for<00:01:36.390> psychological

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
patients out for psychological

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960 
patients out for psychological
counseling<00:01:37.829> when<00:01:37.979> appropriate<00:01:38.549> which

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
counseling when appropriate which

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.630 
counseling when appropriate which
therapies<00:01:39.600> think<00:01:39.869> about<00:01:40.110> problems

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
therapies think about problems

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.550

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
future there is an enormous amount of

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.460 
future there is an enormous amount of
data<00:01:45.320> now<00:01:45.770> on<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.400> role<00:01:46.729> of<00:01:46.760> oxidative<00:01:47.470> stress

we're<00:01:54.560> how<00:01:54.920> will<00:01:55.159> this<00:01:55.310> translate<00:01:55.670> for

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
we're how will this translate for

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.950 
we're how will this translate for
treatment<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.490> think<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:58.550> we<00:01:58.880> will<00:01:59.119> begin<00:01:59.330> to

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
treatment I think that we will begin to

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.609 
treatment I think that we will begin to
look<00:02:00.380> at<00:02:00.759> studies<00:02:01.759> addressing<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:03.350> role<00:02:03.590> of

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
look at studies addressing the role of

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.219 
look at studies addressing the role of
nutrition<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.700> one<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.540> things<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:06.110> I

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
nutrition and one of the things that I

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.169 
nutrition and one of the things that I
will<00:02:06.500> address<00:02:06.830> in<00:02:07.159> my<00:02:07.310> lecture<00:02:07.759> I'll<00:02:07.880> talk<00:02:08.149> a

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
will address in my lecture I'll talk a

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.510 
will address in my lecture I'll talk a
little<00:02:08.479> bit<00:02:08.750> more<00:02:08.959> about<00:02:09.130> oxidative<00:02:10.130> stress

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
little bit more about oxidative stress

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.479 
little bit more about oxidative stress
and<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.000> importance<00:02:11.690> of<00:02:11.959> nutrition<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:13.040> being

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
and the importance of nutrition in being

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.790 
and the importance of nutrition in being
able<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:14.090> deal<00:02:14.390> with<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:14.930> aspect<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.709> the
