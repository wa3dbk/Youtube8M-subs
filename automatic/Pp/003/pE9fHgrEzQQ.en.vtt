what they used to do in the old days

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.220 
what they used to do in the old days
before<00:00:22.189> there<00:00:22.310> was<00:00:22.430> canning<00:00:22.880> is<00:00:23.079> string<00:00:24.079> up

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
before there was canning is string up

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.990 
before there was canning is string up
the<00:00:24.380> beans<00:00:24.560> on<00:00:24.919> a<00:00:24.950> string<00:00:25.430> and<00:00:25.610> hang<00:00:25.790> them<00:00:25.939> to

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
the beans on a string and hang them to

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.150 
the beans on a string and hang them to
dry<00:00:26.149> and<00:00:26.660> then<00:00:27.079> they<00:00:27.200> could<00:00:27.470> rehydrate<00:00:28.040> them

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
dry and then they could rehydrate them

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.650 
dry and then they could rehydrate them
or<00:00:28.340> you<00:00:28.730> know<00:00:28.820> put<00:00:29.000> them<00:00:29.119> in<00:00:29.210> stews<00:00:29.480> or

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
or you know put them in stews or

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.089 
or you know put them in stews or
whatever<00:00:29.930> during<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.470> winter<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:30.829> they

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
whatever during the winter and they

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.430 
whatever during the winter and they
they'd<00:00:31.399> be<00:00:31.460> fine<00:00:31.790> now<00:00:32.390> I<00:00:32.419> tried<00:00:32.780> this<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:33.290> this

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
they'd be fine now I tried this and this

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.370 
they'd be fine now I tried this and this
is<00:00:33.620> what<00:00:33.770> I've<00:00:33.890> got<00:00:34.100> here<00:00:34.489> I<00:00:34.840> strung<00:00:35.840> my<00:00:36.140> green

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
is what I've got here I strung my green

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.560 
is what I've got here I strung my green
beans<00:00:36.590> up<00:00:37.100> on<00:00:37.309> a<00:00:37.340> string<00:00:37.760> and<00:00:38.000> they've<00:00:38.420> been

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
beans up on a string and they've been

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.299 
beans up on a string and they've been
hanging<00:00:38.750> for<00:00:38.960> about<00:00:39.289> two<00:00:39.500> weeks<00:00:39.710> now<00:00:39.859> and

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
hanging for about two weeks now and

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.819 
hanging for about two weeks now and
they're<00:00:41.030> there's<00:00:41.390> gaps<00:00:41.660> in<00:00:41.929> the<00:00:42.050> string<00:00:42.379> you

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
they're there's gaps in the string you

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.739 
they're there's gaps in the string you
can<00:00:42.980> see<00:00:43.190> they're<00:00:43.429> in<00:00:43.760> there<00:00:44.149> where<00:00:44.600> they've

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:44.749 
can see they're in there where they've

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:48.160 
can see they're in there where they've
shrunk<00:00:44.989> quite<00:00:45.410> a<00:00:45.440> bit<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.780> a<00:00:47.780> lot<00:00:47.929> of<00:00:47.989> these

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
shrunk quite a bit and a lot of these

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.149 
shrunk quite a bit and a lot of these
dried<00:00:48.589> up<00:00:48.769> pretty<00:00:49.010> good<00:00:49.449> however<00:00:50.449> I<00:00:51.260> am

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
dried up pretty good however I am

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.669 
dried up pretty good however I am
noticing<00:00:52.670> some<00:00:53.300> spoilage<00:00:53.899> if<00:00:54.109> you<00:00:54.230> can<00:00:54.409> see

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
noticing some spoilage if you can see

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.329 
noticing some spoilage if you can see
that<00:00:54.920> I<00:00:55.219> can<00:00:56.149> rotate<00:00:56.449> it<00:00:56.780> right<00:00:56.960> there<00:00:57.260> some<00:00:58.249> of

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
that I can rotate it right there some of

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.520 
that I can rotate it right there some of
these<00:00:58.429> are<00:00:58.640> starting<00:00:59.059> to<00:00:59.269> rot<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.749> bit<00:00:59.929> on<00:01:00.199> here

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
these are starting to rot a bit on here

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.849 
these are starting to rot a bit on here
now<00:01:01.460> I<00:01:01.489> don't<00:01:01.699> know<00:01:02.030> if<00:01:02.300> that's<00:01:02.539> because<00:01:02.859> I

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
now I don't know if that's because I

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.310 
now I don't know if that's because I
didn't<00:01:04.519> latch<00:01:04.760> them<00:01:05.059> first<00:01:05.360> I<00:01:05.780> don't<00:01:05.960> know<00:01:06.229> if

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
didn't latch them first I don't know if

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.190 
didn't latch them first I don't know if
they<00:01:06.470> did<00:01:06.620> that<00:01:06.770> then<00:01:07.040> I<00:01:07.310> don't<00:01:07.640> have<00:01:08.200> adequate

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
they did that then I don't have adequate

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.640 
they did that then I don't have adequate
instructions<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.070> suppose<00:01:10.430> I<00:01:11.110> don't<00:01:12.110> know<00:01:12.350> if

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
instructions I suppose I don't know if

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.910 
instructions I suppose I don't know if
the<00:01:13.130> bean<00:01:13.340> size<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:14.150> too<00:01:14.960> inconsistent<00:01:15.620> you

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
the bean size is too inconsistent you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.800 
the bean size is too inconsistent you
can<00:01:16.070> see<00:01:16.220> we<00:01:16.340> have<00:01:16.520> small<00:01:16.850> beans<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.420> really

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
can see we have small beans and really

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.720 
can see we have small beans and really
fat<00:01:18.080> ones<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.560> we<00:01:18.620> picked<00:01:18.890> at<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.250> time<00:01:19.520> and

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
fat ones that we picked at that time and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.250 
fat ones that we picked at that time and
I<00:01:19.790> strung<00:01:20.090> them<00:01:20.210> all<00:01:20.390> kind<00:01:20.750> of<00:01:20.840> alternating

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
I strung them all kind of alternating

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
I strung them all kind of alternating
together<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.700> I<00:01:23.240> also<00:01:23.420> don't<00:01:23.810> know<00:01:24.020> if<00:01:24.410> my

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
together and I also don't know if my

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.210 
together and I also don't know if my
storage<00:01:25.640> method<00:01:26.150> was<00:01:26.300> okay<00:01:26.690> I<00:01:26.960> just<00:01:27.740> hung<00:01:28.040> them

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
storage method was okay I just hung them

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.380 
storage method was okay I just hung them
up<00:01:28.340> in<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.550> living<00:01:28.790> room<00:01:28.940> with<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.060> bunch<00:01:29.300> of

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
up in the living room with a bunch of

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.720 
up in the living room with a bunch of
these<00:01:29.540> just<00:01:30.260> kind<00:01:30.470> of<00:01:30.560> hanging<00:01:30.830> there<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.160> I

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
these just kind of hanging there and I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.280 
these just kind of hanging there and I
don't<00:01:31.790> know<00:01:31.940> if<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.120> humidity<00:01:32.600> was<00:01:32.750> wrong<00:01:32.990> in

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
don't know if the humidity was wrong in

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.440 
don't know if the humidity was wrong in
the<00:01:33.380> house<00:01:33.700> part<00:01:34.700> of<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.850> time<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:35.150> had<00:01:35.300> the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
the house part of the time we had the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.270 
the house part of the time we had the
air<00:01:35.540> conditioning<00:01:35.990> running<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.860> don't

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
air conditioning running so I don't

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.040 
air conditioning running so I don't
think<00:01:37.370> it<00:01:37.520> was<00:01:37.610> quite<00:01:38.150> too<00:01:38.390> humid<00:01:38.750> in<00:01:38.900> there

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
think it was quite too humid in there

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.900 
think it was quite too humid in there
but<00:01:39.410> there<00:01:40.070> may<00:01:40.220> have<00:01:40.310> just<00:01:40.520> been<00:01:40.670> too<00:01:40.820> much

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
but there may have just been too much

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.320 
but there may have just been too much
moisture<00:01:41.240> in<00:01:41.540> these<00:01:41.660> beans<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.890> wasn't

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
moisture in these beans and it wasn't

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.850 
moisture in these beans and it wasn't
drying<00:01:44.330> out<00:01:44.510> quick<00:01:44.750> enough<00:01:44.990> for<00:01:45.260> these<00:01:45.350> you

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
drying out quick enough for these you

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.400 
drying out quick enough for these you
know<00:01:46.010> to<00:01:46.070> keep<00:01:46.430> them<00:01:46.610> from<00:01:46.760> rotting<00:01:47.290> so<00:01:48.290> I'm

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
know to keep them from rotting so I'm

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.930 
know to keep them from rotting so I'm
going<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.590> try<00:01:48.800> the<00:01:48.860> more<00:01:49.100> modern<00:01:49.490> version<00:01:49.850> of

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
going to try the more modern version of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.180 
going to try the more modern version of
drying<00:01:50.210> green<00:01:50.540> beans<00:01:50.750> which<00:01:51.080> involves<00:01:51.710> just

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
drying green beans which involves just

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.460 
drying green beans which involves just
washing<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:52.730> snapping<00:01:53.120> in<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.270> beans

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
washing and snapping in the beans

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.630 
washing and snapping in the beans
blanching<00:01:54.470> them<00:01:54.590> freezing<00:01:55.130> them<00:01:55.280> for<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.490> very

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
blanching them freezing them for a very

blanching them freezing them for a very
short<00:01:55.790> time<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.510> then<00:01:56.630> putting<00:01:56.990> them<00:01:57.230> in<00:01:57.470> a

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
short time and then putting them in a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.080 
short time and then putting them in a
dehydrator<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.460> I'm<00:01:58.640> going<00:01:58.760> to<00:01:58.820> show<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:58.970> how

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
dehydrator so I'm going to show you how

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:14.449 
dehydrator so I'm going to show you how
to<00:01:59.150> do<00:01:59.300> that<00:01:59.450> now

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.500 

okay<00:02:15.459> we're<00:02:15.610> gonna<00:02:15.760> let<00:02:15.910> those<00:02:16.030> blanch<00:02:16.360> for

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
okay we're gonna let those blanch for

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.650 
okay we're gonna let those blanch for
about<00:02:16.930> five<00:02:17.290> minutes<00:02:21.120> okay<00:02:22.120> three<00:02:22.420> means

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
about five minutes okay three means

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.990 
about five minutes okay three means
should<00:02:22.870> be<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:22.989> bright<00:02:23.319> green<00:02:23.560> color<00:02:23.680> now<00:02:24.190> and

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
should be a bright green color now and

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.580 
should be a bright green color now and
we're<00:02:25.120> gonna<00:02:25.209> take<00:02:25.480> them<00:02:25.690> out<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.110> pot<00:02:26.350> and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
we're gonna take them out of the pot and

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:40.780 
we're gonna take them out of the pot and
put<00:02:26.860> them<00:02:27.040> out<00:02:27.160> on<00:02:27.190> cookie<00:02:27.610> sheets

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:50.679 

and<00:02:41.689> then<00:02:42.019> we<00:02:42.230> put<00:02:42.409> them<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.709> freezer<00:02:49.689> okay

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
and then we put them in the freezer okay

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:51.850 
and then we put them in the freezer okay
these<00:02:50.870> are<00:02:50.930> gonna<00:02:51.110> stay<00:02:51.379> in<00:02:51.439> the<00:02:51.530> freezer<00:02:51.739> for

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
these are gonna stay in the freezer for

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.670 
these are gonna stay in the freezer for
about<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.280> half<00:02:52.549> an<00:02:52.730> hour<00:02:52.849> and<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:54.349> reason<00:02:54.650> that

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
about a half an hour and the reason that

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.830 
about a half an hour and the reason that
we<00:02:54.890> blanched<00:02:55.459> those<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.150> put<00:02:56.569> them<00:02:56.689> in<00:02:56.750> the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
we blanched those and put them in the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.630 
we blanched those and put them in the
freezer<00:02:57.019> is<00:02:57.319> it<00:02:57.470> tenderizes<00:02:57.829> the<00:02:58.220> beans<00:02:58.430> so

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
freezer is it tenderizes the beans so

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.699 
freezer is it tenderizes the beans so
that<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.879> moisture<00:02:59.299> will<00:02:59.480> come<00:03:00.290> out<00:03:00.440> of<00:03:00.590> them

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
that the moisture will come out of them

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.830 
that the moisture will come out of them
quicker<00:03:00.950> when<00:03:01.190> they're<00:03:01.310> dehydrated<00:03:01.840> I'm

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
quicker when they're dehydrated I'm

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.970 
quicker when they're dehydrated I'm
sorry<00:03:03.079> about<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.379> noise<00:03:03.500> out<00:03:03.709> here<00:03:03.860> it's

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
sorry about the noise out here it's

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.369 
sorry about the noise out here it's
raining

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
raining

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.539 
raining
all<00:03:06.379> right<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.560> got<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.950> beans<00:03:07.129> out<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.459> the

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
all right I got the beans out of the

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.910 
all right I got the beans out of the
freezer<00:03:07.849> and<00:03:08.180> they're<00:03:09.170> not<00:03:09.290> totally<00:03:09.530> frozen

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
freezer and they're not totally frozen

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.490 
freezer and they're not totally frozen
but<00:03:10.220> they're<00:03:10.340> cold<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.840> texture<00:03:12.260> room<00:03:12.379> is

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
but they're cold and the texture room is

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.839 
but they're cold and the texture room is
a<00:03:12.530> little<00:03:12.920> bit<00:03:13.099> different<00:03:13.459> now

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
a little bit different now

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.119 
a little bit different now
so<00:03:14.480> next<00:03:14.720> step<00:03:15.200> is<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.650> put<00:03:15.769> them<00:03:15.920> in<00:03:16.010> the

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
so next step is to put them in the

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.830 
so next step is to put them in the
dehydrator<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.180> is<00:03:17.329> the<00:03:17.450> kind<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:17.810> I

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
dehydrator and this is the kind that I

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.460 
dehydrator and this is the kind that I
have<00:03:18.400> it's<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.760> nesco<00:03:20.329> garden<00:03:20.810> master<00:03:21.200> and

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
have it's the nesco garden master and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.680 
have it's the nesco garden master and
you<00:03:21.739> can<00:03:21.889> stack<00:03:22.129> up<00:03:22.159> to<00:03:22.489> 30<00:03:22.790> shelves<00:03:23.299> on<00:03:23.450> this

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
you can stack up to 30 shelves on this

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.770 
you can stack up to 30 shelves on this
and<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:24.620> still<00:03:24.829> works<00:03:25.069> great<00:03:25.480> all<00:03:26.480> right<00:03:26.599> so

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
and it still works great all right so

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.660 
and it still works great all right so
I'm<00:03:26.840> just<00:03:26.900> gonna<00:03:27.139> put<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.349> beans<00:03:27.560> in<00:03:28.069> here<00:03:28.430> on

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
I'm just gonna put the beans in here on

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.220 
I'm just gonna put the beans in here on
each<00:03:28.879> shelf<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.420> spread<00:03:29.659> them<00:03:29.750> around<00:03:29.870> so

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
each shelf and spread them around so

00:03:30.230 --> 00:04:01.309 
each shelf and spread them around so
that<00:03:30.319> they're<00:03:30.590> gonna<00:03:30.680> sing<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.069> layer

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.320 

okay<00:04:02.319> so<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.650> beans<00:04:02.830> are<00:04:03.010> dry<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:04.030> is<00:04:04.180> what

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
okay so the beans are dry this is what

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.820 
okay so the beans are dry this is what
they<00:04:04.450> look<00:04:04.660> like<00:04:04.690> they<00:04:05.080> kind<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.350> shrivel<00:04:05.740> up

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
they look like they kind of shrivel up

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.110 
they look like they kind of shrivel up
and<00:04:06.100> shrink<00:04:07.060> down<00:04:07.240> quite<00:04:07.569> a<00:04:07.600> bit<00:04:08.880> they're<00:04:09.880> kind

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
and shrink down quite a bit they're kind

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.710 
and shrink down quite a bit they're kind
of<00:04:10.180> brittle<00:04:13.470> crunchy<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:16.030> I'm<00:04:16.359> gonna<00:04:16.510> gather

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
of brittle crunchy and I'm gonna gather

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.750 
of brittle crunchy and I'm gonna gather
these<00:04:17.049> up<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.440> put<00:04:17.829> them<00:04:17.950> into<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.220> mason<00:04:18.760> jar

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
these up and put them into a mason jar

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.710 
these up and put them into a mason jar
all<00:04:21.760> right<00:04:21.850> so<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.090> think<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.419> went<00:04:22.600> pretty

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
all right so I think that went pretty

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.500 
all right so I think that went pretty
well<00:04:22.870> I<00:04:23.200> think<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:23.680> have<00:04:23.919> about<00:04:24.550> eight<00:04:25.060> pounds

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
well I think I have about eight pounds

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.060 
well I think I have about eight pounds
of<00:04:25.600> beans<00:04:25.750> that<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.080> dried<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:26.650> there's<00:04:26.800> just<00:04:26.980> a

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
of beans that I dried and there's just a

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.260 
of beans that I dried and there's just a
little<00:04:27.250> bit<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.639> couldn't<00:04:27.880> fit<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:28.210> the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
little bit that couldn't fit in the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.100 
little bit that couldn't fit in the
court<00:04:28.540> jars<00:04:28.810> so<00:04:29.139> this<00:04:29.710> is<00:04:29.860> pretty<00:04:30.040> close<00:04:30.250> to

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
court jars so this is pretty close to

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.750 
court jars so this is pretty close to
equivalent<00:04:32.110> of<00:04:32.260> eight<00:04:32.710> pounds<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.430> fresh

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
equivalent of eight pounds of fresh

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.870 
equivalent of eight pounds of fresh
beans<00:04:34.060> dried<00:04:34.540> up<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:34.840> stored<00:04:35.710> in<00:04:35.950> a<00:04:36.340> quart

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
beans dried up and stored in a quart

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.330 
beans dried up and stored in a quart
size<00:04:37.120> jar<00:04:37.540> that's<00:04:38.080> pretty<00:04:38.380> good<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.650> saves<00:04:39.220> a

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
size jar that's pretty good it saves a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.060 
size jar that's pretty good it saves a
lot<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.490> space<00:04:39.610> in<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.150> pantry<00:04:40.540> and<00:04:40.840> we<00:04:41.680> should

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
lot of space in the pantry and we should
