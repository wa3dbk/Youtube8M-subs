00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.120
 the winner 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.519
 in this clinic he built the foundations of the work he is currently doing 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.829
 in terms of the research he does to add the oils 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.230
 essential to food supplements 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.039
 Dr. Leon had left for several countries in the middle east and 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:28.999
 Africa 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.999
 in search of new options to fight diseases 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.640
 recently the nations industrial development organization 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.450
 united 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.060
 invited Dr. Lyon to the technological university Eskisehir Turkey 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.700
 to speak at the international congress on essential oils 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.950
 on that occasion he presented not only his research on the germination of 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.560
 the plants and the organic crop 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.910
 but also the research that is taking place in the university 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.400
 state of webber 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.390
 on the antibacterial inhibition of oils 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.450
 against gram negative bacteria and positive team 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.950
 as well as studies comparing essential oils with ampicillin and 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.220
 penicillin 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.590
 the results were very exciting 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.320
 Dr. Yang was one of the first certified American members 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.760
 of the international federation of 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.320
 based at the royal masonic hospital in london england 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.840
 design the first stainless steel vertical distiller of the states 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.050
 United 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.620
 the doctor and lion loves to ride horses in the mountains and work 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.510
 both in the field and in his laboratory 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.240
 because of his intelligence and insight 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.680
 he has become an excellent speaker and little remains 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.650
 It is also one of the eminences in essential oils most recognized of 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.530
 the United States 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.530
 then listen to one of the lectures of the carillon doctor 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.800
 to see what we can learn about this fascinating climate 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.090
 advised is the follower of the proxies 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.040
 when talking about essential oils 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.379
 just to make a very simple comparison if we extracted the oil from 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.180
 the plant or we put it to the human body and a plant side by side 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.809
 we could make some very interesting comparisons 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.529
 the human group we have a substance called blood 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.169
 and this has a very specific purpose 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.359
 to transport nutrients to the cells to feed them 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.349
 one of the main agents of the blood responsible for the distribution 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.129
 of the nutrients through the cell membranes is oxygen 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.369
 what would happen if we removed oxygen from the blood 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:49.179
 we would die immediately 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.199
 the cells begin to transform and produce a toxic gas 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.859
 which creates a conglomerate of cells that promotes diseases 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.969
 nowadays we live in an environment deprived of oxygen 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:06.659
 due to the type of air we breathe the food we eat if the water that 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.309
 we drink 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:12.589
 for this reason we have become victims which is evident from what 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.629
 it happens around us 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.790
 essential oils perform the same function in the plant as the 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.219
 blood in the human body 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.219
 the essential oil that is the blood of the plant 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.229
 how much does a finger have been cut? 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.629
 what's going on 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.019
 exactly to clean and kill the bacteria since it is necessary to 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.019
 allow the tissue to heal 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.640
 how many of you have broken or damaged the leaves of the plants 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.259
 they are afraid to leave 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.629
 a true liquid 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.079
 some call it resin 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.859
 the blood of the plant 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.179
 a few call it the life force of the plant 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:57.629
 but after all 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.949
 it's like the plant is bleeding 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.879
 sandra to clean the damaged part of the plant and kill the bacteria 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.929
 as you see the essential oil is like blood a transport system whose 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:12.929
 principal ingredient 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.909
 before such 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:21.809
