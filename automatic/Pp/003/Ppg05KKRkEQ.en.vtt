00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.840 
pumpkins will ripen
you<00:00:38.050> know<00:00:38.140> usually<00:00:38.290> 60-80<00:00:39.040> days<00:00:39.310> after<00:00:39.730> they

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
you know usually 60-80 days after they

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.260 
you know usually 60-80 days after they
start<00:00:40.750> to<00:00:40.840> flower<00:00:41.489> some<00:00:42.489> will<00:00:42.610> be<00:00:42.700> faster<00:00:43.120> than

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
start to flower some will be faster than

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.630 
start to flower some will be faster than
that<00:00:43.420> depending<00:00:43.690> on<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.110> variety<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:45.430> really

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
that depending on the variety but really

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.340 
that depending on the variety but really
once<00:00:45.850> they<00:00:46.000> start<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.330> color<00:00:46.510> up<00:00:46.630> they're

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
once they start to color up they're

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.799 
once they start to color up they're
gonna<00:00:47.470> turn<00:00:47.739> pretty<00:00:48.070> fast<00:00:48.370> so<00:00:49.270> once<00:00:49.720> they

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
gonna turn pretty fast so once they

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.930 
gonna turn pretty fast so once they
start<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:50.080> color<00:00:50.260> up<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:51.460> know<00:00:51.550> it<00:00:51.760> probably

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
start to color up you know it probably

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.310 
start to color up you know it probably
is<00:00:52.180> a<00:00:52.210> good<00:00:52.270> idea<00:00:52.390> to<00:00:52.690> go<00:00:52.780> out<00:00:52.809> there<00:00:53.050> and<00:00:53.140> check

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
is a good idea to go out there and check

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.470 
is a good idea to go out there and check
them<00:00:53.550> if<00:00:54.550> they're<00:00:54.850> still<00:00:55.059> covered<00:00:55.210> with

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
them if they're still covered with

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.790 
them if they're still covered with
leaves<00:00:55.629> pretty<00:00:55.930> good<00:00:56.140> you<00:00:56.260> can<00:00:56.290> leave<00:00:56.680> them

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
leaves pretty good you can leave them

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.829 
leaves pretty good you can leave them
out<00:00:56.920> in<00:00:56.950> the<00:00:57.070> field<00:00:57.280> but<00:00:58.210> as<00:00:58.330> that<00:00:58.510> canopy

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
out in the field but as that canopy

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.030 
out in the field but as that canopy
starts<00:00:59.199> to<00:00:59.290> die<00:00:59.440> if<00:00:59.559> they're<00:00:59.680> getting<00:00:59.769> more

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
starts to die if they're getting more

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.040 
starts to die if they're getting more
and<00:01:00.129> more<00:01:00.190> sunlight<00:01:00.699> exposure<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.570> would<00:01:01.900> be<00:01:02.019> a

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
and more sunlight exposure it would be a

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.780 
and more sunlight exposure it would be a
good<00:01:02.260> idea<00:01:02.350> to<00:01:02.620> get<00:01:02.710> them<00:01:02.800> picked<00:01:03.070> when<00:01:03.699> you

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
good idea to get them picked when you

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.280 
good idea to get them picked when you
check<00:01:04.030> for<00:01:04.059> a<00:01:04.300> pumpkin<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.690> see<00:01:04.839> if<00:01:04.930> it's<00:01:05.080> ripe

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
check for a pumpkin to see if it's ripe

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.110 
check for a pumpkin to see if it's ripe
or<00:01:05.470> not<00:01:05.500> best<00:01:06.250> thing<00:01:06.430> you<00:01:06.520> can<00:01:06.640> use<00:01:06.790> is<00:01:06.820> use

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
or not best thing you can use is use

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.630 
or not best thing you can use is use
your<00:01:07.270> fingernail<00:01:07.950> go<00:01:08.950> out<00:01:09.100> there<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:09.520> use

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
your fingernail go out there and use

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.130 
your fingernail go out there and use
your<00:01:09.790> fingernail<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:10.180> if<00:01:10.330> you<00:01:10.420> can<00:01:10.600> press<00:01:10.840> and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
your fingernail and if you can press and

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.570 
your fingernail and if you can press and
it<00:01:11.470> actually<00:01:11.620> punctures<00:01:12.159> through<00:01:12.340> the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
it actually punctures through the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.790 
it actually punctures through the
pumpkin<00:01:13.090> isn't<00:01:13.210> ripe<00:01:13.450> yet<00:01:13.720> um<00:01:14.290> so<00:01:14.500> it<00:01:14.590> should

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
pumpkin isn't ripe yet um so it should

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.149 
pumpkin isn't ripe yet um so it should
resist<00:01:15.340> your<00:01:15.780> fingernail<00:01:16.780> should<00:01:17.740> be<00:01:17.800> fairly

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
resist your fingernail should be fairly

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:18.899 
resist your fingernail should be fairly
hard<00:01:18.400> to<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.670> touch

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
hard to the touch

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.910 
hard to the touch
shouldn't<00:01:19.810> really<00:01:19.900> leave<00:01:20.140> much<00:01:20.350> of<00:01:20.380> a<00:01:20.560> dent<00:01:20.740> in

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
shouldn't really leave much of a dent in

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.850 
shouldn't really leave much of a dent in
the<00:01:20.979> pumpkin<00:01:21.340> if<00:01:21.700> they're<00:01:22.030> really<00:01:22.210> truly<00:01:22.600> ripe

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the pumpkin if they're really truly ripe

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.750 
the pumpkin if they're really truly ripe
you<00:01:23.860> know<00:01:23.920> unless<00:01:24.070> you<00:01:24.190> have<00:01:24.220> a<00:01:24.310> really<00:01:24.580> sharp

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
you know unless you have a really sharp

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.920 
you know unless you have a really sharp
fingernail<00:01:25.150> you're<00:01:25.330> not<00:01:25.450> gonna<00:01:25.570> get<00:01:25.810> it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
fingernail you're not gonna get it

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.630 
fingernail you're not gonna get it
through<00:01:26.110> there<00:01:26.290> it<00:01:26.440> should<00:01:26.950> resist<00:01:27.250> it<00:01:27.460> pretty

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
through there it should resist it pretty

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.090 
through there it should resist it pretty
well<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.350> know<00:01:29.440> if<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.620> are<00:01:29.650> fine<00:01:29.920> and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
well if you you know if you are fine and

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.499 
well if you you know if you are fine and
so<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.670> that's<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.969> other<00:01:31.060> challenging

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
so and that's the other challenging

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.450 
so and that's the other challenging
thing<00:01:31.659> some<00:01:31.930> parts<00:01:32.229> you'll<00:01:32.950> find<00:01:33.189> you<00:01:33.369> know

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
thing some parts you'll find you know

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.280 
thing some parts you'll find you know
maybe<00:01:33.610> half<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:33.880> pumpkin<00:01:34.299> is<00:01:34.390> as<00:01:34.600> hard<00:01:35.020> but<00:01:35.200> if

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
maybe half the pumpkin is as hard but if

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.780 
maybe half the pumpkin is as hard but if
you<00:01:35.380> roll<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.680> over<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.979> up<00:01:36.130> backside<00:01:36.579> might

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
you roll it over that up backside might

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.749 
you roll it over that up backside might
be<00:01:36.909> a<00:01:36.939> little<00:01:37.149> bit<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:39.070> could<00:01:39.159> still<00:01:39.399> puncture

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
be a little bit you could still puncture

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.639 
be a little bit you could still puncture
it<00:01:39.850> then<00:01:40.030> usually<00:01:40.540> then<00:01:40.689> you<00:01:40.869> know<00:01:40.960> if<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.500> can

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
it then usually then you know if you can

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:42.959 
it then usually then you know if you can
find<00:01:41.860> anywhere<00:01:42.219> on<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.460> pumpkin<00:01:42.820> that's

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
find anywhere on the pumpkin that's

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.600 
find anywhere on the pumpkin that's
still<00:01:43.560> not<00:01:44.560> hard<00:01:44.860> I<00:01:45.009> would<00:01:45.070> leave<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:45.430> out<00:01:45.520> in

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
still not hard I would leave it out in

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.730 
still not hard I would leave it out in
the<00:01:45.640> field<00:01:45.880> then<00:01:46.090> once<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:46.990> pick<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.259> pumpkin

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
the field then once you pick a pumpkin

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.649 
the field then once you pick a pumpkin
if<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.579> can<00:01:48.729> leave<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:48.969> somewhere<00:01:49.180> where<00:01:49.509> it's

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
if you can leave it somewhere where it's

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.020 
if you can leave it somewhere where it's
80<00:01:50.020> 85<00:01:50.590> degrees<00:01:50.950> out<00:01:51.369> of<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.549> fields<00:01:51.789> probably

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
80 85 degrees out of the fields probably

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.090 
80 85 degrees out of the fields probably
gonna<00:01:52.119> be<00:01:52.240> even<00:01:52.390> hotter<00:01:52.539> than<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.840> but<00:01:53.289> that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
gonna be even hotter than that but that

either<00:03:26.470> in<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.710> field<00:03:26.950> or<00:03:27.160> just<00:03:27.190> in<00:03:27.460> a<00:03:27.550> warm

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
either in the field or just in a warm

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.020 
either in the field or just in a warm
garage<00:03:28.180> works<00:03:28.570> well<00:03:29.640> then<00:03:30.640> once<00:03:30.850> they've

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
garage works well then once they've

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.970 
garage works well then once they've
cured<00:03:31.240> for<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:31.930> know<00:03:32.020> maybe<00:03:32.440> up<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.740> week

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
cured for you know maybe up to a week

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.220 
cured for you know maybe up to a week
even<00:03:33.210> try<00:03:34.210> to<00:03:34.270> get<00:03:34.450> them<00:03:34.570> in<00:03:34.660> somewhere<00:03:35.020> cooler

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
even try to get them in somewhere cooler

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.040 
even try to get them in somewhere cooler
so<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.500> basement<00:03:35.950> would<00:03:36.010> be<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.220> good<00:03:36.400> spot

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
so a basement would be a good spot

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.180 
so a basement would be a good spot
someone<00:03:38.050> with<00:03:38.170> some<00:03:38.350> fairly<00:03:38.590> high<00:03:38.890> humidity

someone with some fairly high humidity

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.130 
someone with some fairly high humidity
so<00:03:40.090> that's<00:03:40.240> where<00:03:40.390> basements<00:03:40.810> work<00:03:40.930> really

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
so that's where basements work really

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.230 
so that's where basements work really

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
good the other thing is don't just put

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.510 
good the other thing is don't just put
