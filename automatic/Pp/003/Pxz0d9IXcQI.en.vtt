this<00:00:11.040> video<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.550> about<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.849> hands<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
this video is about the hands and the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.470 
this video is about the hands and the
feet<00:00:13.160> first<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.340> all<00:00:14.460> we're<00:00:15.089> going<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.330> take<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
feet first of all we're going to take a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.929 
feet first of all we're going to take a
look<00:00:15.660> at<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> hand<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.980> hand<00:00:20.160> consists<00:00:20.820> of

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
look at the hand the hand consists of

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.240 
look at the hand the hand consists of
the<00:00:21.750> couple's<00:00:22.699> the<00:00:23.699> metacarpals<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:25.250> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the couple's the metacarpals and the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.810 
the couple's the metacarpals and the
phalanges<00:00:28.039> first<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.189> all<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.519> want<00:00:29.699> to

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
phalanges first of all you want to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.200 
phalanges first of all you want to
determine<00:00:30.359> where<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.170> thumb<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.790> in<00:00:32.790> order<00:00:33.090> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
determine where the thumb is in order to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.569 
determine where the thumb is in order to
do<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:34.079> count<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> number<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.860> phalanges

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
do this we count the number of phalanges

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.479 
do this we count the number of phalanges
and<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> thumb<00:00:37.230> there<00:00:37.649> are<00:00:37.770> only<00:00:37.890> two

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
and on the thumb there are only two

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.530 
and on the thumb there are only two
phalanges

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
phalanges

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.360 
phalanges
whereas<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.050> all<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> other<00:00:40.530> digits<00:00:41.010> there

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
whereas on all the other digits there

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.209 
whereas on all the other digits there
are<00:00:41.579> three<00:00:41.879> phalanges<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.649> know<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
are three phalanges so we know that the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.380 
are three phalanges so we know that the
thumb<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:45.469> next<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.770> need<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.070> determine

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
thumb is here next we need to determine

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.260 
thumb is here next we need to determine
anterior<00:00:48.390> from<00:00:48.629> posterior<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:50.850> carpal

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
anterior from posterior and this carpal

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.389 
anterior from posterior and this carpal
bone<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.930> called<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> hamate<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.010> has<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
bone here is called the hamate and has a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.630 
bone here is called the hamate and has a
protrusion<00:00:53.879> switch<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.690> anterior<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.460> know

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
protrusion switch is anterior so we know

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.900 
protrusion switch is anterior so we know
that<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.980> right<00:00:59.190> hand<00:01:01.850> there<00:01:02.850> are

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
that this is the right hand there are

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.289 
that this is the right hand there are
two<00:01:03.090> rows<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.359> carpal<00:01:03.930> bones<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:05.729> proximal

this is metacarpal one two three four

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.440 
this is metacarpal one two three four
and<00:01:47.850> five<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.460> heads<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> metacarpals

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.950 
and five the heads of the metacarpals
form<00:01:51.810> your<00:01:51.990> knuckles<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:53.720> then<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
form your knuckles and then the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.959 
form your knuckles and then the
phalanges<00:01:55.560> are<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.899> proximal<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:59.520> distal

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
phalanges are the proximal the distal

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.410 
phalanges are the proximal the distal
and<00:02:00.149> then<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:02.189> fingers<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
and then on the fingers we have the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.670 
and then on the fingers we have the
proximal<00:02:04.040> middle<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:06.570> distal

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
proximal middle and the distal

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.560 
proximal middle and the distal
so<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:08.399> let's<00:02:08.640> take<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:08.880> look<00:02:09.119> at<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.330> foot<00:02:14.570> the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
so now let's take a look at the foot the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.120 
so now let's take a look at the foot the
foot<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.930> similar<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.530> hand<00:02:16.770> in<00:02:16.950> many

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
foot is similar to the hand in many

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.830 
foot is similar to the hand in many
respects<00:02:17.780> but<00:02:18.780> here<00:02:19.020> we<00:02:19.200> have<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.920> tassels

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
respects but here we have the tassels

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.180 
respects but here we have the tassels
the<00:02:21.840> metatarsals<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.100> then<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.210> phalanges

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
the metatarsals and then the phalanges

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.700 
the metatarsals and then the phalanges
to<00:02:26.190> determine<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.210> big<00:02:27.420> toe<00:02:27.690> or<00:02:27.990> as<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:28.530> call

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
to determine the big toe or as we call

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.680 
to determine the big toe or as we call
it<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:28.980> anatomy<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.880> great<00:02:30.120> toe

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
it in anatomy the great toe

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.780 
it in anatomy the great toe
once<00:02:31.470> again<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:32.040> count<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.460> number<00:02:32.490> of

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
once again we count the number of

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.870 
once again we count the number of
phalanges<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.230> if<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.650> great<00:02:34.860> toe<00:02:35.130> only<00:02:35.700> has

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
phalanges so if the great toe only has

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.200 
phalanges so if the great toe only has
two<00:02:36.150> phalanges<00:02:36.780> where<00:02:37.320> all<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.710> other<00:02:37.860> toes

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
two phalanges where all the other toes

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.449 
two phalanges where all the other toes
have<00:02:39.210> three<00:02:39.570> phalanges<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:43.680> tassels<00:02:44.160> this

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
have three phalanges the tassels this

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.310 
have three phalanges the tassels this
bone<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.780> talus<00:02:46.490> and<00:02:47.490> we<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.630> see<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:49.080> has

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
bone is the talus and we can see it has

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.800 
bone is the talus and we can see it has
a<00:02:49.380> rounded<00:02:49.980> top<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.820> articulates<00:02:51.510> with<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
a rounded top that articulates with the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.380 
a rounded top that articulates with the
tibia<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:55.680> bone<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.190> called<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.640> calcaneal
