00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
would suggest adding extensions to you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.760 
would suggest adding extensions to you
baby<00:01:29.729> locks<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.509> want<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.960> your

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
baby locks if you want to have your

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.700 
baby locks if you want to have your
locks<00:01:32.189> start<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.030> then<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:34.290> know<00:01:34.409> kind<00:01:34.650> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
locks start and then you know kind of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.219 
locks start and then you know kind of
cheat<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.220> process<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> little<00:01:36.000> bit<00:01:36.180> by<00:01:37.110> adding

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
cheat the process a little bit by adding

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.980 
cheat the process a little bit by adding
locks<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.970> extensions<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> or<00:01:39.750> long

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
locks to your extensions to you or long

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.289 
locks to your extensions to you or long
you<00:01:40.290> know<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.560> gives<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.520> appearance<00:01:41.640> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
you know it gives it the appearance that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.749 
you know it gives it the appearance that
your<00:01:42.420> locks<00:01:42.750> are<00:01:43.049> longer<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.369> will<00:01:44.579> work

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
your locks are longer and this will work

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.200 
your locks are longer and this will work
better<00:01:45.060> it

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
better it

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.240 
better it
the<00:01:46.299> same<00:01:46.510> color<00:01:46.780> as<00:01:47.020> your<00:01:47.200> hair<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.979> reason

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
the same color as your hair the reason

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.210 
the same color as your hair the reason
why<00:01:48.369> this<00:01:48.430> is<00:01:48.580> okay<00:01:48.970> because<00:01:49.479> you<00:01:50.170> can<00:01:50.220> extend

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
why this is okay because you can extend

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.219 
why this is okay because you can extend
your<00:01:51.400> lock<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:51.970> then<00:01:52.240> when<00:01:52.690> your<00:01:52.810> new<00:01:52.960> growth

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
your lock and then when your new growth

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.070 
your lock and then when your new growth
comes<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:54.400> read<00:01:54.940> reading<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.540> new<00:01:55.720> growth

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
comes in you read reading the new growth

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.770 
comes in you read reading the new growth
on<00:01:56.350> your<00:01:56.380> hair<00:01:56.740> until<00:01:57.430> your<00:01:57.729> dreads<00:01:58.090> are<00:01:58.390> long

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
on your hair until your dreads are long

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.680 
on your hair until your dreads are long
enough<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.680> can<00:01:59.860> cut<00:02:00.220> off<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:00.430> extension<00:02:01.420> and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
enough you can cut off the extension and

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.440 
enough you can cut off the extension and
leave<00:02:02.049> it<00:02:02.200> just<00:02:02.229> so<00:02:03.070> it's<00:02:03.250> all<00:02:03.400> dreadlock<00:02:04.270> and

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
leave it just so it's all dreadlock and

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.690 
leave it just so it's all dreadlock and
