00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.630 
don't think it's a very good feature i
think<00:01:50.810> it's<00:01:50.960> just<00:01:51.259> taken<00:01:52.130> away<00:01:52.280> from<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.520> real

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
think it's just taken away from the real

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.999 
think it's just taken away from the real
football<00:01:52.939> field<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.109> game<00:01:54.289> where<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.829> can

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
football field of the game where you can

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.910 
football field of the game where you can
turn<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.490> on<00:01:55.640> in<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.630> open<00:01:57.020> field<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.710> can

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
turn it on in the open field and you can

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.160 
turn it on in the open field and you can
weave<00:01:58.130> your<00:01:58.340> way<00:01:58.399> through<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.880> defense<00:01:59.170> with

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
weave your way through the defense with

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.620 
weave your way through the defense with
without<00:02:00.679> auto<00:02:00.950> sprint<00:02:01.399> you<00:02:01.609> know<00:02:01.729> as<00:02:01.999> you<00:02:02.479> can

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
without auto sprint you know as you can

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.160 
without auto sprint you know as you can
see<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.170> Jukes<00:02:03.740> are<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.159> lot<00:02:05.149> more<00:02:05.179> effective

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
see the Jukes are a lot more effective

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.259 
see the Jukes are a lot more effective
without<00:02:06.889> sprinting<00:02:07.670> lots<00:02:07.850> i'm<00:02:07.969> going<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.149> do<00:02:08.239> a

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
without sprinting lots i'm going to do a

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.630 
without sprinting lots i'm going to do a
little<00:02:08.450> double<00:02:08.750> Juke<00:02:09.170> move<00:02:09.200> here<00:02:09.860> get<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.489> the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
little double Juke move here get to the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.480 
little double Juke move here get to the
outside<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.480> then<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.470> try<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.739> cut<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.040> out

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
outside and then just try and cut it out

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.380 
outside and then just try and cut it out
probably<00:02:13.700> should<00:02:13.880> have<00:02:13.940> stayed<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.270> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
probably should have stayed to the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.060 
probably should have stayed to the
outside<00:02:14.780> who<00:02:14.990> knows<00:02:15.230> what<00:02:15.470> would<00:02:15.590> happen<00:02:15.830> I

sliders they fit my game style but what

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.810 
sliders they fit my game style but what
you<00:07:18.389> have<00:07:18.510> to<00:07:18.630> understand<00:07:19.080> is<00:07:19.550> there<00:07:20.550> they

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:20.820 
you have to understand is there they

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.460 
you have to understand is there they
can't<00:07:21.060> change<00:07:21.330> the<00:07:21.510> game<00:07:21.660> itself<00:07:22.050> they<00:07:22.320> can

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:22.470 
can't change the game itself they can

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.589 
can't change the game itself they can
only<00:07:22.590> make<00:07:22.919> it<00:07:22.950> react<00:07:23.580> more<00:07:23.940> realistically

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 
only make it react more realistically

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.000 
only make it react more realistically
and<00:07:25.520> pay<00:07:26.720> you<00:07:27.720> know<00:07:27.840> everybody<00:07:28.590> plays<00:07:28.860> the

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010 
and pay you know everybody plays the

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.379 
and pay you know everybody plays the
game<00:07:29.160> different<00:07:29.370> everyone's<00:07:29.940> got<00:07:30.120> their<00:07:30.150> own

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:30.389

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:33.020 
game different everyone's got their own
styles<00:07:30.900> so<00:07:31.139> you<00:07:31.680> can't<00:07:31.889> expect<00:07:32.250> a<00:07:32.400> slider<00:07:32.700> set

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.030 
styles so you can't expect a slider set

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.310 
styles so you can't expect a slider set
to<00:07:33.210> just<00:07:33.419> come<00:07:33.599> in<00:07:33.780> and<00:07:33.810> make<00:07:34.020> the<00:07:34.169> game
