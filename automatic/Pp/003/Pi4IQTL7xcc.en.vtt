the<00:00:26.970> gameplay<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> background<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.990> was

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
the gameplay in the background I was

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.560 
the gameplay in the background I was
only<00:00:28.230> using<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.769> mp7<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.060> silencer

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
only using the mp7 with just a silencer

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.060 
only using the mp7 with just a silencer
so<00:00:30.869> thought<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> little<00:00:31.920> bit

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
so thought that was a little bit

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.500 
so thought that was a little bit
interesting<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.579> usually<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.030> run<00:00:33.239> grip

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
interesting I usually like to run grip

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.120 
interesting I usually like to run grip
on<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.320> know<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> always<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
on this but you know I always like to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.860 
on this but you know I always like to
change<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.489> up<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.700> whatnot<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.750> know

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
change it up and whatnot but you know

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.240 
change it up and whatnot but you know
today<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> thought<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.559> might<00:00:37.620> talk<00:00:37.890> about

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
today I thought I might talk about

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.920 
today I thought I might talk about
having<00:00:38.790> fun<00:00:39.030> while<00:00:39.270> playing<00:00:39.329> call<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.840> duty

case<00:01:22.439> i'm<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.189> pretty<00:01:23.520> consistent<00:01:24.150> player<00:01:24.390> but

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.780 
case i'm a pretty consistent player but
a<00:01:24.750> lot<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.049> times<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.920> know<00:01:26.040> i'm<00:01:26.220> not<00:01:26.340> able<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
