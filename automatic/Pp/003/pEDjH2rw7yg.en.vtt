it<00:02:26.800> was<00:02:26.890> an<00:02:27.010> attempt<00:02:27.489> at<00:02:27.610> political

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
it was an attempt at political

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.680 
it was an attempt at political
commentary<00:02:28.720> but<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.019> kind<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.260> fell<00:02:29.470> flat<00:02:30.690> whoa

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
to a double the size from the guy's head

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.810 
to a double the size from the guy's head
and<00:03:45.570> her<00:03:45.870> face<00:03:46.140> for<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.560> matter<00:03:46.830> they

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
and her face for that matter they

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.340
