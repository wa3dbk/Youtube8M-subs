00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
I was gonna hang on with you so what

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.439 
I was gonna hang on with you so what
happens<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.940> people<00:00:50.940> who<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.239> cerebral

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
happens with people who have cerebral

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.290 
happens with people who have cerebral
palsy<00:00:51.840> there's<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:53.039> don't<00:00:53.399> know<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:54.120> my

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
palsy there's I don't know if you get my

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.229 
palsy there's I don't know if you get my
website<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.800> there's<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.280> think<00:00:59.699> fault<00:01:00.000> I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
website so there's a I think fault I

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.610 
website so there's a I think fault I
don't<00:01:00.719> know<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:00.840> they<00:01:00.960> explain<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
don't know if they explain this to you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.830 
don't know if they explain this to you
an<00:01:01.739> upper<00:01:02.100> motor<00:01:02.280> neuron<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.359> low<00:01:03.510> term<00:01:03.660> or

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
an upper motor neuron and a low term or

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.710 
an upper motor neuron and a low term or
lower<00:01:04.199> motor<00:01:04.439> neuron<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.880> nerves<00:01:06.090> go<00:01:06.420> from

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
lower motor neuron so the nerves go from

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.640 
lower motor neuron so the nerves go from
the<00:01:06.840> brain<00:01:07.520> down<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.760> spinal<00:01:09.060> cord<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.780> then

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the brain down the spinal cord and then

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.109 
the brain down the spinal cord and then
there's<00:01:10.920> another<00:01:11.010> nerve<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.580> goes<00:01:11.640> from<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
there's another nerve that goes from the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.170 
there's another nerve that goes from the
spinal<00:01:12.510> cord<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.170> muscles<00:01:13.790> okay<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:16.159> if

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
spinal cord to the muscles okay so if

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.270 
spinal cord to the muscles okay so if
the<00:01:18.180> bottom<00:01:18.630> nerve<00:01:18.840> what<00:01:19.470> they<00:01:19.590> call<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> loader

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the bottom nerve what they call a loader

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.160 
the bottom nerve what they call a loader
you<00:01:20.610> know<00:01:20.700> muscles<00:01:21.270> are<00:01:21.390> basically<00:01:21.750> motors

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you know muscles are basically motors

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.010 
you know muscles are basically motors
right<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> bottom<00:01:24.030> nerve<00:01:24.210> gets<00:01:24.509> cut<00:01:24.810> or

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
right so if the bottom nerve gets cut or

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.050 
right so if the bottom nerve gets cut or
something<00:01:25.320> happens<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.830> it

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
something happens to it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.899 
something happens to it
the<00:01:27.060> muscles<00:01:27.479> go<00:01:27.600> weak<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.020> classes<00:01:28.860> all<00:01:29.700> right

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
the muscles go weak in classes all right

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.880 
the muscles go weak in classes all right
if<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.380> top<00:01:31.740> nerve<00:01:32.159> gets<00:01:32.939> affected<00:01:33.680> then<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
if the top nerve gets affected then the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.749 
if the top nerve gets affected then the
muscles<00:01:35.930> are<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> lower<00:01:37.770> nerve<00:01:38.100> goes

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
muscles are then the lower nerve goes

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.300 
muscles are then the lower nerve goes
nuts<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.909> manifests<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.090> type<00:01:45.630> muscle

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
nuts and that manifests as type muscle

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.980 
nuts and that manifests as type muscle
the<00:01:46.430> nerves<00:01:46.850> are<00:01:46.909> firing<00:01:47.150> all<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.600> time<00:01:47.780> so

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
the nerves are firing all the time so

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.649 
the nerves are firing all the time so
the<00:01:48.080> muscles<00:01:48.380> get<00:01:48.560> its<00:01:49.100> best<00:01:49.540> all<00:01:50.540> right<00:01:51.430> so

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
the muscles get its best all right so

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.910 
the muscles get its best all right so
there's<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.720> guy<00:01:53.930> who<00:01:53.990> discovered<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.680> if<00:01:54.890> you

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
there's a guy who discovered that if you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.620 
there's a guy who discovered that if you
stretch<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.430> nerve<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.900> stops<00:01:57.259> working<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:59.509> if

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
stretch a nerve it stops working and if

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.420 
stretch a nerve it stops working and if
you<00:01:59.720> take<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.020> stretch<00:02:00.320> off<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:01.040> starts

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
you take the stretch off it starts

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.170 
you take the stretch off it starts
working

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
working

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.830 
working
now<00:02:03.020> there's<00:02:03.290> three<00:02:03.729> layers<00:02:04.729> or<00:02:05.060> three<00:02:05.300> grades

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
now there's three layers or three grades

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.109 
now there's three layers or three grades
three<00:02:06.170> grades<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:07.310> can<00:02:07.460> stretch<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.940> nerve

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
three grades you can stretch the nerve

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.820 
three grades you can stretch the nerve
and<00:02:08.569> then<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:08.840> take<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.140> stretch<00:02:09.410> off<00:02:09.619> and

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
and then you take the stretch off and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.220 
and then you take the stretch off and
there<00:02:09.920> anything<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:10.250> starts<00:02:10.580> working<00:02:10.940> again

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
there anything that starts working again

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.660 
there anything that starts working again
you<00:02:12.230> can<00:02:12.380> stretch<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.890> nerve<00:02:13.069> enough<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.640> that

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
you can stretch the nerve enough so that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.340 
you can stretch the nerve enough so that
it<00:02:13.880> damages<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.510> member<00:02:14.840> end<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.170> nerve

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
it damages the member end of the nerve

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.350 
it damages the member end of the nerve
the<00:02:15.590> outside<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.130> nerve<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.730> then<00:02:17.239> you

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
the outside of the nerve and then you

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.880 
the outside of the nerve and then you
have<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.630> take<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.930> stretch<00:02:18.200> off<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.620> keep<00:02:18.769> it

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
have to take the stretch off and keep it

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.070 
have to take the stretch off and keep it
off<00:02:19.070> for<00:02:19.250> three<00:02:19.610> or<00:02:19.940> four<00:02:20.000> days<00:02:20.180> maybe<00:02:20.720> two

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
off for three or four days maybe two

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.560 
off for three or four days maybe two
weeks<00:02:21.160> somewhere<00:02:22.160> between<00:02:22.310> there<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.120> then

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
weeks somewhere between there and then

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.600 
weeks somewhere between there and then
it<00:02:23.690> starts<00:02:23.959> working<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.530> there's<00:02:25.340> things

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
it starts working and there's things

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.009 
it starts working and there's things
that<00:02:25.700> are<00:02:25.820> ripped<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.360> cut<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:26.750> they're<00:02:26.870> not

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
that are ripped and cut and they're not

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.199 
that are ripped and cut and they're not
coming<00:02:27.350> back<00:02:27.670> all<00:02:28.670> right

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
coming back all right

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.440 
coming back all right
so<00:02:29.570> usually<00:02:30.110> especially<00:02:30.350> in<00:02:30.680> somebody<00:02:31.010> young

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
so usually especially in somebody young

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.580 
so usually especially in somebody young
it's<00:02:32.450> just<00:02:33.200> stretch<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.819> we're<00:02:35.540> gonna<00:02:35.690> get<00:02:36.350> her

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
it's just stretch so we're gonna get her

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.800 
it's just stretch so we're gonna get her
unstuck<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.459> what's<00:02:37.580> happening<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.180> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
unstuck and what's happening is the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.100 
unstuck and what's happening is the
spine<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.560> nerves<00:02:40.100> get<00:02:40.340> stretched<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.930> so

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
spine and nerves get stretched and so

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
spine and nerves get stretched and so
she<00:02:42.170> ends<00:02:42.470> up<00:02:42.530> like<00:02:42.709> this

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
she ends up like this

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.059 
she ends up like this
now<00:02:44.060> there's<00:02:44.630> adhesions<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.620> know<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:45.920> each

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
now there's adhesions you know that each

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.340 
now there's adhesions you know that each
of<00:02:46.100> those<00:02:46.310> things<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:46.760> get<00:02:46.880> stuck<00:02:47.120> together

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
of those things that get stuck together

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.840 
of those things that get stuck together
right

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
right

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.590 
right
there's<00:02:49.850> layers<00:02:50.269> inside<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:52.190> her<00:02:52.489> spine<00:02:52.820> that

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
there's layers inside of her spine that

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.930 
there's layers inside of her spine that
cover<00:02:53.870> things<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.739> when<00:02:54.920> they<00:02:55.370> get<00:02:55.519> stretched

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
cover things and when they get stretched

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.850 
cover things and when they get stretched
they<00:02:56.510> start<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.900> grow<00:02:57.019> together<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.620> stick

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
they start to grow together and stick

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.830 
they start to grow together and stick
together<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:59.060> you're<00:02:59.209> gonna<00:02:59.299> stretch<00:02:59.690> her

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
together so you're gonna stretch her

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.120 
together so you're gonna stretch her
real<00:03:00.110> for<00:03:00.410> we're<00:03:00.500> going<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.680> start<00:03:00.890> pulling

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
real for we're going to start pulling

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.370 
real for we're going to start pulling
some<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.430> those<00:03:01.610> apart<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.720> we're<00:03:03.170> going<00:03:03.320> to

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
some of those apart and we're going to

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.780 
some of those apart and we're going to
put<00:03:03.530> some<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:03.860> bones<00:03:04.070> back<00:03:04.310> in<00:03:04.519> a<00:03:04.610> better

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
put some of the bones back in a better

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.330 
put some of the bones back in a better
position<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.810> then<00:03:06.350> what's<00:03:06.530> gonna<00:03:06.680> happen<00:03:06.799> is

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
position and then what's gonna happen is

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.509 
position and then what's gonna happen is
she's<00:03:07.970> gonna<00:03:08.120> be<00:03:08.269> less<00:03:08.480> fast<00:03:09.010> now<00:03:10.010> how<00:03:10.250> much

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
she's gonna be less fast now how much

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.460 
she's gonna be less fast now how much
she's<00:03:10.730> going<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.000> improve<00:03:11.420> how<00:03:11.780> much<00:03:12.079> of<00:03:12.260> how

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
she's going to improve how much of how

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.280 
she's going to improve how much of how
long<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.860> takes<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.459> how<00:03:13.730> she<00:03:13.820> goes<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.540> can't

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
long it takes and how she goes I can't

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.770 
long it takes and how she goes I can't
tell<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:15.620> exactly<00:03:15.769> because

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
tell you exactly because

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.690 
tell you exactly because
and<00:03:16.930> too<00:03:17.410> many<00:03:17.500> factors<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.490> can't

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
and too many factors and you can't

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.790 
and too many factors and you can't
scratch<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.000> off<00:03:19.210> once<00:03:19.510> Pascoe<00:03:19.930> graduate<00:03:20.440> by

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
scratch it off once Pascoe graduate by

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.480 
scratch it off once Pascoe graduate by
degrees

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
degrees

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.210 
degrees
yes<00:03:22.210> yeah<00:03:23.140> if<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.350> wanna<00:03:23.530> stretch<00:03:23.770> it<00:03:23.950> all<00:03:24.070> at

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
yes yeah if you wanna stretch it all at

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.280 
yes yeah if you wanna stretch it all at
once<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.550> have<00:03:24.760> three<00:03:25.480> different<00:03:25.870> parts<00:03:26.110> here

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
once you have three different parts here

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.740 
once you have three different parts here
yeah<00:03:27.480> right<00:03:28.860> but<00:03:30.360> usually<00:03:31.360> you'll<00:03:31.510> see<00:03:31.600> a

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
yeah right but usually you'll see a

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:39.170 
yeah right but usually you'll see a
substantial<00:03:32.140> response<00:03:32.890> immediately

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.699 

and<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.629> have<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.930> figure<00:03:41.110> out<00:03:41.260> which<00:03:41.470> way<00:03:41.680> to

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
and you have to figure out which way to

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.920 
and you have to figure out which way to
go<00:03:41.950> because<00:03:42.280> we<00:03:42.400> can't<00:03:42.640> tell<00:03:42.879> so<00:03:43.150> what<00:03:43.810> I'm

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
go because we can't tell so what I'm

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.420 
go because we can't tell so what I'm
going<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.140> do<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.379> I'm<00:03:44.560> going<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.920> stretch<00:03:45.220> you

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
going to do is I'm going to stretch you

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.040 
going to do is I'm going to stretch you
all<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.970> way<00:03:46.060> around<00:03:46.300> this<00:03:46.420> way<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.959> we're

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
all the way around this way and we're

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.449 
all the way around this way and we're
going<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.200> find<00:03:47.410> out<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.709> fall<00:03:47.920> for<00:03:48.099> you<00:03:48.190> okay

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
going to find out the fall for you okay

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:59.850 
going to find out the fall for you okay
so<00:03:48.760> we<00:03:49.390> stretched<00:03:49.720> this<00:03:49.900> way<00:03:57.959> this<00:03:58.959> way<00:03:59.170> you

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
so we stretched this way this way you

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.080 
so we stretched this way this way you
notice<00:04:00.040> her<00:04:00.220> arm<00:04:00.430> just<00:04:00.640> what<00:04:00.790> loser<00:04:02.819> was<00:04:03.819> stuck

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
notice her arm just what loser was stuck

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:42.560 
notice her arm just what loser was stuck
out<00:04:04.269> like<00:04:04.480> this

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.090 

scary<00:04:43.570> when<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:43.990> happens<00:04:44.410> she<00:04:44.590> used<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:44.919> bunch

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
scary when that happens she used a bunch

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.700 
scary when that happens she used a bunch
of<00:04:45.250> noise<00:04:45.430> things<00:04:45.970> moving<00:04:46.450> and<00:04:47.380> you<00:04:47.470> notice

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
of noise things moving and you notice

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:56.969 
of noise things moving and you notice
her<00:04:47.830> arms<00:04:48.160> up<00:04:55.500> let's<00:04:56.500> see<00:04:56.620> look<00:04:56.740> at<00:04:56.830> her

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
her arms up let's see look at her

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.230 
her arms up let's see look at her
meaning<00:04:57.190> she's<00:04:57.400> got<00:04:57.580> more<00:04:57.760> control<00:04:57.910> of<00:04:58.120> her

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
meaning she's got more control of her

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.340 
meaning she's got more control of her
hand<00:04:58.450> and<00:04:58.630> her<00:04:58.750> fingers

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
hand and her fingers

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:12.470 
hand and her fingers
remember<00:05:00.190> before<00:05:00.370> she<00:05:00.729> was<00:05:00.850> all<00:05:01.060> my<00:05:01.539> face

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.910 

so<00:05:13.480> the<00:05:13.660> things<00:05:13.900> that<00:05:14.080> went<00:05:14.260> missed<00:05:14.500> so<00:05:14.680> things

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
so the things that went missed so things

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.680 
so the things that went missed so things
that<00:05:15.070> were<00:05:15.190> stretched<00:05:15.550> now<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.150> stretch<00:05:16.510> is

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
that were stretched now the stretch is

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.350 
that were stretched now the stretch is
often<00:05:17.050> all<00:05:17.170> the<00:05:17.200> sudden<00:05:17.590> muscles<00:05:17.890> you<00:05:17.950> working

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
often all the sudden muscles you working

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:55.890 
often all the sudden muscles you working
so<00:05:19.360> if<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:19.870> stand<00:05:20.110> her<00:05:20.350> up<00:05:20.410> a<00:05:20.620> little<00:05:21.490> bit<00:05:54.900> she

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
so if you stand her up a little bit she

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:07.500 
so if you stand her up a little bit she
was<00:05:57.750> alright<00:05:58.810> that's<00:05:59.020> one<00:06:03.690> even<00:06:04.690> though<00:06:06.510> even

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
was alright that's one even though even

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.230 
was alright that's one even though even
though<00:06:07.720> the<00:06:08.230> next<00:06:08.890> slide<00:06:09.190> is<00:06:09.400> a<00:06:09.430> side<00:06:09.700> affected

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
though the next slide is a side affected

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.390 
though the next slide is a side affected
more<00:06:10.450> some<00:06:11.290> reason<00:06:11.620> she's<00:06:11.800> tighter<00:06:12.070> in<00:06:12.280> the

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
more some reason she's tighter in the

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.690 
more some reason she's tighter in the
right<00:06:12.580> man<00:06:13.330> well<00:06:13.870> she<00:06:14.140> she<00:06:14.950> she's<00:06:15.340> doing
