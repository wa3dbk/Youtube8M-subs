getting group sometimes already been

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.320 
getting group sometimes already been
decided<00:00:23.519> when<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.850> games<00:00:24.029> being<00:00:24.269> played

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
decided when it games being played

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.910 
decided when it games being played
they're<00:00:24.750> playing<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> games<00:00:25.320> anyways<00:00:25.680> though

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
they're playing the games anyways though

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.460 
they're playing the games anyways though
and<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.820> instance<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.510> kind<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.230> been

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and this instance it's kind of been

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.510 
and this instance it's kind of been
decided<00:00:28.890> but<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.160> quite<00:00:30.710> GG<00:00:31.710> play<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.279> his

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
decided but not quite GG play in his

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.880 
decided but not quite GG play in his
group<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.940> going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.320> his<00:00:34.469> third<00:00:34.680> game

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
group is going to this is his third game

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.459 
group is going to this is his third game
so<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.850> GG<00:00:36.120> play<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.600> importance<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.170> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
so for GG play the importance of this is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.610 
so for GG play the importance of this is
whether<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:38.010> he<00:00:38.219> gets<00:00:38.370> humiliated<00:00:39.620> as

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
whether or not he gets humiliated as

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.420 
whether or not he gets humiliated as
basically<00:00:41.579> having<00:00:41.760> been<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.620> mean<00:00:44.250> he's

basically having been the I mean he's

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.549

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the defending champion he won the entire

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.369 
the defending champion he won the entire
OSL<00:00:47.100> last<00:00:47.340> season<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:47.850> bottom<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.300> um<00:00:48.539> came

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
OSL last season at bottom with um came

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.020 
OSL last season at bottom with um came
in<00:00:49.530> first<00:00:49.739> place<00:00:49.860> being<00:00:50.160> iris<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.789> final

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
in first place being iris and a final

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.430 
in first place being iris and a final
and<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:52.500> he<00:00:52.620> gets<00:00:52.800> Owen<00:00:53.460> freed<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.440> taken

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440

and so if he gets Owen freed and taken
out<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> first<00:00:56.160> round<00:00:56.520> by<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.390> cookie

out in the first round by the cookie

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.950 
out in the first round by the cookie
dough<00:00:58.770> myself<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.520> season<00:00:59.910> then<00:01:00.570> it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
dough myself of this season then it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.369 
dough myself of this season then it
would<00:01:01.140> be<00:01:01.170> pretty<00:01:02.090> pretty<00:01:03.090> harsh<00:01:03.300> forgot<00:01:03.660> as

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
would be pretty pretty harsh forgot as

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.390 
would be pretty pretty harsh forgot as
far<00:01:04.589> as<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.920> magic<00:01:05.400> who<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:07.340> doing<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
far as up magic who we see is doing a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.969 
far as up magic who we see is doing a
proxy<00:01:08.820> barracks<00:01:09.150> by<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> way<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:10.020> well

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
proxy barracks by the way here well

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.380 
proxy barracks by the way here well
that's<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.220> really<00:01:11.430> proxy<00:01:11.909> barracks<00:01:12.210> it's

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that's not really proxy barracks it's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.630 
that's not really proxy barracks it's
more<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> hidden<00:01:13.020> berry<00:01:13.200> chocolate<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
more like a hidden berry chocolate I

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.280 
more like a hidden berry chocolate I
mother<00:01:15.150> told<00:01:15.330> me<00:01:15.450> someone<00:01:15.930> made<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
mother told me someone made a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.840 
mother told me someone made a
distinction<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.040> makes<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.280> lot<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.460> sense<00:01:17.549> that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
distinction it makes a lot of sense that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.670 
distinction it makes a lot of sense that
proxy<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.570> when<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.049> near<00:01:19.470> their<00:01:19.650> base

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
proxy is when it's like near their base

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.609 
proxy is when it's like near their base
and<00:01:20.610> call<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.659> more<00:01:21.810> hidden<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.439> not

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
and call it more hidden if it's not

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.289 
and call it more hidden if it's not
necessarily<00:01:23.100> mirror<00:01:23.310> based<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:23.909> still<00:01:24.180> out

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
necessarily mirror based but still out

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.120 
necessarily mirror based but still out
of<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.450> way<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> lot<00:01:26.070> of

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
of the way and that is we see a lot of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.910 
of the way and that is we see a lot of
hidden<00:01:26.729> tech<00:01:27.420> hint<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.810> proxy<00:01:28.170> tech<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.619> that

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
hidden tech hint and proxy tech on that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.980 
hidden tech hint and proxy tech on that
little<00:01:29.250> kind<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.640> rich<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.240> right

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
little kind of rich there it's right

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.600 
little kind of rich there it's right
above<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.409> ramp<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.159> run<00:01:32.369> your

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
above that ramp and if you run your

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.789 
above that ramp and if you run your
drone<00:01:33.450> or<00:01:33.720> probe<00:01:33.930> or<00:01:34.110> whatever<00:01:34.350> right<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
drone or probe or whatever right up the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.160 
drone or probe or whatever right up the
middle<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.520> doesn't<00:01:36.030> usually<00:01:36.360> quite<00:01:36.869> go<00:01:37.049> up

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
middle it doesn't usually quite go up

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.819 
middle it doesn't usually quite go up
that<00:01:37.380> ramp<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.759> what's<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> he's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that ramp and see what's there so he's

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.200 
that ramp and see what's there so he's
probably<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.280> putting<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.670> up<00:01:41.790> there<00:01:41.820> just

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
probably just putting it up there just

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.690 
probably just putting it up there just
to<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:43.170> his<00:01:43.380> barracks<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.799> little<00:01:44.340> bit<00:01:44.460> closer

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
to have his barracks a little bit closer

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.010 
to have his barracks a little bit closer
to<00:01:45.680> Jesus<00:01:46.680> plays<00:01:46.860> bass<00:01:47.720> possibly<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.869> that

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
to Jesus plays bass possibly so that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.730 
to Jesus plays bass possibly so that
when<00:01:49.200> he<00:01:49.290> floats<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.829> in

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
when he floats it in

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.219 
when he floats it in
easier<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.490> put<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.759> over<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.210> play<00:01:52.479> face<00:01:52.750> and

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
easier to put it over to play face and

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.280 
easier to put it over to play face and
looks<00:01:53.560> like<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:53.860> is<00:01:53.979> going<00:01:54.159> to<00:01:54.220> get<00:01:54.310> seen<00:01:55.290> but

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
looks like that is going to get seen but

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.230 
looks like that is going to get seen but
it's<00:01:56.560> not<00:01:56.740> gonna<00:01:56.860> be<00:01:56.950> too<00:01:57.100> big<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.310> deal<00:01:57.490> um<00:01:57.759> ok

marine to achieve plays bass as fast as

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.870 
marine to achieve plays bass as fast as
possible<00:02:19.420> depending<00:02:20.019> on<00:02:20.200> when<00:02:20.349> I<00:02:20.380> overlord

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
possible depending on when I overlord

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.949 
possible depending on when I overlord
delaying<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.970> little<00:02:22.209> bit<00:02:22.300> now<00:02:22.480> he's<00:02:22.690> heading

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
delaying a little bit now he's heading

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.140 
delaying a little bit now he's heading
towards<00:02:23.140> he<00:02:23.799> plays<00:02:24.010> bass<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.580> probably<00:02:24.970> is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
towards he plays bass so it probably is

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.809 
towards he plays bass so it probably is
gonna<00:02:25.330> be<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.540> best<00:02:25.569> that<00:02:25.930> he<00:02:26.049> did<00:02:26.670> put<00:02:27.670> down

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
gonna be the best that he did put down

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.740 
gonna be the best that he did put down
that<00:02:27.850> spawning<00:02:28.269> put<00:02:28.569> a<00:02:28.600> little<00:02:28.840> bit<00:02:28.959> quicker

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
that spawning put a little bit quicker

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.670 
that spawning put a little bit quicker
anyways<00:02:31.750> maybe<00:02:31.930> he<00:02:32.140> was<00:02:32.260> afraid<00:02:32.380> he<00:02:32.560> was

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
anyways maybe he was afraid he was

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.289

any tech to back it up he didn't have

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.349 
any tech to back it up he didn't have
any<00:02:53.650> range<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.489> all<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.850> Zerg<00:02:55.030> got<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.269> do

so up magic is gonna have to fall back

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.580 
so up magic is gonna have to fall back
that<00:03:18.100> bunker<00:03:18.400> there<00:03:18.810> but<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:19.989> GG<00:03:20.319> play<00:03:20.470> is

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
with that one base it looks like wiki he

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.349 
with that one base it looks like wiki he
was<00:03:30.040> getting<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.340> great<00:03:30.519> colony<00:03:30.880> down<00:03:31.030> after

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
to try and creeped out basically know

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.530 
to try and creeped out basically know
the<00:03:38.470> what<00:03:38.829> we<00:03:38.920> saw<00:03:39.069> boxer<00:03:39.489> did<00:03:39.639> is<00:03:39.760> he<00:03:40.180> tried<00:03:40.420> to

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
the what we saw boxer did is he tried to

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.569 
the what we saw boxer did is he tried to
bunker<00:03:40.870> in<00:03:41.079> and<00:03:41.590> that<00:03:41.859> did<00:03:42.040> not<00:03:42.069> work<00:03:42.220> because

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
bunker in and that did not work because

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.750 
bunker in and that did not work because
he<00:03:42.760> didn't<00:03:42.940> have<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.090> range<00:03:43.540> advantage<00:03:44.639> so<00:03:45.639> he

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
he didn't have a range advantage so he

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.150 
he didn't have a range advantage so he
tried<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.000> bunker<00:03:46.420> towards<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.680> Zerg<00:03:47.889> player

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
tried to bunker towards the Zerg player

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.140 
tried to bunker towards the Zerg player
I<00:03:48.190> don't<00:03:48.400> remember<00:03:48.489> who<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:48.730> was<00:03:48.970> oh<00:03:49.120> that

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
was a magma and it didn't work because

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.259 
was a magma and it didn't work because
he<00:03:52.239> didn't<00:03:52.510> have<00:03:52.540> any<00:03:52.750> range<00:03:53.530> basically<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:55.090> we

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
he didn't have any range basically so we

calling<00:04:11.620> out<00:04:11.709> building<00:04:12.400> another<00:04:12.550> hatchery

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
calling out building another hatchery

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.830 
calling out building another hatchery
and<00:04:12.970> his<00:04:13.120> base<00:04:13.300> there<00:04:14.850> when<00:04:15.850> I<00:04:15.880> was<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:16.720> was

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
and his base there when I was I was

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.460 
and his base there when I was I was
saying<00:04:17.079> is<00:04:17.200> um<00:04:17.910> for<00:04:18.910> up<00:04:19.060> magic<00:04:19.480> this<00:04:20.019> game<00:04:20.230> is<00:04:20.440> a

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
saying is um for up magic this game is a

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.900 
saying is um for up magic this game is a
little<00:04:20.739> bit<00:04:20.829> important<00:04:21.160> because<00:04:21.250> he<00:04:21.430> is<00:04:21.519> 2<00:04:21.760> and

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
little bit important because he is 2 and

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.409 
little bit important because he is 2 and
0<00:04:23.640> so<00:04:25.169> if<00:04:26.169> he<00:04:26.410> wins<00:04:27.160> this<00:04:27.310> game<00:04:27.610> he<00:04:27.880> definitely

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
0 so if he wins this game he definitely

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.140 
0 so if he wins this game he definitely
has<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:29.260> spot<00:04:29.860> in<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.190> next<00:04:30.310> round<00:04:30.460> definitely

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
has a spot in the next round definitely

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.810 
has a spot in the next round definitely
I<00:04:31.300> think<00:04:31.990> there's<00:04:32.290> a<00:04:32.350> slight<00:04:32.710> possibility<00:04:32.950> if

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
I think there's a slight possibility if

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.990 
I think there's a slight possibility if
he<00:04:33.970> loses<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:35.290> GG<00:04:35.590> play<00:04:35.830> that<00:04:36.490> he<00:04:36.640> won't<00:04:36.790> make

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
he loses to GG play that he won't make

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.630 
he loses to GG play that he won't make
in<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.240> next<00:04:37.270> round<00:04:37.660> if<00:04:37.960> if<00:04:38.380> shutter<00:04:39.010> beats<00:04:39.370> be

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
in the next round if if shutter beats be

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.440 
in the next round if if shutter beats be
soon<00:04:39.910> because<00:04:40.600> then<00:04:41.580> no<00:04:42.580> I<00:04:42.610> guess<00:04:42.790> even<00:04:43.360> if

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
soon because then no I guess even if

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.000 
soon because then no I guess even if
that<00:04:43.600> happens<00:04:43.960> and<00:04:44.200> he'll<00:04:44.470> still<00:04:44.680> be<00:04:44.800> danced

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
that happens and he'll still be danced

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.790 
that happens and he'll still be danced
to<00:04:45.160> still<00:04:45.340> be<00:04:45.460> two<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:45.640> one<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:46.410> Cheryl<00:04:47.410> sure

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800

factory proxy factory nearby so I don't

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:27.990 
factory proxy factory nearby so I don't
think<00:05:27.040> that's<00:05:27.190> gonna<00:05:27.280> affect<00:05:27.460> things<00:05:27.700> too

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
think that's gonna affect things too

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.540 
think that's gonna affect things too
much<00:05:28.120> though<00:05:28.330> because<00:05:29.070> GT<00:05:30.070> play<00:05:30.220> does<00:05:30.400> have

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
much though because GT play does have

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.940 
much though because GT play does have
those<00:05:30.700> sunk<00:05:30.910> ins<00:05:31.090> there<00:05:31.270> and<00:05:31.590> I'll<00:05:32.590> magic

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
those sunk ins there and I'll magic

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.350 
those sunk ins there and I'll magic

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
building that bunker in his base but it

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.760 
building that bunker in his base but it
just<00:05:34.510> America's<00:05:34.960> didn't<00:05:35.229> have<00:05:35.320> any<00:05:35.470> Marines

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
just America's didn't have any Marines

to<00:05:35.919> put<00:05:36.100> in<00:05:36.190> it<00:05:36.630> so<00:05:37.630> it's<00:05:38.260> not<00:05:38.410> going<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.590> a<00:05:38.650> lot

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
to put in it so it's not going to a lot

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.469 
to put in it so it's not going to a lot
of<00:05:38.830> good<00:05:38.890> he<00:05:39.430> is<00:05:39.550> taking<00:05:39.880> a<00:05:39.910> lot<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.150> links<00:05:40.390> with

those stds though GG played not doing a
terribly<00:05:42.430> good<00:05:42.520> job<00:05:42.789> of<00:05:42.820> bringing<00:05:43.750> those<00:05:43.960> legs

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
terribly good job of bringing those legs

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.580 
terribly good job of bringing those legs
around<00:05:44.350> and<00:05:44.700> distracting

those<00:06:38.130> last<00:06:38.370> apt<00:06:38.700> STDs<00:06:39.240> that's<00:06:39.420> not<00:06:39.540> good

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
those last apt STDs that's not good

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.030 
those last apt STDs that's not good
because<00:06:39.990> he<00:06:40.200> obviously<00:06:40.230> doesn't<00:06:40.740> have<00:06:40.890> any

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
because he obviously doesn't have any

because he obviously doesn't have any
minerals<00:06:41.370> right<00:06:41.550> now<00:06:41.700> and<00:06:41.940> more<00:06:42.600> legs<00:06:42.960> coming

putting the around his bunker there

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.050 
putting the around his bunker there
but<00:06:56.010> it's<00:06:56.130> not<00:06:56.280> going<00:06:56.460> to<00:06:56.550> be<00:06:56.640> effective

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060
