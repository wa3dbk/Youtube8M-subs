00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.230
 How about Mauricio, how are you doing so well? 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.389
 gerardo good night and health for all 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.340
 Well, a team of tigers that 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.309
 He entered the field with that 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.279
 need to add points in your house 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.109
 not to be separated in the general table of 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.940
 look for the possibility of having the 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.130
 qualification and atlante for that life 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.109
 sports because it is in the last place 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.199
 of the percentage of a first time 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.150
 where after superior to the set 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.559
 atlantist with this controversial move 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.480
 within the area of ​​the others where 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.800
 from my point of view if there is contact 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.350
 with the left knee the player 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.660
 atlantist about gerardo if there is a 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.730
 contact there is jiménez that the referee 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.470
 of the area you do not see is the entry lucas 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.490
 wolves receives good service 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.990
 it's been to space you see 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.730
 observe that there is a hole in the defense 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.100
 the balls with power in the shot 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.950
 it does well to get back it was very 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.440
 attentive alan polished and was the first 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.540
 annotation at minute 17 and then to this 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.640
 I try again to polish that before 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.010
 the absence of emanuel el tito villa a 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.920
 throughout this tournament this young man 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.590
 he has responded to the confidence that 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.990
 has given ricardo the tuca ferretti and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.220
 Well the Atlantean did this to make 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.780
 that the end of the first part a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.670
 bad punt clearance that is let's say 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.979
 married or intercepted by galmarini that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.410
 with the head filters the ball and erviti 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.150
 taking advantage first that the goalkeeper is 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.479
 unfit and then a genius 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.700
 making the tie at minute 43 seemed 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.110
 that the plant took something important if 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.900
 the incredible thing in that play was what 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.910
 sticks do not clear anyone without 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.400
 intention ends up dividing the ball and 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.100
 so they marked him then the both 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.330
 local and good set and for the part 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.640
 complementary 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.520
 how trying really was the tonic 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.160
 of the game a feline team that was 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.320
 looking for the annotation here I reach you 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.790
 to divert this is perhaps the most of the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.830
 most important and atlante in the part 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.230
 complementary and not only in many a 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.810
 shot of the same dry sock 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.700
 authentic when it looked like he had the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.740
 opportunity to clear up before a 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.050
 team like tigers with so much capacity 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.120
 individual with as much quality as 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.760
 set can not fail that kind of 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.070
 plays later would come is in favor of 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.620
 tiger is a center that was not wearing 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.260
 practically nothing and olga gutiérrez comes out 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.870
 to nothing and you end up marking the ground and 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.240
 he even leaves behind the tiger player 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.430
 without the one of atlante and here good then 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.870
 when it appeared that it is based 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.190
 Atlantean gives me the impression that he is 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.410
 advanced position at the moment of 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.350
 receive the ball and the certain thing is that 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.810
 delgadillo does not mark this action at 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.510
 90 minute good with two minutes of 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.910
 replacement time makes the third goal 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.459
 the shooting team is 3 for 0 on 3 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.390
 by 1 it gets bigger than it was 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.930
 let's say until the 85th minute the game yes 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.000
 the marker 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.920
 reflects precisely what happened in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.590
 the playing field and good atlante 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.209
 it lacks moves to the front and the 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.159
 few that have them wasted in what 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.709
 that we already saw that he made the fonseca kikin 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.329
 I had already had in the initial part a 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.549
 played in also hits infamous to the 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.129
 ball and good because the atlante is still 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.709
 that slide where it seems that no 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.019
 have say a downhill but pure 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.139
 uphill and lack of idea is missing 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.200
 clarity needs to strengthen in area 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.299
 defensive and greater solidity in midfield 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.950
 one a midfield balance because a 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.530
 throughout the game they were 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.829
 eating that part to the atlante and tigers 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.720
 well with this result does not separate into 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.939
 the general table is fighting there the 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.799
 possibility of advancing in a result 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.569
 very important you have to remember that 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.489
 they have a pending game in front of 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.609
 america yes yes and still have the 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.919
 opportunity to add yet 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.019
 mathematically with possibilities of 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.549
 enter the group and because he mentioned 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.549
 this is good because a team like 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.370
 tigers with such a complete campus so 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.199
 wide so rich can not be forgiven 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.800
 to ricardo the tuca ferretti that does not achieve 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.480
 the qualification 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.030
 the result of veracruz that reached 18 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.520
 they are not taken off because tigers are already 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.350
 17 points then there is that 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.200
 possibility of fighting in the 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:20.360
 position 11 position 12 but not 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.360
 take off in this final stretch
