00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
section below but really personally I

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.840

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
think I'm call of duty doing this again

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.719 
think I'm call of duty doing this again
is<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.750> best<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.220> smartest

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
is not the best it's not the smartest

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.120 
is not the best it's not the smartest
thing<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.390> at<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.229> point<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
thing to do at this point because of the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.030 
thing to do at this point because of the
good<00:01:53.310> reputation<00:01:54.030> they<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.390> oh<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:55.320> guess<00:01:55.710> I

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
good reputation they have oh I guess I

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.800 
good reputation they have oh I guess I
guess<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.520> could<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.729> debatable<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.689> I'm

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
guess that could be debatable but I'm

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.060 
guess that could be debatable but I'm
just<00:01:57.960> going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.110> move<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.619> second
