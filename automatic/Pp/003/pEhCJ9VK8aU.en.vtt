00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.649
 you 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.210
 same sea as you follow very good guys 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.920
 I am of treatment and attention all because 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.370
 we are in the news enough 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.169
 important world of fans of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.660
 nintendo already thinks about the new console 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:23.489
 substitute for which effectively already 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.730
 thinks Nintendo's new console 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:29.340
 After-dinner that will reach our 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.619
 homes is more with the evidence that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.620
 nintendo because it has not been at all 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.960
 accepted with the launch of wii in a 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.910
 perhaps inappropriate timing taking into 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.899
 mind that was approaching and that and all 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.260
 we know 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.760
 playstation 4 and xbox one both 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.059
 logically with superior hardware that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.969
 would zomba to the nintendo console if 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.949
 to this we add that good the relationship 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.800
 of nintendo and third-party developers 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.600
 you have not or has not really been everything 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.609
 fruitful things that could be expected with the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 support for window we are 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.769
 Currently the catalog window 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.760
 is far from being desired by many 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.200
 gamers this is all these facts are 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.939
 they have translated into nothing 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.020
 low sales of the console 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.610
 Nintendo and Nintendo has just presented 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.979
 your sales forecasts for the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.380
 exercise in progress announcing a new 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.810
 a debacle 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.119
 difficult to sustain of the 9 million 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.460
 units that they planned to sell have 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.829
 reduced the figure to 2.5 million for 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.990
 this current exercise is why 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.060
 in parallel to all this information os 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.270
 I'm giving also announced a 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.270
 strong investment in R &amp; D in order to 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.009
 throw soon sooner than later a 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.810
 new console that returns the company 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.970
 Japan those wonderful figures 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.270
 achieved with the first wii so that 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.159
 I would be thinking of a wii 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.020
 well at the height of xbox and playstation 4 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.259
 nintendo is sure to give you the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.500
 return from this situation and really 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.600
 Well, let's hope so, but 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.330
 a question comes up or maybe 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.800
 a little thing to the head and is what is going to 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.280
 go with all those who have 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.370
 named the juve 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.680
 currently either they are spending 250 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:26.319
 350 euros or dollars for a person who 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.270
 maybe it's only two or three years 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.550
 in the market 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.100
 it becomes difficult it reminds me a lot of the 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.520
 situation of lashing simply that by 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.140
 sega stopped making consoles not 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.180
 thank god 'nintendo is lucky 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.650
 of having enough economic potential not 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.750
 today and make a console at the height of 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.340
 the characteristics of the next-gen or of 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.150
 the current generation and the playstation 4 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.610
 and the xbox one 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.110
 and well this is I think that is what 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.170
 I had to have done or be the wind you 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.970
 was for me a console that 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.400
 technologically it was out of date and 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.230
 same day of his departure and did not have 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.870
 will be raised and you have not expected a 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.840
 couple of years and have adapted to 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.269
 technical characteristics of the external 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.670
 but it seems that this is what is going 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.090
 to do they are already preparing their new 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.549
 william to say it wing 2 or as 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.879
