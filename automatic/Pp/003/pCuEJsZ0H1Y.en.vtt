00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
because I couldn't really figure out I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.610 
because I couldn't really figure out I
couldn't<00:00:39.420> think<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> best<00:00:40.110> way<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> didn't

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

couldn't think of the best way I didn't
know<00:00:40.710> if<00:00:40.800> they<00:00:40.890> needed<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.340> be<00:00:42.149> germinated<00:00:42.719> in

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
the best way to germinate these guys I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.810 
the best way to germinate these guys I
would<00:01:53.850> say<00:01:54.229> would<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.770> do<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.460> ziplock

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
would say would be to do in a ziplock

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.160 
would say would be to do in a ziplock
bag<00:01:57.060> with<00:01:57.360> some<00:01:57.509> paper<00:01:57.719> towel<00:01:57.960> um<00:01:59.869> future<00:02:00.869> kids

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
bag with some paper towel um future kids

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.260 
bag with some paper towel um future kids
don't<00:02:01.380> need<00:02:01.469> sunlight<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.040> germinate<00:02:02.969> like

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
don't need sunlight to germinate like

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.249 
don't need sunlight to germinate like
some<00:02:03.630> seeds<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:05.149> don't<00:02:06.149> know<00:02:06.540> what<00:02:06.780> those<00:02:06.990> seeds

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
some seeds I don't know what those seeds

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.359 
some seeds I don't know what those seeds
are<00:02:07.439> offhand<00:02:07.979> but

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
are offhand but

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.860 
are offhand but
I<00:02:09.720> think<00:02:10.720> this<00:02:10.929> is<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.230> best<00:02:11.410> way<00:02:11.650> because

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
I think this is the best way because

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.809 
I think this is the best way because
that<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.019> says<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.440> can<00:02:14.530> take<00:02:14.590> up<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.920> 35<00:02:15.550> days

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
that it says it can take up to 35 days

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.600 
that it says it can take up to 35 days
for<00:02:16.209> these<00:02:16.330> things<00:02:16.629> to<00:02:16.840> germinate<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:18.190> I've

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
for these things to germinate and I've

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:27.140

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
here

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.949 
here
not<00:03:46.690> quite<00:03:46.900> germinated<00:03:47.440> yet<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:48.959> they've

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
not quite germinated yet and they've

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.740 
not quite germinated yet and they've
been<00:03:50.260> longer<00:03:51.120> they've<00:03:52.120> been<00:03:52.299> in<00:03:52.419> the<00:03:52.540> other

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
been longer they've been in the other

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.710 
been longer they've been in the other
way<00:03:53.019> about<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.680> week<00:03:53.919> longer<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.609> that<00:03:55.540> was

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
way about a week longer and that was

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.300 
way about a week longer and that was
basically<00:03:56.200> just<00:03:56.319> a<00:03:56.590> container<00:03:56.829> with<00:03:57.130> some

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
basically just a container with some

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.479 
basically just a container with some
saran<00:03:57.669> wrap<00:03:57.849> over<00:03:57.970> top<00:03:58.299> and<00:04:01.380> yeah<00:04:02.380> so<00:04:02.919> I<00:04:03.250> think

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
saran wrap over top and yeah so I think

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.120 
saran wrap over top and yeah so I think
this<00:04:03.760> is<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:04.180> other<00:04:04.329> way<00:04:04.540> this<00:04:04.900> ziplock<00:04:05.590> bag

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.349 

ordeal<00:04:09.569> is<00:04:10.569> a<00:04:10.630> better<00:04:10.930> way<00:04:11.109> so<00:04:11.430> I'm<00:04:12.430> gonna<00:04:12.579> very

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
ordeal is a better way so I'm gonna very

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.289 
ordeal is a better way so I'm gonna very
briefly<00:04:13.690> show<00:04:13.810> you<00:04:13.989> how<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.319> do<00:04:14.470> this

distance<00:04:27.940> long<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:29.050> know

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
distance long you know

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.570 
distance long you know
maybe<00:04:29.740> 9<00:04:30.550> 10<00:04:30.880> inches<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.650> then<00:04:32.650> place<00:04:33.550> your

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
maybe 9 10 inches and then place your

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.750 
maybe 9 10 inches and then place your
seeds<00:04:34.060> Oh<00:04:35.760> an<00:04:36.760> inch<00:04:36.940> part<00:04:37.450> half<00:04:38.430> maybe<00:04:39.430> an<00:04:39.640> inch

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
seeds Oh an inch part half maybe an inch

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.880 
seeds Oh an inch part half maybe an inch
and<00:04:39.820> a<00:04:39.910> half<00:04:39.970> or<00:04:40.510> if<00:04:41.140> you<00:04:41.260> put<00:04:41.470> three<00:04:41.710> in<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.860> row

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
and a half or if you put three in a row

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.260 
and a half or if you put three in a row
then<00:04:42.190> about<00:04:42.430> an<00:04:42.790> inch<00:04:43.720> apart<00:04:44.040> then<00:04:45.040> fold<00:04:45.910> a

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
then about an inch apart then fold a

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.540 
then about an inch apart then fold a
chunk<00:04:46.720> of<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:46.930> paper<00:04:47.110> towel<00:04:47.380> over<00:04:48.040> top<00:04:50.550> then

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
chunk of the paper towel over top then

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.710 
chunk of the paper towel over top then
the<00:04:51.580> next<00:04:52.360> fold<00:04:52.930> over<00:04:53.260> top<00:04:53.470> again<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.720> repeat

the next fold over top again and repeat

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.340 
the next fold over top again and repeat
and<00:04:55.930> that's<00:04:56.440> basically<00:04:57.840> how<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.870> do<00:04:59.050> and<00:04:59.230> then

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
and that's basically how to do and then

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.050 
and that's basically how to do and then
you<00:04:59.470> just<00:04:59.500> put<00:04:59.890> it<00:05:00.010> inside<00:05:00.280> this<00:05:00.430> ziplock<00:05:00.670> bag

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
you just put it inside this ziplock bag

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.480 
you just put it inside this ziplock bag
and<00:05:01.090> leave<00:05:01.420> a<00:05:01.450> little<00:05:01.720> bit<00:05:01.900> of<00:05:02.140> air<00:05:03.010> in<00:05:03.310> there

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
and leave a little bit of air in there

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.070 
and leave a little bit of air in there
and<00:05:03.840> then<00:05:04.840> you<00:05:05.080> get<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:05.950> fairly<00:05:06.850> wet<00:05:07.180> I<00:05:07.420> made<00:05:07.930> it

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
and then you get it fairly wet I made it

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.080 
and then you get it fairly wet I made it
pretty<00:05:08.320> moist<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:09.250> then<00:05:09.400> just<00:05:09.640> zip<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:09.940> bag

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
pretty moist and then just zip the bag

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.540 
pretty moist and then just zip the bag
up<00:05:10.300> and<00:05:10.480> in<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.110> week<00:05:11.290> or<00:05:11.440> two<00:05:11.500> check<00:05:12.190> on<00:05:12.370> them

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
up and in a week or two check on them

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.520 
up and in a week or two check on them
and<00:05:12.580> make<00:05:12.910> sure<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:13.900> they're<00:05:14.110> still<00:05:14.350> wet<00:05:14.590> and

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
and make sure that they're still wet and

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.409 
and make sure that they're still wet and
then<00:05:17.530> your<00:05:17.890> they<00:05:18.669> will<00:05:18.700> germinate<00:05:18.940> really

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
then your they will germinate really

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.630 
then your they will germinate really
fast
