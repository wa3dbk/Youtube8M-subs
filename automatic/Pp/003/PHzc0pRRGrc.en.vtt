definitely are you gonna be checking out

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.009 
definitely are you gonna be checking out
it<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.030> speak<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.420> running<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.750> panels

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it in the speak is running the panels

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.890 
it in the speak is running the panels
like<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.320> um<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:05.400> think<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.479> deal<00:01:06.720> is

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
like that um I think that the deal is

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.170 
like that um I think that the deal is
bands<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:07.920> they<00:01:08.010> get<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.460> industry<00:01:08.939> past

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
bands on they get like one industry past

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.660 
bands on they get like one industry past
so<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.960> think<00:01:10.350> only<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.010> us<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.220> go<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
so I think only one of us can go and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.039 
so I think only one of us can go and
watch<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.060> speakers<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.659> stuff<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.990> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
watch like speakers and stuff like that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.609 
watch like speakers and stuff like that
so<00:01:14.000> we<00:01:15.000> don't<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.479> pass<00:01:15.630> ourselves<00:01:15.930> but

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
so we don't have the pass ourselves but

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.910 
so we don't have the pass ourselves but
our<00:01:16.860> manager<00:01:17.610> took<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.240> oh<00:01:18.590> just<00:01:19.590> spend

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
