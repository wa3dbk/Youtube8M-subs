00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.949 
space on a small footprint just kind of
where<00:02:32.790> we're<00:02:32.910> going<00:02:32.940> with<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.600> whole<00:02:33.720> notion

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
where we're going with the whole notion

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.650 
where we're going with the whole notion
of<00:02:34.110> calling<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.620> ii4<00:02:35.160> innovators<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:36.600> a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
of calling it the ii4 innovators it's a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.360 
of calling it the ii4 innovators it's a
fairly<00:02:36.870> innovative<00:02:37.230> vehicle<00:02:37.890> idea<00:02:38.160> because

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
fairly innovative vehicle idea because

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.699 
fairly innovative vehicle idea because
it<00:02:38.459> places<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:39.030> engine<00:02:39.540> reared<00:02:39.959> midship

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
it places the engine reared midship

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.650 
it places the engine reared midship
location<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.580> engines<00:02:42.000> actually<00:02:42.240> ahead

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
location so the engines actually ahead

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.780 
location so the engines actually ahead
of<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.900> rear<00:02:43.050> axle<00:02:43.410> maximizing<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.370> interior

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
of the rear axle maximizing the interior

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.330 
of the rear axle maximizing the interior
space<00:02:45.090> as<00:02:45.300> well<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> lot<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.709> lot<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.190> new

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
space as well so a lot of lot of new

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.740 
space as well so a lot of lot of new
thinking<00:02:47.610> went<00:02:47.880> into<00:02:48.000> developing<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.570> small

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.710 
thinking went into developing the small

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
car now of course with any car it's all

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.570 
car now of course with any car it's all
about<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.260> drive<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.830> comfort<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.489> the

about the drive and the comfort of the
drive<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.420> have<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.690> tell<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.020> I'm<00:02:55.170> pretty

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
drive and I have to tell you I'm pretty

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.740 
drive and I have to tell you I'm pretty
impressed<00:02:55.650> with<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.220> vehicle<00:02:56.489> it's<00:02:57.150> easy<00:02:57.540> to

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
impressed with this vehicle it's easy to

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.040 
impressed with this vehicle it's easy to
steer<00:02:58.110> it's<00:02:58.700> extremely<00:02:59.700> quiet<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.810> course

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.160 
steer it's extremely quiet and of course
I<00:03:01.350> feel<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.220> much<00:03:02.400> better<00:03:02.700> because<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.630> almost

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
I feel so much better because I almost

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.730 
I feel so much better because I almost
