00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.460
 Held at the Japan Science Future Museum 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.390
 At the 4th Robot Award Ceremony 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.020
 Developed by Maekawa Electric Co., Ltd. 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.090
 Automatic bone removing robot for pork thigh 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.800
 "Hamdasuar" is the best 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.580
 Received the Small and Medium Venture Business Award 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.079
 How to attach meat and thickness of bone 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.499
 Different pork thighs, such as how to twist 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.749
 Skilled technology for removing bones 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.579
 It has been required 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.009
 At Hamdas Aal, craftsmanship tips 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.870
 For processing procedure and operation mechanism 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.820
 We succeeded in taking in automation 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.260
 At Hamdasal 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.240
 Food called amorphous soft body 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.750
 We realized automation of meat 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.980
 Together in the food processing field 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.910
 Robotization is 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.080
 I did not go ahead 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.180
 This is also to automate the food 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.020
 Need to mechanize craftsmanship 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.370
 I can not but rely on human hands 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.140
 Mechanization is quite easy 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.360
 And that it was difficult to mechanize 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.280
 Since it is a food factory after cleaning 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.290
 In terms of environmental issues 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.830
 As environment to put in robot 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.080
 Very tough things 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.350
 Where it was 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.290
 Inside there was not going 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.420
 By Hamdas Ale 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.990
 Because we have realized 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.000
 In the future, food inflexible 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.650
 Robot advances in automation 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.740
 We are thinking about expanding the possibilities 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.070
 So far 500 pig thighs per hour 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.159
 The deboning process was performed by 20 people 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.100
 By using Hamdasal 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.909
 We were able to get the saving effect of 10 people 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.760
 In addition, production planning with stable processing capacity 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.200
 It became easy to set up 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.420
 From now on, mainly in Europe Japan 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.539
 We plan to develop sales to countries around the world 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.780
 By the way 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.140
 If you catch it, it is fish in general food 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.450
 All things are vegetables 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.220
 It can be enclosed in the framework of an indeterminate soft body 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.000
 As our company is an irregular soft body 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.790
 Know-how of automation 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.099
 Accumulated and versatile in all fields 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.310
 What is called an irregular soft general purpose system 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.159
 I want to build
