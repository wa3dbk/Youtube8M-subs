 it is very annoying but yes I will 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.039
 better but what in your gameplay is a 206 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.410
 aundrey and the album became color and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.510
 I think this is the most number of money that 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.530
 to influence in a game of cargo by 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.840
 nation has been reached 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.660
 I have not seen this higher 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.909
 xbox and xbox one tess still looked 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.340
 the all head i was you so close did u 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.930
 I give him 206 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.430
 oh my god yes it was such a dirty thing i went 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.030
 once dead because of my own mistake 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.909
 it like 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.560
 bad me so just come off 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.560
 the check mark and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.360
 not always everything comes in from me 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.130
 four legs dead and was made of lions 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.329
 stupid mistakes second date i had was 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.850
 for my own school and the third time 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.590
 not a gamer but yes that just two 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.840
 bowls 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.210
 jet ski what and that should really happen 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.700
 would have been much higher than me 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.370
 not by but very shape was turned around 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.590
 yes i will have mine 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.450
 I pushed over my own shape 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.400
 record upstairs 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.140
 yes that is very much a shame because me 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.840
 maybe had 22 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.550
 who knows it seemed shit go him this one 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.740
 great grace like that 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.600
 man the man man the bad and my pale 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.070
 always something for it 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.060
 to the end of the first hundred 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.740
 you still see a lot then just go whole 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.760
 what one site still looks four to five 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.430
 in or something 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.460
 purple reconnecting grand, well, just 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.880
 immediately and was still something funny 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.650
 at the start of the 2nd round 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.660
 because five flip is always like were ark 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.470
 relax than to catch me we do not we 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.370
 flip is immediately at their tightening 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.940
 and yes then we expressa we do not 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.740
 you sure the social kevlar and what 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.100
 so we happened that the emmys are just 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.380
 not agents and I over molding oh shit 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.410
 then what will actually not at all 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.640
 I purchase 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.710
 catch that thing that five had to do 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.510
 first again 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.820
 eye catcher when we get that from one 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.250
 faint weather 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.710
 what they dammers relax when i have 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.440
 will still be Ghana and finally 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.070
 really it 's been two minutes in the second 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.160
 below 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.620
 finally saw the app and heard about it 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.100
 find their entire head to size or so 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.900
 and achieved that thing so much speed 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.450
 it just a little boring work so i have 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.180
 that piece accompanies this video cut 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.400
 because your son looks to what extent I am sitting 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.710
 here with you to wander and there so well 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.940
 just by those monkeys on my emails from 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.830
 not good 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.980
 just a shame I was sorry for me 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.600
 once I jumped was something like 113 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.630
 tiles first round 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.950
 immediately and I just give 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.069
 motherfucking 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.650
 and this is that of the best game criss-cross 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.010
 core line are what hang down here than 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.010
 nuclear 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.000
 from jorik because minute lasts then the plus 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.280
 my 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.900
 most of them kill you call or duty 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.810
 historic chopping has never been red gold 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.730
 or this and yet very happy with this one 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.280
 camping overpressure a bit more traversal 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.000
 collection as delivery by the contractor 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.040
 even at that time with you a player 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.040
 check I just don't feel like it 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.230

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.769

 meat participated in research series pro5 and 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.210

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.710
 you stop a few people and so on 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.020

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.120
 crucible account 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.340
 and that goat research that he and then go 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.490
 I get mobile so quickly from the moment the 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.960
 started workspace because I am sick and 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.090
 I do n't have to defeat the influence of 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.430
 the headache 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:50.320
 from the moment the workspace 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:53.199
 i started going live u me and so so fast 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.479
 possible try to be fake for 550 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:56.620
 there as high an adn apron moment as possible 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.330
 to keep 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.520
 I just go that I add what you still where 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.199
 thought they just hadn't been so whole 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.580
 much of it I have it 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:10.060
 and try to master as quickly as possible 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:12.009
 or to become smaller and last time or 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.130
 us me when i look'd a lion like in 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:17.169
 two hours if I will take 550 count 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.380
 so going a little less likely 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:21.909
 because I just didn't do the reason it works 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.960
 then in orange are whole anyway 

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:27.039
 easy to be there but you wanted forests 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.810

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:31.659
