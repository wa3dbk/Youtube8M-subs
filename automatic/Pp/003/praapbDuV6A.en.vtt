00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.349
 decoration with newspaper on the basis of 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.230
 French manicure now what I'm going to 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.660
 do is the French but upside down the 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.520
 French manicure of letters upside down what 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.540
 what I'm going to do is place in all the 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:30.220
 bottom part what would be the base the 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.689
 text and the tip will run out of letters 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.570
 then I cut out a piece of paper 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.010
 more or less the width of my nail I'm going to 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.890
 catch with the tweezers 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.710
 and I'm going to immerse him in alcohol 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 and now 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.690
 since 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.690
 more or less here exactly 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.010
 down 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.250
 is where the letters are going to be 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.190
 see if I can hold it like this so that 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.239
 it moves it 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.159
 Well now I 'm in a tight spot 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.020
 I add if I need a little more 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.500
 alcohol 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.500
 very well 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.110
 voilÃ  there you see we are good a little bit 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.830
 because the paper moved but good for 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.830
 that you see the idea 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.060
 to give it a more original touch I'm going to 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.060
 place a blue color 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.850
 to enhance the French 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.570
 for example 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.510
 you can make it more straight more curved 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.720
 well it's more or less for you to take the 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.720
 idea 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.560
 Exactly see if a way can be left 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.090
 original also to make it French 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.489
 how I got the letters for the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.160
 skin with a stick of these 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.750
 cotton swabs what I'm going to 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.810
 do is 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.160
 wet it and go through the skin with a lot 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.130
 careful not to touch the nail 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.460
 and that way I take off the letters of 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.460
 the skin 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.520
 A) Yes 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.960
 and now once the enamel is dry 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.580
 so he applied the shine layer 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.150
 so that it lasts much longer this 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.150
 decor 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.080
 a nightmare 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.460
 without dragging a lot 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.900
 and in this original way there are 2 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.900
 French manicures very original
