technology is inside this canister we

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.109 
technology is inside this canister we
still<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> original<00:01:44.070> cone<00:01:44.520> inside<00:01:44.970> of

still have the original cone inside of

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.940 
still have the original cone inside of
here<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:45.810> now<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:45.960> hidden<00:01:46.350> away<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.680> give

here but now it's hidden away to give

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.620 
here but now it's hidden away to give
you<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> modern-day<00:01:47.640> look<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.210> modern<00:01:48.540> day

you a modern-day look in modern day

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.539 
you a modern-day look in modern day
performance<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> reason<00:01:50.250> why<00:01:50.340> that's

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
performance now the reason why that's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.490 
performance now the reason why that's
important<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.329> these<00:01:51.840> are<00:01:51.899> designed<00:01:52.380> to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
important is that these are designed to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.649 
important is that these are designed to
fit<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.860> 70s<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.490> 80s<00:01:53.610> maybe<00:01:54.000> even<00:01:54.390> early

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
fit on the 70s and 80s maybe even early

amount of air restriction now I touched
a<00:03:24.780> little<00:03:24.989> bit<00:03:25.079> earlier<00:03:25.350> about<00:03:25.410> power<00:03:25.890> wise<00:03:26.160> if

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
a little bit earlier about power wise if

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.250 
a little bit earlier about power wise if
you<00:03:26.820> guys<00:03:26.940> really<00:03:27.420> want<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.780> unlock<00:03:28.079> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
you guys really want to unlock the

performance machine

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.440 
performance machine
maybe<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.610> should<00:03:29.760> pair<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.000> with<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.209> higher

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
maybe you should pair this with a higher

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.390 
maybe you should pair this with a higher
flow<00:03:30.750> filter<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.530> which<00:03:31.680> again<00:03:31.829> once<00:03:32.160> again

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400

if<00:03:32.519> you're<00:03:32.610> doing<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.940> mix<00:03:33.180> your<00:03:33.360> reject<00:03:33.780> or

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
if you're doing that mix your reject or

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.080 
if you're doing that mix your reject or
also<00:03:34.470> even<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:34.980> high-performance<00:03:35.579> carburetor

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
also even a high-performance carburetor

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.690 
also even a high-performance carburetor
which<00:03:36.450> DG<00:03:36.959> once<00:03:37.140> again<00:03:37.380> sells<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.549> way

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
which DG once again sells so that way

which DG once again sells so that way
you're<00:03:38.970> really<00:03:39.299> looking<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.690> machine<00:03:39.959> breathe

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
you're really looking a machine breathe

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.509 
you're really looking a machine breathe
you're<00:03:40.470> really<00:03:40.739> letting<00:03:40.890> that<00:03:41.070> powerful<00:03:41.370> go

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
you're really letting that powerful go

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.860 
you're really letting that powerful go
through<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.420> means<00:03:42.540> you're<00:03:42.720> really

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
through and it means you're really

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.870 
through and it means you're really
unlocking<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.620> hidden<00:03:43.859> potential<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.430> that

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
unlocking the hidden potential of that

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.210 
unlocking the hidden potential of that
older<00:03:45.120> engine<00:03:45.480> now<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.440> do<00:03:46.530> also<00:03:46.890> want<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.100> point

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
older engine now I do also want to point

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.190 
older engine now I do also want to point
out<00:03:47.340> once<00:03:47.670> again<00:03:47.940> towards<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.239> RCM<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.900> hear

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
out once again towards the RCM to hear

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.410 
out once again towards the RCM to hear
that<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:49.799> comes<00:03:50.100> in<00:03:50.280> only<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.730> steel<00:03:51.180> body

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
that this comes in only a steel body

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.240 
that this comes in only a steel body
stainless<00:03:51.959> steel<00:03:52.140> body<00:03:52.350> which<00:03:52.920> means<00:03:53.100> it's

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
stainless steel body which means it's

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.470 
stainless steel body which means it's
not<00:03:53.370> going<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.640> rust<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:54.030> going<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.209> be<00:03:54.299> very

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
not going to rust it's going to be very

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.000 
not going to rust it's going to be very
very<00:03:54.720> strong<00:03:54.959> but<00:03:55.410> it's<00:03:55.560> also<00:03:55.680> going<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:55.890> be<00:03:55.980> a

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
very strong but it's also going to be a

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.130 
very strong but it's also going to be a
little<00:03:56.130> bit<00:03:56.280> heavier<00:03:56.640> than<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.269> RCM<00:03:57.750> one

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140
