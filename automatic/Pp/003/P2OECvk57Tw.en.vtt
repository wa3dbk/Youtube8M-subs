what I'm doing is I had a mine was

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.310 
what I'm doing is I had a mine was
broken<00:02:29.989> so<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.410> put<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:31.900> put<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.930> new<00:02:33.110> one<00:02:33.260> in

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
broken so I put a I put a new one in

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.090 
broken so I put a I put a new one in
that<00:02:33.620> work<00:02:33.830> but<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:36.140> control<00:02:36.590> when<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.890> works

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
that work but the control when it works

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.580 
that work but the control when it works
so<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.910> would<00:02:38.060> turn<00:02:38.300> when<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.230> did<00:02:39.470> the

so it would turn when I did the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.420 
so it would turn when I did the
diagnostic<00:02:40.340> test<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.950> wouldn't<00:02:43.250> turn

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
diagnostic test but it wouldn't turn

until it blinks I was originally getting
code<00:03:03.290> 20<00:03:03.620> for<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.640> mode<00:03:05.030> door<00:03:05.209> actuator<00:03:05.709> so<00:03:06.709> I

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
code 20 for the mode door actuator so I

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.380 
code 20 for the mode door actuator so I
changed<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.280> out<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.700> then<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:07.910> was<00:03:08.030> getting

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
changed that out and then I was getting

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.660 
changed that out and then I was getting
cold<00:03:08.630> 36<00:03:09.320> for<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.660> control<00:03:11.660> head<00:03:12.670> control

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
cold 36 for the control head control

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:22.509 
cold 36 for the control head control
head<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:16.600> so<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.860> turn<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:19.549> turn<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.930> vent<00:03:21.519> piece

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
head so so I turn I turn the vent piece

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.720 
head so so I turn I turn the vent piece
by<00:03:23.390> hands<00:03:23.900> just<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.350> wheel<00:03:24.560> down<00:03:24.829> there<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.579> make

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
by hands just a wheel down there to make

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.350 
by hands just a wheel down there to make
it<00:03:25.850> come<00:03:26.000> out<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.239> vents<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:30.079> then<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:31.360> plugged

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
it come out the vents and then I plugged

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.860 
it come out the vents and then I plugged
in<00:03:32.600> a<00:03:32.630> new<00:03:33.590> actuator<00:03:34.160> so<00:03:35.090> we<00:03:35.329> turned<00:03:35.630> during

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
in a new actuator so we turned during

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.750 
in a new actuator so we turned during
the<00:03:35.930> diagnostic<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.739> once<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.100> stops<00:03:37.459> where<00:03:37.730> I

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
the diagnostic and once it stops where I

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.120 
the diagnostic and once it stops where I
needed<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.299> be<00:03:38.329> unplugged<00:03:38.959> it<00:03:39.140> then<00:03:40.100> I

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
needed it to be unplugged it then I

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.740 
needed it to be unplugged it then I
plugged<00:03:40.400> everything<00:03:40.640> back<00:03:41.060> in<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.540> hooked<00:03:41.660> it

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
plugged everything back in and hooked it

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.870 
plugged everything back in and hooked it
all<00:03:41.870> back<00:03:42.110> up<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:42.950> was<00:03:43.070> working<00:03:43.340> fine<00:03:43.549> for<00:03:43.850> a

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
all back up it was working fine for a

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.490 
all back up it was working fine for a
while<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.239> then<00:03:44.390> I<00:03:44.480> guess<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.810> reset<00:03:45.200> itself

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
while and then I guess I reset itself

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.120 
while and then I guess I reset itself
and<00:03:45.739> then<00:03:45.829> it<00:03:45.920> went<00:03:46.010> back<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.250> defrost<00:03:47.049> so<00:03:48.130> now

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
and then it went back to defrost so now

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.680 
and then it went back to defrost so now
what<00:03:49.340> I'm<00:03:49.459> doing<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:49.910> I'm<00:03:50.090> just<00:03:50.120> going<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.480> put

what I'm doing is I'm just going to put
the<00:03:50.780> broken<00:03:50.989> one<00:03:51.290> back<00:03:51.470> in<00:03:51.680> temporarily<00:03:52.450> till

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
the broken one back in temporarily till

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.180 
the broken one back in temporarily till
I<00:03:53.600> can<00:03:53.690> get<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.019> control<00:03:54.709> fixed

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
I can get the control fixed

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.940 
I can get the control fixed
and<00:03:56.280> what<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.120> did<00:03:57.420> was<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.840> took<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.380> broken<00:03:58.590> one

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
and what I did was I took the broken one

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.170 
and what I did was I took the broken one
I<00:03:59.190> popped<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.270> top<00:04:00.690> piece<00:04:00.930> off<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.560> then<00:04:02.430> pull

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
I popped the top piece off and then pull

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.880 
I popped the top piece off and then pull
this<00:04:03.360> piece<00:04:03.630> out<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:03.930> then<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.380> turns<00:04:04.650> no

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
this piece out and then it turns no

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.970 
this piece out and then it turns no
problem<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.520> then<00:04:05.580> I<00:04:05.640> lined<00:04:05.970> up<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.980> lined

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
problem and then I lined up the I lined

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.670 
problem and then I lined up the I lined
it<00:04:08.130> up<00:04:08.280> right<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:08.790> then<00:04:09.360> put<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:09.660> back<00:04:09.960> in<00:04:10.170> so

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
it up right and then put that back in so

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.770 
it up right and then put that back in so
now<00:04:10.890> it's<00:04:11.070> lined<00:04:11.310> up<00:04:11.490> I'll<00:04:12.360> just<00:04:12.510> put<00:04:12.690> the

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
now it's lined up I'll just put the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.780 
now it's lined up I'll just put the
cover<00:04:12.960> back<00:04:13.080> on<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.740> put<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.040> back<00:04:14.190> in<00:04:14.400> and

cover back on and put it back in and

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.470 
cover back on and put it back in and
then<00:04:15.630> shouldn't<00:04:16.260> move<00:04:16.380> because<00:04:16.680> it's<00:04:16.860> busted

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
then shouldn't move because it's busted

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.170 
then shouldn't move because it's busted
for<00:04:18.480> temporary<00:04:19.700> just<00:04:20.700> for<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:20.940> little<00:04:21.060> while

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
for temporary just for a little while

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.480 
for temporary just for a little while
it's<00:04:21.720> not<00:04:21.810> too<00:04:22.049> important<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.890> have<00:04:23.010> defrost

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
it's not too important to have defrost

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.750 
it's not too important to have defrost
and<00:04:23.700> Eira's<00:04:23.910> on<00:04:24.060> anyway<00:04:24.450> for<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.840> while<00:04:25.580> until<00:04:26.580> I

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
and Eira's on anyway for a while until I

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.900 
and Eira's on anyway for a while until I
get<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.200> get<00:04:28.200> that<00:04:28.230> piece<00:04:28.590> fixed<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:32.700> that's

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
get a get that piece fixed and that's

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.820 
get a get that piece fixed and that's
about<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.360> put<00:04:33.660> everything<00:04:33.870> in<00:04:34.140> Reverse<00:04:34.350> of

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
about it put everything in Reverse of

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.830 
about it put everything in Reverse of
removal<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:36.800> spot<00:04:37.800> it
