 this new video and well I bring you 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.670
 a gameplay of the revolution for 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.920
 talk to them about information that 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.690
 it came out about naruto storm 4 and it's that 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.940
 well there was a small event where 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.250
 showed a new topic about this 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.140
 game how good was the battle of hai and 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.450
 gamma against wood that well we already know 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.460
 that they handle what is the man of 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.010
 wood and what is the club and dressed with 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.660
 what is the susano ok then good 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.550
 new images came out regarding 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.200
 this the gameplay can look for in 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.120
 internet so I can not put that good 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.850
 who who raised it good put him 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.109
 too many watermarks then do not 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.210
 I can upload precisely for reasons 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.980
 of copyright and more than anything comfort 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.500
 for you not that you are seeing me something 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.079
 of that nature ok then well then 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.940
 the gameplay showed something that many 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.550
 let's say we expected it to be a 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.230
 little bit the graphic aspect but also 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.480
 you can see more or less how it was 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.370
 is the gameplay aspect not then 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.140
 good in what is the video can see 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.460
 some of the good things left the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.650
 here in the description but good 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.260
 it will be up to you to look but good 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.330
 here the images that show us good 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.390
 a graphic quality very similar to what 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.159
 what is 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.370
 this revolution rather the states 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.900
 previous however you see something something 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.119
 How good is this classic 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.420
 generation and good are sparks or 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.130
 sparks the particles that good come out 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.810
 let's say in the simple not something so 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.240
 well we already know in halo that there 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.369
 too many particles then this is 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.470
 something that is going to be and then present by 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.000
 what we see here in these four there 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.520
 we are going to have too many particles 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.770
 active in what is the view we already know 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.570
 that we are going to be so let's say that at 60 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.650
 pictures also then we hope that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.390
 the fact that they add so many 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.950
 particles do not affect the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.180
 already know that the frame rate in 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.520
 the naruto games is very normal 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.289
 So, well, these are the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.000
 images of time bands like them 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.009
 mentioned in what is the time and what 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.750
 you can search the internet for this 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.580
 let's say something like two minutes more or 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.960
 less than the combat looks pretty good 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.210
 but good if we make the voices 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.459
 fights in case of this game or more 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.140
 well this saga are not so bad and 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.030
 said then I could consider them I 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.200
 pretty good, however, not good 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.519
 Well, you have to see how the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.140
 details of the gameplay in general and 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.000
 we know how good they are going to leave some 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.220
 mechanics of revolution at least so 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.230
 they said they plan to keep what is 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.670
 the word break the counterattack 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.650
 so then let's see how it goes 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.659
 as you want, the images look 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.340
 quite spectacular the sports like 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.980
 I mention they look pretty flashy 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.930
 I really liked the look they have 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.640
 I say in the pictures you can not see 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.590
 Sawtooth is something I hope 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.810
 that they really eliminate because it 's something 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.580
 quite annoying but good, you have to 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.290
 see how he does what is this game 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.760
 but well now, do not forget 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.780
 leave your law do not forget to share it with 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.069
 his friends and left here in the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.599
 comments how do you think 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.760
 images look good do not look good 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.739
 and what do you think then no good 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.489
 Well here I say goodbye to the next one and 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.489
 bye
