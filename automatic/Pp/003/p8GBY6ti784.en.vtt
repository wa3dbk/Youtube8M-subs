 happen it can just lose it 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.400
 he is already in herself until the moment when 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.529
 ronnie began to eat anything other than milk 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.840
 so as soon as it means eating different 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.580

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.009

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.079

 thing irreplaceable her favorite ronnie without 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.809

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.850
 she easily washes all food falls here in 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.100

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.989

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.600
 thing here in florida and has already become 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.170
 irreplaceable part of ronnie's image has become 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.180
 hat hat and he loves himself very much and i him 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.890
 especially not accustomed I'm just beginning 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.260
 it is very early for him to wear them as 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.290
 the sun is shining and you need to defend 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.750
 so somewhere from 4 5 months he already 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.290
 started wearing hats and now they have very 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.509
 love and no problem so that it 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.970
 make him wear a hat no he himself 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.340
 takes clothes we go for a walk also 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.270
 the right thing but in that clip go which we 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.189
 live when 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.650
 all year round the sun is shining 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.600

 very pleasant smell on very easy 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.130
 this cream is applied very thick in 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.560
 general in all respects he is very me 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.020
 I like to eat this baby balm 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.000
 this balm you can use to 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.790

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.490
 and really love them for the design and for that 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.009
 the effect which does not give therefore my 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.750
 best favorites next is your favorite 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.880
 the thing is early and you probably already could 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.490
 watch the latest video and 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.860
 scooter scooter he got this two 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.960
 months ago and during that time he is very 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.740
 confidently learned to ride it 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.380
 he can slow down 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.290
 through this obstacle is generally very 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.840
 he quickly learned himself on this scooter 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.210
 ride he showed a desire on the court 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.070
 there he took from the kids and now we decided to him 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.600
 buy a month ago not at all 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.210
 regretted because it really is 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.160
 favorite toy and always them he goes 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.620
 walking takes this scooter about 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.590
 what company chose scooter 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.390
 Firm micro mini you really are us 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.390
 here is the most popular kids scooter 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.690
 at the site because there is practically 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.730
 all colors are in several 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.100
 quantities on site and irony 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.900
 Already with the experience from tried different 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.870
 scooters for children and I can say for sure 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.020
 that this micro mini he is the best he 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.970
 on the most stable thanks to him 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.170
 probably here 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.970
 good quality is so quick and easy 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.590
 learned to ride because he 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.590
 tried to ride no other some 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.690
 simple scooters and he and fast 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.770
 left because he is not so 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.110
 it worked well 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.300
 so micro mini is the best firm for 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.700
 scooter for kids after visiting 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.460
 cities of atlanta and aquarium in this city 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.890
 ronnie was just delighted and from 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.200
 only left a mark on him 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.730
 because now he is and wherever he orders 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.730
 fishes here he has such a storm of emotions 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.520
 he loves fish will never pass 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.010
 past some aquarium at home and also we 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.709
 now replenishing the collection of toys and 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.050
 on the topic of fish from I wonder what he knows 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.870
 not only there whale dolphin shark 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.760
 some basic such he has 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.700
 special training materials he already 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:13.220
 may know there to distinguish perch cd 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.450
 flounder there butt halibut swordfish from itself 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.250
 of course for me it is very surprising 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.900
 because even I myself sometimes don't 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.240
 I understand and he can already without errors 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.040
 indicate what kind of fish and instead 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.850
 cartoons pit often now including 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.220
 movies on youtube about fish 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.229
 the inhabitants I have a feeling that 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.150
 when he starts talking about me already 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.479
 will start retelling these films and bc 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.880
 because he is watching so closely 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.789
 something argues there i think that this is it 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.009
 remembers well so give fish u 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.470
 we are everywhere everywhere now where is my 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.660
 go to the store and immediately notice everything 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.800
 use only with fish and that's it 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.380
 on this topic of fish 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.010
 we recently had a new bed 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.020
 ronni k and so accidentally can not by chance 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.680
 it turned out that she, too, has a marine theme 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.860
 our bed video boats are generally ronnie 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.289
 from birth sleeps separate first with him 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.870
 there was a crib my sweat 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.990
 gradually removed the front wall he 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.389
 asleep and now we have the time when 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.259
 we decided that the child needed this more 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:22.060
 adult bed and have been looking for a long time 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:25.570
 and here came across this wonderful 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.720
 bed boat from earlier now somewhere 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.650
 sleeps with in a separate room 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.990
 so here we are a little bit here 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.750
 ennoble doing people in such in 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.260
 sea- themed not soil thrushes bed 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.250
 her design because she's a sign 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.909
 natural wood 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:46.150
 very nice white wooden colors 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:48.460
 blue in general we are very pleased with it 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.710
 mayoral elections is not an enemy too but 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.650
 In general, I love wooden toys 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.360
 so some kind of incomprehensible love therefore 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.550
 basically all the toys drop to not 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.500
 Wooden I do not like plastics 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:06.970
 so he has different wood 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:10.060
 letters he has different puzzles 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.860
 wooden cars family love 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.650
 toys from natural materials and 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.440
 plastics practical except confident 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.380
 here is such a huge plastic machine 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.480
 we do not find 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.080
 so here are some of our favorite 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.810
 things are things roller toys and in all 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.310
