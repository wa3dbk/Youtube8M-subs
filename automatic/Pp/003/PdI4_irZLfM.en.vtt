00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
bends are an interesting little ditty we

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.480 
bends are an interesting little ditty we
covered<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:11.610> in<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.849> previous<00:00:12.269> lesson<00:00:13.490> but

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
covered this in a previous lesson but

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.730 
covered this in a previous lesson but
that<00:00:15.150> wasn't<00:00:15.450> too<00:00:15.570> well<00:00:15.750> received<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.529> we're

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
that wasn't too well received so we're

bends<00:00:20.279> are<00:00:20.490> contingent<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.150> couple<00:00:21.480> things

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
bends are contingent on a couple things

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.410 
bends are contingent on a couple things
one<00:00:22.080> how<00:00:22.949> could<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.250> pickups<00:00:23.580> are<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:24.150> how

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
one how could you pickups are to how

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.730 
one how could you pickups are to how
good<00:00:24.600> your<00:00:24.689> technique<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.439> three<00:00:25.619> how

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
good your technique is and three how

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.009 
good your technique is and three how
much<00:00:25.890> gain<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.609> your<00:00:26.730> amp<00:00:26.910> since<00:00:27.840> I'm

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
much gain you have on your amp since I'm

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.259 
much gain you have on your amp since I'm
playing<00:00:28.289> with<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.680> all<00:00:29.070> tube<00:00:29.400> head<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
playing with the all tube head and the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.590 
playing with the all tube head and the
tone<00:00:30.480> driver<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.170> that's<00:00:31.949> always<00:00:32.600> harmonics

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
tone driver and that's always harmonics

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.170 
tone driver and that's always harmonics
gonna<00:00:33.780> be<00:00:33.930> pretty<00:00:34.140> good<00:00:34.380> if<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.460> safe

not the excuses let's begin so always
try<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.760> make<00:00:50.969> sure<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.300> pickup<00:00:51.629> switch<00:00:51.750> is

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
try to make sure your pickup switch is

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.330 
try to make sure your pickup switch is
in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> bridge<00:00:52.379> position<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:53.039> want<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
in the bridge position you want the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.860 
in the bridge position you want the
hottest<00:00:53.550> pickup<00:00:54.120> which<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> bridge

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
hottest pickup which is the bridge

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.150 
hottest pickup which is the bridge
pickup<00:00:55.640> distorts<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> pedal<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.890> we'll<00:00:58.890> save

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
pickup distorts the pedal on we'll save

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.080 
pickup distorts the pedal on we'll save
that<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.640> minute

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
that for a minute

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.450 
that for a minute
so<00:01:00.480> what<00:01:00.930> you're<00:01:01.079> gonna<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.590> you're

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
so what you're gonna do is you're

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.090 
so what you're gonna do is you're
basically<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.690> grip<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.290> pic<00:01:04.559> like

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
basically going to grip the pic like

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.160 
basically going to grip the pic like
such<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.030> play<00:01:11.720> you're<00:01:12.720> gonna<00:01:12.840> want<00:01:13.110> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
such so as you play you're gonna want to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.289 
such so as you play you're gonna want to
strike<00:01:13.619> once<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> pick<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.820> once<00:01:15.090> with

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
strike once with the pick and once with

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.450 
strike once with the pick and once with
your<00:01:15.450> thumb<00:01:15.720> kind<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.170> double<00:01:16.470> strike<00:01:16.740> but

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
your thumb kind of a double strike but

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.800 
your thumb kind of a double strike but
you're<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.759> gonna<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.119> literally<00:01:18.509> sit

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
you're just gonna have to literally sit

it's really it the sound you want to go
for<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.670> you're<00:01:26.820> listening<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.119> any<00:01:27.299> Black

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
for if you're listening to any Black

for if you're listening to any Black
Label<00:01:27.750> Society<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.439> know<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:29.460> I'm<00:01:29.579> talking

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
Label Society you know what I'm talking

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:53.050 
Label Society you know what I'm talking
about

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.469 

that<00:01:54.060> squeal<00:01:54.539> is<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.170> pitch<00:01:55.350> harmonic<00:01:55.829> Bend

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
that squeal is the pitch harmonic Bend

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:06.039 
that squeal is the pitch harmonic Bend
so<00:01:57.479> once<00:01:58.289> again<00:01:59.119> hold<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.299> pic<00:02:00.539> like<00:02:01.140> such

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.109 

then<00:02:07.049> as<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.530> play<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.369> want<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.789> kind<00:02:09.030> of

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
then as you play you want to kind of

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.290 
then as you play you want to kind of
downward<00:02:09.599> strike<00:02:09.959> once<00:02:10.560> with<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.950> pic<00:02:11.300> once

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
downward strike once with the pic once

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.420 
downward strike once with the pic once
with<00:02:12.569> your<00:02:12.720> finger<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> end<00:02:14.280> result

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
with your finger so the end result

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:36.960 
with your finger so the end result
sounds<00:02:15.030> like

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.990 

and<00:02:38.170> that's<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.319> pitch<00:02:39.530> harmonic<00:02:40.010> Bend<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:40.970> I

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
and that's a pitch harmonic Bend so I

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.649 
and that's a pitch harmonic Bend so I
cannot<00:02:41.390> reiterate<00:02:41.599> enough<00:02:43.420> combination<00:02:44.420> of
