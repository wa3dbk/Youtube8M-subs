00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.969 

we<00:00:00.420> had<00:00:00.539> to<00:00:00.659> go<00:00:00.810> wanted<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.620> go<00:00:01.740> slightly

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
we had to go wanted to go slightly

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.220 
we had to go wanted to go slightly
longer<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.580> I<00:00:02.639> build<00:00:02.850> up<00:00:03.060> in<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.780> first<00:00:03.990> phase

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
longer and I build up in the first phase

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.760 
longer and I build up in the first phase
of<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.410> game<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:05.180> the<00:00:06.180> players<00:00:07.080> row<00:00:07.290> standing

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
of the game and the players row standing

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.530 
of the game and the players row standing
but<00:00:08.189> now<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.370> think<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:09.059> course<00:00:09.210> has<00:00:09.420> been

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
but now I think it of course has been

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.419 
but now I think it of course has been
frustration<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.800> supporters<00:00:11.250> would<00:00:11.370> be

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
frustration the the supporters would be

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.310 
frustration the the supporters would be
no<00:00:11.550> standing<00:00:12.090> as<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.420> said<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.900> they<00:00:13.259> were

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
no standing as I said it they were

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.259 
no standing as I said it they were
terrific<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.950> then<00:00:14.009> second<00:00:14.700> half<00:00:14.849> obviously

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
terrific and then second half obviously

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.450 
terrific and then second half obviously
planned<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.690> parade<00:00:16.010> and<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.130> thought<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
planned for parade and I thought the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.980 
planned for parade and I thought the
players<00:00:17.640> rose<00:00:17.850> down<00:00:18.090> then<00:00:18.240> second<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.630> few<00:00:18.779> in

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
players rose down then second a few in

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.200 
players rose down then second a few in
particular<00:00:19.230> second<00:00:19.710> half<00:00:19.880> we<00:00:20.880> didn't<00:00:21.119> quite

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
particular second half we didn't quite

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.970 
particular second half we didn't quite
the<00:00:21.359> move<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.779> ball<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.109> quick<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> first

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the move the ball so quick in the first

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.070 
the move the ball so quick in the first
period<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:23.369> tell<00:00:24.240> us<00:00:24.269> some<00:00:24.539> chances<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:25.019> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
period but tell us some chances but I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.750 
period but tell us some chances but I
thought<00:00:25.199> second<00:00:25.560> half<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.830> were<00:00:26.010> we<00:00:26.699> were

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
thought second half we were we were

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.730 
thought second half we were we were
stunned<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.359> he<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:27.960> fantastic<00:00:28.560> when<00:00:28.650> he

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
stunned and he was fantastic when he

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.259 
stunned and he was fantastic when he
came<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.340> said<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:30.029> he<00:00:30.150> was

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
came on and as I said I'm like he was

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.999 
came on and as I said I'm like he was
excellent<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.929> know<00:00:31.019> two<00:00:31.380> different<00:00:31.529> types

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
excellent you know two different types

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.069 
excellent you know two different types
strikers<00:00:32.969> up<00:00:33.090> there<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.570> Mario<00:00:33.840> but

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
strikers up there we have in Mario but

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.470 
strikers up there we have in Mario but
Ricky<00:00:35.040> come<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.309> Amazo<00:00:35.640> stand<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.149> it's

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
Ricky come on Amazo stand and it's

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.819 
Ricky come on Amazo stand and it's
irrelevant<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:36.989> need<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.260> win<00:00:37.440> though<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
irrelevant we need to win though the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.650 
irrelevant we need to win though the
last<00:00:38.219> game<00:00:38.489> against<00:00:38.820> Barcelona<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.510> think

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
last game against Barcelona and I think

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.729 
last game against Barcelona and I think
at<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.809> beginning<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.170> competition<00:00:40.649> we

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
at the beginning the competition we

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.470 
at the beginning the competition we
probably<00:00:40.980> would<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.280> looked<00:00:42.030> at<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.300> as

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
probably would have looked at that as

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.940 
probably would have looked at that as
the<00:00:42.750> game<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.230> would<00:00:43.350> hopefully<00:00:43.559> see<00:00:43.860> us

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the game that would hopefully see us

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.860 
the game that would hopefully see us
through<00:00:44.250> soul<00:00:44.550> shiver<00:00:44.820> Grenada<00:00:45.270> unfitted<00:00:45.719> but

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
through soul shiver Grenada unfitted but

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.450 
through soul shiver Grenada unfitted but
great<00:00:46.500> effort<00:00:46.739> by<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.890> players<00:00:47.160> tonight<00:00:47.340> I

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460

Stephen coming on was left at the tempo

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.859

think over the course of the the season

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.230 
think over the course of the the season
Marvin<00:01:10.590> being<00:01:10.920> creative<00:01:11.310> enough<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
Marvin being creative enough and and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.940 
Marvin being creative enough and and

the game I thought our performance level
was<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:28.860> outstanding

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860

probably<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.070> maybe<00:01:38.790> about<00:01:39.000> right<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.420> with

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
probably a maybe about right but with

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.380 
probably a maybe about right but with
other<00:01:39.659> chances<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> first<00:01:42.270> half

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
other chances so the first half

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.719

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
apart from that spell in the game I

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.569 
apart from that spell in the game I
thought<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> work<00:02:02.009> really<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.340> players

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
thought that the work really the players

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.819 
thought that the work really the players
was<00:02:02.729> always<00:02:02.939> standard<00:02:03.390> yeah<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> think<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.290> he

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
was always standard yeah I think that he

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.260 
was always standard yeah I think that he
obviously<00:02:04.920> came<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> lot<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.119> money

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
obviously came here for a lot of money

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.059 
obviously came here for a lot of money
in<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> big<00:02:07.140> move<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.380> him<00:02:07.710> coming

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
in and it's a big move for him coming

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.369 
in and it's a big move for him coming
out<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.550> Southampton<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.750> top<00:02:09.929> captain

out of Southampton as the top captain

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:10.779

thought considering we obviously had the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.660

this<00:03:27.109> season<00:03:27.500> how<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.650> tougher<00:03:28.069> team<00:03:28.250> they<00:03:28.400> are

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
this season how a tougher team they are

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.210 
this season how a tougher team they are
to<00:03:29.180> break<00:03:29.359> down<00:03:29.569> and<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:30.500> particular<00:03:30.919> way<00:03:31.040> from

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
to break down and a particular way from

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.740 
to break down and a particular way from
home<00:03:31.340> they've<00:03:31.579> had<00:03:31.730> some<00:03:31.970> outstanding

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
home they've had some outstanding

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.449 
home they've had some outstanding
results<00:03:33.530> but<00:03:33.799> I<00:03:33.829> thought<00:03:34.010> my<00:03:34.099> players<00:03:34.340> were

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
results but I thought my players were

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.470 
results but I thought my players were
outstanding<00:03:34.849> tonight

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
outstanding tonight

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.930 
outstanding tonight
the<00:03:35.780> second<00:03:36.109> Alpha<00:03:36.349> thought<00:03:36.530> we<00:03:36.680> really

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
the second Alpha thought we really

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.210 
the second Alpha thought we really
dominated<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.000> game<00:03:38.180> we<00:03:38.389> retain<00:03:38.889> the<00:03:39.889> the

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
dominated the game we retain the the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.909 
dominated the game we retain the the
dynamic<00:03:40.639> our<00:03:40.790> midfield<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.599> I<00:03:41.959> thought

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
dynamic our midfield and I thought

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.259 
dynamic our midfield and I thought
second<00:03:43.280> half<00:03:43.370> we<00:03:43.549> were<00:03:43.669> outstanding

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
second half we were outstanding

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.750 
second half we were outstanding
um<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:45.680> we<00:03:45.769> should<00:03:45.919> are<00:03:46.040> apparently<00:03:46.459> near<00:03:46.669> the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
um so we should are apparently near the

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.759 
um so we should are apparently near the
end<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:47.030> thought<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.269> was<00:03:47.419> clear<00:03:48.169> Joe<00:03:48.410> Allen<00:03:48.650> who

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
end I thought it was clear Joe Allen who

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.110 
end I thought it was clear Joe Allen who
was<00:03:48.799> outstanding<00:03:49.160> tonight<00:03:49.519> I<00:03:49.669> thought<00:03:49.879> they

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
was outstanding tonight I thought they

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.640 
was outstanding tonight I thought they
shunned<00:03:50.329> love<00:03:50.480> on<00:03:50.599> community<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.049> team<00:03:51.260> I've

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
shunned love on community the team I've

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.289 
shunned love on community the team I've
been<00:03:51.769> in<00:03:51.859> the<00:03:51.980> team<00:03:52.160> for<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.609> little<00:03:53.150> while<00:03:53.269> I

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
been in the team for a little while I

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.270
