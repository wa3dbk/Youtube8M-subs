00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
at the manometer nothing happens so you

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.920 
at the manometer nothing happens so you
have<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.579> check<00:02:38.790> whether<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.299> machine<00:02:39.659> works

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930

is<00:02:55.829> able<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.489> reach<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.000> pressure<00:02:57.299> or<00:02:57.599> not<00:02:57.810> yet

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
is able to reach the pressure or not yet

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.119 
is able to reach the pressure or not yet
okay<00:02:59.819> it's<00:03:00.150> about<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.689> level<00:03:01.019> which<00:03:01.439> is<00:03:01.680> okay

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
okay it's about this level which is okay

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.319 
okay it's about this level which is okay
and<00:03:02.340> then<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.939> release<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.599> lever<00:03:03.840> softly

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
and then you release the lever softly

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.330 
and then you release the lever softly
okay<00:03:06.329> that's<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.260> way<00:03:07.409> to<00:03:07.470> check<00:03:08.040> whether

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
okay that's the way to check whether

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.449 
okay that's the way to check whether
everything's<00:03:09.209> okay<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.220> afterwards<00:03:11.220> you

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
everything's okay and afterwards you

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.199 
everything's okay and afterwards you
just<00:03:12.019> release<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.049> little<00:03:13.500> bit<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.799> pressure

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
just release a little bit of pressure

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.030 
just release a little bit of pressure
and<00:03:15.209> now<00:03:15.569> we<00:03:15.629> make<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.969> an<00:03:19.040> experiment

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
and now we make a an experiment

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.280 
and now we make a an experiment
concerning<00:03:20.909> the<00:03:21.090> sound<00:03:21.389> this<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:22.019> now<00:03:22.230> the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
concerning the sound this is now the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.839 
concerning the sound this is now the
sound<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.159> rotary<00:03:23.579> pump<00:03:24.000> soft<00:03:25.519> needs<00:03:26.519> no

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
sound of the rotary pump soft needs no

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.289 
sound of the rotary pump soft needs no
pressure<00:03:27.469> and<00:03:28.489> this<00:03:29.489> is<00:03:29.669> where<00:03:29.939> bration<00:03:30.299> pump

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
pressure and this is where bration pump

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.259 
pressure and this is where bration pump
the<00:03:33.299> volumetric<00:03:34.260> pump<00:03:34.700> doesn't<00:03:35.700> need<00:03:35.879> a<00:03:35.909> blind

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
the volumetric pump doesn't need a blind

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.860 
the volumetric pump doesn't need a blind
filter<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.169> has<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.470> different<00:03:38.099> characteristic

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
filter it has a different characteristic

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.229 
filter it has a different characteristic
so<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.139> reaches<00:03:40.620> easily<00:03:41.220> nine-part<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:42.000> has<00:03:42.209> a

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
so it reaches easily nine-part it has a

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.920 
so it reaches easily nine-part it has a
capacity<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:43.019> about<00:03:44.239> 100<00:03:45.239> liters<00:03:45.629> per<00:03:45.900> hour

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
capacity of about 100 liters per hour

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.069 
capacity of about 100 liters per hour
the<00:03:46.409> operation<00:03:47.040> pump<00:03:47.280> only<00:03:47.519> 35<00:03:48.299> liters<00:03:48.810> power

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
the operation pump only 35 liters power

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.309 
the operation pump only 35 liters power
and<00:03:49.650> let's<00:03:50.280> see<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.699> difference<00:03:50.849> again<00:03:51.359> like

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
and let's see the difference again like

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:02.689 
and let's see the difference again like
a<00:03:52.349> small<00:03:52.769> sound<00:03:53.129> check<00:03:56.959> yeah<00:04:00.169> soft<00:04:01.699> yeah

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
a small sound check yeah soft yeah

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:09.830 
a small sound check yeah soft yeah
little<00:04:03.269> bit<00:04:03.419> more<00:04:03.720> noisy<00:04:07.159> yeah<00:04:08.159> okay<00:04:09.000> so

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
little bit more noisy yeah okay so

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.259 
little bit more noisy yeah okay so
that's<00:04:10.139> it<00:04:10.439> I<00:04:10.590> hope<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:11.189> helps<00:04:11.579> you<00:04:11.669> a<00:04:11.819> little

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
that's it I hope this helps you a little

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.899 
that's it I hope this helps you a little
bit<00:04:12.419> in<00:04:12.720> finding<00:04:13.709> out<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:13.889> right<00:04:14.340> machine<00:04:14.879> for

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
bit in finding out the right machine for

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.779 
bit in finding out the right machine for
you<00:04:15.329> of<00:04:15.509> course<00:04:15.540> models<00:04:16.530> with<00:04:16.769> vibration<00:04:17.519> pump

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
you of course models with vibration pump

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.629 
you of course models with vibration pump
are<00:04:18.060> less<00:04:18.329> expensive<00:04:18.810> than<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.949> one<00:04:20.159> equipped

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
are less expensive than the one equipped

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.960 
are less expensive than the one equipped
with<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> rotary<00:04:21.389> pump<00:04:21.989> that's<00:04:22.620> not<00:04:22.949> true<00:04:23.190> but

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
with a rotary pump that's not true but

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.870 
with a rotary pump that's not true but
it's<00:04:24.720> up<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.349> so<00:04:25.680> there<00:04:26.009> is<00:04:26.039> a<00:04:26.220> machine<00:04:26.639> for
