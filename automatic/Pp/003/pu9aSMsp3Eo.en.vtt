00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
chord is what gives it the flavor if you

and<00:01:42.750> that's<00:01:42.930> fine<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.920> sounds<00:01:44.220> better<00:01:44.400> if

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and that's fine but it sounds better if

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.580 
and that's fine but it sounds better if
you<00:01:44.790> pick<00:01:45.120> it<00:01:45.150> like<00:01:45.480> a<00:01:45.510> folk<00:01:45.810> song<00:01:46.020> because<00:01:46.410> it

notice<00:01:57.350> how<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.620> gets<00:01:57.710> more<00:01:57.980> flavoring<00:01:58.550> it's

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
more rich in the sound and we'll use the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.140 
more rich in the sound and we'll use the
picking<00:02:03.020> pattern<00:02:03.230> that<00:02:03.950> I've<00:02:04.520> done<00:02:04.880> in<00:02:05.060> other

I wouldn't use the hammer on all of the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.660 
I wouldn't use the hammer on all of the
courts<00:03:26.620> because<00:03:26.800> then<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.280> gets<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.520> little

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
courts because then it gets a little

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.310 
courts because then it gets a little
monotonous<00:03:28.030> but<00:03:28.480> just<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.810> little<00:03:29.020> spice<00:03:29.290> in

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
monotonous but just a little spice in

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:56.210 
monotonous but just a little spice in
that<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.680> minor<00:03:30.040> quarters<00:03:30.490> okay

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
you get the idea on the F chord and on

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.660 
you get the idea on the F chord and on
the<00:04:00.370> G<00:04:00.520> chord<00:04:01.530> no<00:04:02.530> hammer-ons<00:04:03.040> in<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.430> just

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
the G chord no hammer-ons in that just

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.830 
the G chord no hammer-ons in that just
played

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:34.709 

notices<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.989> picking<00:04:10.319> pattern

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:34.719 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:37.949 

now<00:04:35.259> the<00:04:35.319> reason<00:04:35.649> I'm<00:04:35.769> using<00:04:36.009> the<00:04:36.879> bar<00:04:37.479> chords

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:37.959 
now the reason I'm using the bar chords

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:40.829 
now the reason I'm using the bar chords
on<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.229> end<00:04:38.409> and<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.249> gene<00:04:39.639> is<00:04:40.389> because<00:04:40.809> I

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:40.839 
on the end and the gene is because I

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:45.149 
on the end and the gene is because I
want<00:04:41.169> that<00:04:41.319> bass<00:04:41.589> note<00:04:41.860> in<00:04:42.099> there<00:04:42.309> okay<00:04:44.039> if<00:04:45.039> I

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
want that bass note in there okay if I

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.629 
want that bass note in there okay if I
use<00:04:45.339> my<00:04:45.610> F<00:04:45.789> down<00:04:46.119> here<00:04:46.569> I<00:04:47.229> don't<00:04:47.829> have<00:04:48.039> that<00:04:48.309> low

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
use my F down here I don't have that low

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.789 
use my F down here I don't have that low
bass<00:04:48.939> note<00:04:49.239> right<00:04:49.599> and<00:04:49.809> if<00:04:49.869> I<00:04:49.959> hope<00:04:50.139> do<00:04:50.469> the<00:04:50.589> G

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:50.799 
bass note right and if I hope do the G

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:53.009 
bass note right and if I hope do the G
of<00:04:50.979> course<00:04:51.159> I<00:04:51.249> have<00:04:51.399> there<00:04:51.579> this<00:04:52.509> over<00:04:52.809> here

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:53.019 
of course I have there this over here

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:54.989 
of course I have there this over here
and<00:04:53.139> that's<00:04:53.289> fine<00:04:53.529> but<00:04:54.249> it's<00:04:54.399> easier<00:04:54.789> when

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:54.999 
and that's fine but it's easier when

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.689 
and that's fine but it's easier when
you're<00:04:55.119> going<00:04:55.209> from<00:04:55.479> here<00:04:56.279> just<00:04:57.279> to<00:04:57.399> move<00:04:57.519> the

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
you're going from here just to move the

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.549 
you're going from here just to move the
whole<00:04:57.849> thing<00:04:57.879> up<00:04:58.299> to<00:05:00.029> the<00:05:01.029> G<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:02.079> it's<00:05:02.229> easier

00:05:02.549 --> 00:05:02.559 
whole thing up to the G so it's easier

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:08.189 
whole thing up to the G so it's easier
to<00:05:02.679> play<00:05:04.679> rather<00:05:05.679> than<00:05:05.919> going<00:05:06.129> here<00:05:07.050> and<00:05:08.050> then

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
to play rather than going here and then

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.659 
to play rather than going here and then
having<00:05:08.439> to<00:05:08.589> change<00:05:08.829> your<00:05:08.979> fingers<00:05:09.489> around

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
having to change your fingers around

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.119 
having to change your fingers around
okay<00:05:10.179> so<00:05:10.839> it's<00:05:10.959> economy<00:05:11.439> of<00:05:11.559> movement<00:05:11.979> if<00:05:12.099> you

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:12.129 
okay so it's economy of movement if you

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.459 
okay so it's economy of movement if you
will<00:05:12.279> and<00:05:12.969> it<00:05:13.659> just<00:05:13.899> sounds<00:05:14.860> good<00:05:15.039> okay<00:05:15.269> you

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:16.469 
will and it just sounds good okay you

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:26.519 
will and it just sounds good okay you
could<00:05:17.469> do<00:05:17.619> the<00:05:17.739> a<00:05:17.769> minor<00:05:18.129> up<00:05:18.369> here

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.219 

up<00:05:26.919> here<00:05:27.239> getting<00:05:28.239> that<00:05:28.389> hammer<00:05:28.689> on<00:05:28.959> is<00:05:29.199> a

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
up here getting that hammer on is a

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.809 
up here getting that hammer on is a
little<00:05:29.589> bit<00:05:29.739> more<00:05:29.919> difficult<00:05:30.399> than<00:05:30.459> it<00:05:30.699> is

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
little bit more difficult than it is

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:36.149 
little bit more difficult than it is
down<00:05:31.029> here<00:05:33.329> so<00:05:34.329> whether<00:05:34.779> those<00:05:35.199> reasons<00:05:35.799> I<00:05:36.129> use

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
down here so whether those reasons I use

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:39.739 
down here so whether those reasons I use
these<00:05:36.579> three<00:05:36.879> chords<00:05:37.179> the<00:05:37.599> minor<00:05:37.869> in<00:05:38.049> position

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:39.749 
these three chords the minor in position

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.719 
these three chords the minor in position
F<00:05:40.749> in<00:05:40.959> the<00:05:41.049> first<00:05:41.259> position<00:05:41.829> G<00:05:42.159> in<00:05:42.339> the<00:05:42.489> third

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
F in the first position G in the third

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.289 
F in the first position G in the third
position<00:05:43.229> and<00:05:44.229> it<00:05:44.379> makes<00:05:44.559> a<00:05:44.679> nice<00:05:44.919> tight

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:45.299 
position and it makes a nice tight

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:48.719 
position and it makes a nice tight
little<00:05:46.299> song<00:05:46.659> it's<00:05:47.319> a<00:05:47.379> great<00:05:47.679> song<00:05:47.949> it's<00:05:48.249> an
