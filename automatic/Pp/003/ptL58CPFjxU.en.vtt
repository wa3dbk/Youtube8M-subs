00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.500
 turn is endow you know very well that it is 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.760
 endowed if you had not given it cliba this 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.040
 video and the issue in turn is like being a 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.140
 good car if you've ever caught 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.910
 lane and in the middle of the game at 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.610
 end the game of have said a child 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:48.210
 rat you have been told no 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:51.600
 if you are maybe 3 k 2 k 1 k a coffee 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.760
 it's a bone but yes gentlemen there is the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.740
 people of a k are not legend are not 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.050
 stories are there 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.960
 if you are new to the game or even 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.550
 from the middle level this video is going to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.020
 help a lot we start 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:11.320
 well it's number one to buy good this 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.659
 may have a small variables but 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.640
 in general it is always the same 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:21.909
 the main thing some twigs and instants 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.490
 a portion the reason for this tan goal 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.200
 because of this position is very 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.720
 important many times at the beginning 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.979
 they want to buy these things is for you 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.960
 can keep you online to create 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.940
 farmers get gold without having to 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.850
 leave the line because if you leave 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.070
 the line an experience loses that 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.840
 you stayed with a little life 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.780
 then they will have to come back again 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.150
 to the base of recover spend in a tp 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.950
 to be able to go back quickly then to 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.120
 avoid this it's always good to have 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.850
 a tango and a position 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.740
 apart from that soccer maybe you 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.550
 share a tanguito as it was in this 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:08.070
 occasion but it would be really the basics 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.070
 in this case we are going to handle an old 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.720
 tip number your first steps good 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.290
 here you will have two options at the beginning 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.660
 of the trumpet when game mission is 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.000
 the first option that delay clicks 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.300
 why delay the others and certain 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.220
 castilla two instants good between more 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.230
 delay the kids good here was a 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.110
 go ahead but it does not matter between more 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.510
 delays the scripts 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.670
 You will be able to be closer to the doctor and 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.280
 the closer to tutors you go to 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.440
 have a far safer you will be able to 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.110
 create more calm because I can in 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.730
 any case of tanking or any 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.370
 dangerous situation you can go back 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.650
 quickly to your tower while yes 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.230
 the team against the strong is relevant 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.790
 He made his crises more than you because you're going to 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.830
 find in the press are stretches of your 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.209
 be near the tower of them 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.230
 increase the chances that 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.870
 have to be in danger of you dying and 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.760
 well this is not good because as 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.849
 carrie can not lose second as 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.599
 you can lose farm all this is vital in 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.599
 the rest of the games 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.530
 the option to say number 2 is if not 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.910
 want to delay the scripts go and take the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.200
 rune 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:30.610
 good gold before explaining how well 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.380
 what radio refers to how to be 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.370
 with you the simple one in which is the line the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.560
 mouth and if you are daher and that is why 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.440
 touches that I know that would be your 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.540
 620 secure line also speaks well with 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.470
 your me so that he can go to the line of 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.640
 top and the two can take route two 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.040
 you have to be very careful 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.360
 accommodate one because you can face 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.730
 other hills because they will also want 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.440
 take one of the enemies and instead of 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.740
 take some you can give a first 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.210
 blood easily then when you're 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.850
 there you have to analyze what the 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:08.320
 are you if the possibility of age in this 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.900
 case will come very valuable so no 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.760
 It is not difficult to beat the rune when 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.580
 be on the moon and give you the time to 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.580
 be and risk 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.890
 and you can escape the brown anti 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.580
 The other detail that they saw is that 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.650
 put the ski the bling now there 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.560
 many people who before leaving the 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.030
 masses already put the skill if I felt 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.640
 I would have done so if I had put 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.800
 burning first manna would not have 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.110
 could escape and have and would have 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.400
 caused much damage to the poor old 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:54.860
 screamed so the option is to go 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.860
 quickly to take the rumba 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:02.060
 the tip number 3 and the last tip of this 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:05.810
 video of this video I repeat is here and 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.490
 do not listen to the line as number one of 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.280
 the mls the last blow you give to the 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.830
 clip to be able to meet the 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.000
 script parrot and he does not listen to 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.449
 equation lines that you liked 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.639
 do recently 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.379
 do not hit because if I mark siegel for 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.939
 conclude moves faster you push the 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.219
 line and we are closer to the tower 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:26.650
 d'en vieja is closer to the engine 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:28.420
 to die actually we're a 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.320
 disadvantage 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:34.660
 then every time they are in low 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.250
 level also comes from denies is very 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.750
 important not only family tries to 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:42.700
 delegate and what he was saying 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.729
 only nobody was going to one left 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.550
 ours was the other 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.360
 it was the third and although we hit 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.600
 look 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.690
 our crises for the first delays 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.510
 in detail the first clicks close to 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.920
 everyone gets five hits from everyone and 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.480
 after the five laps runs 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:08.000
 solitude if you stay with the color and the 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.330
 round clip of range with two laps 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.490
 so you give the ax the guamazo 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.530
 and you also stayed in the gold 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.139
 then together with the single memory of 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.449
 deny report and listen to the line 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.740
 I always tried safe line pair me 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.390
 that to the sheath of heroes because you're going to 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:30.270
 take the game is the lane 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:34.550
 get the win usually like this 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:38.960
 how good that is all for this video and 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:41.670
 if you liked the tips elmundo.es it worked 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.760
 and you would like to see the second part this 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.610
 video then I like it 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.740
 it would help me a lot to share it with everyone 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.860
 the friends share it with you 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:58.000
 Rat friend share it with your friend 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:00.969

 like irbid albin you can not digiware 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.699
