00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.319 
completely raw so it's full of live
enzymes<00:02:14.799> and<00:02:15.250> those<00:02:15.400> are<00:02:15.549> incredible<00:02:16.090> for

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
enzymes and those are incredible for

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.710 
enzymes and those are incredible for
digestion<00:02:16.780> yes<00:02:17.380> they're<00:02:18.100> very<00:02:18.130> oxidizing<00:02:19.030> as

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
digestion yes they're very oxidizing as

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.800 
digestion yes they're very oxidizing as
well<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.199> off<00:02:20.500> to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
well so off to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.449 
well so off to
people<00:02:21.080> feel<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.290> little<00:02:21.470> bit<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.739> a<00:02:21.830> lift<00:02:22.069> after

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
people feel a little bit of a lift after

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.210 
people feel a little bit of a lift after
like<00:02:22.640> they've<00:02:22.819> got<00:02:23.060> more<00:02:23.330> energy<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:24.230> we

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
like they've got more energy and we

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.040 
like they've got more energy and we
called<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.610> varies<00:02:25.970> tonic<00:02:26.360> because<00:02:26.690> it<00:02:26.840> sort

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
called it varies tonic because it sort

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.229 
called it varies tonic because it sort
of<00:02:27.140> gives<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.860> air<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.220> like<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.730> light

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
of gives you that air of like a light

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.330 
of gives you that air of like a light
fairy<00:02:29.569> right<00:02:29.989> so<00:02:30.319> how<00:02:30.560> does<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.800> actually<00:02:30.950> work

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
fairy right so how does it actually work

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.270 
fairy right so how does it actually work
that<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.819> produces<00:02:32.330> these<00:02:32.510> enzyme<00:02:32.959> so<00:02:33.260> okay<00:02:33.739> so

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
that it produces these enzyme so okay so

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.420 
that it produces these enzyme so okay so
the<00:02:35.000> culture<00:02:35.510> which<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.959> this<00:02:36.410> big<00:02:36.709> floaty<00:02:37.069> YT

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
the culture which is this big floaty YT

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.339 
the culture which is this big floaty YT
thing<00:02:37.760> can<00:02:38.120> we<00:02:38.180> take<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.390> give<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.019> a<00:02:39.080> close-up

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
thing can we take it give you a close-up

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.949 
thing can we take it give you a close-up
see<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.069> floating<00:02:40.610> in<00:02:40.730> there<00:02:40.910> that's<00:02:41.720> the

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
see that floating in there that's the

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.550 
see that floating in there that's the
scoby<00:02:42.200> up<00:02:42.560> on<00:02:42.739> top<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.250> jar<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:44.780> thats<00:02:45.080> toby

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
scoby up on top of the jar so thats toby

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.130 
scoby up on top of the jar so thats toby
is<00:02:45.769> made<00:02:46.069> at<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.550> symbiosis<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.660> yeast<00:02:47.900> and

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
is made at the symbiosis of a yeast and

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.370 
is made at the symbiosis of a yeast and
bacteria<00:02:48.920> it's<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.760> culture<00:02:50.209> so<00:02:50.690> those<00:02:51.170> two

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
bacteria it's a culture so those two

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.110 
bacteria it's a culture so those two
things<00:02:51.530> form<00:02:51.860> together<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.370> create<00:02:52.550> this<00:02:52.730> and

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
things form together to create this and

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.370 
things form together to create this and
basically<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:54.680> thrives<00:02:55.220> off<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:56.140> tea<00:02:57.140> and

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
basically this thrives off of tea and

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
basically this thrives off of tea and
sugar<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:58.430> along<00:02:59.000> with<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.450> caffeine<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.230> the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
sugar so along with the caffeine and the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.059 
sugar so along with the caffeine and the
glucose<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.580> fructose<00:03:01.640> up<00:03:02.650> that<00:03:03.650> is<00:03:03.920> the

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
glucose and fructose up that is the

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.780 
glucose and fructose up that is the
nutrient<00:03:04.580> solution<00:03:05.150> oh<00:03:05.330> yeah<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.290> culture

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
nutrient solution oh yeah the culture

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.300 
nutrient solution oh yeah the culture
metabolizes<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.120> when<00:03:08.299> we<00:03:08.420> drink<00:03:08.660> kombucha

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
metabolizes it so when we drink kombucha

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.380 
metabolizes it so when we drink kombucha
even<00:03:10.310> though<00:03:10.430> that's<00:03:10.640> on<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.940> ingredient

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
even though that's on the ingredient

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.120 
even though that's on the ingredient
list<00:03:11.420> we're<00:03:11.720> not<00:03:11.870> actually<00:03:12.140> getting<00:03:12.799> a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
list we're not actually getting a

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.190 
list we're not actually getting a
straight<00:03:13.760> shutter<00:03:14.150> or<00:03:14.269> you<00:03:14.510> are<00:03:15.019> always

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
straight shutter or you are always

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.900 
straight shutter or you are always
concerned<00:03:15.739> about<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.069> too<00:03:16.310> yeah<00:03:16.700> I<00:03:16.730> don't

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
concerned about that too yeah I don't

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.699 
concerned about that too yeah I don't
want<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:17.269> like<00:03:17.299> is<00:03:17.599> this<00:03:17.690> fake<00:03:17.989> kombucha<00:03:18.440> citta

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
want it like is this fake kombucha citta

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.530 
want it like is this fake kombucha citta
sugar<00:03:19.040> in<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.430> would<00:03:19.670> have<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.330> only

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
sugar in it I would have to the only

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.630 
sugar in it I would have to the only
real<00:03:20.750> bucher<00:03:21.230> could<00:03:21.440> have<00:03:21.590> sugar<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:22.069> has<00:03:22.340> to

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
real bucher could have sugar it has to

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.630 
real bucher could have sugar it has to
because<00:03:23.120> what<00:03:23.480> happens<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:23.989> if<00:03:24.560> this<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.459> you

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
because what happens is if this is you

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.050 
because what happens is if this is you
know<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:25.940> is<00:03:26.000> basically<00:03:26.989> like<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:28.060> phenomenally

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
know it is basically like a phenomenally

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.470 
know it is basically like a phenomenally
interesting<00:03:29.090> so<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:29.780> really<00:03:30.140> need<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.829> sugar

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
interesting so I really need the sugar

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.050 
interesting so I really need the sugar
for<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.989> metabolize<00:03:33.739> a<00:03:33.769> tea<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.370> as<00:03:34.790> it

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
for it to metabolize a tea and as it

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.990 
for it to metabolize a tea and as it
does<00:03:35.090> that<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.750> recreates<00:03:36.590> itself<00:03:36.829> so<00:03:37.640> often

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
does that it recreates itself so often

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.759 
does that it recreates itself so often
people<00:03:38.150> call<00:03:38.480> this<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.720> mother<00:03:39.109> and<00:03:39.470> then<00:03:39.620> when

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
people call this a mother and then when

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.160 
people call this a mother and then when
the<00:03:40.310> kombucha<00:03:40.670> is<00:03:40.819> fully<00:03:41.150> fermented<00:03:41.810> after

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
the kombucha is fully fermented after

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.410 
the kombucha is fully fermented after
about<00:03:42.319> three<00:03:42.620> weeks<00:03:42.650> creates<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.340> baby<00:03:43.670> it

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
about three weeks creates a baby it

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.050 
about three weeks creates a baby it
can't<00:03:44.780> create<00:03:45.109> that<00:03:45.380> baby<00:03:45.769> unless<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.880> has<00:03:47.030> a

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
can't create that baby unless it has a

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.690 
can't create that baby unless it has a
nutrient<00:03:47.569> solution<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.890> what<00:03:49.130> we<00:03:49.280> do<00:03:49.489> at

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
nutrient solution so what we do at

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.400 
nutrient solution so what we do at
fairies<00:03:50.000> tonic<00:03:50.420> is<00:03:50.569> we<00:03:50.720> wait<00:03:50.900> until<00:03:51.109> the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
fairies tonic is we wait until the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.039 
fairies tonic is we wait until the
perfect<00:03:51.829> time<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.340> then<00:03:52.850> once<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:53.750> baby<00:03:53.930> is

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
perfect time and then once the baby is

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.660 
perfect time and then once the baby is
formed<00:03:54.470> we<00:03:54.620> take<00:03:54.799> both<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.190> baby<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:55.519> the

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
formed we take both the baby and the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.970 
formed we take both the baby and the
mother<00:03:55.760> out<00:03:56.060> we've<00:03:56.840> strain<00:03:57.170> it<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:57.470> you<00:03:57.799> get

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980
