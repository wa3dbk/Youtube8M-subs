answers science tells you that you got
to<00:04:13.320> have<00:04:13.410> all<00:04:13.560> these<00:04:13.680> other<00:04:13.860> things<00:04:13.890> too

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
to have all these other things too

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.800 
to have all these other things too
so<00:04:14.579> what<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.849> ectomorph<00:04:15.360> we<00:04:15.420> just<00:04:15.629> think

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
so what this ectomorph we just think

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.780 
so what this ectomorph we just think
drinking<00:04:15.930> milk<00:04:16.410> he's<00:04:17.130> getting<00:04:17.400> all<00:04:17.489> types

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
drinking milk he's getting all types

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.280 
drinking milk he's getting all types
again<00:04:18.000> I'm<00:04:18.180> not<00:04:18.329> liking<00:04:18.600> now<00:04:18.750> science<00:04:19.139> because

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
again I'm not liking now science because

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.870 
again I'm not liking now science because
science<00:04:19.320> lets<00:04:19.650> me<00:04:19.769> out<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:19.919> lot<00:04:20.130> but<00:04:20.579> every<00:04:20.729> time

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
science lets me out a lot but every time

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.939 
science lets me out a lot but every time
you<00:04:20.970> guys<00:04:21.060> man<00:04:21.419> this<00:04:22.320> is<00:04:22.440> like<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.590> revelation

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
you guys man this is like a revelation

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.620 
you guys man this is like a revelation
and<00:04:23.310> believe<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.759> or<00:04:23.850> not<00:04:23.970> I<00:04:24.150> hopped<00:04:24.419> on<00:04:24.600> the

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
and believe it or not I hopped on the

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.960 
and believe it or not I hopped on the
I'll<00:04:24.900> fucking<00:04:25.500> hopped<00:04:25.800> on<00:04:26.009> it<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.340> drink<00:04:26.820> milk

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.460 
like every every two three hours my man
I<00:04:29.039> don't<00:04:29.100> want<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.340> see<00:04:29.430> some<00:04:29.580> games<00:04:29.789> because<00:04:30.150> I

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
I don't want to see some games because I

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.920 
I don't want to see some games because I
live<00:04:31.470> with<00:04:31.500> him<00:04:31.740> I<00:04:31.919> saw<00:04:32.100> my<00:04:32.310> own<00:04:32.460> eyes<00:04:32.930> he

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
live with him I saw my own eyes he

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.090 
live with him I saw my own eyes he
doesn't<00:04:34.199> know<00:04:34.259> anything<00:04:34.470> my<00:04:34.650> father's<00:04:34.949> good

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
doesn't know anything my father's good

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.730

so you have a good example of Kentucky

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.070 
so you have a good example of Kentucky
to<00:04:37.860> genetics<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.490> what<00:04:39.449> he's<00:04:39.539> the<00:04:39.630> actor<00:04:39.900> box

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080
