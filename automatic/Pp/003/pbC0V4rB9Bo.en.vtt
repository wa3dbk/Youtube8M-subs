 tutorial to make custom heads 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.199
 like that big wall that I did you 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.480
 see with heads and lots of other 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.490
 than heads that heads and then 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.260
 it's without fashion I prefer to prevent 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.210
 because there are people who disturb me 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.000
 What is the brief Bing everyone 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.280
 know that when we take a head of 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.989
 jean kÃ©vin ben we end up with a 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.640
 people who come all ugly between 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.190
 others in europe we it is because we 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.480
 wants then some would think that he 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.090
 just use an anvil 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.899
 renamed the head that one wishes for 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.969
 to have the character you want but 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.399
 I remember this technique does work 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.010
 not and well to order for and well for 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.340
 the tutorial you will just need a block of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.160
 order a redstone torch and your 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.409
 ears to listen and not clogged 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.479
 please so I have already prepared 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.729
 that's where the command is enough 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.840
 complicated myself I do not understand it 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.340
 too much so here it is so you have to play 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.259
 she will be in the description for that 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.290
 you do the eco side is good I 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.420
 you leave it if you want to watch 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.860
 then you do that he can go 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.420
 fout here it's the kind of parenthesis 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.790
 that it's too good for the teachers and 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.220
 that you do not know how to make a fist 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:40.420
 do not forget to put 2 2 points and 2 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:42.550
 apostrophe either of postroff you 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.940

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.940
 will put I do not know we'll put me 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.490
 this is done 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.820
 do not forget to close with two 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.680
 points so there you activate and it's going 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.240
 give you a head so in your 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.980
 hand is a kevin jean head should not 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.200
 not trust that because as soon as you 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.660
 go to the break and hawks offered the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.440
 head that you wish here is so here 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.510
 that's my head 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.830
 wesh pole opposed there sees there and you 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.480
 can do this kind of head for any 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.220
 what you want then after you 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.780
 go tell me yes but how do we do 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.220
 to know people's heads then 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.600
 there are two tips one that is a bit 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.800
 more complicated than the other so the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.750
 first if you go on servers 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.709
 multiplayer games skiing gard 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.690
 any of them 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.870
 and as soon as you see a guy with a 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.209
 pen head and a head was not what 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.130
 do you learn it here and you take 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.890
 his name you put him in the in the 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.630
 command block right here and that's it and 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.670
 the second less complicated technique - 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.600
 annoying you go to the site that 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.090

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.430
