for<00:00:11.250> salmon<00:00:11.519> halibut<00:00:12.179> but<00:00:12.780> when<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.080> came<00:00:13.290> back

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
for salmon halibut but when we came back

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.900 
for salmon halibut but when we came back
from<00:00:13.590> our<00:00:13.710> fishing<00:00:14.190> trip<00:00:14.429> back<00:00:14.610> from<00:00:14.820> the

from our fishing trip back from the
fishing<00:00:15.240> dock<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.960> could<00:00:16.199> see<00:00:16.350> tons<00:00:16.740> of

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
mackerel around and we thought we just

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
on video at the same time before we get

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.529 
on video at the same time before we get
into<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.279> fishing<00:00:23.640> gear<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.180> use<00:00:24.210> in

into the fishing gear that we use in
this<00:00:24.660> video<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.619> answer<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> few

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160

so<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:34.680> these<00:00:34.800> macros<00:00:35.309> well<00:00:35.760> these<00:00:35.940> at

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
so what are these macros well these at

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.660 
so what are these macros well these at
macro<00:00:36.300> actually<00:00:36.899> come<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.160> west<00:00:38.370> coast<00:00:38.460> of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
macro actually come to the west coast of

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.549 
macro actually come to the west coast of
Vancouver<00:00:38.820> Island<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> warm<00:00:40.020> current

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
Vancouver Island with the warm current

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.479 
Vancouver Island with the warm current
that<00:00:41.239> make<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.780> eastern<00:00:43.350> Pacific<00:00:43.829> once

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that make it to the eastern Pacific once

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.119 
that make it to the eastern Pacific once
every<00:00:44.730> few<00:00:45.000> years<00:00:45.149> due<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.539> El<00:00:45.870> Ninos<00:00:46.320> or<00:00:46.649> other

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
every few years due to El Ninos or other

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.760 
every few years due to El Ninos or other
factors<00:00:47.690> they're<00:00:48.690> not<00:00:48.870> native<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.500> British

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
factors they're not native to British

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.319 
factors they're not native to British
Columbia<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> same<00:00:51.000> time<00:00:51.149> they're

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
Columbia but at the same time they're

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.819 
Columbia but at the same time they're
not<00:00:51.420> really<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.840> phases<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.350> well<00:00:52.559> because

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
not really in phases as well because

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.010 
not really in phases as well because
this<00:00:52.949> cycle<00:00:53.399> has<00:00:53.460> been<00:00:53.640> happening<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.090> very

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
this cycle has been happening for very

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.720 
this cycle has been happening for very
long<00:00:55.289> time<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.800> once<00:00:56.010> every<00:00:56.250> few<00:00:56.430> years

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
long time so once every few years

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.060 
long time so once every few years
we<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> appearance<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.020> mackerel<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
we see the appearance of mackerel on the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.090 
we see the appearance of mackerel on the
west<00:00:59.280> coast<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.930> these<00:01:01.199> macros<00:01:01.680> are<00:01:01.859> actually

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
west coast so these macros are actually

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.770 
west coast so these macros are actually
pretty<00:01:02.340> aggressive<00:01:02.910> predators<00:01:03.390> they'll

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
pretty aggressive predators they'll

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050 
pretty aggressive predators they'll
pretty<00:01:04.080> much<00:01:04.170> feed<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.619> anything<00:01:04.909> do<00:01:05.909> they

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
pretty much feed on anything do they

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.710 
pretty much feed on anything do they
have<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> negative<00:01:06.689> impact<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.400> Pacific<00:01:08.400> salmon

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
have a negative impact on Pacific salmon

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.600 
have a negative impact on Pacific salmon
yes<00:01:09.720> they<00:01:09.930> do<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> certain<00:01:10.650> extent<00:01:11.310> is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
yes they do to a certain extent is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
yes they do to a certain extent is
juvenile<00:01:12.420> salmon<00:01:12.869> actually<00:01:13.020> migrate

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
juvenile salmon actually migrate

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.580 
juvenile salmon actually migrate
downstream<00:01:14.549> from<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.750> river<00:01:16.020> into<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
downstream from the river into the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.100 
downstream from the river into the
estuary<00:01:16.860> into<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> ocean<00:01:17.759> during<00:01:18.540> spring<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
estuary into the ocean during spring and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.190 
estuary into the ocean during spring and
summer<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.740> that's<00:01:20.659> when<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> macro<00:01:22.110> will

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
summer and that's when the macro will

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.380 
summer and that's when the macro will
present<00:01:22.680> they<00:01:23.100> do<00:01:23.159> feed<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.759> low<00:01:23.909> juvenile

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
present they do feed on low juvenile

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.679 
present they do feed on low juvenile
salmon<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:26.159> they<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:27.000> some<00:01:27.270> impact

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
salmon so they they do have some impact

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.960 
salmon so they they do have some impact
but<00:01:27.869> at<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.080> same<00:01:28.259> time<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.610> this

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
but at the same time this is this

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.670 
but at the same time this is this
creates<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.689> great<00:01:30.720> sport<00:01:31.439> fishing

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
creates a great sport fishing

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.880 
creates a great sport fishing

catch<00:01:46.619> them<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.399> light<00:01:47.790> tackle<00:01:47.820> because<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
catch them is on light tackle because of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.810 
catch them is on light tackle because of
the<00:01:49.079> fish<00:01:49.259> out<00:01:49.409> between<00:01:49.799> one<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.100> two<00:01:50.430> pounds

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the fish out between one and two pounds

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.719 
the fish out between one and two pounds
big<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:52.049> don't<00:01:52.350> want<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.560> use<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> heavy<00:01:53.130> you

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
big you don't want to use a heavy you

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.889 
big you don't want to use a heavy you
don't<00:01:53.909> want<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> use<00:01:54.180> heavy<00:01:54.420> equipment<00:01:54.869> to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
don't want to use heavy equipment to

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.170 
don't want to use heavy equipment to
target<00:01:55.409> them<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.280> want<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.579> get<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
target them because you want to get the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.139 
target them because you want to get the
most<00:01:57.810> fight<00:01:58.079> all<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.380> them<00:01:58.530> even<00:01:59.490> though<00:01:59.820> these

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
most fight all of them even though these

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.600 
most fight all of them even though these
fish<00:02:00.420> are<00:02:00.630> roughly<00:02:01.350> run<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.649> size<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.280> small

trout<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.450> actually<00:02:03.780> fight<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> lot

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
trout they actually fight a lot

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.660 
trout they actually fight a lot
felt<00:02:04.970> so<00:02:05.300> ultralight<00:02:06.050> fishing<00:02:06.800> tackle<00:02:06.920> is<00:02:07.310> the

chase<00:03:12.920> anything<00:03:13.130> in<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.000> water<00:03:14.239> what<00:03:14.900> if<00:03:15.019> what

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
chase anything in the water what if what

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.500 
chase anything in the water what if what
we<00:03:15.350> find<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.829> when<00:03:16.670> we<00:03:16.790> started<00:03:17.030> fishing<00:03:17.209> at

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
we find is when we started fishing at

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.780 
we find is when we started fishing at
one<00:03:17.720> particular<00:03:17.959> spot<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:19.070> first<00:03:19.340> cast<00:03:19.579> will

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
one particular spot the first cast will

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.550 
one particular spot the first cast will
usually<00:03:19.910> get<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.209> fish<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:21.079> see<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> whole

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
usually get a fish and you see a whole

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.380 
usually get a fish and you see a whole
bunch<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.860> them<00:03:22.040> falling<00:03:22.579> right<00:03:22.970> behind<00:03:23.239> that

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
bunch of them falling right behind that

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.660 
bunch of them falling right behind that
fish<00:03:23.780> as<00:03:24.019> being<00:03:24.530> cooked<00:03:24.739> is<00:03:25.100> they<00:03:25.459> probably

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
fish as being cooked is they probably

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.460 
fish as being cooked is they probably
think<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.120> one<00:03:26.480> fish<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:26.900> chasing<00:03:27.320> down

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
think that one fish is chasing down

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.949 
think that one fish is chasing down
fruit<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:29.180> rest<00:03:29.390> will<00:03:29.540> fall<00:03:29.750> right

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
fruit and the rest will fall right

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.620 
fruit and the rest will fall right
behind<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.410> it's<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.590> feeding<00:03:30.860> frenzy<00:03:31.390> but<00:03:32.390> what

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
behind so it's a feeding frenzy but what

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.780 
behind so it's a feeding frenzy but what
after<00:03:32.750> two<00:03:33.110> or<00:03:33.260> three<00:03:33.290> fish<00:03:33.739> a<00:03:34.040> lot<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.610> times

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
after two or three fish a lot of times

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.930 
after two or three fish a lot of times
all<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.269> fish<00:03:35.450> will<00:03:35.600> suddenly<00:03:35.780> disappear<00:03:35.959> and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
all the fish will suddenly disappear and

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.090 
all the fish will suddenly disappear and
you<00:03:37.940> think<00:03:38.209> well<00:03:38.360> is<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.630> it<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.590> are<00:03:39.980> you

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
you think well is that it the are you

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.160 
you think well is that it the are you
going<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.310> catch<00:03:40.489> any<00:03:40.670> more<00:03:40.880> well<00:03:41.420> you<00:03:41.450> will

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
going to catch any more well you will

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.380 
going to catch any more well you will
because<00:03:42.650> this<00:03:42.950> schooling<00:03:43.670> fish<00:03:43.850> actually

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
because this schooling fish actually

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.420 
because this schooling fish actually
just<00:03:44.780> swimming<00:03:45.079> around<00:03:45.320> and<00:03:45.560> they'll<00:03:45.980> do

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
just swimming around and they'll do

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.009 
just swimming around and they'll do
they'll<00:03:46.730> do<00:03:46.880> circles<00:03:47.360> or<00:03:47.540> actually<00:03:47.840> come

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
they'll do circles or actually come

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.370 
they'll do circles or actually come
around<00:03:48.170> after<00:03:48.790> five<00:03:49.790> or<00:03:50.030> ten<00:03:50.209> minutes<00:03:50.510> they<00:03:51.320> do

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
around after five or ten minutes they do

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.400 
around after five or ten minutes they do
get<00:03:51.650> educated<00:03:52.100> with<00:03:52.400> we<00:03:52.820> find<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.410> after

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
get educated with we find that after

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.230 
get educated with we find that after
catching<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.310> few<00:03:55.519> fish<00:03:55.750> they<00:03:56.750> will

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
catching a few fish they will

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.300 
catching a few fish they will
yes<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:59.080> little<00:03:59.470> bit<00:03:59.590> when<00:03:59.890> it<00:04:00.010> comes<00:04:00.160> to

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
yes a little bit when it comes to

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.670 
yes a little bit when it comes to
fighting<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.790> Lord<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.270> lot<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:01.900> times<00:04:02.110> if<00:04:02.620> you

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
fighting the Lord a lot of times if you

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.250 
fighting the Lord a lot of times if you
look<00:04:03.010> at<00:04:03.160> in<00:04:03.280> video<00:04:03.580> they'll<00:04:04.120> fold<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.930> fly<00:04:05.200> to

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
look at in video they'll fold the fly to

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.330 
look at in video they'll fold the fly to
fold<00:04:05.710> the<00:04:05.890> spinner<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.460> they<00:04:07.210> won't<00:04:07.660> actually

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
fold the spinner and they won't actually

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.010 
fold the spinner and they won't actually
write<00:04:09.340> directly<00:04:09.850> at<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.150> they'll<00:04:10.360> peck<00:04:10.630> at<00:04:10.840> it

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
write directly at it they'll peck at it

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.960 
write directly at it they'll peck at it
or<00:04:11.260> they'll<00:04:12.010> chase<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.430> down<00:04:12.460> but<00:04:12.850> they

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
or they'll chase it down but they

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.940 
or they'll chase it down but they
wouldn't<00:04:13.210> actually<00:04:13.300> commit<00:04:13.810> fully<00:04:14.320> to<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.740> so

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
wouldn't actually commit fully to it so

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.300 
wouldn't actually commit fully to it so
we<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.700> way<00:04:15.910> used<00:04:16.810> why<00:04:17.080> you<00:04:17.140> should<00:04:17.440> do<00:04:17.560> is<00:04:17.800> to

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
we the way used why you should do is to

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.040 
we the way used why you should do is to
actually<00:04:18.520> adjust<00:04:19.209> your<00:04:19.920> retrieving<00:04:20.920> speed

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
actually adjust your retrieving speed

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.260 
actually adjust your retrieving speed
twitch<00:04:23.050> shalu<00:04:23.410> a<00:04:23.440> little<00:04:23.770> bit<00:04:23.920> just<00:04:24.730> that<00:04:25.120> the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
twitch shalu a little bit just that the

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.920 
twitch shalu a little bit just that the
pause<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.950> pause<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.910> certain<00:04:28.480> movement

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
pause and the pause and certain movement

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.010 
pause and the pause and certain movement
will<00:04:29.440> usually<00:04:29.860> trigger<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.490> plights

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
will usually trigger the plights

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.810 
will usually trigger the plights
besides<00:04:32.020> spin<00:04:32.350> casting<00:04:32.590> you<00:04:33.190> also<00:04:33.340> notice

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
besides spin casting you also notice

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.930 
besides spin casting you also notice
that<00:04:33.850> we<00:04:34.270> fly<00:04:34.840> fish<00:04:35.170> for<00:04:35.380> these<00:04:35.770> small<00:04:36.580> fish<00:04:36.790> as

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
that we fly fish for these small fish as

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.590 
that we fly fish for these small fish as
well<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:39.280> flight<00:04:39.610> Elfi<00:04:39.970> that<00:04:40.120> we<00:04:40.240> use<00:04:40.390> is

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
well the the flight Elfi that we use is

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.070 
well the the flight Elfi that we use is
actually<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.930> 3-way<00:04:41.350> setup<00:04:41.740> so<00:04:42.160> I<00:04:43.080> mentioned

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
actually a 3-way setup so I mentioned

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.770 
actually a 3-way setup so I mentioned
this<00:04:44.290> before<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:45.150> numbering<00:04:46.150> system<00:04:46.300> of<00:04:46.630> the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
this before the numbering system of the

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.110 
this before the numbering system of the
five<00:04:46.990> fishing<00:04:47.350> outfit<00:04:47.650> goes<00:04:48.130> from<00:04:48.370> one<00:04:48.640> way<00:04:48.820> to

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
five fishing outfit goes from one way to

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.140 
five fishing outfit goes from one way to
10<00:04:49.390> /<00:04:50.080> 10<00:04:50.110> with<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:50.770> one<00:04:51.130> thing<00:04:51.430> for<00:04:52.030> the

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
10 / 10 with so one thing for the

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.380 
10 / 10 with so one thing for the
smallest<00:04:52.510> fish<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:52.960> 10<00:04:53.500> for<00:04:54.160> 6<00:04:54.730> 7<00:04:54.940> wait<00:04:55.150> for

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
smallest fish and 10 for 6 7 wait for

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.990 
smallest fish and 10 for 6 7 wait for
salmon<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.830> heavier<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.640> larger

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
salmon and the heavier the larger

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.150 
salmon and the heavier the larger
numbers<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.810> heavier<00:04:59.230> your<00:04:59.410> target<00:04:59.800> species

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
numbers the heavier your target species

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.390 
numbers the heavier your target species
is<00:05:00.280> 3<00:05:00.760> so<00:05:00.970> 3<00:05:01.150> witches<00:05:01.540> are<00:05:02.050> pretty<00:05:02.380> adequate<00:05:02.680> we

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
is 3 so 3 witches are pretty adequate we

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.950 
is 3 so 3 witches are pretty adequate we
did<00:05:03.580> get<00:05:03.790> into<00:05:04.000> one<00:05:04.180> or<00:05:04.300> two<00:05:04.330> fish<00:05:04.660> that<00:05:04.870> are

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
did get into one or two fish that are

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.680 
did get into one or two fish that are
fairly<00:05:05.350> big<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:05.830> that<00:05:06.730> took<00:05:07.000> quite<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.360> long

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
fairly big and that took quite a long

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.090 
fairly big and that took quite a long
time<00:05:07.900> to<00:05:08.080> bring<00:05:08.290> and<00:05:08.620> we<00:05:08.710> actually<00:05:08.980> had<00:05:09.070> one

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
time to bring and we actually had one

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.610 
time to bring and we actually had one
fish<00:05:09.520> that<00:05:09.730> was<00:05:10.150> closer<00:05:10.450> to<00:05:10.570> pound<00:05:10.960> that

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
fish that was closer to pound that

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.770 
fish that was closer to pound that
actually<00:05:12.430> snagged<00:05:12.730> us<00:05:12.910> up<00:05:13.120> and<00:05:13.330> luckily<00:05:13.630> we

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
actually snagged us up and luckily we

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.710 
actually snagged us up and luckily we
got<00:05:13.810> it<00:05:14.080> out<00:05:14.170> but<00:05:14.730> definitely<00:05:15.730> 3<00:05:16.060> 3<00:05:16.420> or<00:05:16.450> 4

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
got it out but definitely 3 3 or 4

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.790 
got it out but definitely 3 3 or 4
weight<00:05:16.930> is<00:05:17.170> a<00:05:17.800> good<00:05:18.400> setup<00:05:18.730> to<00:05:18.970> go<00:05:19.120> with<00:05:19.680> we<00:05:20.680> use

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
weight is a good setup to go with we use

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.070 
weight is a good setup to go with we use
the<00:05:20.950> floating<00:05:21.310> line<00:05:21.780> except<00:05:22.780> I<00:05:22.900> would

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
the floating line except I would

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.080 
the floating line except I would
recommend<00:05:23.530> you<00:05:23.680> use<00:05:23.860> a<00:05:23.890> sinking<00:05:24.430> line<00:05:24.460> this

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
recommend you use a sinking line this

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.110 
recommend you use a sinking line this
because<00:05:25.480> most<00:05:25.870> fish<00:05:26.110> are<00:05:26.290> filtered<00:05:26.620> down<00:05:26.800> deep

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
because most fish are filtered down deep

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.240 
because most fish are filtered down deep
in<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.240> deep<00:05:28.420> water<00:05:28.780> and<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.650> get<00:05:29.830> your<00:05:29.980> fly

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250

down<00:05:30.970> to<00:05:31.000> deeper<00:05:31.570> water<00:05:31.780> use<00:05:32.170> use<00:05:32.380> a<00:05:32.410> sinking

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
down to deeper water use use a sinking

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.190 
down to deeper water use use a sinking
line<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.340> that<00:05:34.270> will<00:05:34.480> get<00:05:34.600> you<00:05:34.750> into<00:05:34.870> fish

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
line and that will get you into fish

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.990 
line and that will get you into fish
right<00:05:35.500> away<00:05:35.530> instead<00:05:36.070> of<00:05:36.160> having<00:05:36.400> to<00:05:36.580> wait<00:05:36.790> for

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
right away instead of having to wait for

right away instead of having to wait for
that<00:05:37.090> fly<00:05:37.360> to<00:05:37.420> sink<00:05:37.780> down<00:05:37.990> for<00:05:38.950> a<00:05:38.980> long<00:05:39.160> time<00:05:39.460> so

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
that fly to sink down for a long time so

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.240 
that fly to sink down for a long time so
what<00:05:40.570> kind<00:05:40.750> of<00:05:40.780> fly<00:05:40.990> should<00:05:41.230> use<00:05:41.470> well<00:05:41.980> again

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
any fly pattern and those fish will

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.060
