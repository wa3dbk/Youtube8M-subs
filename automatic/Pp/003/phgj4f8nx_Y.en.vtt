00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.890
 on the psychology of the relationship between 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.110
 man and woman 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.000
 today we have such an interesting question 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.089
 which one my reader asked me 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.010
 in the video category 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.470
 man and woman answers and questions 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.070
 today we will talk about what 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.039
 exists 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.260
 error the main error on the first 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.150
 dating very often many women and and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.859
 allow and actually the question sounded like this 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.840
 anastasia tell me if there are 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.969
 some major female errors that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.160
 we allow on the first date at 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.360
 communicating with a man how to avoid them 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.450
 actually or list up to some 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.800
 I had to bring you now 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.410
 possible and possible on this topic somehow 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.719
 talk more longer more so 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.960
 prolonged conversation can happen but I 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:01.620
 I would like to name the main main 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:04.350
 so here's where the woman go 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.250
 hence everything goes awry 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.600
 This is the main such mistake that you 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.330
 surely understand now i want to 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.140
 you remembered felt and somehow 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.270
 tried and and avoided at the moment of the first 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.939
 dating yes that is when communicating with 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.680
 man when you try each other 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.070
 learn ask each other questions 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.840
 you get answers you have such a conversation 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.960
 woman is not here one by one 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.079
 simple reason because she thinks and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.270
 does and speaks to the perspective that is 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.200
 the moment you need to enjoy 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.299
 communication 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.240
 she I can be several now 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.250
 exaggerate thinks about how I would behold him 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.200
 so like to start with him 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.079
 meet there already come live 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.720
 together give birth to children already calls names 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.700
 that is, the woman at the time of the first 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.579
 bye is in your thoughts 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.130
 she build a whole plan she is not here 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.250
 she is not now and the man feels it but 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.810
 he perceives it as some 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.829
 detachment 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.500
 disinterest and which wall 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.420
 such 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.119
 here is felt between a man and a woman 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.100
 at this moment there is a major error in 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.300
 that woman thinks and does on 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.410
 perspective 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.630
 and the very first date you even you not 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.010
 can be so sure to 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.260
 make plans of this kind 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.950
 calculate your steps you only learn 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.450
 each other and your task at this moment 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.209
 just know each other how you can 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.090
 deeper about yourself tell ask about 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.580
 man about his partner do understand 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.250
 reveal how much they have between you 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.830
 shared values and interests there principles 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.080
 views on life and so on and in this 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.540
 the moment turns out so the woman is she 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.640
 can even communicate hear that man and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.250
 says she doesn't perceive it because 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.040
 that she may have been yearning for 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.870
 love and thereby creating 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.530
 already around this man 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.120
 a certain way has the most to him by his 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.970
 characterized and not at all important that he 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.620
 it says that she is in herself 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.220
 arrange a plan calculates each his 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.620
 subsequent words and not involved in 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.739
 the process of this dating this 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.350
 the very first date that's probably in 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.690
 As an answer to this question, I 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.269
 Iâ€™ll confine myself to that 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.959

 on the first date was it inherent to you 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.880
