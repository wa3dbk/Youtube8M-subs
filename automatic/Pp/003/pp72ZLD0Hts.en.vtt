00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.600 
instead of writing I'm gonna talk about
it<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.910> bengals<00:00:06.210> beat<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.420> rounds<00:00:06.690> 34<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.290> 27

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610

it the bengals beat the rounds 34 to 27
really<00:00:08.610> didn't<00:00:08.760> think<00:00:08.820> they<00:00:09.030> were<00:00:09.150> gonna<00:00:09.240> lose

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
really didn't think they were gonna lose

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.089 
really didn't think they were gonna lose
before<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.960> game<00:00:10.110> started<00:00:10.469> during<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.920> game

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
before the game started during the game

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.860 
before the game started during the game
and<00:00:11.460> even<00:00:12.150> when<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.330> game<00:00:12.480> was<00:00:12.509> within<00:00:12.750> a

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
and even when the game was within a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.589 
and even when the game was within a
touchdown<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.590> thought<00:00:13.950> they'd<00:00:14.130> win<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> game

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
touchdown I thought they'd win the game

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.750 
touchdown I thought they'd win the game
without<00:00:15.599> really<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.230> know<00:00:16.350> any<00:00:16.619> concern<00:00:17.160> but

percent<00:01:02.129> health<00:01:02.550> wise<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.030> he<00:01:03.120> doesn't<00:01:03.420> look

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the bangle scored a touchdown all the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.020 
the bangle scored a touchdown all the
deep<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.280> know<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> Browns<00:01:50.610> were<00:01:50.729> gonna<00:01:50.880> do

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
deep you know the Browns were gonna do

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.280 
deep you know the Browns were gonna do
just<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> same<00:01:51.360> thing<00:01:51.509> they<00:01:51.750> answered<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
just the same thing they answered and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.109 
just the same thing they answered and
credit<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.740> grounds<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.100> doing<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.399> but

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
credit to the grounds for doing that but

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.639 
credit to the grounds for doing that but
the<00:01:54.210> defense<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.659> not<00:01:54.960> gonna<00:01:55.140> help<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.470> team

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
the defense is not gonna help this team

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.080 
the defense is not gonna help this team
stay<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.070> games<00:01:56.310> there's<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.969> many

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
stay in games there's so many

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.639 
stay in games there's so many
adjustments<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.140> think<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
adjustments and I just think that the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.780 
adjustments and I just think that the
enters<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:59.009> finally<00:01:59.280> caught<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
enters have finally caught up with the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.420 
enters have finally caught up with the
team<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.360> still<00:02:01.259> still<00:02:01.770> not<00:02:01.979> feeling<00:02:02.130> really

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
team and still still not feeling really

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.039 
team and still still not feeling really
good<00:02:02.579> about<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:02.969> I'll<00:02:03.060> take<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> win<00:02:03.570> the
