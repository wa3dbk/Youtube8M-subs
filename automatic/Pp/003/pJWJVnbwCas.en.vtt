00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.120
 we have been doing news reviews and previews since 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.649

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.269

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.089
 channel 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.800
 was your question how do we proceed? 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.570
 having a lot of people is gone 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.970
 commons on our youtube channel may be ours 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.079
 website facebook and twitter ask what 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.090
 do you do for more devices 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.799
 well first of all as a manufacturer 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.390
 brings a new test on the market than 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.700
 it asks who in us or we want it 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.649
 testing 9 out of 10 times we say yes as 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.329
 when our agenda fits please get real 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.310
 many phones time it is 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:20.899
 a show well then we get such 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.759
 device within that may be two weeks 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.560
 test we use man without fixed 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.149
 phone and during testing 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.490
 to all aspects of device construction 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.799
 the quality of the screen that memory 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.020
 you name it on the camera as we test 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.890
 there make a preview of them such 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.140
 making it 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.820
 reviewer about it and afterwards 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.380
 publish it completely independently 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.210
 our website and on the youtube channel and 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.039
 the place there is also on twitter facebook 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.840
 and of course youtube and google plus 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.729
 it is therefore good to know that 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.110
 we are not allowed to keep telephones ourselves 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.240
 right my own few weeks ago and 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.590
 just study everyone i back that 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.149
 we have a lot of telephones but that 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.860
 is just not so we buy our own 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.509
 Phones and all phones that you belong to 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.100
 expert just push you back in 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.630
 to all manufacturers and so we know 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.640
 just stay independent 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.800
 many people love 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.640
 what phone tell myself use that 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.180
 is actually very simple to 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.350
 reply 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.150
 we have them not really fixed 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.890
 phone to that is about keys 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.360
 I want to get a test device with that myself 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.850
 walking up and used during the day 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.170
 test how strings in practice we are 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.590
 so have a different one every two weeks 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.360
 phone 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.030
 we are completely crazy about it 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.040
 Android my iPhone iPad number on both 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.600
 she started no preference and is 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.800
 just completely independent in it 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.180
 so you can't really tell which 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.130
 We always determine ours 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.360
 of course you are 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.190
 all very curious how it is 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.080
 behind us behind the scenes 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.730
 we want to show you now 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.040
 our studio setup is behind me 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.140

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.400

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.600
 and wherever we have our list 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.680
 keep track of the devices that we 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.940
 everyone's going to shoot 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.680

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.970

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.019
