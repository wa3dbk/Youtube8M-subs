00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
what we call it wave kinda fitting the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.940

large ones in the large flat RS and then

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.620 
large ones in the large flat RS and then
I<00:01:52.979> did<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> kind<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.670> same<00:01:53.850> pattern<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.420> that

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
I did the kind of same pattern it's that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.819 
I did the kind of same pattern it's that
shame<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> jack<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.219> not<00:01:57.180> show<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.630> with

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
jagged China for Jennifer I think that

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.109 
jagged China for Jennifer I think that
would<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:01.799> kind<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.189> fitting<00:02:02.549> name<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.759> it

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
would be kind of fitting name for it

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.539 
would be kind of fitting name for it
it's<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.930> where<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.290> leave<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.369> little

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
word being position low one of the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.929 
word being position low one of the
reasons<00:04:31.460> as<00:04:32.090> a<00:04:32.150> small<00:04:32.689> flipper<00:04:33.699> but<00:04:34.699> still

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:34.939 
reasons as a small flipper but still

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:39.010 
reasons as a small flipper but still
flip<00:04:35.240> is<00:04:35.360> nicely<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:36.409> first<00:04:36.710> one<00:04:37.599> you<00:04:38.599> like<00:04:38.870> it

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
flip is nicely the first one you like it

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.339 
flip is nicely the first one you like it
perfectly<00:04:39.409> centered<00:04:39.680> good<00:04:40.400> lock<00:04:40.610> up<00:04:41.319> nice<00:04:42.319> and

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
perfectly centered good lock up nice and

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.850 
perfectly centered good lock up nice and
so<00:04:42.710> we<00:04:42.889> lock<00:04:43.129> up<00:04:43.340> not<00:04:43.610> too<00:04:43.849> late<00:04:44.060> not<00:04:44.300> too<00:04:44.479> early

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
so we lock up not too late not too early

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.040 
so we lock up not too late not too early
nice<00:04:45.860> relieves<00:04:46.340> on<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.639> inside<00:04:47.090> or<00:04:47.539> in<00:04:47.599> the

nice relieves on the inside or in the
new<00:04:48.349> feature<00:04:48.620> i<00:04:48.770> was<00:04:48.860> talking<00:04:49.159> about<00:04:49.340> if<00:04:49.999> you

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
new feature i was talking about if you

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.170 
new feature i was talking about if you
can<00:04:50.749> speak<00:04:51.259> it<00:04:51.469> out<00:04:51.590> there<00:04:51.949> i<00:04:54.759> try<00:04:55.759> to<00:04:55.819> maybe

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
can speak it out there i try to maybe

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.920 
can speak it out there i try to maybe
show<00:04:56.870> you<00:04:56.930> better<00:04:57.740> way<00:04:58.099> I<00:04:58.509> think<00:04:59.509> we<00:04:59.659> should

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
show you better way I think we should

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:08.499 
show you better way I think we should
actually<00:05:00.409> be<00:05:00.800> able<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.159> not<00:05:01.909> really<00:05:07.330> here<00:05:08.330> you

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
actually be able to not really here you

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.769 
actually be able to not really here you
can<00:05:08.719> see<00:05:08.779> from<00:05:09.409> this<00:05:09.680> position<00:05:10.210> in<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.389> camera

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:11.779 
can see from this position in the camera

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:22.200 
can see from this position in the camera
focus<00:05:15.069> on<00:05:16.069> camera

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.930 

there<00:05:22.840> is<00:05:23.020> a<00:05:23.050> little<00:05:23.530> slide<00:05:23.919> no<00:05:24.190> doubt<00:05:24.490> you<00:05:24.699> see

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
there is a little slide no doubt you see

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.939 
there is a little slide no doubt you see
that<00:05:25.180> that's<00:05:25.509> exercising<00:05:26.169> you<00:05:26.319> also<00:05:26.740> have<00:05:26.919> a

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
that that's exercising you also have a

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.370 
that that's exercising you also have a
glimpse<00:05:27.310> of<00:05:27.550> that<00:05:27.610> screw<00:05:28.419> there<00:05:29.169> is<00:05:29.259> an

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
glimpse of that screw there is an

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.100 
glimpse of that screw there is an
internal<00:05:29.949> stopping<00:05:30.669> inside<00:05:31.270> so<00:05:31.780> there<00:05:31.990> is<00:05:32.080> a

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
internal stopping inside so there is a

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.040 
internal stopping inside so there is a
hole<00:05:32.470> drilled<00:05:32.889> this<00:05:33.490> way<00:05:33.819> into<00:05:34.419> the<00:05:34.569> light<00:05:34.750> bar

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
hole drilled this way into the light bar

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.370 
hole drilled this way into the light bar
here<00:05:35.410> right<00:05:35.650> here<00:05:35.949> drew<00:05:36.789> this<00:05:37.120> way<00:05:37.360> then<00:05:38.020> put<00:05:38.349> a

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
here right here drew this way then put a

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.140 
here right here drew this way then put a
thread<00:05:38.800> in<00:05:39.039> the<00:05:39.190> hall<00:05:39.370> you<00:05:39.699> know<00:05:39.849> that's

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
thread in the hall you know that's

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.870 
thread in the hall you know that's
threaded<00:05:40.509> for<00:05:40.900> 256<00:05:41.560> threat<00:05:41.949> and<00:05:42.580> then<00:05:42.729> I<00:05:42.819> could

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
threaded for 256 threat and then I could

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.839 
threaded for 256 threat and then I could
the<00:05:43.120> set<00:05:43.389> screw<00:05:43.840> in<00:05:44.050> you<00:05:44.530> know<00:05:44.680> when<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.669> light

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
the set screw in you know when the light

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.059 
the set screw in you know when the light
was<00:05:46.090> here<00:05:46.479> I<00:05:46.599> said<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.110> screw<00:05:47.470> in<00:05:47.650> that<00:05:47.860> way

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.069 
was here I said the screw in that way

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.010 
was here I said the screw in that way
you<00:05:48.580> can<00:05:48.759> see<00:05:48.970> there<00:05:49.270> that's<00:05:49.449> cool<00:05:49.810> right<00:05:49.960> now

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
you can see there that's cool right now

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.950 
you can see there that's cool right now
and<00:05:50.759> then<00:05:51.759> I<00:05:51.880> mailed<00:05:52.090> out<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.419> little<00:05:52.660> slot

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
and then I mailed out the little slot

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.640 
and then I mailed out the little slot
there<00:05:53.380> so<00:05:54.039> when<00:05:54.910> it's<00:05:55.090> in<00:05:55.419> this<00:05:56.229> engaged

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
there so when it's in this engaged

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.070 
there so when it's in this engaged
position<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:58.000> screw<00:05:58.330> is<00:05:58.449> just<00:05:58.660> sitting<00:05:58.900> in

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
position the screw is just sitting in

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.460 
position the screw is just sitting in
the<00:05:59.199> milled<00:05:59.440> out<00:05:59.590> slot<00:06:00.660> but<00:06:01.660> what<00:06:01.840> it<00:06:01.960> does<00:06:02.139> is

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
the milled out slot but what it does is

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.850 
the milled out slot but what it does is
you<00:06:03.000> physically<00:06:04.000> cannot<00:06:04.410> press<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:05.650> lock

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
you physically cannot press the lock

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.680 
you physically cannot press the lock
button<00:06:05.889> now<00:06:06.370> all<00:06:06.699> the<00:06:06.849> way<00:06:06.970> you<00:06:07.030> know<00:06:07.270> it<00:06:07.449> stops

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
button now all the way you know it stops

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.300 
button now all the way you know it stops
you<00:06:07.840> right<00:06:08.020> there<00:06:08.229> it's<00:06:08.770> actually<00:06:08.979> pretty

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
you right there it's actually pretty

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.900 
you right there it's actually pretty
much<00:06:09.460> even<00:06:09.820> with<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:10.930> outside<00:06:11.320> scale<00:06:11.789> but<00:06:12.789> you

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
much even with the outside scale but you

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.149 
much even with the outside scale but you
know<00:06:13.030> internally<00:06:13.720> it<00:06:14.080> works<00:06:14.320> just<00:06:14.440> and<00:06:14.949> well

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
know internally it works just and well

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:16.950 
know internally it works just and well
you<00:06:15.250> know<00:06:15.280> it<00:06:15.400> goes<00:06:15.699> in<00:06:15.940> and<00:06:16.090> everything<00:06:16.449> plus

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
you know it goes in and everything plus

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.779 
you know it goes in and everything plus
it<00:06:17.169> if<00:06:17.440> you<00:06:17.620> for<00:06:17.860> whatever<00:06:18.039> is<00:06:18.370> and<00:06:18.669> you<00:06:18.759> were

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
it if you for whatever is and you were

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.450 
it if you for whatever is and you were
to<00:06:19.210> squish<00:06:19.570> it<00:06:19.720> this<00:06:19.870> way<00:06:20.080> so<00:06:20.590> in<00:06:20.800> you<00:06:21.130> put<00:06:21.370> the

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
to squish it this way so in you put the

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.939 
to squish it this way so in you put the
negative<00:06:21.580> forces<00:06:22.090> this<00:06:22.389> way<00:06:22.599> it<00:06:23.229> kind<00:06:23.590> of<00:06:23.680> hits

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
negative forces this way it kind of hits

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.920 
negative forces this way it kind of hits
the<00:06:24.159> back<00:06:24.400> wall<00:06:24.639> of<00:06:24.669> the<00:06:24.819> of<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.419> middle

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
the back wall of the of the middle

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.110 
the back wall of the of the middle
portion<00:06:26.409> and<00:06:26.560> it<00:06:26.680> also<00:06:26.830> can<00:06:27.280> stabilize<00:06:27.820> is<00:06:28.000> the

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
portion and it also can stabilize is the

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.210 
portion and it also can stabilize is the
log<00:06:28.300> it<00:06:28.479> helps<00:06:28.780> to<00:06:29.259> deal<00:06:29.440> with<00:06:29.650> the<00:06:29.740> forces

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
log it helps to deal with the forces

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.760 
log it helps to deal with the forces
this<00:06:30.520> way<00:06:30.729> in<00:06:30.940> the<00:06:31.300> negative<00:06:31.630> forces<00:06:31.960> so

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
this way in the negative forces so

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.689 
this way in the negative forces so
that's<00:06:33.009> why<00:06:33.159> I<00:06:33.190> log<00:06:33.460> by<00:06:33.699> log<00:06:33.729> bar<00:06:35.039> /<00:06:36.039> travel<00:06:36.520> and

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699 
that's why I log by log bar / travel and

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:41.640 
that's why I log by log bar / travel and
stabilizer<00:06:38.099> so<00:06:39.719> kind<00:06:40.719> of<00:06:40.780> cool<00:06:40.990> new<00:06:41.020> features

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
stabilizer so kind of cool new features

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.830 
stabilizer so kind of cool new features
especially<00:06:42.219> the<00:06:42.610> supplies<00:06:43.030> I<00:06:43.180> think<00:06:43.509> I<00:06:43.570> look

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
especially the supplies I think I look

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.709 
especially the supplies I think I look
it's<00:06:44.530> not<00:06:45.370> dead<00:06:45.669> heart<00:06:45.969> so<00:06:46.150> I<00:06:46.180> think<00:06:46.270> it<00:06:46.630> will

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:46.719 
it's not dead heart so I think it will

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:48.450 
it's not dead heart so I think it will
be<00:06:46.780> doing<00:06:47.380> this<00:06:47.530> on<00:06:47.710> everyone<00:06:48.190> you<00:06:48.219> know

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
be doing this on everyone you know

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.730 
be doing this on everyone you know
beside<00:06:48.880> being<00:06:49.180> my<00:06:49.750> pocket<00:06:50.110> lip<00:06:50.229> so<00:06:50.349> it's<00:06:50.590> nice

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
beside being my pocket lip so it's nice

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.959 
beside being my pocket lip so it's nice
on<00:06:50.919> this<00:06:51.009> one<00:06:51.190> because<00:06:51.310> this<00:06:51.550> pocket<00:06:51.880> the

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:51.969 
on this one because this pocket the

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:54.120 
on this one because this pocket the
bitch<00:06:52.120> is<00:06:52.210> not<00:06:52.330> as<00:06:52.599> big<00:06:52.870> as<00:06:53.050> I<00:06:53.080> normally<00:06:53.620> are

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
bitch is not as big as I normally are

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.159 
bitch is not as big as I normally are
normally<00:06:54.820> my<00:06:54.940> pocket<00:06:55.240> leave<00:06:55.330> actually<00:06:55.479> goes<00:06:55.900> a

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:56.169 
normally my pocket leave actually goes a

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:58.709 
normally my pocket leave actually goes a
little<00:06:56.860> bit<00:06:57.070> beyond<00:06:57.520> the<00:06:57.880> like<00:06:58.060> relief<00:06:58.419> so<00:06:58.630> it

00:06:58.709 --> 00:06:58.719 
little bit beyond the like relief so it

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:01.010 
little bit beyond the like relief so it
actually<00:06:58.870> acts<00:06:59.229> as<00:06:59.440> a<00:06:59.500> over<00:06:59.919> to<00:07:00.070> our<00:07:00.159> health

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
actually acts as a over to our health

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.510 
actually acts as a over to our health
but<00:07:02.020> even<00:07:02.229> with<00:07:02.380> my<00:07:02.680> traditional<00:07:03.159> pocket

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
but even with my traditional pocket

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.339 
but even with my traditional pocket
because<00:07:03.669> i<00:07:03.789> think<00:07:03.849> i<00:07:04.030> will<00:07:04.090> do<00:07:04.360> it<00:07:04.599> you<00:07:05.259> know

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:05.349 
because i think i will do it you know

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:07.439 
because i think i will do it you know
just<00:07:05.650> it's<00:07:06.219> kind<00:07:06.520> of<00:07:06.610> nice<00:07:06.729> feature<00:07:07.000> and<00:07:07.240> it<00:07:07.270> is

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:07.449 
just it's kind of nice feature and it is

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:10.379 
just it's kind of nice feature and it is
that<00:07:07.990> new<00:07:08.320> thing<00:07:08.620> doesn't<00:07:09.430> it's<00:07:09.789> not<00:07:09.880> too<00:07:10.210> hard

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:10.389 
that new thing doesn't it's not too hard

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.140 
that new thing doesn't it's not too hard
to<00:07:10.479> do<00:07:10.690> and<00:07:11.080> it<00:07:11.229> is<00:07:11.349> you<00:07:11.409> know<00:07:11.530> the<00:07:12.150> evolution

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150 
to do and it is you know the evolution

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.120 
to do and it is you know the evolution
of<00:07:13.240> night<00:07:13.449> making<00:07:13.719> evolution<00:07:14.380> of<00:07:14.469> my<00:07:14.620> knives<00:07:14.860> I

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.130 
of night making evolution of my knives I

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.149 
of night making evolution of my knives I
think<00:07:16.120> it's<00:07:16.240> always<00:07:16.419> good<00:07:17.289> to<00:07:17.320> move<00:07:17.740> forward

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:18.159 
think it's always good to move forward

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:22.050 
think it's always good to move forward
rather<00:07:18.969> than<00:07:19.120> backward<00:07:19.750> or<00:07:19.930> just<00:07:20.460> stay<00:07:21.460> on<00:07:21.820> one

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060 
rather than backward or just stay on one

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.230 
rather than backward or just stay on one
place<00:07:22.349> so<00:07:23.349> guys<00:07:23.530> hope<00:07:23.740> you<00:07:23.889> enjoyed<00:07:23.919> it<00:07:24.240> I'm

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:40.139 
most likely will go to gay bashing so

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:41.689 
most likely will go to gay bashing so
