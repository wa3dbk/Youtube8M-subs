00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
of screws on the body so these machines

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.869 
of screws on the body so these machines
can<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.500> very<00:00:49.710> difficult<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.579> tell<00:00:50.760> the

can be very difficult to tell the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
can be very difficult to tell the
difference<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.600> you're<00:00:51.780> looking<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> buy<00:00:52.559> a

difference of if you're looking to buy a
machine<00:00:53.039> these<00:00:53.489> machines<00:00:53.940> may<00:00:54.239> look<00:00:54.510> exactly

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
machine these machines may look exactly

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.970 
machine these machines may look exactly
the<00:00:55.469> same

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the same

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.979 
the same
the<00:00:56.610> heads<00:00:56.820> may<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.149> little<00:00:57.300> different<00:00:57.570> but

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the heads may be a little different but

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.689 
the heads may be a little different but
the<00:00:58.109> machines<00:00:58.410> are<00:00:58.590> completely<00:00:59.280> different<00:00:59.430> in

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the machines are completely different in

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.979

the<00:00:59.730> way<00:00:59.789> they<00:01:00.000> operate<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.870> are

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the way they operate and they are

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869

completely<00:01:01.260> different<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.520> end<00:01:02.699> result

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
completely different in the end result

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.000 
completely different in the end result
and<00:01:03.239> what<00:01:03.809> products<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.409> pads<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.830> should

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and what products and pads you should

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.440 
and what products and pads you should
use<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.280> each<00:01:05.430> machine<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.180> I'm<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
use with each machine so I'm going to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.000 
use with each machine so I'm going to
tell<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.869> exact<00:01:07.200> differences<00:01:07.619> between<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010

between the two so right here as you
might<00:01:20.939> notice<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> heads<00:01:21.630> look<00:01:21.810> very<00:01:22.049> very

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
might notice the heads look very very

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.390 
might notice the heads look very very
similar<00:01:22.740> except<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> 3403<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:25.799> head

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
similar except on the 3403 the head

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.780 
similar except on the 3403 the head
right<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.180> has<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.170> hex<00:01:28.619> bolt<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.430> that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
right here has a hex bolt in it that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.060 
right here has a hex bolt in it that
holds<00:01:30.060> down<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.450> backing<00:01:30.960> plate<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.320> opposed<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
holds down a backing plate as opposed to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.270 
holds down a backing plate as opposed to
the<00:01:32.220> difference<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.570> with<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.409> 3404

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the difference right here with the 3404

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.520 
the difference right here with the 3404
which<00:01:35.759> has<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> complete<00:01:36.420> flat<00:01:36.900> backing<00:01:37.320> plate

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
which has a complete flat backing plate

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.170 
which has a complete flat backing plate
so<00:01:38.009> let's<00:01:38.189> remove<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> backing<00:01:38.729> plates<00:01:39.030> on

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
so let's remove the backing plates on

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.460 
so let's remove the backing plates on
each<00:01:39.299> machine<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.840> show<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> difference

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
each machine and show you the difference

and the 3403 runs off of a RPMs per

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.800 
and the 3403 runs off of a RPMs per
minute<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.130> starts<00:02:05.430> at<00:02:05.520> 1100<00:02:06.149> rpms<00:02:06.570> so

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
minute and that starts at 1100 rpms so

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.479 
minute and that starts at 1100 rpms so
I'm<00:02:07.500> gonna<00:02:07.590> go<00:02:07.680> ahead<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.860> flip<00:02:08.129> each<00:02:08.310> machine

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489

over and show you guys the differences

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.070 
over and show you guys the differences
between<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.760> heads<00:02:11.940> itself<00:02:12.360> now<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.840> head

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
between the heads itself now the head

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.390 
between the heads itself now the head
right<00:02:13.290> here<00:02:13.590> on

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
right here on

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.330 
right here on

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
you sue you as you will see the machine

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.850 
you sue you as you will see the machine
will<00:02:21.700> move<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.360> random<00:02:23.200> pattern<00:02:23.440> that's

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
will move in a random pattern that's

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.140 
will move in a random pattern that's
derived<00:02:24.340> from<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.790> gear<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.790> can<00:02:27.940> see<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
derived from a gear you can see the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.670 
derived from a gear you can see the
difference<00:02:28.450> right<00:02:28.599> there<00:02:28.780> on<00:02:28.959> this<00:02:29.440> machine

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
difference right there on this machine

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.860 
difference right there on this machine
this<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.610> circular<00:02:31.000> polisher

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
this is a circular polisher

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.680 
this is a circular polisher
so<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.739> 3403<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:34.120> completely<00:02:34.510> different

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
so the 3403 is a completely different

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.870 
so the 3403 is a completely different
machine<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.380> it<00:02:35.800> can<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.190> can<00:02:36.250> burn<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.670> paint

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
machine and it can it can burn the paint

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.190 
machine and it can it can burn the paint
if<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.090> don't<00:02:37.300> know<00:02:37.450> what<00:02:37.750> you're<00:02:37.870> doing<00:02:38.080> as<00:02:38.170> a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
professional but if you are professional

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.550 
professional but if you are professional
you<00:02:40.360> know<00:02:40.450> exactly<00:02:40.840> how<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.019> use<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.260> machine

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
you know exactly how to use the machine

that<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.190> machine<00:02:48.569> just<00:02:49.569> spins<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.140> true

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
that the machine just spins in a true

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.410 
that the machine just spins in a true
circular<00:02:50.860> motion<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.090> can<00:02:55.209> see<00:02:55.299> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
circular motion so you can see the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.789 
circular motion so you can see the
difference<00:02:55.690> I'll<00:02:55.810> trim<00:02:56.019> both<00:02:56.200> on<00:02:56.440> so<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.709> can

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
difference I'll trim both on so you can

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:57.660 
difference I'll trim both on so you can
see<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.040> difference<00:02:57.310> between<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.549> two

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
see the difference between the two

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.729 
see the difference between the two
machines<00:02:57.819> as<00:02:58.120> they<00:02:58.269> run

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.170 

so<00:03:06.739> both<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:06.950> them<00:03:07.189> look<00:03:07.400> very<00:03:07.640> similar<00:03:08.030> but

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
so both of them look very similar but

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.179 
so both of them look very similar but
they<00:03:08.299> both<00:03:08.420> run<00:03:08.689> in<00:03:08.840> their<00:03:08.959> own<00:03:09.139> unique<00:03:09.920> way

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
they both run in their own unique way

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.819 
they both run in their own unique way
