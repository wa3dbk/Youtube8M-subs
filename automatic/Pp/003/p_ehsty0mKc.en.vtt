00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.810
 greetings in this opportunity we are going to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.730
 comment a little about synchronization 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.790
 of a belt 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:19.730
 of one engine time another 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.730
 vehicle after double overhead camshaft 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.240
 first you have to put on if the strap is not 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.099
 it has damaged that he has bent the valves 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.380
 or something like that but simply 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.920
 the change is being made 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.530
 For maintenance reasons , it is necessary to 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.530
 place the engine in sync 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.530
 this has some marks here that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.160
 match the back cover both 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.719
 gears have these brands have 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.190
 that be aligned with this brand 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.579
 later and likewise the gear of the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.579
 crankshaft 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:06.260
 as you can see here below has a 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.510
 small shows that it matches a 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.360
 cut and it's back here 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.630
 once this is done 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.479
 they have to release 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.479
 the time belt tensioner 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.530
 which in this case is this tensor 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.570
 in this engine you have to have a lot 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.810
 be careful with this tensioner 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.440
 since this practice that is here 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.770
 back she fits in the background the car 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.980
 oil and she has a gutter 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.890
 and acts as a guide 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.950
 some mechanics make the mistake of 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.720
 that when placing the tensioner this leg 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.810
 leave out of the guide and when 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.110
 they turn these which is an eccentric to 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.750
 give tension to the strap this leg is 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.600
 turns and locks the tensioner losing of 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.500
 this way the automatic adjustment that 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.910
 grants the factory tension 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.320
 it is well to remember that when mounting the tensioner 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.960
 fit the patica as I show here 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.280
 it has to be inside the guide 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.819
 some leave it out ok then 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.970
 this is extremely important 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.770
 another thing 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.330
 to release it you can remove 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.760
 the screw that holds the tensioner here 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.310
 releasing the tensor in this case this 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.300
 strap I just changed it is already 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.780
 finished already the old tensor here what 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.780
 I have 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.940
 how can you tell here has the 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.940
 patita 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:59.120
 this tensor in this case was raised 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.580
 lifting the strap out 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.950
 taking it out of his guide and rubbing against the 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.290
 top this is dangerous but the engine 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.750
 because it damages the strap and you can 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.630
 produce 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.100
 in breakage of it although damaging the 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.430
 engine 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.730
 and I recommended changing the tensioner 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.170
 because it was ringing 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.610
 Now it is already having put 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.930
 placing the strap keeping the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.690
 Attention 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.120
 I helped by placing something down here 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.620
 always block as they have in 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.860
 consideration that is not going to 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.730
 forget because this can damage the motor 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:44.730
 God helped me for example I grab before 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.810
 of mounting the cap obviously and a brake 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.239
 down here I put a key so that 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.390
 so that the belt the teeth do not 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.060
 get out of gear and have no problem 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.129
 at the time of riding because this 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.370
 allows me to keep the strap fixed on 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.959
 your place whenever I am tensing the 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.420
 strap to place it in a gear 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.970
 I have to take into consideration that 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.319
 this brand I did not move for any 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.569
 from both sides 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.920
 you have to keep this in mind when 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.009
 of thinking 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.000
 because if the engine is not left out 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.000
 synchronization is
