00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.070 
dies in any leftover damages is spread
to<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.290> blocks<00:00:04.620> next<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.190> it<00:00:05.420> so<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.629> idea<00:00:06.660> is

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
to the blocks next to it so the idea is

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.669 
to the blocks next to it so the idea is
if<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.799> healer<00:00:08.250> attacks<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:08.970> it<00:00:09.380> weakens<00:00:10.380> a

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
if a healer attacks you it weakens a

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.089 
if a healer attacks you it weakens a
whole<00:00:11.010> chunk<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.639> blocks<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.660> then<00:00:13.110> if<00:00:13.469> an<00:00:13.650> SMG

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
whole chunk of blocks so then if an SMG
