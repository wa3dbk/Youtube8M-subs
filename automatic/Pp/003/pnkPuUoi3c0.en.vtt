you<00:00:05.410> know<00:00:05.500> you'd<00:00:05.710> think<00:00:05.920> that<00:00:06.190> something<00:00:06.640> is

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:06.730 
you know you'd think that something is

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.209 
you know you'd think that something is
simple<00:00:07.150> as<00:00:07.360> checking<00:00:07.779> and<00:00:08.200> your<00:00:08.769> automatic

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.219 
simple as checking and your automatic

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.549 
simple as checking and your automatic
transmission<00:00:09.369> fluid<00:00:10.209> level<00:00:10.450> and<00:00:10.990> filling<00:00:11.440> it

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:11.559 
transmission fluid level and filling it

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.619 
transmission fluid level and filling it
up<00:00:11.679> when<00:00:11.919> it's<00:00:12.070> low<00:00:12.309> would<00:00:12.610> be<00:00:12.759> just<00:00:13.030> a<00:00:13.239> piece

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629 
up when it's low would be just a piece

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.650 
up when it's low would be just a piece
of<00:00:13.780> cake<00:00:13.989> but<00:00:14.739> I<00:00:14.980> know<00:00:15.369> from<00:00:15.940> the<00:00:16.059> number<00:00:16.480> of

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
of cake but I know from the number of

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.950 
of cake but I know from the number of
emails<00:00:17.110> that<00:00:17.230> I<00:00:17.410> receive<00:00:17.890> from<00:00:18.010> our<00:00:18.190> customers

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
emails that I receive from our customers

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.600 
emails that I receive from our customers
it's<00:00:19.960> not<00:00:20.230> that<00:00:20.470> easy<00:00:20.680> in<00:00:20.950> fact<00:00:21.190> it<00:00:21.340> can<00:00:21.460> be

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
it's not that easy in fact it can be

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.330 
it's not that easy in fact it can be
quite<00:00:21.850> frustrating<00:00:21.880> trying<00:00:22.780> to<00:00:23.040> actually<00:00:24.040> see

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
quite frustrating trying to actually see

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.550 
quite frustrating trying to actually see
on<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:24.610> dipstick<00:00:24.910> where<00:00:25.750> the<00:00:25.900> fluid<00:00:26.110> is<00:00:26.289> and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
on the dipstick where the fluid is and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.650 
on the dipstick where the fluid is and
then<00:00:26.860> knowing<00:00:27.039> how<00:00:27.370> much<00:00:27.550> to<00:00:28.090> put<00:00:28.270> in<00:00:28.330> there

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
then knowing how much to put in there

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.570 
then knowing how much to put in there
and<00:00:28.810> then<00:00:29.140> what<00:00:29.440> in<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:29.710> world<00:00:29.950> do<00:00:30.100> you<00:00:30.160> do<00:00:30.400> if

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
and then what in the world do you do if

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.249 
and then what in the world do you do if
you<00:00:30.700> put<00:00:30.970> too<00:00:31.180> much<00:00:31.210> in<00:00:31.420> there<00:00:31.840> does<00:00:31.990> that<00:00:32.020> mean

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
you put too much in there does that mean

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.930 
you put too much in there does that mean
you<00:00:32.379> got<00:00:32.499> to<00:00:32.649> get<00:00:32.769> on<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:33.010> car<00:00:33.219> and<00:00:33.370> drain<00:00:33.760> it

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
you got to get on the car and drain it

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.759 
you got to get on the car and drain it
out<00:00:33.999> of<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.239> pan<00:00:34.480> and<00:00:34.510> create<00:00:34.960> this<00:00:35.079> mess<00:00:35.559> on

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
out of the pan and create this mess on

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.489 
out of the pan and create this mess on
the<00:00:35.859> ground<00:00:36.269> well<00:00:37.269> I<00:00:37.300> decided<00:00:37.449> to<00:00:37.870> do<00:00:38.019> a<00:00:38.050> short

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:38.499 
the ground well I decided to do a short

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.639 
the ground well I decided to do a short
video<00:00:38.949> series<00:00:39.460> on<00:00:39.609> dealing<00:00:40.179> with

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
video series on dealing with

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.649 
video series on dealing with
transmission<00:00:41.649> filling<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:42.760> measuring<00:00:43.359> woes

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
transmission filling and measuring woes

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.599 
transmission filling and measuring woes
and<00:00:44.230> so<00:00:44.890> in<00:00:45.039> part<00:00:45.370> 1<00:00:45.670> let's<00:00:46.089> talk<00:00:46.449> about<00:00:46.659> just

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
and so in part 1 let's talk about just

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.610 
and so in part 1 let's talk about just
reading<00:00:48.609> the<00:00:48.729> dipstick<00:00:49.089> now<00:00:49.809> you<00:00:49.870> should<00:00:50.379> know

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
reading the dipstick now you should know

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.869 
reading the dipstick now you should know
right<00:00:50.890> away<00:00:51.159> that<00:00:52.440> when<00:00:53.440> you<00:00:53.620> check<00:00:54.069> the<00:00:54.550> level

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
right away that when you check the level

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.579 
right away that when you check the level
of<00:00:54.999> the<00:00:55.059> transmission<00:00:55.719> fluid<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:56.139> car<00:00:56.350> needs

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
of the transmission fluid the car needs

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:57.930 
of the transmission fluid the car needs
to<00:00:56.679> be<00:00:56.769> running<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.339> engine<00:00:57.489> and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
to be running the engine and

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.819 
to be running the engine and
transmission<00:00:58.299> need<00:00:58.719> to<00:00:58.809> be<00:00:58.929> hot<00:00:59.139> needs<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.739> be

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
transmission need to be hot needs to be

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.770 
transmission need to be hot needs to be
in<00:00:59.920> park<00:01:00.190> I'm<00:01:00.429> not<00:01:00.670> going<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.059> do<00:01:01.269> that<00:01:01.510> in<00:01:01.659> this

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
in park I'm not going to do that in this

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.020 
in park I'm not going to do that in this
video<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:03.309> you<00:01:03.549> wouldn't<00:01:03.699> be<00:01:03.760> able<00:01:03.850> to

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
video because you wouldn't be able to

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.030 
video because you wouldn't be able to
hear<00:01:04.180> what<00:01:04.300> I'm<00:01:04.420> saying<00:01:04.750> so<00:01:05.110> just<00:01:05.350> remember

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
hear what I'm saying so just remember

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.470 
hear what I'm saying so just remember
that<00:01:06.160> as<00:01:06.370> we're<00:01:06.580> as<00:01:06.880> we're<00:01:07.090> going<00:01:07.330> through

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
that as we're as we're going through

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.130 
that as we're as we're going through
this<00:01:07.660> when<00:01:08.530> you<00:01:08.680> pull<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.070> dipstick<00:01:09.280> out<00:01:10.140> if

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
this when you pull the dipstick out if

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.660 
this when you pull the dipstick out if
the<00:01:11.290> engines<00:01:11.620> not<00:01:11.800> running<00:01:12.100> it's<00:01:12.430> going<00:01:12.610> to

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
the engines not running it's going to

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.400 
the engines not running it's going to
read<00:01:12.880> really<00:01:13.330> high<00:01:13.660> on<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.110> stick<00:01:14.380> right

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
read really high on the stick right

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.760 
read really high on the stick right
there<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.900> you've<00:01:16.900> got<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.230> have<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.500> engine

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
there so you've got to have the engine

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.500 
there so you've got to have the engine
running<00:01:18.130> it's<00:01:18.310> got<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.550> be<00:01:18.610> idling<00:01:19.090> with<00:01:19.390> the

running it's got to be idling with the

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.180 
running it's got to be idling with the
transmission<00:01:19.960> part<00:01:20.410> to<00:01:20.560> get<00:01:20.680> an<00:01:20.830> accurate

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
transmission part to get an accurate

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.030 
transmission part to get an accurate
reading<00:01:21.370> and<00:01:22.240> when<00:01:22.690> you<00:01:22.780> put<00:01:23.020> when<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.680> clean

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
reading and when you put when you clean

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.390 
reading and when you put when you clean
the<00:01:24.250> dipstick<00:01:24.640> off<00:01:24.850> you<00:01:25.090> want<00:01:25.360> a<00:01:25.600> lint-free

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the dipstick off you want a lint-free

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.670 
the dipstick off you want a lint-free
towel<00:01:27.400> you<00:01:27.760> can<00:01:27.940> use<00:01:28.120> a<00:01:28.150> chamois<00:01:28.600> but<00:01:29.290> do<00:01:29.500> not

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
towel you can use a chamois but do not

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.470 
towel you can use a chamois but do not
and<00:01:29.980> I'm<00:01:30.070> going<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.310> repeat<00:01:30.580> do<00:01:30.730> not<00:01:30.910> use<00:01:31.210> paper

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
and I'm going to repeat do not use paper

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.420 
and I'm going to repeat do not use paper
towels<00:01:31.810> do<00:01:32.230> not<00:01:32.470> use<00:01:32.710> napkins

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
towels do not use napkins

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.000 
towels do not use napkins
do<00:01:33.940> not<00:01:34.150> use<00:01:34.360> an<00:01:34.510> old<00:01:34.690> rag<00:01:34.960> that<00:01:35.350> has<00:01:35.530> lint<00:01:35.860> in

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
do not use an old rag that has lint in

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.520 
do not use an old rag that has lint in
it<00:01:36.100> because<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:36.550> lint<00:01:36.940> can<00:01:37.690> get<00:01:37.900> down<00:01:38.140> into

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
it because that lint can get down into

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.100 
it because that lint can get down into
the<00:01:38.860> transmission<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.700> can<00:01:39.970> actually<00:01:40.420> cause

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
the transmission and can actually cause

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.250 
the transmission and can actually cause
problems<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:42.340> shifting<00:01:42.850> because<00:01:43.270> that<00:01:43.720> gets

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
problems with shifting because that gets

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.070 
problems with shifting because that gets
into<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.560> valve<00:01:44.860> body<00:01:45.190> so<00:01:46.120> use<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.450> clean

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
into the valve body so use a clean

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.680 
into the valve body so use a clean
lint-free<00:01:47.440> cloth<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.330> thoroughly<00:01:49.330> clean<00:01:49.660> the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
lint-free cloth and thoroughly clean the

add fluid and checking it it's not going
to<00:02:31.600> be<00:02:31.690> accurate<00:02:31.870> because<00:02:32.290> you're<00:02:32.410> going<00:02:32.530> to

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590
