00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.690 

hi<00:00:00.450> guys<00:00:00.659> sorry<00:00:01.530> about<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.979> background<00:00:02.610> noise

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hi guys sorry about the background noise

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.630 
hi guys sorry about the background noise
I'm<00:00:03.389> out<00:00:03.540> in<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.659> conservatory<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.650> it's

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
I'm out in the conservatory and it's

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.060 
I'm out in the conservatory and it's
raining<00:00:05.879> hard<00:00:06.270> outside<00:00:08.300> back<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.660> car<00:00:10.650> in

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
raining hard outside back to the car in

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.480 
raining hard outside back to the car in
front<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.519> me<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.330> one<00:00:12.450> with<00:00:12.690> the

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
front of me this is the one with the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.090 
front of me this is the one with the
hard<00:00:14.490> drive<00:00:14.969> motor<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:16.400> in<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> last<00:00:17.699> video

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
hard drive motor and in the last video

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.720 
hard drive motor and in the last video
turbo<00:00:20.100> team<00:00:21.470> pointed<00:00:22.470> out<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.130> motor

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
turbo team pointed out that that motor

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.720 
turbo team pointed out that that motor
ought<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.300> able<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.480> handle<00:00:24.960> 12<00:00:25.439> volts<00:00:25.890> and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
ought to be able to handle 12 volts and

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.839 
ought to be able to handle 12 volts and
I<00:00:27.330> was<00:00:27.510> only<00:00:27.630> put<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.279> six<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.429> half<00:00:29.580> volts

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
I was only put in six and a half volts

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:30.880 
I was only put in six and a half volts
through<00:00:30.269> it

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
through it

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.470 
through it
so<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> bought<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> cheaper<00:00:33.170> 3s<00:00:34.940> lipo<00:00:35.940> battery

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
so I bought a cheaper 3s lipo battery

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.170 
so I bought a cheaper 3s lipo battery
that<00:00:36.989> will<00:00:37.079> give<00:00:37.200> us<00:00:37.260> 11<00:00:37.410> point<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.070> volts

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
that will give us 11 point one volts

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.700 
that will give us 11 point one volts
nominal<00:00:39.180> voltage<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:40.260> probably<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> bit<00:00:40.680> more

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
nominal voltage it's probably a bit more

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.770 
nominal voltage it's probably a bit more
than<00:00:40.890> that

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
than that

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.740 
than that
and<00:00:42.780> we'll<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.170> how<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.379> goes<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:45.510> I'll<00:00:45.600> just

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and we'll see how it goes so I'll just

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.229 
and we'll see how it goes so I'll just
plug<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:47.670> we'll<00:00:47.850> give<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
plug that in and then we'll give it a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.010 
plug that in and then we'll give it a
try<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:49.100> start<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.250> off<00:00:50.399> handheld<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.719> then

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
try just start it off handheld and then

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.160 
try just start it off handheld and then
we<00:00:52.140> might<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.910> go<00:00:53.910> onto<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.180> tripod<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.809> we

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
we might have to go onto a tripod so we

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.430 
we might have to go onto a tripod so we
can<00:00:55.289> actually<00:00:55.410> control<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.440> can't

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
can actually control it because I can't

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.250 
can actually control it because I can't
do<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.219> hand<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:02.539> well<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:04.019> pulls

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
do this with one hand so well it pulls

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.480 
do this with one hand so well it pulls
away<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:05.210> we<00:01:06.210> got<00:01:06.299> no<00:01:06.479> brakes

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
away and we got no brakes

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.109 
away and we got no brakes
then<00:01:08.490> we've<00:01:08.580> got<00:01:08.700> enough<00:01:08.850> room<00:01:09.090> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
then we've got enough room to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.090 
then we've got enough room to
demonstrate<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.990> properly<00:01:10.380> because<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
demonstrate this properly because the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.750 
demonstrate this properly because the
turning<00:01:11.760> circle<00:01:11.970> certainly<00:01:12.780> won't<00:01:12.960> turn<00:01:13.290> it

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
turning circle certainly won't turn it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.310 
turning circle certainly won't turn it
within<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.210> width<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:16.140> kitchen<00:01:18.140> but<00:01:19.140> well

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
within the width of my kitchen but well

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:30.510 
within the width of my kitchen but well
we'll<00:01:19.830> see<00:01:20.040> how<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> goes

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.190 

we've<00:01:31.520> got<00:01:31.640> no<00:01:31.820> reverse<00:01:32.180> I'll<00:01:32.570> go<00:01:32.840> down<00:01:33.020> there

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
we've got no reverse I'll go down there

00:01:33.200 --> 00:02:11.630 
we've got no reverse I'll go down there
and<00:01:33.320> turn<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.680> round

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.490 

Maxon<00:02:15.810> I'll<00:02:16.810> try<00:02:17.049> that<00:02:17.109> again

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
Maxon I'll try that again

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.929 
Maxon I'll try that again
see<00:02:17.799> if<00:02:17.859> I<00:02:17.920> can<00:02:18.010> get<00:02:18.099> it<00:02:18.189> to<00:02:18.310> turn<00:02:18.489> around<00:02:18.640> in

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
see if I can get it to turn around in

00:02:18.939 --> 00:03:23.370 
see if I can get it to turn around in
front<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.239> camera

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.560 

that'll<00:03:24.380> do
