00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
i'm working with large format which is

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.150 
i'm working with large format which is
really<00:00:45.430> neat

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.960 

4<00:00:52.730> x<00:00:52.850> 5<00:00:53.030> is<00:00:53.960> actually<00:00:54.590> a<00:00:54.770> 4<00:00:55.310> inch<00:00:55.489> by<00:00:55.700> 5<00:00:55.910> inch

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
4 x 5 is actually a 4 inch by 5 inch

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.660 
4 x 5 is actually a 4 inch by 5 inch
negative<00:00:56.630> and<00:00:57.160> everybody<00:00:58.160> knows<00:00:58.370> what<00:00:58.640> a

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
negative and everybody knows what a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.850 
negative and everybody knows what a
35-millimeter<00:00:59.360> negative<00:01:00.110> looks<00:01:00.410> like<00:01:00.620> well

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
35-millimeter negative looks like well

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.640 
35-millimeter negative looks like well
this<00:01:01.220> is<00:01:01.400> what<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.640> 4<00:01:01.970> x<00:01:02.090> 5<00:01:02.330> negative<00:01:02.960> looks<00:01:03.440> like

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
this is what a 4 x 5 negative looks like

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.860 
this is what a 4 x 5 negative looks like
and<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.070> there's<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:04.729> much<00:01:04.879> more<00:01:05.120> information

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
and and there's so much more information

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.590 
and and there's so much more information
and<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:06.380> when<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:07.400> go<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:07.820> print<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:08.570> can

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
and so when you go to print you can

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.100 
and so when you go to print you can
print<00:01:09.310> very<00:01:10.310> large<00:01:10.640> because<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.510> detail<00:01:11.869> is

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
print very large because the detail is

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.520 
print very large because the detail is
there<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.360> prints<00:01:14.690> are<00:01:14.780> absolutely

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
there and and the prints are absolutely

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.920 
there and and the prints are absolutely
beautiful

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.640 

the<00:01:22.650> magic<00:01:23.130> happens<00:01:23.550> in<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:23.850> darkroom

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
the magic happens in the darkroom

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.140 
the magic happens in the darkroom
probably<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.800> greatest<00:01:25.980> thing<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:26.700> doing

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
probably the greatest thing about doing

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.840 
probably the greatest thing about doing

of<00:01:55.880> my<00:01:56.090> pants<00:01:56.360> i<00:01:56.570> think<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:57.530> know<00:01:57.560> it's

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860

intuitive<00:01:59.140> because<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.410> my<00:02:00.500> art<00:02:00.650> background

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
intuitive because of my art background

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.000 
intuitive because of my art background
and<00:02:01.580> I've<00:02:02.180> been<00:02:02.420> largest<00:02:02.780> for<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:03.170> long<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.830> just

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
and I've been largest for so long I just

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.550 
and I've been largest for so long I just
look<00:02:04.370> at<00:02:04.490> things<00:02:04.700> differently<00:02:05.150> I<00:02:05.450> can<00:02:06.410> see

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
look at things differently I can see

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.370 
look at things differently I can see
contrast<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.310> composition<00:02:07.990> which<00:02:08.990> makes<00:02:09.259> for

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
contrast and composition which makes for

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.790 
contrast and composition which makes for
a<00:02:09.530> great<00:02:09.649> black<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.160> white<00:02:10.310> photo<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:11.740> think<00:02:12.740> I
