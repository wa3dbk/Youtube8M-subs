Universal<00:02:55.940> time<00:02:56.120> like<00:02:56.390> don't<00:02:56.600> look<00:02:56.690> at<00:02:56.840> a

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
Universal time like don't look at a

Universal time like don't look at a
microwave<00:02:57.530> clock<00:02:57.740> because<00:02:58.520> those<00:02:58.670> aren't

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
microwave clock because those aren't

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.760 
microwave clock because those aren't
always<00:02:58.970> right<00:02:59.270> they<00:02:59.660> may<00:02:59.870> be<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.440> what<00:03:00.620> you

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
always right they may be just what you

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.770 
always right they may be just what you
set<00:03:01.160> them<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.640> maybe<00:03:01.790> maybe<00:03:02.270> two<00:03:02.510> minutes

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
set them to and maybe maybe two minutes

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.080 
set them to and maybe maybe two minutes
off<00:03:02.930> which<00:03:03.140> is<00:03:03.260> way<00:03:03.440> too<00:03:03.500> much<00:03:03.680> time<00:03:03.890> off<00:03:04.160> to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
off which is way too much time off to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.210 
off which is way too much time off to
grab<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.870> server<00:03:06.050> so<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:06.620> want<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.100> make<00:03:07.190> sure

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
that has an exact time on it and once

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.229

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
that when it's a minute away I always

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.440 
that when it's a minute away I always
start<00:03:15.560> hitting<00:03:16.340> planned<00:03:16.580> realms<00:03:16.940> then
