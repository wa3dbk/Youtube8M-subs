hey<00:00:00.870> everybody<00:00:01.290> starts<00:00:01.709> over<00:00:01.979> here<00:00:02.190> and<00:00:02.340> today

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hey everybody starts over here and today

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.130 
hey everybody starts over here and today
I'm<00:00:02.730> bringing<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.120> video<00:00:03.389> dedicated<00:00:03.689> to

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
I'm bringing you a video dedicated to

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.829 
I'm bringing you a video dedicated to
shift<00:00:04.650> registers<00:00:05.210> so<00:00:06.210> what's<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.600> shift

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
shift registers so what's the shift

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.350 
shift registers so what's the shift
register<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.410> may<00:00:07.529> ask<00:00:07.820> it's<00:00:08.820> simply<00:00:09.330> a

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
register you may ask it's simply a

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.959 
register you may ask it's simply a
series<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.170> registers<00:00:10.769> or<00:00:11.040> flip-flops<00:00:11.670> that

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
series of registers or flip-flops that

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.580 
series of registers or flip-flops that
are<00:00:12.630> linked<00:00:12.900> together<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:15.020> when<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> when<00:00:16.500> it

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
are linked together and when a when it

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.760 
are linked together and when a when it
receives<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.980> pulse<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:18.050> data<00:00:19.050> travels<00:00:19.439> from

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
receives a pulse the data travels from

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.519 
receives a pulse the data travels from
one<00:00:19.830> register<00:00:20.490> into<00:00:21.150> another<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:22.260> it

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
one register into another and it

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.820 
one register into another and it
continues<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.760> chain<00:00:24.380> this<00:00:25.380> design<00:00:25.800> that

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
continues on in a chain this design that

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.849 
continues on in a chain this design that
you<00:00:26.189> see<00:00:26.430> before<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.529> linear<00:00:28.529> feedback

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
you see before you is a linear feedback

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.240 
you see before you is a linear feedback
shift<00:00:29.099> register<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.900> once<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> data<00:00:31.560> gets<00:00:32.070> to

these<00:00:39.600> red<00:00:39.960> sections<00:00:40.469> are<00:00:41.090> our<00:00:42.090> inputs<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:43.230> can

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
these red sections are our inputs we can

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.290 
these red sections are our inputs we can
also<00:00:43.530> use<00:00:43.800> them<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.070> an<00:00:44.340> output<00:00:44.700> if<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.059> if

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
also use them as an output if for you if

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.619 
also use them as an output if for you if
you<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.719> want<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.170> well<00:00:47.450> I've<00:00:48.450> put

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
you really want to as well I've put

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.970 
you really want to as well I've put
buttons<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.680> manually

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
buttons on here so you can manually

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.080 
buttons on here so you can manually
select<00:00:50.489> them<00:00:51.079> this<00:00:52.079> purple<00:00:52.890> block<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.879> my

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
select them this purple block here is my

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.260 
select them this purple block here is my
reset<00:00:54.539> I've<00:00:55.110> set<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.640> automatically

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
reset I've set it so it automatically

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.010 
reset I've set it so it automatically
sets<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.170> very<00:00:58.500> first<00:00:58.890> register<00:00:59.550> to<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> 1<00:01:00.750> or

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
sets the very first register to a 1 or

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.820 
sets the very first register to a 1 or
an<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.609> upon<00:01:02.609> reset<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.260> can<00:01:04.260> get<00:01:04.439> rid<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
an on upon reset I can get rid of that

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.899 
an on upon reset I can get rid of that
by<00:01:05.180> well<00:01:06.180> I'd<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.630> move<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.200> but

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
by well I'd have to move that out but

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
by well I'd have to move that out but
I've<00:01:08.909> made<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.299> like<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.659> because<00:01:10.500> I'm

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
I've made it like this because I'm

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.080 
I've made it like this because I'm
actually<00:01:10.799> using<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.400> register<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.060> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
actually using this register for a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.429 
actually using this register for a
counter<00:01:12.950> which<00:01:13.950> you'll<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.250> later<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
counter which you'll see later on so the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.710 
counter which you'll see later on so the
way<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.920> register<00:01:17.430> works<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:18.090> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
way that this register works is it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.690 
way that this register works is it
relies<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.790> sort<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.850> tried<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.810> tested

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
relies on a sort of tried and tested

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.300 
relies on a sort of tried and tested
method<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.939> storing<00:01:24.750> data<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.380> sort<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.100> RAM

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
method for storing data in a sort of RAM

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.270 
method for storing data in a sort of RAM
design<00:01:26.700> which<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.560> essentially<00:01:28.560> locking<00:01:29.009> out

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
design which is essentially locking out

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.859 
design which is essentially locking out
or<00:01:30.590> permanently<00:01:31.590> turning<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.430> repeater<00:01:32.880> via

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
or permanently turning on a repeater via

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.640 
or permanently turning on a repeater via
a<00:01:34.049> feedback<00:01:34.740> loop<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:36.200> repeaters<00:01:37.200> powering

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
a feedback loop so repeaters powering

a feedback loop so repeaters powering
this<00:01:37.740> block<00:01:38.070> which<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.490> goes<00:01:38.729> back<00:01:38.970> up<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
this block which then goes back up to

this block which then goes back up to
here<00:01:39.540> which<00:01:40.229> then<00:01:40.409> run<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> repeater<00:01:41.720> gets

this<00:01:46.979> off<00:01:47.220> or<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.939> my<00:01:48.090> case<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.780> shift<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.649> along

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
this off or in my case to shift it along

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.450 
this off or in my case to shift it along
we<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.270> our<00:01:51.479> input<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.159> tied

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
we have our input here I have this tied

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.800 
we have our input here I have this tied
to<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> clock<00:01:54.720> or<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.790> want<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.509> single

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to a clock or if you want just a single

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.300 
to a clock or if you want just a single
pulse<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.409> press<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> button<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.159> that

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
pulse you can press the button and that

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.679 
pulse you can press the button and that
will<00:01:59.399> give<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.990> single<00:02:00.990> shift<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.270> weird

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
will give you a single shift so weird

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.980 
will give you a single shift so weird
now<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.840> we've<00:02:04.079> noticed<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:05.270> owl<00:02:06.270> set<00:02:06.750> bit

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
now that we've noticed the owl set bit

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.589 
now that we've noticed the owl set bit
has<00:02:07.350> moved<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.190> next<00:02:08.459> one<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.819> what

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
has moved on to the next one so what

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.850 
has moved on to the next one so what
happens<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.170> when<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.190> block<00:02:11.520> goes<00:02:11.879> down

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
happens is when that block goes down

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.220 
happens is when that block goes down
it<00:02:13.730> turns<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.600> one<00:02:14.780> off<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.290> breaks<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.770> loop

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
it turns this one off it breaks the loop

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.720 
it turns this one off it breaks the loop
then<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:20.200> next<00:02:21.200> one<00:02:21.350> along<00:02:23.260> well<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:24.740> this<00:02:25.520> was

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
then the next one along well so this was

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.910 
then the next one along well so this was
here<00:02:26.120> previously<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.870> now<00:02:27.260> it's<00:02:27.440> moved<00:02:27.650> on<00:02:27.800> to

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
here previously and now it's moved on to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.550 
here previously and now it's moved on to
the<00:02:28.010> next<00:02:28.280> section<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:29.330> what<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.690> does<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:29.960> it

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
the next section so what that does is it

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.950 
the next section so what that does is it
continues<00:02:31.070> down<00:02:31.100> there<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.700> then<00:02:32.390> loops<00:02:32.720> up

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
continues down there and then loops up

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.520 
continues down there and then loops up
to<00:02:33.110> here<00:02:33.490> waiting<00:02:34.490> for<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:35.270> signal<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.080> travel

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
to here waiting for a signal to travel

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.090 
to here waiting for a signal to travel
on<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:37.340> when<00:02:37.490> we<00:02:37.610> press<00:02:37.820> our<00:02:38.320> button<00:02:39.320> here<00:02:42.100> it

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
on so when we press our button here it

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.480 
on so when we press our button here it
enables<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.120> well<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:45.590> enables<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.130> signal

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
enables the well it enables the signal

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.070 
enables the well it enables the signal
from<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.790> repeater<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.240> travel<00:02:47.720> through<00:02:47.990> the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
from the repeater to travel through the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.970 
from the repeater to travel through the
block<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:49.070> powers<00:02:49.959> this<00:02:50.959> block<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.770> block

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
block it powers this block and the block

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.850 
block it powers this block and the block
underneath<00:02:52.310> as<00:02:52.580> well<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:53.530> permanently<00:02:54.530> sets

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
underneath as well and permanently sets

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:04.120 
underneath as well and permanently sets
the<00:02:55.070> repeater<00:02:55.550> on<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.780> if<00:03:03.080> we<00:03:03.260> turn<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:03.950> clock

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
the repeater on so if we turn the clock

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:13.390 
the repeater on so if we turn the clock
on<00:03:04.480> we<00:03:05.480> can<00:03:05.630> see<00:03:05.810> how<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.140> works<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:12.190> then<00:03:13.190> it

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
on we can see how this works and then it

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.130 
on we can see how this works and then it
loops<00:03:13.610> back<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.090> start<00:03:14.360> again

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.500 

now<00:03:20.800> you're<00:03:21.580> not<00:03:21.640> limited<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.120> just<00:03:22.240> the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
now you're not limited to just the

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.320 
now you're not limited to just the
single<00:03:23.080> one<00:03:23.230> being<00:03:23.500> on<00:03:23.820> if<00:03:24.820> you<00:03:24.970> can<00:03:25.120> connect

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
single one being on if you can connect

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.090 
single one being on if you can connect
it<00:03:25.420> up<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.660> control<00:03:26.110> board<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.710> you<00:03:26.890> can

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
it up to a control board and you can

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.510 
it up to a control board and you can
write<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.180> via<00:03:28.860> whatever<00:03:29.860> control<00:03:30.220> method

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
write to it via whatever control method

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.090 
write to it via whatever control method
you<00:03:30.610> have<00:03:30.870> described<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:35.320> we<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:35.710> set<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:35.890> few

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
you have described so we just set a few

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.870 
you have described so we just set a few
more<00:03:36.130> of<00:03:36.340> these<00:03:36.460> bits<00:03:36.700> out<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:39.790> will

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
more of these bits out and it will

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:51.800 
more of these bits out and it will
continue<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.420> shift<00:03:40.480> all<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.080> these<00:03:41.230> bits

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.839 

and<00:03:51.900> that's<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.800> basics<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.550> shift

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
and that's the basics of the shift

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:00.380 
and that's the basics of the shift
register<00:03:58.130> now<00:03:59.130> where<00:03:59.370> this<00:03:59.489> is<00:03:59.700> useful<00:03:59.910> is

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
register now where this is useful is

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.510 
register now where this is useful is
what<00:04:01.290> I've<00:04:01.410> sort<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.739> used<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.099> for<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.489> a

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
what I've sort of used it for is a

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.410 
what I've sort of used it for is a
counter<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:04.650> I've<00:04:05.069> changed<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:06.030> slightly

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
counter so I've changed this slightly

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.790 
counter so I've changed this slightly
and<00:04:07.400> I've<00:04:08.400> applied<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.819> to<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.470> clock<00:04:10.470> if<00:04:10.680> you

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
and I've applied it to a clock if you

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.410 
and I've applied it to a clock if you
will<00:04:11.660> so<00:04:12.660> currently<00:04:13.080> my<00:04:13.380> clock<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:13.980> reading<00:04:14.280> at

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
will so currently my clock is reading at

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.449 
will so currently my clock is reading at
11:56<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.780> I'm<00:04:16.650> going<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:16.980> show<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.190> that<00:04:17.370> it

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
11:56 and I'm going to show you that it

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.620 
11:56 and I'm going to show you that it
loops<00:04:17.730> back<00:04:17.970> properly<00:04:18.470> I'll<00:04:19.470> manually

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.510 

increment<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.810> time<00:04:25.080> here<00:04:27.169> and<00:04:28.169> now<00:04:28.520> we'll

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
increment the time here and now we'll

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.610 
increment the time here and now we'll
see<00:04:29.729> it<00:04:29.820> loop<00:04:30.000> back<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.240> zero<00:04:31.050> time<00:04:31.350> or

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
see it loop back to zero time or

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.790 
see it loop back to zero time or
midnight<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.669> continues<00:04:36.120> on<00:04:36.240> again<00:04:36.800> so

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
midnight and it continues on again so

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.310 
midnight and it continues on again so
essentially<00:04:38.610> this<00:04:38.760> is<00:04:38.820> just<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.479> whole

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
essentially this is just a a whole

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.550 
essentially this is just a a whole
series<00:04:40.710> of<00:04:41.990> linear<00:04:42.990> feedback<00:04:43.350> shift

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
series of linear feedback shift

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.010 
series of linear feedback shift
registers<00:04:44.750> ten<00:04:45.750> bits<00:04:45.990> six<00:04:46.889> bits<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:48.020> well

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
registers ten bits six bits and well

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.070 
registers ten bits six bits and well
three<00:04:49.440> bits<00:04:49.650> down<00:04:49.889> here<00:04:50.510> with<00:04:51.510> some<00:04:51.780> logic

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
three bits down here with some logic

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.460 
three bits down here with some logic
attached<00:04:54.050> down<00:04:55.050> here<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:56.160> looks<00:04:56.190> back<00:04:56.669> from

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
attached down here so it looks back from

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.279 
attached down here so it looks back from
24<00:04:58.470> instead<00:04:58.800> of<00:04:58.950> going<00:04:59.250> from<00:05:00.200> instead<00:05:01.200> of

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
24 instead of going from instead of

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.029 
24 instead of going from instead of
continuing<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:01.880> 24<00:05:02.880> 25<00:05:03.360> 26<00:05:03.630> and<00:05:04.140> so<00:05:04.380> on<00:05:04.590> it's

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
continuing to 24 25 26 and so on it's

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.590 
continuing to 24 25 26 and so on it's
not<00:05:05.160> just<00:05:05.340> limited<00:05:05.700> to<00:05:05.729> a<00:05:05.850> clock<00:05:06.240> you<00:05:06.450> could

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
not just limited to a clock you could

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.290 
not just limited to a clock you could
use<00:05:06.720> this<00:05:06.900> for<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.200> scoreboard<00:05:07.770> with<00:05:08.729> two<00:05:09.060> teams

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
use this for a scoreboard with two teams

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.779 
use this for a scoreboard with two teams
versing<00:05:09.780> each<00:05:09.900> other<00:05:10.140> to<00:05:11.130> keep<00:05:11.250> track<00:05:11.490> of<00:05:11.520> the

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
versing each other to keep track of the

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:18.190 
versing each other to keep track of the
points<00:05:12.419> or<00:05:13.410> ounds<00:05:14.400> or<00:05:14.580> whatever<00:05:14.940> you<00:05:15.060> will<00:05:16.669> and

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
points or ounds or whatever you will and

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.350 
points or ounds or whatever you will and
I<00:05:19.200> have<00:05:19.380> this<00:05:19.560> hooked<00:05:19.770> up<00:05:19.979> in<00:05:20.160> a<00:05:20.220> way<00:05:20.370> that<00:05:20.760> when

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
I have this hooked up in a way that when

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.270 
I have this hooked up in a way that when
it<00:05:21.770> goes<00:05:22.770> from<00:05:23.010> a<00:05:23.190> nine<00:05:23.520> back<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.150> zero<00:05:25.280> it

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
it goes from a nine back to a zero it

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.719 
it goes from a nine back to a zero it
continues<00:05:26.850> and<00:05:27.210> acts<00:05:27.780> as<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.260> impulse<00:05:29.160> or<00:05:29.610> the

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
continues and acts as the impulse or the

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.670 
continues and acts as the impulse or the
clock<00:05:30.000> source<00:05:30.360> for<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:30.810> next<00:05:31.380> set<00:05:31.560> of

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
clock source for the next set of

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.260 
clock source for the next set of
registers<00:05:32.510> so<00:05:33.510> when<00:05:34.410> this<00:05:34.590> goes<00:05:34.830> 29<00:05:36.470> it<00:05:37.470> turns

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
registers so when this goes 29 it turns

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.460 
registers so when this goes 29 it turns
this<00:05:39.270> torch<00:05:39.660> off<00:05:39.960> and<00:05:41.210> it<00:05:42.210> also<00:05:42.419> requires<00:05:43.020> a

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
this torch off and it also requires a

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.450 
this torch off and it also requires a
clock<00:05:44.160> impulse<00:05:44.580> from<00:05:44.820> here<00:05:45.800> to<00:05:46.800> turn<00:05:47.070> this

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
clock impulse from here to turn this

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.420 
clock impulse from here to turn this
torch<00:05:47.820> off<00:05:48.169> which<00:05:49.169> will<00:05:49.380> then<00:05:49.710> trigger<00:05:50.160> our

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
torch off which will then trigger our

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.700 
torch off which will then trigger our
next<00:05:50.789> impulse<00:05:51.120> otherwise<00:05:51.990> if<00:05:52.320> we<00:05:52.410> didn't<00:05:52.620> have

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
next impulse otherwise if we didn't have

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.040 
next impulse otherwise if we didn't have
this<00:05:52.889> clock<00:05:53.190> impulse<00:05:53.550> as<00:05:53.760> well<00:05:53.789> as<00:05:54.720> soon<00:05:54.930> as

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
this clock impulse as well as soon as

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.560 
this clock impulse as well as soon as
you<00:05:55.169> get<00:05:55.350> to<00:05:55.500> a<00:05:55.530> nine<00:05:55.830> it<00:05:56.520> would<00:05:56.669> trigger<00:05:56.910> which

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
you get to a nine it would trigger which

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.560 
you get to a nine it would trigger which
is<00:05:57.600> too<00:05:58.260> early<00:05:58.620> and<00:05:58.830> if<00:05:59.490> you<00:06:00.060> just<00:06:00.240> have<00:06:00.419> the

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
is too early and if you just have the

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.930 
is too early and if you just have the
clock<00:06:00.810> impulse

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
clock impulse

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.610 
clock impulse
well<00:06:03.750> then<00:06:03.870> you're<00:06:03.960> going<00:06:04.050> to<00:06:04.140> be<00:06:04.200> triggering

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
well then you're going to be triggering

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.080 
well then you're going to be triggering
every<00:06:04.860> single<00:06:05.130> time<00:06:05.310> this<00:06:05.460> one's<00:06:05.700> triggering

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
every single time this one's triggering

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.600 
every single time this one's triggering
as<00:06:06.240> well<00:06:06.420> so<00:06:07.290> that's<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:07.680> way<00:06:07.770> that<00:06:07.950> I<00:06:08.010> get

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
as well so that's the way that I get

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.240 
as well so that's the way that I get
around<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:09.590> sequential<00:06:10.590> logic<00:06:10.860> for

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
around the sequential logic for

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:17.120 
around the sequential logic for
connecting<00:06:11.730> the<00:06:12.540> next<00:06:12.990> highest<00:06:13.170> bit<00:06:13.620> up<00:06:15.680> so<00:06:16.680> I

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
connecting the next highest bit up so I

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.540 
connecting the next highest bit up so I
have<00:06:17.760> this<00:06:17.880> design<00:06:19.160> set<00:06:20.160> up<00:06:20.250> like<00:06:20.400> this

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
have this design set up like this

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.940 
have this design set up like this
because<00:06:20.790> I<00:06:21.210> require<00:06:21.600> it<00:06:21.930> for<00:06:21.960> my<00:06:22.290> seven

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
because I require it for my seven

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
because I require it for my seven
segment<00:06:23.340> display<00:06:23.640> on<00:06:23.790> top<00:06:25.340> otherwise<00:06:26.340> you

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
segment display on top otherwise you

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.880 
segment display on top otherwise you
could<00:06:27.150> sort<00:06:27.360> of<00:06:27.390> cut<00:06:27.960> out<00:06:27.990> this<00:06:28.260> whole<00:06:28.440> section

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
could sort of cut out this whole section

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:34.700 
could sort of cut out this whole section
and<00:06:29.040> make<00:06:29.190> it<00:06:29.370> slightly<00:06:29.490> less<00:06:29.940> wide<00:06:33.680> so<00:06:34.680> that

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
and make it slightly less wide so that

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.120 
and make it slightly less wide so that
continues<00:06:35.520> from<00:06:35.790> there<00:06:36.120> and<00:06:36.480> goes<00:06:37.050> to<00:06:37.350> this

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
continues from there and goes to this

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.060 
continues from there and goes to this
decoder<00:06:38.580> here<00:06:39.080> it's<00:06:40.080> a<00:06:40.140> very<00:06:40.320> simple<00:06:40.620> decoder

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
decoder here it's a very simple decoder

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.700 
decoder here it's a very simple decoder
it's<00:06:41.460> also<00:06:41.640> a<00:06:42.020> you<00:06:43.020> could<00:06:43.200> change<00:06:43.440> it<00:06:43.680> to

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
it's also a you could change it to

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.380 
it's also a you could change it to
displaying<00:06:44.490> anything<00:06:44.700> you<00:06:44.940> can<00:06:45.150> on<00:06:45.180> the

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
displaying anything you can on the

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.630 
displaying anything you can on the
7-segment<00:06:45.870> display<00:06:46.320> so<00:06:47.010> you<00:06:47.040> can<00:06:47.280> display

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.640 
7-segment display so you can display

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.050 
7-segment display so you can display
quite<00:06:48.000> a<00:06:48.030> few<00:06:48.270> letters<00:06:48.540> as<00:06:48.930> well<00:06:49.640> so<00:06:50.640> instead

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
quite a few letters as well so instead

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.930 
quite a few letters as well so instead
of<00:06:51.120> a<00:06:51.300> scoreboard<00:06:51.840> or<00:06:52.260> a<00:06:52.520> clock<00:06:53.520> like<00:06:53.760> I've

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
of a scoreboard or a clock like I've

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.940 
of a scoreboard or a clock like I've
made<00:06:54.330> you<00:06:54.780> could<00:06:54.960> have<00:06:55.200> a<00:06:55.440> whole<00:06:55.620> bunch<00:06:55.830> of

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
made you could have a whole bunch of

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.440 
made you could have a whole bunch of
letters<00:06:56.190> and<00:06:56.750> you<00:06:57.750> could<00:06:57.900> have<00:06:58.970> this<00:06:59.970> clock

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
letters and you could have this clock

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.290 
letters and you could have this clock
connected<00:07:00.990> to<00:07:01.170> all<00:07:01.440> of<00:07:01.680> them<00:07:01.970> so<00:07:02.970> it<00:07:03.180> it

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
connected to all of them so it it

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.910 
connected to all of them so it it
Scrolls<00:07:03.750> a<00:07:03.870> message<00:07:04.230> across<00:07:04.530> the<00:07:04.770> whole

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920 
Scrolls a message across the whole

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.560 
Scrolls a message across the whole
screen<00:07:07.340> that's<00:07:08.340> just<00:07:08.490> another<00:07:08.700> user<00:07:08.970> you<00:07:09.300> use

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570 
screen that's just another user you use

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.140 
screen that's just another user you use
for<00:07:09.840> it<00:07:09.930> the<00:07:10.770> way<00:07:10.860> that<00:07:11.100> these<00:07:11.280> decoders<00:07:11.790> work

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
for it the way that these decoders work

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.290 
for it the way that these decoders work
is<00:07:12.480> we<00:07:12.900> have<00:07:13.080> a<00:07:13.110> signal<00:07:13.590> and<00:07:14.550> it<00:07:14.700> travels<00:07:15.120> to

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
is we have a signal and it travels to

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.260 
is we have a signal and it travels to
each<00:07:15.510> of<00:07:15.720> these<00:07:15.840> lines<00:07:16.250> the<00:07:17.250> bottom<00:07:17.550> three<00:07:17.880> the

middle one and the top three and what it
does<00:07:24.540> is<00:07:24.840> it<00:07:25.170> turns<00:07:25.670> we<00:07:26.670> can't<00:07:27.210> see<00:07:27.450> from<00:07:27.480> this

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:27.750 
does is it turns we can't see from this

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:33.890 
does is it turns we can't see from this
one<00:07:28.550> the<00:07:29.550> top<00:07:29.760> one<00:07:30.560> so<00:07:32.000> when<00:07:33.000> one<00:07:33.510> of<00:07:33.600> these<00:07:33.690> is

on<00:07:34.490> it<00:07:35.490> turns<00:07:35.790> the<00:07:36.120> required<00:07:36.510> torch<00:07:36.900> off<00:07:37.200> which

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:37.950 
on it turns the required torch off which

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.960 
on it turns the required torch off which
then<00:07:38.190> turns<00:07:38.520> on<00:07:39.170> the<00:07:40.170> torch<00:07:40.500> lines<00:07:40.830> here<00:07:41.190> which

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:41.970 
then turns on the torch lines here which

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:47.330 
then turns on the torch lines here which
correspond<00:07:42.720> to<00:07:43.280> a<00:07:44.330> panel<00:07:45.330> or<00:07:45.600> a<00:07:46.410> three<00:07:46.830> section

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 
correspond to a panel or a three section

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 
on the seven segment display it's just a

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.070 
change all the values around there's
more<00:07:56.250> compact<00:07:56.790> designs<00:07:57.180> around<00:07:57.540> but<00:07:57.780> I<00:07:57.900> like

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 
more compact designs around but I like

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.900 
more compact designs around but I like
using<00:07:58.290> this<00:07:58.530> one<00:07:58.740> because<00:07:58.860> it's<00:07:59.160> just<00:07:59.220> easy<00:07:59.700> to

00:07:59.900 --> 00:07:59.910 
using this one because it's just easy to

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.130 
using this one because it's just easy to
change<00:08:00.120> anything<00:08:00.480> at<00:08:00.810> will<00:08:00.990> and

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:03.140 
change anything at will and

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.900 
change anything at will and
everything<00:08:04.140> has<00:08:04.290> a<00:08:04.320> set<00:08:04.950> time<00:08:05.220> that'll<00:08:05.580> go<00:08:05.730> off

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:05.910 
everything has a set time that'll go off

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:11.840 
everything has a set time that'll go off
at<00:08:08.210> and<00:08:09.380> that<00:08:10.380> covers<00:08:10.770> up<00:08:10.920> the<00:08:10.950> shift

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:11.850 
at and that covers up the shift

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.970 
at and that covers up the shift
registers<00:08:12.270> for<00:08:12.450> use<00:08:12.630> as<00:08:12.990> a<00:08:13.760> counting<00:08:14.760> device
