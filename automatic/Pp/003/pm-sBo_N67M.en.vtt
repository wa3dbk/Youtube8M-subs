got twenty-twenty vision is for 77 PPI
so<00:00:21.630> we're<00:00:21.779> getting<00:00:21.960> pretty<00:00:22.109> close<00:00:22.880> some<00:00:23.880> of

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
so we're getting pretty close some of

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.359 
so we're getting pretty close some of
the<00:00:24.090> nice<00:00:24.300> function<00:00:25.170> some<00:00:25.529> features<00:00:25.740> are<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
the nice function some features are the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.769 
the nice function some features are the
qslide<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:28.680> playing<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.250> full<00:00:29.820> HD<00:00:30.420> video

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
qslide so I'm playing this full HD video

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.049 
qslide so I'm playing this full HD video
here<00:00:31.080> because<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.439> does<00:00:31.619> run<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:31.980> full<00:00:32.219> HD<00:00:32.790> are

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
here because it does run on full HD are

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.450 
here because it does run on full HD are
handsome<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.800> then<00:00:34.829> minimize<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.850> video

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
handsome you can then minimize the video

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.580 
handsome you can then minimize the video
like<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.840> then<00:00:39.960> move<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.320> video

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
like so you can then move the video

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.610 
like so you can then move the video
around<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.129> screen<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:43.020> change<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
around the screen you can change the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.430 
around the screen you can change the
shape<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> size<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.170> top<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.350> that

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
shape and size and then on top of that

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.279 
shape and size and then on top of that
you<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.770> change<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.219> transparency<00:00:47.460> level

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
you can change the transparency level

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.049 
you can change the transparency level
and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.500> video<00:00:49.770> will<00:00:49.980> stay<00:00:50.190> running<00:00:50.640> as<00:00:50.850> you

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
and the video will stay running as you

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.439 
and the video will stay running as you
open<00:00:51.480> multiple<00:00:51.860> applications<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.309> say<00:00:54.270> you're

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
open multiple applications so say you're

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.290 
open multiple applications so say you're
using<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.020> calculator<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:56.489> then<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.120> can

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
using the calculator and then you can

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.819 
using the calculator and then you can
minimize<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:57.960> down<00:00:58.109> as<00:00:58.320> well<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.739> that

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
minimize that one down as well and that

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.340 
minimize that one down as well and that
becomes<00:00:59.070> part<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> qslide<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.989> then<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.199> can

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
becomes part of qslide and then you can

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.080 
becomes part of qslide and then you can
even<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.920> top<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.399> add<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> third

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
even on top of that add a third

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.859 
even on top of that add a third
application<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.309> calendar

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
application so you can see in calendar

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.490 
application so you can see in calendar
remembering<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.990> we've<00:01:07.110> still<00:01:07.290> got<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
remembering that we've still got the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.310 
remembering that we've still got the
video<00:01:07.740> running<00:01:08.040> underneath

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
video running underneath

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.740 
video running underneath
so<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.220> can<00:01:10.370> have<00:01:10.490> three<00:01:10.820> applications<00:01:11.330> or

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
so you can have three applications or

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.290 
so you can have three applications or
running<00:01:12.260> at<00:01:12.500> once<00:01:12.820> another<00:01:13.820> thing<00:01:14.000> about<00:01:14.120> the

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
running at once another thing about the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.980 
running at once another thing about the
g<00:01:14.479> pro<00:01:14.780> is<00:01:15.050> we've<00:01:15.920> got<00:01:16.100> cube<00:01:16.430> remote<00:01:16.930> so<00:01:17.930> you

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
g pro is we've got cube remote so you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.460 
g pro is we've got cube remote so you
can<00:01:18.290> use<00:01:18.440> your<00:01:18.650> device<00:01:18.800> as<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.370> remote<00:01:19.820> control

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
phones have got like edgy shutter so you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.120 
phones have got like edgy shutter so you
tell<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.780> camera<00:02:00.020> cheese<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.620> it<00:02:00.740> will<00:02:00.920> take

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
tell the camera cheese and it will take

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.990 
tell the camera cheese and it will take
the<00:02:01.250> picture<00:02:01.640> which<00:02:01.940> is<00:02:02.120> quite<00:02:02.300> nice<00:02:02.860> and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
the picture which is quite nice and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.460 
the picture which is quite nice and
variable<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.120> Mary<00:02:05.300> summer<00:02:05.570> capabilities<00:02:06.200> I

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
variable and Mary summer capabilities I

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.380 
variable and Mary summer capabilities I
mean<00:02:06.650> it's<00:02:06.800> got<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.010> 2.1<00:02:07.430> front<00:02:07.940> camera<00:02:08.330> and

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
mean it's got the 2.1 front camera and

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.660 
mean it's got the 2.1 front camera and
13<00:02:09.170> megapixel<00:02:09.709> camera<00:02:10.250> as<00:02:10.399> well<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:13.310> that's<00:02:13.520> a

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
13 megapixel camera as well so that's a
