00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:11.170
 the nights here I present you good as 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.170
 you have already seen all the lg optimus 2x 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.150
 this video is currently for 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:24.210
 show them how is this terminal going with 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:29.289
 the latest version of google that is the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.980
 4.1.1 what would be jelly bean like 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.920
 come I have this side a rom that the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.420
 senate on motorcycles 10 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.559
 it's unofficial because the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.629
 optimized certain developers for 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.760
 adapt them to this phone because 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.760
 the jee not yet 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.000
 released an official update 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.490
 he only freed her in Korea for the 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.380
 jeep 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.620
 in that 660 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.110
 and you can not float on this phone 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:11.170
 because it would be 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.270
 not unusable but if it would be damaged and 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.340
 we would have to do one by all of those 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.460
 things to be able to work again 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.720
 but how well they see this would be 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:27.010
 version 4.1.1 and the living in our 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.160
 terminal the truth runs quite well 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.710
 the truth is super fluid look like 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.530
 Super super screen transitions 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.900
 fluid 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.850
 I really do not have any problem 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.060
 version is quite stable 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.610
 it's pretty stable here we close 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.399
 the applications in the version is 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.570
 pretty stable as I told you we're going 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:55.040
 to adjustments for you to see 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.210
 phone training and here we have it 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.150
 4.1.1 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:05.240
 what is the latest version of google here 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.240
 we see the typical animation of living 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.310
 we click here 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.880
 we can see the animation the truth that 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.270
 to make everyone very sincere 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.960
 I was hesitant to install this rom 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.760
 or not because I had the phone 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:27.379
 originally with 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.750
 of official interpreter of elche la 2.3.4 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:34.010
 which is the official version for this 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.930
 terminal and was hesitant to install him 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.409
 or not install this because it is 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.360
 version as the sina not noticed 9 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.489
 presents certain errors that it 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.379
 describe below for example this 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.049
 terminal has great capacity 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.980
 video recording in resolutions of 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.980
 1080p 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.070
 how can you see 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.520
 the camera serves the camera quite well 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.500
 Take pictures you can see that 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.950
 there is no problem there is no 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.760
 problem with the photographs but if 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.450
 we want to record a video 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.690
 what would this be 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.780
 for the video throws us an error 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.510
 because you do not have the drivers for 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.270
 nvidia remember that this terminal has 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.380
 the dual core dual nvidia processor 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:32.470
 tegra 2 and have not released the drivers of the 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.540
 role of them so that they do not 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.069
 can not be optimized and can not be 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.099
 fix these errors but 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.170
 for this book we can install 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.850
 an application called video camp 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.870
 illusion pro 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.240
 and it allows us to record videos in 720 p without 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.650
 no problem 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.230
 the truth is that it works quite well 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.260
 quite pretty well and we have this 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.420
 application that allows us to record videos 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.830
 in that image quality or in 1080 as 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.500
 the terminal can do it but yes 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.960
 at 720 p 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.470
 continues to show certain functionalities 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.620
 from here of jelly bean de veras see that 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.750
 the transitions go very well despite 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.730
 that the terminal does not have fray bears 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.730
 from nvidia 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.969
 all applications run pretty 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.239
 fast 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:36.950
 everything opens very fast there is no 

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:39.370
 book there is no reset 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.320
 No other error mentioned above 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.840
 including games 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.220
 they run very well we are going to demonstrate 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.320
 that we are going to look for a game here 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.380
 so that you well 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.870
 this game asks for a lot of equipment 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.890
 and the truth is that he runs it without any 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.260
 problem 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:05.700
 it runs super fluid and in quality 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:09.000
 graphic the highest there is high 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.040
 so I really recommend them 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.290
 this version because it puts the terminal 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.630
 very much very much faster and more 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.160
 fluid thing that I do not agree with 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.160
 he and because 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.720
 has a large terminal as is the 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.890
 optimus 2x that is this and does not take advantage 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.630
 with your software 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.640
 that's why the developers that I give 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.200
 thanks in advance develop 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.470
 these versions are worth the redundancy 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.750
 to optimize this terminal they are going to 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.690
 see that I'm not wrong at all 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:43.080
 when I say that the phone runs super 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:46.170
 well super fluid and does not have any 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.849
 no problem at game level 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.860
 look at the image quality 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:55.139
 for what 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.139
 no problem here when playing it 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.900
 see that everything worked well see that 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.630
 the game ran pretty well 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.699
 and when closing the application in 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.180
 this case the game closes with 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:26.789
 pretty quickly thing that when I 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:31.139
 had the official version 2.3.4 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:33.419
 gingerbread took a lot 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.409
 close applications and show another 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:39.349
 what would be the menu 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:42.739
 it also happened to me that by playing like that 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:45.319
 the team asked for a lot and when closing the 

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:47.920
 game to be rebooted that is really 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:52.880
 it does not happen at all 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.880
 with this rom I await your comments 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.880
 really what 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.139
 I recommend them because it is very stable 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.680
 although 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:03.680
 do not 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:09.130
 it is not the official 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.580
 I really recommend them if 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.889
 they want 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.560
 know how to install it like flashing the and 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:17.780
 where to download it request me that some 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.080
 tutorial and I explain how to go from 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:25.210
 the official version 2.3.4 gingerbread to 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:29.380
 this one is super easy only 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:31.690
 you can ask me by giving them 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.630
 comments I would like them to give to 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:38.560
 I like it in the video and I wait for your 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:41.550
 comments and suggestions of this video 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.550
 thank you
