 songs that article that talks about that of things not necessarily funny 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.380
 but who touches her 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.840
 because muriel robin can open to others her audience she has 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.760
 reconciled with itself have today been reinforced by 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.789
 cats question so much to tolerate the slightest intrusion into his private life 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.310
 she says why she felt address and the murderer by afp a 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.109
 match 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.929
 we saw her appear with a friend muriel robin this is the portrait of the 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:43.680
 week of thierry demaizière 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.069
 at the 50 days Friborg to his deathbed 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:50.479
 the banks of the arno ranks of harmony are welcome how to do better 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.639
 in the matt moussilou series it took what love torres worth of 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:57.639
 10 euros there was advised to environmental aspects 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.290
 in the 50m surpassing the downhill but 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.030
 the softer ones for me I started these are softer lines 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.040
 the study also shows that wage developments 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.490
 that of poutine in china for a unique concert we are all hamzeh 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.920
 all femininity 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.830
 the match was hard with me 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.830
 it took a lot given percent 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.090
 we considered that like last year it was unfortunately 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.410
 during his tenure 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.880
 we have a good soldier nothing good soldier this female port are not more numerous than 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.730
 this is a good soldier has learned at any cost despite the seriousness occurred 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.230
 several heads back as a good soldier times the alarmed in recent 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.230
 salary 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.460
 the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.460
 at 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.020
 polanski novel is useful if you had to tell him 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.980
 Hair color 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.620
 to this day after day has come 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.280
 super talent 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.790
 already qualified but it spells morning on i-TV first 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.409
 in any case all roads lead lipstick all 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:10.539
 I think it is 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.479
 cc it's pretty hearty national 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.240
 this question in another what would that be 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.499
 but any other story of all our shows 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.669
 there is no this box 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.669
 the pressures the union must emancipate itself from this vegetable 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.809
 j so harsh against rebel sets 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.569
 the action of this plot are waiting 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 tears of pressure escaped a delay 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.999
 and in this new challenge 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.579
 she told me that your biggest love story is your mom 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.839
 two died and two in one hand wanted to accompany m under the pressure 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:48.339
 from his family his wife to wife also 4 the end of the tunnel 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.839
 you have nothing to say about it but it's important to say that 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:55.019
 it's important especially to see her here I say I wanted to go with 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.619
 she's going to work 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:58.089
 with his environment 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:01.929
 lead her well or so little for their fans one more time both 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.349
 that is why 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.209
 jonathan to play 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.209
 dad 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:15.879
 ouattara 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.779
 and in restaurant 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.369
 not bad 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:21.660
 it is likely rebound 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.419
 the last time the voice is going to take place 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.379
 in the group g the letter 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.399
 so why not 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:31.869
 remember I know very well that my father died seven years ago when 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.889
 even a hell of his illness badly to forget for now the restaurant 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.549
 propose to carcassonne 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.189
 what is missing sometimes 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:41.059
 not yet of this world 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:45.069
 hope has asked me to let go today the world of the mythical it 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.309
 beings the meeting and 26th if that's its meaning so much about to 5 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:52.009
 morning hours who was the boss of the business except that I have not everything 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:54.349
 unlimited very wide paws or private not taken 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.349
 she also said that the husband and the children and grandchildren 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:59.499
 some 600 flights 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.919
 you still need joy and that is foldable 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.169
 % and so that I kept it was not originally planned that 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.730
 whoever neglects them 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.789
 raymonde of the death of your mother 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:12.589
 and especially since the one of luke steele haut he denies these vip mans 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:14.699
 we have to come back to the score 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.359
 and as the pressure they 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.620
 forgetting, no doubt, yes, can it spill its expenses? 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.999
 ahmed ben helli 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:23.499
 go ahead go ahead 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:26.569
 you're lighter anyway today I'm feeling lighter 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:27.909
 finer mouth 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.729
 Paolucci 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.729
 I know that the prophet week 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.490
 the trait that I discovered 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.789
 now 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.770
 at home with character traits 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.930
 this one 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.750
 ultra 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.750
 ultra ultra ultra-sensitive 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.120
 and marble once I got myself some moments too by markit 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.900
 62 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.979
 so like that 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.629
 and it's just that's all from there so here I know I do not like 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.900
 more TV for example the one that the press 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.419
 I can not I can not have a thing 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.199
 I read I can not get used to things in the water I see a child and 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.460
 which is unfounded Wednesday what is it that this world is 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.580
 this man lying more victims would have seen 50 years to finally become 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.580
 happy 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.909
 you often do not know ever 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.889
 and in this fifties to see reborn we saw you at the lagoon of 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:21.900
 match 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.250
 in the arm of your opinion it can because if we are known or eiffel tower is 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.530
 a way to display your your love to understand and we can be of 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.460
 wick with her 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.479
 one minute 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.069
 and a match decided to 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:34.539
 the group will put the text 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.160
 a place of debauchery 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.279
 because for me everything you have 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.419
 a common outsing court of appeal it must be said also that it is said that he and his 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.020
 used tools spiritual 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.190
 she says m majali for me this collection is done without my consent 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.699
 I have a trial is underway 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.210
 and then I won selling prices 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.139
 this is very serious 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.200
 and that's fine 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.520
 who knows who I am 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.189
 who knows the clichés 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:02.629
 how sarko is 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:06.429
 on the person who follows the daily of a premiere of the show I'm not 

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:09.930
 the first to do it right after halftime of a match 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.720
 I am little knife for 15 years and a half in cabins to women of 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.439
 men 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.439
 and who knows who I am 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:23.479
 20h16 it is a tool of outraged violence at the mouth of the river 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.830
 we imagined it was a very happy race of this study 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.169
 they all wanted six victims who he said hiding not that I'm a 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.029
 push of energy prices 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:35.529
 I'm told I was not I'm talking to you 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.270
 trumpet to the whole France 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.160
 and if I trumpet it is I who choose Lent certainly not the 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.119
 people in my place 

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:44.010
 starting from that 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.669
 it will go through tamara marthe 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.669
 in relation to that 

00:06:57.339 --> 00:07:00.249
 after defection but they fall face to face and a catch in 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:02.310
 account to decide decided to sit 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.789
 this visit why not sing 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:06.840
 it's not that I think I'm dad 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.550
 is that I say why not sing I always wanted to sing either 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.810
 I want to be treated 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.080
 training on vacation 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.090
 this last 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.090
 and really it's not about songs 

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:22.580
 his decree was published a year ago with my agent we already heard 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.999
 something with the blues is that you are exposed in class since that 

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:27.050
 the words that m 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.770
 what is a balance sheet structure 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.659
 in his apartment but what a journey 

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:34.059
 but I am not animated 

00:07:34.059 --> 00:07:35.869
 I worked for before that 

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:38.719
 those seven years of exile but what you can give us some words this 

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:39.819
 evening humming 

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:42.699
 that's what we wanted to settle down like that and who's talking about 

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:43.539
 you 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:45.679
 I might do 

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:48.679
 the common memory a month 

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:51.710
 vincennes 

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.000
 the common memory or less one must dream better everything that is black 

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:58.550
 there is little doubt that niger 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.080
 the rest of the announced tour 

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.629
 it's a continuous music 

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:05.819
 and by the way the end of the song says 

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.759
 the rest I swing everything 

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:11.069
 and I was able to continue 

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:14.199
 and for fans of muriel robin the humorist you can find 

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:16.990
 all of his shows in a box 

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.870
 the dvd that just came out in
