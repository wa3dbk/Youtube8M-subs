at the end of the quarter but that did

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.880 
at the end of the quarter but that did
not<00:05:44.910> work<00:05:45.600> out<00:05:45.840> so<00:05:45.900> we're<00:05:46.260> going<00:05:46.410> into<00:05:46.770> the

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
the comment section below as ak-47

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.090 
the comment section below as ak-47
knocks<00:06:00.660> down<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:00.930> three<00:06:01.289> to<00:06:01.320> tie<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.710> game<00:06:02.039> up

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
knocks down the three to tie the game up

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.900 
knocks down the three to tie the game up
but<00:06:02.789> anyway<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.720> question<00:06:03.960> is<00:06:04.650> how<00:06:05.310> long<00:06:05.580> will

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
but anyway the question is how long will

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.820 
but anyway the question is how long will
it<00:06:05.940> take<00:06:06.300> the<00:06:06.479> Eastern<00:06:06.930> Conference<00:06:07.229> to<00:06:07.710> be

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
it take the Eastern Conference to be

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.529 
it take the Eastern Conference to be
better<00:06:08.100> than<00:06:08.310> the<00:06:08.430> Western<00:06:08.850> Conference<00:06:09.150> in

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
better than the Western Conference in

right<00:06:12.840> there<00:06:13.080> to<00:06:13.200> take<00:06:13.229> the<00:06:13.560> lead<00:06:13.710> by<00:06:13.919> one

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
right there to take the lead by one

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
point anyway what I mean by that is

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.790

let's look right now at the current
conferences<00:06:33.270> right<00:06:33.539> now<00:06:33.840> there's<00:06:34.650> nine<00:06:35.039> teams

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
conferences right now there's nine teams

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.320

in<00:06:36.000> the<00:06:36.240> East<00:06:36.510> that<00:06:36.659> have

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
in the East that have

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.170

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
in the West to have a negative record

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.010 
in the West to have a negative record
that<00:06:42.759> is<00:06:42.970> ridiculous

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
that is ridiculous

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.950 
that is ridiculous
since<00:06:45.009> the<00:06:45.159> NBA<00:06:45.610> started<00:06:46.419> two<00:06:46.569> Western

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
since the NBA started two Western

since the NBA started two Western
Conference<00:06:47.289> has<00:06:47.800> always<00:06:48.159> been<00:06:48.669> better<00:06:48.969> than

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
Conference has always been better than

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.839

the<00:06:49.389> Eastern<00:06:49.750> Conference<00:06:49.960> always<00:06:50.710> how<00:06:51.490> many

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:51.849 
the Eastern Conference always how many

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.990 
the Eastern Conference always how many
years<00:06:52.389> do<00:06:53.169> you<00:06:53.379> think<00:06:53.770> it<00:06:54.069> will<00:06:54.400> take<00:06:54.699> before

00:06:59.879 --> 00:06:59.889 
conference in the NBA I think it would

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:02.790 
conference in the NBA I think it would
take<00:07:00.099> at<00:07:00.340> least<00:07:00.400> two<00:07:00.849> decades<00:07:01.060> if<00:07:01.599> not<00:07:01.990> more<00:07:02.560> I

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
take at least two decades if not more I

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.610 
take at least two decades if not more I

to be honest I don't even see the

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.469 
to be honest I don't even see the
Eastern<00:07:06.009> Conference<00:07:06.280> ever<00:07:06.819> being<00:07:07.300> better

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479 
Eastern Conference ever being better

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:09.149
