00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
 a team that presents 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.230
 interesting programs and precisely the 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.080
 gymnasts are always very prepared and 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.000
 the time of the united states 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.630
 jennifer rock ma monica norman laura 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.150
 all unique and yet sharon da sui 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.150
 natali mag iv and alisa cano 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.630
 our previous experience that it was 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.490
 framed while exchange card that 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.050
 then we hope to have here at ours 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.580
 microphone also to comment on this 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.900
 good proof of the blue then this 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.760
 US team is the states 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.590
 united they cannot succeed in breaking through 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.750
 in rhythmic gymnastics as instead 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.750
 it happens for example in gymnastics 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.030
 artistic still for now 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.570
 taking some measurements by calling 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.040
 also of the coaches mainly 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.379
 Russians also have gymnasts 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.430
 foreigners however still not even if they are 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.120
 much better than the beginning 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.200
 in fact the idea masquerades 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.660
 Russian pd are just now 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.910
 however we see their work because how 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.740
 we have already said new code then 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.010
 new exercise gear names that 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.270
 we see 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.859
 not much is enough 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.659
 go even to read that music 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.659
 let's see if this music helps me 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.890
 all 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.649
 Golden Boy 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.159
 n 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.680
 no 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.220
 Well 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.220
 year 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.030
 already 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.390
 anyway, slow passion must 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.290
 be always present a dynamism 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.700
 that is precisely these grandmother's breaks thus 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.569
 here they are 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.129
 I said if we talked about it I said between the 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.950
 of the new code there is also a novelty 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:55.599
 as for the jury and see 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.640
 people were penalized 15 11 with 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.739
 penalty points and the difference of 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.930
 score on the execution from 88 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.269
 of Italy has gone to 73 if 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.400
 you think he only took 0 30 's 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.250
 executions more than Finland 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.220
 they are unthinkable beyond having had 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.590
 precisely the 0 3 of banality for the breeze 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.680
 what I said was successful and pedantic 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.630
 another novelty of the new code is the 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.850
 composition of the jury the jury is 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.680
 composed of only two groups , that one 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.300
 of the difficulty that looks at the 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.460
 difficulty at once the difficulties 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.520
 braid and that of execution which 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.500
 look at technical fouls and artistic fouls 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.750
 while before we were a little more 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.700
 here I saw it framed the jury are 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.490
 nine members of the jury cisco for 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.160
 the difficulty is 4 for the execution done 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.800
 on the contrary, excuse me, don't worry 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.260
 4 for the difficulty there are news also 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.220
 of this world cup is that they come 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.740
 line judges were also drawn 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.289
 the case wants that just the judge of 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.020
 line in front of us is Belarusian 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.210
 then 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.310
 he probably wanted to get up and 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.360
 say that I'm going to pick up that one 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.360
