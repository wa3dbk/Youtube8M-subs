00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
I personally believe that any any pedal

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.110 
I personally believe that any any pedal
that's<00:00:58.800> trying<00:00:59.040> to<00:00:59.129> duplicate<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.879> type<00:01:00.089> of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
that's trying to duplicate this type of

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.030 
that's trying to duplicate this type of
tone<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.870> something<00:01:01.290> that<00:01:01.470> this<00:01:01.769> is<00:01:01.830> pretty

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
tone is something that this is pretty

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.829 
tone is something that this is pretty
much<00:01:02.129> what<00:01:02.309> they've<00:01:02.430> modeled<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.940> after<00:01:03.059> if

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
much what they've modeled it after if

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.000 
much what they've modeled it after if
you<00:01:03.930> look<00:01:04.080> at<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> pedal<00:01:04.530> that's<00:01:04.680> trying<00:01:04.949> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
you look at a pedal that's trying to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.469 
you look at a pedal that's trying to
come<00:01:05.549> close<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> original<00:01:06.270> fender

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
come close to the original fender

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.570 
come close to the original fender
tremolo<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.049> pretty<00:01:07.229> much<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.860> just

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
tremolo this is pretty much it I just

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.580 
tremolo this is pretty much it I just
love<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> variability<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
love the variability of it and the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.830 
love the variability of it and the
smooth<00:01:10.860> actual<00:01:11.400> down<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.299> dirty<00:01:12.420> kind<00:01:12.690> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
smooth actual down and dirty kind of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.060 
smooth actual down and dirty kind of
vibrato<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.409> get<00:01:13.560> from<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> lot<00:01:13.979> of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070

really<00:01:56.550> going<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.760> use<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.000> for<00:01:57.150> I<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.660> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
really going to use it for I think a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.120 
really going to use it for I think a
clean<00:01:58.020> or<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.380> want<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:58.710> crank<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.070> to

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
clean or you want to really crank it to

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.190 
clean or you want to really crank it to
get<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> gritty<00:01:59.550> sound<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.720> would<00:02:00.870> be<00:02:00.960> this

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
get a gritty sound this would be this

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.870 
get a gritty sound this would be this
would<00:02:01.260> be<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.740> plug<00:02:01.920> into<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.760> have

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
would be going to plug into you have

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.430 
would be going to plug into you have
your<00:02:03.000> stand<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.240> brake<00:02:03.450> switch<00:02:03.600> right<00:02:03.960> here<00:02:04.200> and

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
your stand a brake switch right here and

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.180 
your stand a brake switch right here and
two<00:02:05.340> impedance<00:02:05.940> inputs<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.260> that<00:02:07.290> means<00:02:07.620> when

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
two impedance inputs so that means when

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.169 
two impedance inputs so that means when
you're<00:02:08.280> actually<00:02:08.399> plugged<00:02:08.759> into<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> first

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
you're actually plugged into the first

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.040 
you're actually plugged into the first
one<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.420> gonna<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> little<00:02:09.690> bit<00:02:09.869> louder

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
one it's gonna be a little bit louder

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.240 
one it's gonna be a little bit louder
you<00:02:10.229> plug<00:02:10.409> into<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> second<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.039> it's<00:02:11.159> going

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
you plug into the second one it's going

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.509 
you plug into the second one it's going
to<00:02:11.310> be<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.700> little<00:02:12.390> bit<00:02:12.540> softer<00:02:13.190> what<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.220> plugged

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
to be a little bit softer what I plugged

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.979 
to be a little bit softer what I plugged
into<00:02:14.700> right<00:02:14.909> now<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.269> is<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.629> vibrato

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
into right now is the is the vibrato

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.470 
into right now is the is the vibrato
side<00:02:16.409> and<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.610> pretty<00:02:17.819> much<00:02:17.879> gonna<00:02:18.120> in

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
side and this is pretty much gonna in

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.720 
side and this is pretty much gonna in
addition<00:02:19.200> at<00:02:19.409> us<00:02:19.590> our<00:02:20.010> speed<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.459> our

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
addition at us our speed and our

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.089 
addition at us our speed and our
intensity<00:02:21.239> controls<00:02:21.720> right<00:02:22.590> here<00:02:22.830> this<00:02:22.950> is

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
intensity controls right here this is

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.710 
intensity controls right here this is
really<00:02:23.250> where<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.610> amp<00:02:23.790> tends<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.390> come<00:02:24.599> to

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
really where the amp tends to come to

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.570 
really where the amp tends to come to
life<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.260> they<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.830> still<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.250> still<00:02:26.430> get

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
life and they you still you still get

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.330 
life and they you still you still get
the<00:02:26.670> bright<00:02:26.909> switch<00:02:27.209> right<00:02:28.109> here<00:02:28.290> too<00:02:28.499> as<00:02:28.829> well

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the bright switch right here too as well

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.599 
the bright switch right here too as well
and<00:02:29.870> let's<00:02:30.870> get<00:02:30.989> into<00:02:31.139> some<00:02:31.469> sounds<00:02:31.829> alright

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
and let's get into some sounds alright

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:33.890 
and let's get into some sounds alright
so<00:02:32.730> right<00:02:32.879> now<00:02:33.030> I'm<00:02:33.150> actually<00:02:33.239> plugged<00:02:33.689> in

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
so right now I'm actually plugged in

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.410 
so right now I'm actually plugged in
to<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.110> clean<00:02:34.409> side<00:02:35.010> virtually<00:02:35.760> all<00:02:35.790> we<00:02:36.299> have

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
to the clean side virtually all we have

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.179 
to the clean side virtually all we have
is<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> volume<00:02:36.810> control<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.200> treble<00:02:37.620> control<00:02:37.950> and

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
is a volume control a treble control and

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.470 
is a volume control a treble control and
a<00:02:38.430> bass<00:02:38.579> control<00:02:38.939> so<00:02:39.120> all<00:02:39.209> right<00:02:39.299> now<00:02:39.420> I'm

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
a bass control so all right now I'm

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.240 
a bass control so all right now I'm
gonna<00:02:39.569> just<00:02:40.110> do<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> little<00:02:40.439> bit<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.680> blank

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
gonna just do a little bit of blank

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.380 
gonna just do a little bit of blank
strumming<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:41.879> you<00:02:41.939> can<00:02:42.030> actually<00:02:42.239> hear<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
strumming so you can actually hear the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.240 
strumming so you can actually hear the
difference<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.900> tone<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.409> what<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:43.829> want<00:02:44.189> to

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
difference in tone and what I want to

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.979 
difference in tone and what I want to
actually<00:02:44.340> show<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.879> this<00:02:45.000> channel<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.569> how

actually show you on this channel is how
sensitive<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.560> bright<00:02:46.769> switch<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.280> I'm

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
sensitive the bright switch is I'm

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.009 
sensitive the bright switch is I'm
actually<00:02:47.909> going<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.209> strum<00:02:48.480> with<00:02:48.629> it<00:02:48.780> with<00:02:48.930> the

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
actually going to strum with it with the

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.390 
actually going to strum with it with the
bright<00:02:49.170> switch<00:02:49.379> off<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.769> turn<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.189> right

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
bright switch off and turn it on right

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.009 
bright switch off and turn it on right

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
in the mid the mid strum sticking here

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.089 
in the mid the mid strum sticking here
so<00:02:52.230> here's<00:02:52.379> just<00:02:52.439> a<00:02:52.590> few<00:02:52.620> chords<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.069> can

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
you the bright the difference between

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.490 
you the bright the difference between
the<00:03:05.670> right<00:03:05.819> switch<00:03:06.000> on<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.269> channel<00:03:06.510> we

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
the right switch on this channel we

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.539 
the right switch on this channel we
actually<00:03:07.769> have<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.950> bright<00:03:08.129> switch<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.519> right

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
actually have the bright switch on right

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.130 
actually have the bright switch on right
now<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.390> I'm<00:03:09.510> actually<00:03:09.599> going<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.870> turn<00:03:09.989> it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
now but I'm actually going to turn it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.390 
now but I'm actually going to turn it
off<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.560> then<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.769> mid<00:03:10.980> strum<00:03:11.220> you're<00:03:11.310> gonna

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
off and then the mid strum you're gonna

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.720 
off and then the mid strum you're gonna
hear<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.640> difference<00:03:16.280> buddy<00:03:17.280> switch<00:03:17.519> on

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
hear the difference buddy switch on

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.090 
hear the difference buddy switch on
right<00:03:18.470> switch<00:03:19.470> off

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
right switch off

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.680 
right switch off
here<00:03:21.610> it's<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.790> little<00:03:22.000> bit<00:03:22.120> softer<00:03:22.510> it's<00:03:22.630> a

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
here it's a little bit softer it's a

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.060 
here it's a little bit softer it's a
little<00:03:22.870> bit<00:03:22.960> smoother<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:23.530> some<00:03:23.710> people<00:03:23.830> do

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
little bit smoother so some people do

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.140 
little bit smoother so some people do
like<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.400> let's<00:03:24.550> try<00:03:24.640> some<00:03:24.820> of<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:24.970> same

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
like it let's try some of the same

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.030 
like it let's try some of the same

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
now I'm on to the vibrato channel which

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.830 
now I'm on to the vibrato channel which
is<00:04:10.230> my<00:04:10.350> favorite<00:04:10.770> and<00:04:10.920> I've<00:04:11.550> got<00:04:11.790> our<00:04:12.030> speed

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000

so<00:05:02.000> there's<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.389> example<00:05:02.810> of<00:05:02.930> why<00:05:03.080> I

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
so there's the example of why I

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.899 
so there's the example of why I
definitely<00:05:03.830> like<00:05:03.979> this<00:05:04.159> band<00:05:04.520> master

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
definitely like this band master

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.909 
definitely like this band master
probably<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.270> most<00:05:05.479> out<00:05:05.659> of<00:05:05.780> most<00:05:05.930> of<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.229> the

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
probably the most out of most of the the

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.379 
probably the most out of most of the the
older<00:05:07.159> fender<00:05:07.430> amps<00:05:07.669> because<00:05:07.789> of<00:05:08.000> that<00:05:08.090> actual

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
older fender amps because of that actual

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.059 
older fender amps because of that actual
vibrato<00:05:08.719> tone<00:05:08.990> just<00:05:09.199> sounds<00:05:09.439> sort<00:05:09.590> of<00:05:09.620> rich<00:05:09.800> in

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
vibrato tone just sounds sort of rich in

vibrato tone just sounds sort of rich in
warm<00:05:11.530> now<00:05:12.530> let's<00:05:12.710> switch<00:05:13.129> it<00:05:13.310> over<00:05:13.400> to

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:13.969 
warm now let's switch it over to

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:15.279 
warm now let's switch it over to
something<00:05:14.150> a<00:05:14.270> little<00:05:14.419> bit<00:05:14.539> faster<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.169> I'm

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
something a little bit faster and I'm

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.890 
something a little bit faster and I'm
going<00:05:15.650> to<00:05:15.740> increase<00:05:16.039> our<00:05:16.400> speed<00:05:16.780> probably<00:05:17.780> to

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
going to increase our speed probably to

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.189 
going to increase our speed probably to
about<00:05:18.759> 4.5<00:05:19.759> maybe<00:05:20.090> 5<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.449> keep<00:05:20.599> our<00:05:20.719> intensity

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
about 4.5 maybe 5 and keep our intensity

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.200 
about 4.5 maybe 5 and keep our intensity
the<00:05:21.349> same<00:05:21.560> so<00:05:22.340> now<00:05:22.370> I've<00:05:22.580> got<00:05:22.699> our<00:05:22.819> faster

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
the same so now I've got our faster

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.790 
the same so now I've got our faster
settings<00:05:23.539> in<00:05:23.689> effect<00:05:23.990> and<00:05:24.259> I<00:05:24.439> want<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:24.680> show

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800

you<00:05:24.860> a<00:05:24.919> quick<00:05:25.069> sample<00:05:25.280> of<00:05:25.490> that<00:05:25.639> right<00:05:25.849> now<00:05:25.969> so

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
you a quick sample of that right now so

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.980 
you a quick sample of that right now so
you<00:05:26.210> can<00:05:26.300> hear<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:26.509> difference

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
you can hear the difference

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.360 
you can hear the difference
we've<00:05:27.199> probably<00:05:27.289> doubled<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.830> speed<00:05:28.009> up<00:05:28.189> and

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
we've probably doubled the speed up and

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.249 
we've probably doubled the speed up and
even<00:05:29.090> increase<00:05:29.360> our<00:05:29.509> intensity<00:05:29.960> a<00:05:29.990> little<00:05:30.020> bit

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
even increase our intensity a little bit

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.600 
even increase our intensity a little bit
more<00:05:30.379> so<00:05:30.469> you<00:05:30.530> can<00:05:30.560> hear<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:30.860> difference

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
more so you can hear the difference
