00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:08.230
 and if there was an action camera that 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.110
 I can go with you to see what you see and 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:15.030
 do what you do to the action camera hd 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.030
 carmen's bit is life 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.599
 i 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.090
 aimar navarro is a free rider born in 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.130
 the valley of Aran has grown between 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.500
 mountains and has trained as a skier 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.230
 in one of the most privileged places 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.510
 of the Pyrenees exactly at the station 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.480
 Baqueira Beret and its entire environment 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.309
 pure off track evasion has traveled 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.890
 until this station so that aimar 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.600
 show your particular paradise your patio 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.129
 of recreation on freeride 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.229
 proud of his valley tell us his 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.680
 best and worst experiences as 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.680
 skier 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.530
 our three years I have been skiing 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.960
 my parents look every weekend in 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.469
 the clubs and then I went through the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.619
 competition in the alpine and good to 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:31.049
 17 years I decided to leave it and the alpine 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.020
 I met some friends with their or Ã¡lex 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.369
 they were going a lot off track and I'm good 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.679
 then I started to follow you with my 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.030
 giant skis and the end then good 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.810
 they left me some fat skis and the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.810
 I really love 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.189
 for me it is a way of 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.700
 of freedom not to leave you a way to 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.200
 express yourself really when 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.909
 it is only the silence the snow 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.909
 and you're really comfortable 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.770
 I consider myself a skier the only thing 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.170
 Well, I always try to combine a little 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.450
 mountaineering since it is important to be 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.310
 quite versatile in this world to 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.080
 level of competition usually the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.720
 Ascents to the mountains are 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.250
 normally easy does not have much 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.260
 difficulty when recording if you 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.600
 you want to go to a place that nobody has gone 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.850
 if nobody has gone, it 's because of something or because 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.520
 the descent is very difficult or because the 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.560
 access to that peak is complicated 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.290
 will help us the truth has some 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.110
 good landscapes some mountains a quality 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.450
 of snow that few places can have 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.730
 so then in this aspect we have it 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.760
 very easy when it comes to training is 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.550
 teaching every day 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.250
 we have 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.010
 many many mountains that do not 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.390
 we would end up with a skiing outside 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.670
 track inside baqueira 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.459
 perfect us as cities for 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.959
 training has us very well too 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.760
 we have to take into account the issue of 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.980
 security because like all 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.590
 amounts of storms that enter with 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.020
 they load a lot of snow then what this 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.600
 it also means that the subject of 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.090
 Avalanches is still an aspect to have very 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.569
 into account 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.129
 and myself last year I had a 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.489
 very serious accident us that 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.800
 day we were recording and we had watched 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.349
 everything even so sometimes they happen 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.120
 accidents lot to look and ramires 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.080
 things in the end the subject of health 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.030
 is 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.660
 it's not an exact science then 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.500
 you try to minimize the risks but 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:44.069
 you are never one hundred percent safe 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.749
 last year this we got to 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.049
 at the end of a project that we had 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:51.389
 together with colleagues in the world of 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:55.969
 freeride as with the earthquake that is the 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:57.989
 director editor of the movie and good 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.659
 we were all year round all winter 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.930
 recording in summer programming all the 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:07.200
 movie theme and the truth that the 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.489
 The result has been very good 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.689
 ease has not put it at the end of the 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.750
 valley of Aran because the mountains that 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:15.810
 we had it easy to record here inside that 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.430
 It fits if you have the ones if you have the material 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.350
 to do it 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.820
 the truth that all the people have 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.880
 congratulated with the theme of the film 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.949
 because it has been seen at European level has 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.750
 seen many people and has given 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.220
 know a little more what is the 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.340
 valley of Aran and the quality that is here 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.610
 i 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.060
 for me and now to this day I can 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.800
 dedicate in winter to the theme of the raid in 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.960
 part thanks to all the sponsors that 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.050
 I have 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.569
 and well also thanks to some little that 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.819
 has made the issue of feef right as 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.319
 many people think that those who 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.449
 raiders only as you only see the 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.009
 movies go down and down so that only 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.449
 we do that we do not look at anything that 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.340
 we are the crazy people who have us any 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.590
 side and that image is totally 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.750
 wrong is not to get to a mountain and 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.569
 Pulling you down is getting to a 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.889
 mountain visualize it and lose for home 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.750
 with the photos back you're going to look 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.120
 look at the snow forecast of the 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.389
 health is the time it will do or 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.630
 it is a job that is not seen but that is 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.630
 behind 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.870
 here it is difficult to define it with a 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.910
 word then it would be a paradise for 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.030
 me and for the subject of the right cid is both 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.680
 also a mountaineering for the crossing in 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.900
 definitive for mountain that also 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.390
 keep in mind it's a very wild place 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.380
 and we have to take into account many things 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.380
 before going out to the mountain 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.289
 Y 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.030
 and if there was an action camera that 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.030
 I can go with you to see it and do what 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:09.230
 you do action camera hd bit of 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.230
 garmin is life
