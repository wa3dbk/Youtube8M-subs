that we can question things and

and you could say that that level of
consciousness<00:01:09.450> comes<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.409> measure<00:01:10.950> of

consciousness comes with a measure of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.560 
consciousness comes with a measure of
responsibility<00:01:11.729> because<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.330> do

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
responsibility because you do

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
making a choice that's also why if you

philosophical<00:01:32.549> side<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.000> whether<00:01:33.180> or<00:01:33.270> not<00:01:33.450> we

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
philosophical side of whether or not we

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.870 
philosophical side of whether or not we
really<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> choice<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.979> put<00:01:35.369> my<00:01:35.490> views<00:01:35.729> on

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
really have a choice I put my views on

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.429 
really have a choice I put my views on
that<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.240> another<00:01:36.329> video<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:36.840> I'll<00:01:37.170> link<00:01:37.320> that

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
that in another video so I'll link that

several<00:01:40.229> people<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.650> tumblr<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:41.159> asked<00:01:41.460> me

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
several people on tumblr have asked me

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.760 
several people on tumblr have asked me
how<00:01:41.880> much<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.450> my<00:01:42.630> experience<00:01:43.229> strength<00:01:43.649> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
how much in my experience strength and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830 
how much in my experience strength and
size<00:01:44.189> matter<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.060> martial<00:01:45.479> art<00:01:45.659> or

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
size matter in a martial art or

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.510 
size matter in a martial art or
self-defense<00:01:46.320> situation<00:01:47.070> again<00:01:47.340> my

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
self-defense situation again my

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.429 
self-defense situation again my
experience<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.570> limited<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
experience in this is limited but the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.569 
experience in this is limited but the
first<00:01:49.649> thing<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.890> would<00:01:49.950> say<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.399> it

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
first thing I would say is that it

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.550 
first thing I would say is that it
depends<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.240> what<00:01:51.810> martial<00:01:52.229> art<00:01:52.380> you're

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
depends on what martial art you're

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.200 
depends on what martial art you're
talking<00:01:53.009> about<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.430> course<00:01:53.610> can't<00:01:53.939> say<00:01:54.149> for

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
talking about I of course can't say for

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.700 
talking about I of course can't say for
many<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> think<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.439> know<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.590> you're

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
many but I think that you know if you're

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.469 
many but I think that you know if you're
a<00:01:55.740> boxer<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.399> instance<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:57.210> you're<00:01:57.360> up

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
a boxer for instance if you're up

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.480 
a boxer for instance if you're up
against<00:01:57.719> someone<00:01:58.140> twice<00:01:58.649> your<00:01:58.710> weight<00:01:58.920> size

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
against someone twice your weight size

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.130 
against someone twice your weight size
and<00:01:59.790> strength<00:02:00.000> my<00:02:00.360> guess<00:02:00.570> would<00:02:00.719> be<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
and strength my guess would be that you

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.480 
and strength my guess would be that you
might<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.500> problem<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.130> comes<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
might have a problem but it comes to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.310 
might have a problem but it comes to
grappling<00:02:02.729> though<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.270> especially<00:02:03.509> BJJ

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
grappling though and especially BJJ

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.350 
grappling though and especially BJJ
which<00:02:04.560> relies<00:02:05.250> less<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.670> strength<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.210> would

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
which relies less on strength I would

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.449 
which relies less on strength I would
say<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.570> comes<00:02:06.840> down<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> ratio<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.979> skill

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
say it comes down to the ratio of skill

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.949 
say it comes down to the ratio of skill
and<00:02:08.610> strength<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:08.940> my<00:02:09.030> experience<00:02:09.509> guys<00:02:09.720> were

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
and strength in my experience guys were

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.630 
and strength in my experience guys were
really<00:02:10.319> big<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.709> strong<00:02:10.920> we'll<00:02:11.250> still<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
really big and strong we'll still have a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.260 
really big and strong we'll still have a
huge

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
huge

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.760 
huge
that's<00:02:12.480> over<00:02:12.750> most<00:02:12.930> white<00:02:13.260> belts<00:02:13.620> because

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that's over most white belts because

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.860 
that's over most white belts because
they<00:02:14.040> don't<00:02:14.250> have<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:15.060> technique<00:02:15.390> yet<00:02:15.600> but<00:02:15.750> as

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
they don't have the technique yet but as

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.570 
they don't have the technique yet but as
you<00:02:16.140> go<00:02:16.230> up<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.500> skill<00:02:16.830> especially<00:02:17.100> if<00:02:17.460> we're

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
you go up in skill especially if we're

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.550 
you go up in skill especially if we're
talking<00:02:17.610> purple<00:02:18.390> belt<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.750> up<00:02:18.900> strengths

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
talking purple belt and up strengths

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.230 
talking purple belt and up strengths
teams<00:02:19.800> become<00:02:20.190> less<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.580> less<00:02:20.640> important

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
teams become less and less important

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.060 
teams become less and less important
I've<00:02:21.330> seen<00:02:21.510> videos<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.870> skinny<00:02:22.380> guys<00:02:22.590> taking

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
I've seen videos of skinny guys taking

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.070 
I've seen videos of skinny guys taking
down<00:02:23.220> James<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:24.060> based<00:02:24.270> on<00:02:24.450> technique<00:02:24.870> and

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
down James just based on technique and

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.080 
down James just based on technique and
I've<00:02:25.170> personally<00:02:25.350> experienced<00:02:26.280> being<00:02:26.730> beaten

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
I've personally experienced being beaten

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.700 
I've personally experienced being beaten
by<00:02:27.450> younger<00:02:27.750> guys<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.260> was<00:02:28.410> sure<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.620> could

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
by younger guys that I was sure I could

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.350 
by younger guys that I was sure I could
handle<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.520> because<00:02:29.760> they<00:02:29.910> had<00:02:30.120> better

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
handle just because they had better

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.910 
handle just because they had better
technique<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.960> a<00:02:31.050> house<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.470> would<00:02:31.620> say<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:31.800> in

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
technique in a house I would say it in

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.590 
technique in a house I would say it in
at<00:02:32.010> least<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.400> Brazilian<00:02:32.790> Jujitsu<00:02:33.060> if<00:02:33.480> you

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
at least in Brazilian Jujitsu if you

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.450 
at least in Brazilian Jujitsu if you
have<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.750> certain<00:02:34.110> level<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.650> skills<00:02:35.040> strength

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
have a certain level of skills strength

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.550 
have a certain level of skills strength
becomes<00:02:35.640> much<00:02:36.150> less<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.600> factor<00:02:36.810> maybe<00:02:37.230> even

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
becomes much less of a factor maybe even

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.190 
becomes much less of a factor maybe even
negligible<00:02:38.130> but<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:38.460> until<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.060> point<00:02:39.200> it

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
negligible but up until that point it

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.450 
negligible but up until that point it
can<00:02:40.260> definitely<00:02:40.740> make<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.920> difference<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
can definitely make a difference the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.100 
can definitely make a difference the
mistake<00:02:41.760> though<00:02:41.910> he's<00:02:42.030> focusing<00:02:42.510> too<00:02:42.690> much<00:02:42.720> on

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
mistake though he's focusing too much on

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.600 
mistake though he's focusing too much on
strength<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.710> too<00:02:43.860> little<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.190> technique

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
strength and too little on technique

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.190 
strength and too little on technique
because<00:02:44.940> trains<00:02:45.210> can<00:02:45.360> only<00:02:45.540> get<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:45.990> far

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
because trains can only get you so far

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.290 
because trains can only get you so far
and<00:02:46.770> ultimately<00:02:47.490> if<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.760> stick<00:02:48.060> with<00:02:48.240> it

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
and ultimately if you stick with it

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.820 
and ultimately if you stick with it
technique<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:48.930> what<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.230> will<00:02:49.380> come<00:02:49.560> down<00:02:49.800> to

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
technique is what it will come down to

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.560 
technique is what it will come down to
but<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.460> kind<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.760> all<00:02:50.910> for<00:02:51.120> now<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:51.300> can

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
but that is kind of all for now you can

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.570 
but that is kind of all for now you can
