we<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:24.470> have<00:00:25.470> developed<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.699> knowledge<00:00:27.180> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
we now have developed the knowledge and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.820 
we now have developed the knowledge and
the<00:00:27.750> technology<00:00:28.640> to<00:00:29.640> farm<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.330> build<00:00:31.320> soils

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the technology to farm and build soils

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.540 
the technology to farm and build soils
at<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.099> same<00:00:32.309> time<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:33.270> now<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:34.550> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
at the same time we now have the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.819 
at the same time we now have the
knowledge<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.180> technology<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.559> graze

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
knowledge and technology to graze

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.369 
knowledge and technology to graze
animals<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> land<00:00:39.000> while<00:00:39.510> simultaneously

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
animals on the land while simultaneously

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.060 
animals on the land while simultaneously
building<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.280> we've<00:00:41.850> never<00:00:42.180> been<00:00:42.450> able<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:43.070> do

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
building so we've never been able to do

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.369 
building so we've never been able to do
that<00:00:44.280> before<00:00:44.489> that's<00:00:45.239> incredible

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
that before that's incredible

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.350 
that before that's incredible
people<00:00:46.920> are<00:00:47.039> getting<00:00:47.160> excited<00:00:47.760> about<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
people are getting excited about it and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630 
people are getting excited about it and
we<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> brighter<00:00:49.379> future<00:00:49.500> because<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
we see a brighter future because of that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.459 
we see a brighter future because of that
knowledge<00:00:54.890> we<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> learn<00:00:56.430> what<00:00:56.850> is

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
knowledge we are going to learn what is

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.220 
knowledge we are going to learn what is
holistic<00:00:58.469> management<00:00:58.710> how<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.489> differs<00:00:59.969> from

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
holistic management how it differs from

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.759 
holistic management how it differs from
conventional<00:01:01.230> management<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.270> why<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
conventional management and why we in a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.300 
conventional management and why we in a
sense<00:01:05.060> focus<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:07.080> whole<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.159> we're

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
sense focus on the whole so we're

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.940 
sense focus on the whole so we're
talking<00:01:08.640> about<00:01:08.729> social<00:01:09.119> values<00:01:09.950> economic

supports it is a basis or a foundation
of<00:01:55.649> healthy<00:01:56.070> land<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:57.990> look<00:01:58.200> at<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
of healthy land but if we look at the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.289 
of healthy land but if we look at the
history<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.950> civilization<00:01:59.729> it<00:02:00.000> basically

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
history of civilization it basically

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.859 
history of civilization it basically
says<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.320> lose<00:02:01.530> your<00:02:01.740> soil<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.719> lose<00:02:03.719> your

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
