00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
as well up the fortress of ways it

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.210 
as well up the fortress of ways it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
there's red quantum too and you can just

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.729 
there's red quantum too and you can just
use<00:02:06.369> one<00:02:06.580> of<00:02:06.610> those<00:02:06.759> in<00:02:07.000> slang<00:02:07.720> what<00:02:08.110> guys<00:02:08.410> to

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
get it now I do something you probably

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.199 
get it now I do something you probably
want<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.799> do<00:02:11.950> here<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.430> have<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.849> give<00:02:13.000> this

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
want to do here and have to give this

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.380 
want to do here and have to give this
mushroom<00:02:14.019> before<00:02:14.860> getting<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.250> red<00:02:15.370> coin<00:02:15.760> on

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
mushroom before getting the red coin on

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.530 
mushroom before getting the red coin on
the<00:02:16.420> flan<00:02:16.840> because<00:02:17.799> you<00:02:18.310> can<00:02:18.549> destroy<00:02:19.030> swathes

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
the flan because you can destroy swathes

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.390 
the flan because you can destroy swathes
I<00:02:19.840> found<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.709> evidently<00:02:21.010> can't

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
I found that and you evidently can't

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.479 
I found that and you evidently can't
backflip<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.410> makes<00:02:23.799> it<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.099> lot<00:02:24.430> more

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
backflip so it makes it a lot more

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.830 
backflip so it makes it a lot more
difficult<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:24.970> get<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.180> red<00:02:25.330> coin<00:02:25.599> so<00:02:25.780> I'm

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
difficult to get that red coin so I'm

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.940 
difficult to get that red coin so I'm
actually<00:02:25.959> going<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.319> go<00:02:26.440> back<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.799> get<00:02:26.890> that

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
actually going to go back and get that

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.599 
actually going to go back and get that
later<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.650> would<00:02:29.799> recommend<00:02:29.920> if<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.430> wanted

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
later so I would recommend if you wanted

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.090 
later so I would recommend if you wanted
to<00:02:30.700> get<00:02:30.820> that<00:02:31.030> mushroom<00:02:31.750> in<00:02:32.140> there<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.920> wait

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
to get that mushroom in there to wait

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.259 
to get that mushroom in there to wait
till<00:02:33.280> after<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:35.459> after<00:02:36.459> you<00:02:36.700> get<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.030> red

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
till after you after you get that red

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.140 
till after you after you get that red
coin<00:02:37.540> on<00:02:37.690> top<00:02:37.720> of<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.109> swamp<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.940> because

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
coin on top of a swamp just because

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.900 
coin on top of a swamp just because
it'll<00:02:40.329> make<00:02:40.540> things<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.900> lot<00:02:41.019> easier<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:42.700> now

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
it'll make things a lot easier but now

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.910 
it'll make things a lot easier but now
there's<00:02:43.120> no<00:02:43.239> red<00:02:43.450> coin<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.230> third<00:02:44.530> one<00:02:44.709> behind

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
there's no red coin the third one behind

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.849 
there's no red coin the third one behind
that<00:02:45.040> prana<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:46.380> we're<00:02:47.380> going<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:47.650> down

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
that prana and we're going to go down

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.840 
that prana and we're going to go down
here<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.760> get<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:50.380> rest<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.769> our<00:02:50.890> 100<00:02:51.280> coins

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
here to get the rest of our 100 coins

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.370 
here to get the rest of our 100 coins
basically<00:02:54.329> because<00:02:55.329> there<00:02:55.510> is<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.780> blue<00:02:56.109> coin

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
basically because there is a blue coin

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.970 
basically because there is a blue coin

or more asteroid Papa like rightward I
were<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.300> coins<00:03:20.930> were<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:23.209> next<00:03:23.450> thing

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
were the coins were and the next thing

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.170 
were the coins were and the next thing
about<00:03:23.600> this<00:03:23.870> star<00:03:24.170> is<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.709> get<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.640> continue

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
about this star is you get to continue

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.440 
about this star is you get to continue
on<00:03:26.360> level<00:03:27.020> after<00:03:27.730> after<00:03:28.730> getting<00:03:29.000> it<00:03:29.090> so<00:03:29.300> we

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
on level after after getting it so we

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.000 
on level after after getting it so we
can<00:03:29.570> go<00:03:29.690> ahead<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.930> continue<00:03:30.080> with<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.680> eight

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
can go ahead and continue with the eight

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.840 
can go ahead and continue with the eight
coins<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:32.510> we<00:03:32.630> were<00:03:32.690> collecting<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:34.700> we're

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
coins that we were collecting so we're

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.680 
coins that we were collecting so we're
going<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.060> go<00:03:35.270> back<00:03:35.959> up<00:03:36.170> here<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:38.510> next

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
going to go back up here and the next

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.190 
going to go back up here and the next
ray<00:03:38.870> coin<00:03:39.140> is<00:03:39.760> on<00:03:40.780> instead<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:41.870> taking<00:03:42.110> the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
ray coin is on instead of taking the

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.620 
ray coin is on instead of taking the
collapsing<00:03:42.620> bridge<00:03:42.860> it's<00:03:43.160> only<00:03:43.570> like<00:03:44.570> a

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
collapsing bridge it's only like a

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.970 
collapsing bridge it's only like a
little<00:03:44.840> narrow<00:03:45.080> pathway<00:03:45.590> next<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.180> and

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
little narrow pathway next to it and

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.729 
little narrow pathway next to it and
there<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.180> just<00:03:50.330> kind<00:03:50.510> of<00:03:50.570> walk<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.530> little

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
there so you just kind of walk a little

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.650 
there so you just kind of walk a little
slowly<00:03:52.130> along<00:03:52.459> there<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.380> then<00:03:55.090> another<00:03:56.090> red

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
slowly along there and then another red

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.060 
slowly along there and then another red
coin<00:03:56.930> is<00:03:57.290> right<00:03:58.250> here<00:03:58.489> so<00:03:59.769> that's<00:04:00.769> kinda<00:04:00.980> nice

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
coin is right here so that's kinda nice

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.920 
coin is right here so that's kinda nice
even<00:04:01.489> though<00:04:01.580> this<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:01.910> called<00:04:02.120> red<00:04:02.360> coins<00:04:02.750> in

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
even though this is called red coins in

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.240 
even though this is called red coins in
the<00:04:03.050> floating<00:04:03.380> I'll<00:04:03.760> wait<00:04:04.790> -<00:04:05.630> one<00:04:06.260> or<00:04:06.410> two<00:04:06.650> -<00:04:07.220> I

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
the floating I'll wait - one or two - I

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.479 
the floating I'll wait - one or two - I
believe<00:04:07.640> on<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:08.510> floating<00:04:08.810> Isles<00:04:09.350> up<00:04:10.220> there

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
believe on the floating Isles up there

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.000 
believe on the floating Isles up there
at<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.640> top<00:04:11.170> so<00:04:12.170> just<00:04:12.320> going<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.500> stand<00:04:12.829> by

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
at the top so just going to stand by

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.810 
at the top so just going to stand by
here<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.989> it'll<00:04:14.989> let<00:04:15.230> like<00:04:15.860> rotate<00:04:16.280> right

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
here and it'll let like rotate right

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.630 
here and it'll let like rotate right
through<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.299> red<00:04:18.019> coin<00:04:18.260> that<00:04:19.160> what<00:04:19.400> you<00:04:19.549> can

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
through the red coin that what you can

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.719 
through the red coin that what you can
get<00:04:19.880> that<00:04:20.060> one<00:04:20.209> up<00:04:20.359> but<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:21.190> don't<00:04:22.190> think<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.520> want

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
get that one up but I don't think I want

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:23.920 
get that one up but I don't think I want
to<00:04:22.790> climb<00:04:23.030> all<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.240> way<00:04:23.300> back<00:04:23.510> up<00:04:23.540> here

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
to climb all the way back up here

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.719 
to climb all the way back up here
because<00:04:24.110> it'll<00:04:24.500> pretty<00:04:25.070> much<00:04:25.160> almost

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
because it'll pretty much almost

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.190 
because it'll pretty much almost
guarantee<00:04:26.270> it<00:04:26.300> did<00:04:26.510> fall<00:04:27.460> below<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.669> there<00:04:29.200> um

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
guarantee it did fall below you there um

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.219 
guarantee it did fall below you there um
and<00:04:30.260> then<00:04:31.160> they<00:04:31.250> just<00:04:31.520> walked<00:04:31.729> with<00:04:31.940> kitten<00:04:32.300> so

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
and then they just walked with kitten so

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.680 
and then they just walked with kitten so
we're<00:04:33.650> gonna<00:04:33.800> kind<00:04:34.310> of<00:04:34.430> make<00:04:34.970> our<00:04:35.150> way<00:04:35.270> back<00:04:35.300> up

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
we're gonna kind of make our way back up

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.180 
we're gonna kind of make our way back up
to<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.870> top<00:04:36.140> of<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.350> fortress

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
to the top of the fortress

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.400 
to the top of the fortress
there<00:04:38.910> will<00:04:39.030> be<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.180> big<00:04:39.480> board<00:04:39.810> to<00:04:40.050> your<00:04:40.170> round

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
there will be a big board to your round

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.970 
there will be a big board to your round
and<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.730> want<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:42.030> jump<00:04:42.660> kick<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:43.050> twice<00:04:43.470> and

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
and you want to jump kick that twice and

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.810 
and you want to jump kick that twice and
I'll<00:04:44.280> knock<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.520> down

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
I'll knock it down

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.910 
I'll knock it down
and<00:04:45.060> there<00:04:45.630> you<00:04:45.750> go<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.320> floating<00:04:46.650> islands

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
and there you go the floating islands

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.150 
and there you go the floating islands
that<00:04:47.130> were<00:04:47.340> mentioned<00:04:48.000> in<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.210> title<00:04:48.500> and<00:04:49.500> you

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
that were mentioned in the title and you

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.470 
that were mentioned in the title and you
can<00:04:50.370> see<00:04:50.490> there's<00:04:50.640> one<00:04:50.880> right<00:04:51.030> there<00:04:51.090> in<00:04:51.300> plain

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
can see there's one right there in plain

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.840 
can see there's one right there in plain
sight<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.050> then<00:04:52.200> there's<00:04:52.380> another<00:04:52.650> one<00:04:53.010> right

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:03.080 

over<00:04:57.950> everyone<00:04:58.950> and<00:05:00.590> there<00:05:01.590> we<00:05:01.680> go<00:05:01.910> so<00:05:02.910> that's

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
over everyone and there we go so that's

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.120 
over everyone and there we go so that's
number<00:05:03.240> seven<00:05:03.600> and<00:05:03.990> in<00:05:04.290> theory<00:05:04.740> it<00:05:04.920> would<00:05:05.010> be

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
number seven and in theory it would be

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.780 
number seven and in theory it would be
odd<00:05:05.340> just<00:05:05.970> missed<00:05:06.270> it<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:08.280> would<00:05:08.490> be<00:05:08.520> number

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
odd just missed it that would be number

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.100 
odd just missed it that would be number
eight<00:05:09.950> instead<00:05:10.950> though<00:05:11.630> since<00:05:12.630> I<00:05:12.750> missed<00:05:12.990> that

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
eight instead though since I missed that

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.140 
eight instead though since I missed that
earlier<00:05:13.170> I<00:05:13.710> have<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.280> go<00:05:14.400> all<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:14.670> way<00:05:14.760> back<00:05:14.970> I

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
earlier I have to go all the way back I

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.880 
earlier I have to go all the way back I
think<00:05:15.240> I'm<00:05:15.390> going<00:05:15.480> to<00:05:15.570> try<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.750> use<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.230> owl<00:05:16.470> do

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
think I'm going to try to use the owl do

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.520 
think I'm going to try to use the owl do
you<00:05:17.010> drop<00:05:17.520> onto<00:05:17.760> it<00:05:18.000> so<00:05:18.240> I<00:05:18.810> mean<00:05:18.960> in<00:05:19.170> the<00:05:19.290> event

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
you drop onto it so I mean in the event

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.870 
you drop onto it so I mean in the event
that<00:05:19.590> you<00:05:19.800> do<00:05:19.950> use<00:05:20.040> that<00:05:20.160> mushroom<00:05:20.460> and<00:05:20.670> break

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
that you do use that mushroom and break

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.280 
that you do use that mushroom and break
that<00:05:21.060> flop<00:05:21.450> I<00:05:21.630> guess<00:05:21.780> this<00:05:21.960> would<00:05:22.170> be<00:05:22.200> the

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
that flop I guess this would be the

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.380 
that flop I guess this would be the
method<00:05:22.770> that<00:05:22.890> I<00:05:22.980> would<00:05:23.130> recommend<00:05:23.610> you<00:05:23.850> trying

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
method that I would recommend you trying

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.370 
method that I would recommend you trying
first<00:05:25.520> so<00:05:26.520> you<00:05:26.610> climb<00:05:26.820> up<00:05:26.850> that<00:05:26.970> tree<00:05:27.090> and<00:05:27.630> this

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
first so you climb up that tree and this

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.670 
first so you climb up that tree and this
owl<00:05:28.590> can<00:05:28.890> up<00:05:29.040> and<00:05:29.340> he<00:05:29.940> can<00:05:30.240> you<00:05:30.600> offer<00:05:30.780> to<00:05:31.050> give

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
owl can up and he can you offer to give

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.550 
owl can up and he can you offer to give
you<00:05:31.800> a<00:05:31.860> ride<00:05:32.160> so<00:05:33.120> you<00:05:33.180> just<00:05:33.480> jump<00:05:33.930> onto<00:05:34.200> them

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
you a ride so you just jump onto them

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.210 
you a ride so you just jump onto them
and<00:05:37.010> what<00:05:38.010> kind<00:05:38.040> of<00:05:38.660> technically<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:40.680> next

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
and what kind of technically the next

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.590 
and what kind of technically the next
level<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:41.520> believe<00:05:41.550> is<00:05:42.030> the<00:05:42.150> one<00:05:42.300> where<00:05:42.480> you're

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
level I believe is the one where you're

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.110 
level I believe is the one where you're
using<00:05:42.840> to<00:05:43.020> get<00:05:43.140> that<00:05:43.350> stark<00:05:43.740> there<00:05:44.070> but<00:05:44.880> we're

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
using to get that stark there but we're

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.760 
using to get that stark there but we're
just<00:05:45.150> using<00:05:45.360> them<00:05:45.540> get<00:05:45.720> this<00:05:45.900> red<00:05:46.110> coin<00:05:46.410> and

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
just using them get this red coin and

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.830 
just using them get this red coin and
just<00:05:47.280> drop<00:05:47.520> right<00:05:47.700> on<00:05:47.880> top<00:05:48.090> of<00:05:48.270> it<00:05:48.390> you<00:05:48.810> can

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
just drop right on top of it you can

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.960 
just drop right on top of it you can
just<00:05:49.050> like<00:05:49.169> barely<00:05:49.470> see<00:05:49.860> it<00:05:49.950> from<00:05:50.700> way<00:05:50.880> up

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
just like barely see it from way up

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.220 
just like barely see it from way up
there

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.470 

yeah<00:05:54.220> so<00:05:54.340> now<00:05:54.490> you<00:05:54.550> just<00:05:54.640> got<00:05:54.850> a<00:05:54.880> quick<00:05:55.120> star

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
yeah so now you just got a quick star

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.920 
yeah so now you just got a quick star
and<00:05:55.990> that's<00:05:56.260> it<00:05:57.270> so<00:05:58.270> it's<00:05:58.420> pretty<00:05:58.510> easy<00:05:58.630> just

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
and that's it so it's pretty easy just

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.780 
and that's it so it's pretty easy just
as<00:05:59.290> long<00:05:59.470> as<00:05:59.590> you<00:05:59.710> don't<00:05:59.860> break<00:06:00.010> that<00:06:00.400> flop

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
as long as you don't break that flop

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.490 
as long as you don't break that flop
like<00:06:01.030> I<00:06:01.180> did<00:06:03.480> and<00:06:04.480> then<00:06:04.660> something<00:06:05.050> with<00:06:05.170> 100

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
like I did and then something with 100

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.750 
like I did and then something with 100
points<00:06:05.800> star<00:06:05.950> that<00:06:06.130> was<00:06:06.220> also<00:06:06.370> pretty<00:06:06.610> easy

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
points star that was also pretty easy

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.890 
points star that was also pretty easy
and<00:06:07.740> for<00:06:08.740> the<00:06:08.860> next<00:06:09.190> star<00:06:09.460> is<00:06:12.180> I<00:06:13.180> forget

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
and for the next star is I forget
