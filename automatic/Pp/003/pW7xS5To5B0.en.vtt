00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.140
 bruges show you some live feathers 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.219
 fast enough that those used in a star is critical 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:12.099
 in the handball solos will remain a world cup 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.829
 cassano drink too much photo 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.610
 by that it's not especially difficult this fact is a movement 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 repetitive arm 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.370
 open for the announced transfer movement 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.560
 lately it's a round trip 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.560
 we will start balloons 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.500
 we will pay pretty much in the same day 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.500
 on the one hand what is quite often besides seats 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.270
 this year at the base it's a Belgian 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.420
 but do not need more to dread 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.450
 on the side of developments that think their parents in this world 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.600
 is europe wearing arms 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.160
 that's what I ask him 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
 the library 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.960
 on one side it is always the case the movement this moment I suspected 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.450
 really important from europe 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 because it's true that 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.120
 we are at once a little rough at all 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.120
 while the ball of the right hand savidan 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.400
 I do not cling to a murder 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400
 it's not especially later 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.850
 after more two weeks coordination of all 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.850
 open early work very slowly 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:16.329
 man slowly pressed the tempo finally as for his competitive exercises 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.609
 who has prevailed all that is harmful that loops around in the 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.609
 submarines 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.379
 it's always good 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.359
 wonder if we follow the important facies of France 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.359
 similar based on two years we will see 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:50.979
 didier 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:53.629
 m 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.000
 in October a passionate man and a little bit of a foot brigade 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.999
 a little difference 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.399
 but she still has not sown the movement in the middle of a button 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.399
 to integrate 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.469
 you're here it's really just a few basic techniques that baptism 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:22.359
 always 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.219
 welding establishment 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.469
 his decision only makes firefighters 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.469
 it follows seasonal classes 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.979
 finally here and it is you who see it is under the sun techniques 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:40.689
 and thank you
