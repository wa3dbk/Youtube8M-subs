00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
some heavy bounce on them and this can

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.970 
some heavy bounce on them and this can
be<00:00:50.610> particularly<00:00:51.090> annoying<00:00:51.780> when<00:00:52.199> trying<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
be particularly annoying when trying to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.950 
be particularly annoying when trying to
take<00:00:53.719> out<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.899> targets<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.590> error<00:00:56.960> around

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
take out the targets that error around

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.279 
take out the targets that error around
the<00:00:58.050> outskirts<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> map<00:00:59.010> now<00:00:59.370> I<00:01:00.109> like<00:01:01.109> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the outskirts of the map now I like to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.270 
the outskirts of the map now I like to
start<00:01:02.180> from<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.449> right<00:01:04.140> start<00:01:04.890> working<00:01:05.189> on

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
start from the right start working on

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.070 
start from the right start working on
the<00:01:05.339> targets<00:01:05.760> from<00:01:06.060> up<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> left<00:01:06.659> side<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the targets from up on the left side and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.289 
the targets from up on the left side and
wrap<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:08.430> west<00:01:08.640> side<00:01:08.850> work<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:10.110> way<00:01:10.260> around

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
wrap the west side work my way around

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.690 
wrap the west side work my way around
clockwise<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.170> mean<00:01:13.740> personal<00:01:14.280> opinion<00:01:14.670> I

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
clockwise that I mean personal opinion I

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.060 
clockwise that I mean personal opinion I
just<00:01:15.150> think<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> targets<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> left<00:01:16.860> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
just think the targets to the left it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.969 
just think the targets to the left it
easier<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.549> then<00:01:17.960> gradually<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.110> harder<00:01:20.420> and

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
easier and then gradually get harder and

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.929 
easier and then gradually get harder and
because<00:01:22.979> there's<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> right<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:23.909> well

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
because there's one on the right as well

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.630 
because there's one on the right as well
that<00:01:24.270> you'll<00:01:24.390> see<00:01:24.570> anywhere<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.020> has<00:01:25.640> its

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
that you'll see anywhere that has its

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.170 
that you'll see anywhere that has its
little<00:01:26.820> root<00:01:27.750> around<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> bottomless<00:01:29.340> pit

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
little root around like a bottomless pit

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.550 
little root around like a bottomless pit
and<00:01:31.850> there's<00:01:32.850> only<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.720> couple<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.170> angles

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
and there's only like a couple of angles

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.399 
and there's only like a couple of angles
you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:35.780> broad<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.049> place

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you can really broad you know place

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.929 
you can really broad you know place

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
time in as well now I'm thinking once

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.980 
time in as well now I'm thinking once
you<00:02:04.530> fall<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> grenade<00:02:05.189> we're<00:02:05.549> talking<00:02:05.990> say

you fall the grenade we're talking say
about<00:02:07.170> five<00:02:07.530> ish<00:02:07.950> seconds<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.060> when<00:02:09.929> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
about five ish seconds to when it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.210 
about five ish seconds to when it
belongs<00:02:10.379> or<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:10.800> don't<00:02:11.009> worry<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.430> much<00:02:11.489> about

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
belongs or but don't worry so much about

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.860 
belongs or but don't worry so much about
the<00:02:13.370> detonation<00:02:14.090> in<00:02:14.720> your<00:02:14.990> hand<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.560> mean<00:02:16.870> it
