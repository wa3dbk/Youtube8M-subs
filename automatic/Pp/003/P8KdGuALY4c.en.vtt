three<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.930> row<00:01:52.960> who's<00:01:53.560> gonna<00:01:53.649> show<00:01:53.920> up<00:01:54.070> early

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
three in a row who's gonna show up early

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.420 
three in a row who's gonna show up early
after<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.619> know<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:56.860> didn't<00:01:57.100> shoot<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.310> ball

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
after you know you didn't shoot the ball

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.010 
after you know you didn't shoot the ball
well<00:01:57.610> who's<00:01:58.240> going<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.479> show<00:01:58.600> who's<00:01:58.780> going<00:01:58.960> to

continue showing up early and I think

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.700 
continue showing up early and I think
that's<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.539> tone<00:02:01.780> that's<00:02:01.990> being<00:02:02.200> set<00:02:02.440> here<00:02:02.619> at

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
that's the tone that's being set here at

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.870 
that's the tone that's being set here at
practice<00:02:03.070> they<00:02:03.190> brought<00:02:03.369> in<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.520> lot<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.700> new

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
the playoffs by one we improved and then

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.240 
the playoffs by one we improved and then
you<00:02:14.050> build<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.709> next<00:02:14.980> year<00:02:15.069> and<00:02:15.190> you

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
you build on that the next year and you

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.220 
you build on that the next year and you
get<00:02:15.430> better<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:16.090> look<00:02:16.510> at<00:02:16.600> Oklahoma<00:02:16.959> City

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
get better you look at Oklahoma City

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.570 
get better you look at Oklahoma City
even<00:02:17.500> though<00:02:17.590> their<00:02:17.769> blueprint<00:02:18.250> might<00:02:18.400> be<00:02:18.550> a

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
even though their blueprint might be a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.220 
even though their blueprint might be a
little<00:02:18.730> different<00:02:19.000> every<00:02:19.450> year<00:02:19.810> they

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
little different every year they

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.720 
little different every year they
improved<00:02:20.620> over<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.950> last<00:02:21.010> five<00:02:21.340> or<00:02:21.400> six<00:02:21.670> years

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
improved over the last five or six years

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.130 
improved over the last five or six years
like<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.150> remember<00:02:22.390> when<00:02:22.510> Kevin<00:02:22.720> Durant<00:02:22.959> first

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
like I remember when Kevin Durant first

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.800 
like I remember when Kevin Durant first
came<00:02:23.319> into<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.650> league<00:02:24.480> they<00:02:25.480> went<00:02:25.720> from

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
came into the league they went from

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.259 
came into the league they went from
winning<00:02:26.110> 26<00:02:26.650> games<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.160> went<00:02:27.340> into<00:02:27.519> 44<00:02:28.000> games

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
winning 26 games so went into 44 games

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.240 
winning 26 games so went into 44 games
one<00:02:28.630> in<00:02:28.750> 50<00:02:29.080> games<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.709> then<00:02:30.069> going

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
one in 50 games to and then going

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.860 
one in 50 games to and then going
further<00:02:30.550> in<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.790> class<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.269> it<00:02:31.630> takes

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
further in the class and that it takes

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.690 
further in the class and that it takes
time<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.560> think<00:02:32.830> we<00:02:32.950> have<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.130> good<00:02:33.459> nucleus

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
time and I think we have a good nucleus

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.030 
time and I think we have a good nucleus
of<00:02:34.209> young<00:02:34.450> players<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.290> guys<00:02:35.709> with<00:02:35.920> the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
of young players and and guys with the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.819 
of young players and and guys with the
right<00:02:36.220> mentality<00:02:36.450> did<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.510> guys<00:02:37.660> pick<00:02:38.500> up<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
right mentality did you guys pick up the

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.800 
right mentality did you guys pick up the
intensity<00:02:39.190> from<00:02:39.760> last

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
intensity from last

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.180 
intensity from last
it's<00:02:42.810> been<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.379> guys<00:02:43.530> been<00:02:43.739> gradually

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
it's been you guys been gradually

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.119 
it's been you guys been gradually
getting<00:02:44.400> harder<00:02:44.910> yeah<00:02:45.629> I<00:02:45.690> think<00:02:45.870> uh<00:02:46.170> next

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
getting harder yeah I think uh next

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.410 
getting harder yeah I think uh next
session<00:02:47.550> tonight<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.030> going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.300> little

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
session tonight is going to be a little

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.460 
session tonight is going to be a little
bit<00:02:48.599> harder<00:02:48.810> than<00:02:48.930> where<00:02:49.050> we<00:02:49.140> went<00:02:49.319> through

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
bit harder than where we went through

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.530 
bit harder than where we went through
tonight<00:02:49.739> because<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.730> more<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.209> more

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
tonight because it is more of more

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.390 
tonight because it is more of more
contact<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.260> uh<00:02:52.290> guys<00:02:52.830> going<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.160> be<00:02:53.220> able<00:02:53.280> to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400

run<00:02:53.489> up<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.730> down<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:55.080> think<00:02:55.319> it'd<00:02:55.620> be<00:02:55.650> a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
run up and down and I think it'd be a

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.080 
run up and down and I think it'd be a
lot<00:02:56.280> more<00:02:56.340> intensive<00:02:56.879> later<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:58.940> got<00:02:59.940> this

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
lot more intensive later on got this

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.460 
lot more intensive later on got this
feel<00:03:00.330> for<00:03:00.599> Eddie<00:03:02.330> style<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.599> guys<00:03:03.780> might<00:03:04.140> play

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
feel for Eddie style you guys might play

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.860 
feel for Eddie style you guys might play
love<00:03:05.069> me<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.849> can't<00:03:05.879> can't<00:03:06.450> really<00:03:06.629> tell

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
love me you can't can't really tell

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.750 
love me you can't can't really tell
right<00:03:07.110> now<00:03:07.140> because<00:03:07.590> both<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.129> not<00:03:08.310> back<00:03:08.730> yet

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
right now because both is not back yet

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.449 
right now because both is not back yet
so<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.569> think<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.530> all<00:03:10.650> gonna<00:03:10.830> depend<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:11.310> how

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
so I think it's all gonna depend on how

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.140 
so I think it's all gonna depend on how
Bogut's<00:03:12.769> condition<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:13.980> knowing<00:03:14.819> what<00:03:15.060> we

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
Bogut's condition is and knowing what we

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.580 
Bogut's condition is and knowing what we
going<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.390> do<00:03:15.480> with<00:03:15.720> run<00:03:16.200> up<00:03:16.349> and<00:03:16.440> down<00:03:16.500> the

that<00:03:43.579> defensive<00:03:44.579> we<00:03:44.670> can<00:03:44.819> really<00:03:44.970> help<00:03:45.120> us

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
that defensive we can really help us

block shots and and rebound the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.280 
block shots and and rebound the
basketball<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.239> think<00:03:48.420> he<00:03:48.510> has<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.840> great

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
basketball and I think he has a great

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.390 
basketball and I think he has a great
presence<00:03:49.470> there<00:03:49.829> in<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:49.980> paint<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:50.280> he's

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
presence there in the paint so he's

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.800 
presence there in the paint so he's
surprised<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:51.120> think<00:03:51.329> you<00:03:51.420> can<00:03:51.569> make<00:03:51.690> that

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
surprised you think you can make that

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.599 
surprised you think you can make that
kind<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.049> impact<00:03:52.139> right<00:03:52.560> away<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:53.069> think<00:03:53.549> you

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
kind of impact right away I think you

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.550 
kind of impact right away I think you
can't<00:03:53.819> just<00:03:54.000> just<00:03:54.239> from<00:03:54.420> his<00:03:54.510> effort<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.019> I<00:03:55.260> do

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
can't just just from his effort and I do

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.050 
can't just just from his effort and I do
I<00:03:55.620> think<00:03:55.829> he's<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:55.980> guy<00:03:56.400> that's<00:03:56.430> going<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.730> start

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
I think he's a guy that's going to start

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.729 
I think he's a guy that's going to start
and<00:03:57.180> play<00:03:57.209> 35<00:03:57.720> minutes<00:03:57.959> of<00:03:58.019> game<00:03:58.139> no<00:03:58.349> but<00:03:58.590> I

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
and play 35 minutes of game no but I

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.890 
and play 35 minutes of game no but I
think<00:03:59.280> in<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.700> role<00:03:59.880> that<00:03:59.910> he's<00:04:00.209> given<00:04:00.569> which

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
think in the role that he's given which

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.509 
think in the role that he's given which
coach<00:04:01.139> will<00:04:01.290> determine<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:01.889> think<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.280> he<00:04:02.370> can

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
coach will determine I think that he can

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.069 
coach will determine I think that he can
be<00:04:02.700> he<00:04:03.180> can<00:04:03.299> be<00:04:03.389> a<00:04:03.420> solid<00:04:03.660> contributor<00:04:04.139> for<00:04:04.260> us

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
be he can be a solid contributor for us
