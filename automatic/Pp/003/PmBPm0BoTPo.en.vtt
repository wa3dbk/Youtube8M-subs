00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.679 
pretty good to me
and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.299> shut<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> lights

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and then from there it shut the lights

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.499 
and then from there it shut the lights
off<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> pre<00:01:47.399> focus<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.060> right<00:01:48.210> right

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
now that's a manual focus so it won't

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.850
