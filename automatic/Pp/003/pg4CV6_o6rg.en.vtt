first of all what you need to do as in
many<00:00:46.480> projects<00:00:47.020> in<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.200> landscape<00:00:47.710> is<00:00:47.950> to

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
many projects in the landscape is to

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.050 
many projects in the landscape is to
form<00:00:48.880> a<00:00:49.180> retention<00:00:49.720> or<00:00:50.050> an<00:00:50.380> edge<00:00:50.740> while<00:00:51.730> using

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
form a retention or an edge while using

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.680 
form a retention or an edge while using
gravels<00:00:52.840> or<00:00:53.050> in<00:00:53.320> this<00:00:53.410> case<00:00:53.620> lava<00:00:53.980> rock<00:00:54.690> here

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690

gravels or in this case lava rock here
in<00:00:55.810> this<00:00:55.960> design<00:00:56.290> this<00:00:56.590> is<00:00:56.740> an<00:00:56.890> old<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.430> herb

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
in this design this is an old of herb

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.360 
in this design this is an old of herb
garden<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.020> we're<00:00:59.440> going<00:00:59.590> to<00:00:59.620> just<00:00:59.800> use<00:00:59.890> this

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
garden and we're going to just use this

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.960 
garden and we're going to just use this
as<00:01:00.610> a<00:01:01.090> lava<00:01:01.510> rock<00:01:01.810> sitting<00:01:02.380> area<00:01:02.800> so<00:01:03.670> what

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
as a lava rock sitting area so what

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.459 
as a lava rock sitting area so what
we're<00:01:04.089> going<00:01:04.179> to<00:01:04.239> use<00:01:04.479> for<00:01:04.689> a<00:01:04.719> retention<00:01:05.140> is

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:05.469 
we're going to use for a retention is

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:10.319 
we're going to use for a retention is
this<00:01:06.369> old<00:01:06.640> brick<00:01:07.450> edging<00:01:07.960> as<00:01:08.079> shown<00:01:08.710> here<00:01:09.329> if

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
this old brick edging as shown here if

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.539 
this old brick edging as shown here if
you<00:01:10.539> don't<00:01:10.689> want<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.960> use<00:01:11.109> any<00:01:11.319> type<00:01:11.619> of<00:01:11.649> edging

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
you don't want to use any type of edging

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.209 
you don't want to use any type of edging
you<00:01:12.759> can<00:01:13.210> excavate<00:01:13.659> dig<00:01:14.170> down<00:01:14.439> into<00:01:14.859> the

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
you can excavate dig down into the

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.700 
you can excavate dig down into the
ground<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.789> use<00:01:15.969> the<00:01:16.179> side<00:01:16.450> where<00:01:17.200> you've<00:01:17.380> dug

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
ground and use the side where you've dug

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.090 
ground and use the side where you've dug
as<00:01:18.009> a<00:01:18.490> retention<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:20.380> once<00:01:20.560> again<00:01:20.859> in<00:01:21.009> this

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
as a retention but once again in this

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.980 
as a retention but once again in this
case<00:01:21.310> we're<00:01:21.520> going<00:01:21.609> to<00:01:21.670> use<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:22.240> old<00:01:22.270> edging

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
case we're going to use the old edging

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.870 
case we're going to use the old edging
that<00:01:23.139> was<00:01:23.259> used<00:01:23.530> in<00:01:23.679> this<00:01:23.799> herb<00:01:24.039> garden<00:01:24.490> here

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
that was used in this herb garden here

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.069 
that was used in this herb garden here
then<00:01:25.810> I<00:01:26.139> would<00:01:26.439> start<00:01:27.119> using<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.389> bag<00:01:28.600> of<00:01:28.840> lava

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
then I would start using the bag of lava

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:40.420 
then I would start using the bag of lava
rock<00:01:29.200> just<00:01:30.069> open<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.490> bag

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.789 

now<00:01:41.430> when<00:01:41.640> spreading<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> lava<00:01:42.390> rock<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.680> make

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
now when spreading the lava rock to make

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.520 
now when spreading the lava rock to make
it<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.040> little<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.280> lot<00:01:44.430> easier<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.530> spread<00:01:46.530> it

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
it a little a lot easier just spread it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.039 
it a little a lot easier just spread it
sort<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.619> an<00:01:49.710> even<00:01:50.009> motion<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.899> would

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
sort of an even motion and I would

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.859 
sort of an even motion and I would
recommend<00:01:55.200> try<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:57.630> your

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
recommend try not to get this on your

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.499 
recommend try not to get this on your
driveways<00:01:58.380> or<00:01:58.409> patios<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.490> be<00:02:00.179> a<00:02:00.210> little

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
driveways or patios it can be a little

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.560 
driveways or patios it can be a little
difficult<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.899> come<00:02:01.140> off<00:02:01.850> once<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.060> lava<00:02:03.270> rock

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
difficult to come off once the lava rock

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.109 
difficult to come off once the lava rock
is<00:02:03.869> distributed<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:04.979> ground<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.670> will<00:02:05.880> be

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
is distributed on the ground it will be

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.820 
is distributed on the ground it will be
a<00:02:06.149> little<00:02:06.509> uneven<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> would<00:02:08.610> recommend<00:02:08.789> a

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
a little uneven so I would recommend a

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.300 
a little uneven so I would recommend a
gardening<00:02:10.830> hoe<00:02:11.069> or<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:12.290> metal<00:02:13.290> rake<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:14.130> can

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
gardening hoe or a metal rake you can

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.780 
gardening hoe or a metal rake you can
use<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.880> flat<00:02:15.150> part<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.989> metal<00:02:16.560> rake<00:02:16.790> to

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
use the flat part of this metal rake to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.530 
use the flat part of this metal rake to
smooth<00:02:18.120> out<00:02:18.360> all<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.950> lava<00:02:20.190> rocks<00:02:20.519> if<00:02:21.269> that's

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
smooth out all the lava rocks if that's

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.910 
smooth out all the lava rocks if that's
going<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.780> be<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.900> little<00:02:22.140> bit<00:02:22.260> cumbersome<00:02:22.799> or

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
going to be a little bit cumbersome or

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.250 
going to be a little bit cumbersome or
difficult<00:02:23.430> I'd<00:02:24.180> recommend<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.870> use<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
difficult I'd recommend to use the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.620 
difficult I'd recommend to use the
gardening<00:02:25.680> hoe<00:02:25.890> here<00:02:26.630> next<00:02:31.519> also<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:33.510> know
