00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello to you all hurt and today I 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.200
 I got out on the street suddenly abruptly 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.950
 wanted to internet wi-fi points 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.719
 there is no next to me what do i have 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.590
 iphone from which i can distribute 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.389
 the Internet 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.859
 how do we do today and find out 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.859
 our release went 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.890
 first we need to make sure that the points 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.860
 there is no wi-fi access right 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.440
 we are looking for wifi in principle 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.960
 Wi-Fi module is the same in ipad iphone 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.750
 so the results will be the same as 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.140
 we see there is no wi-fay well it is not 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.330
 scary i have a sim card in 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.309
 in general, and on the SIM has its own 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.699
 the Internet 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:04.540
 let's go to the basic cellular data 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:06.299
 and select the modem mode itself so that 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.890
 who he is not active modem 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.220
 I'll show you what needs to be done. 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.900
 log into the cellular data network and 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.650
 enter here open in modem mode 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.500
 as we see here anapa tags where it 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.979
 you can take it just in the cellular 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.320
 data here open if you have configured 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.390
 Internet on your iPhone or Android 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.610
 surrendered enough of this access point 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.020
 access points are on the internet at 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.110
 official sites this is not now 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.400
 problem find in general yes we included 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:47.230
 modem mode on added look and here 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:51.520
 we are given the password socket 3870 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.290
 change if desired and inscribe your but i 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.050
 in fact, I will not do this, and we 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.260
 go to our ipad price ipad 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.150
 found a few seconds wifi and I already 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.690
 connected to connect prices 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.340
 naturally you will need to choose 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.269
 actually wifi itself and enter it 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.280
 the password is then assigned to us a domain and 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.200
 so on in general is not a problem 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.330
 let's test it out with us or 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.550
 no to test us 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.830
 just open the standard browser 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.550
 Safari and try to download 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.420

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.890
 tab write ipad military and 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.920
 let's wait for the natural mobile internet 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.900
 it is no longer, especially since I donâ€™t have 3g 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.930
 internet in iphone if 3g was already 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.940
 instantly all loaded and edge with 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.370
 this is a little natural technology 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.750
 imperfect she is very slow 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.160
 load on how we see everything works 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.720
 and we can use the Internet where 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.420

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.400
