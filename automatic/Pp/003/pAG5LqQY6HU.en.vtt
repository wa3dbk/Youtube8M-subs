00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.890 

so<00:02:22.070> from<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.460> filmmakers<00:02:22.910> perspective<00:02:23.480> what

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
so from a filmmakers perspective what

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.060 
so from a filmmakers perspective what
are<00:02:24.050> my<00:02:24.140> favorite<00:02:24.290> things<00:02:24.650> about<00:02:24.770> this

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
are my favorite things about this

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.010 
are my favorite things about this
replica<00:02:25.610> well<00:02:26.120> first<00:02:26.360> it's<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.840> official

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
replica well first it's the official

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.470 
replica well first it's the official
replica<00:02:27.410> therefore<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.520> very<00:02:28.820> accurate<00:02:29.090> in

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
replica therefore is very accurate in

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.240 
replica therefore is very accurate in
terms<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.870> design<00:02:30.200> having<00:02:30.860> been<00:02:31.100> developed

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
terms of design having been developed

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.250 
terms of design having been developed
directly<00:02:31.820> from<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.120> in-game<00:02:32.480> 3d<00:02:32.930> model

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
directly from the in-game 3d model

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.140 
directly from the in-game 3d model
second<00:02:34.130> I'd<00:02:34.310> like<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.610> weight<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:34.940> prop

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
second I'd like the weight of the prop

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.060 
second I'd like the weight of the prop
since<00:02:35.720> it's<00:02:35.870> made<00:02:35.990> out<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.170> plastic<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.830> keeps

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
since it's made out of plastic it keeps

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.800 
since it's made out of plastic it keeps
the<00:02:37.220> weight<00:02:37.340> down<00:02:37.640> as<00:02:37.910> opposed<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.510> metal

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
the weight down as opposed to a metal

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.540 
the weight down as opposed to a metal
hidden<00:02:39.050> blade<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.830> can<00:02:40.070> be<00:02:40.160> less<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.370> a

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
hidden blade this can be less of a

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.460 
hidden blade this can be less of a
distraction<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.240> actor<00:02:41.630> allowing<00:02:42.350> them

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
distraction to the actor allowing them

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.350 
distraction to the actor allowing them
to<00:02:42.590> focus<00:02:42.770> on<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.100> performance<00:02:43.310> rather<00:02:44.120> than

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
to focus on the performance rather than

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.570 
to focus on the performance rather than
on<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> bulky<00:02:44.900> prop<00:02:45.140> third<00:02:45.800> I<00:02:46.010> like<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.370> price

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
on a bulky prop third I like the price

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.400 
on a bulky prop third I like the price
for<00:02:47.060> thirty<00:02:47.240> to<00:02:47.450> fifty<00:02:47.570> dollars<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:48.080> get<00:02:48.380> a

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
for thirty to fifty dollars you get a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.950 
for thirty to fifty dollars you get a
vambrace<00:02:48.650> Ange<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.490> get<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.700> hidden<00:02:49.970> blade<00:02:50.240> now

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
vambrace Ange you get a hidden blade now

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.060 
vambrace Ange you get a hidden blade now
if<00:02:51.260> you've<00:02:51.440> seen<00:02:51.470> some<00:02:51.740> of<00:02:51.770> my<00:02:51.830> previous

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
if you've seen some of my previous

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.920 
if you've seen some of my previous
videos<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:52.610> know<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.180> some<00:02:53.420> hidden<00:02:53.690> blades

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
videos you know that some hidden blades

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.630 
videos you know that some hidden blades
can<00:02:54.140> go<00:02:54.260> for<00:02:54.470> over<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.650> hundred<00:02:54.800> dollars<00:02:55.340> and

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
can go for over a hundred dollars and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.310 
can go for over a hundred dollars and
that's<00:02:56.210> before<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:56.660> start<00:02:56.870> building<00:02:57.020> them

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
that's before you start building them

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.040 
that's before you start building them
and<00:02:57.560> assembling<00:02:58.070> them<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:59.030> this<00:02:59.600> fan<00:02:59.810> brace

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
and assembling them so this fan brace

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.780 
and assembling them so this fan brace
and<00:03:00.290> hidden<00:03:00.560> blade<00:03:00.800> is<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.220> pretty<00:03:01.490> good<00:03:01.640> bang

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
and hidden blade is a pretty good bang

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.120 
and hidden blade is a pretty good bang
for<00:03:01.970> your<00:03:02.060> buck<00:03:02.410> another<00:03:03.410> thing<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.740> like<00:03:03.920> is

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
for your buck another thing I like is

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.190 
for your buck another thing I like is
the<00:03:04.190> paint<00:03:04.580> originally<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:05.720> was<00:03:05.900> worried<00:03:06.170> that

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
the paint originally I was worried that

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.630 
the paint originally I was worried that
this<00:03:06.410> was<00:03:06.590> not<00:03:06.740> going<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.010> be<00:03:07.130> reflective

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
this was not going to be reflective

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.700 
this was not going to be reflective
enough<00:03:07.880> but<00:03:08.480> after<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> few<00:03:09.080> tests<00:03:09.350> I<00:03:09.560> have

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
enough but after a few tests I have

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.260 
enough but after a few tests I have
found<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.190> metallic<00:03:10.520> sheen<00:03:10.880> comes

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
found that this metallic sheen comes

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
distressed as I like but that's an easy

if<00:03:21.590> you've<00:03:21.770> played<00:03:21.980> Assassin's<00:03:22.310> Creed

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
if you've played Assassin's Creed

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.730 
if you've played Assassin's Creed
Brotherhood<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.630> know<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:24.020> Ezio's<00:03:24.410> hidden

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
Brotherhood you know that Ezio's hidden

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.280 
Brotherhood you know that Ezio's hidden
blades<00:03:25.040> are<00:03:25.520> a<00:03:25.610> lot<00:03:25.820> longer<00:03:26.000> than<00:03:26.330> this<00:03:26.510> but

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
blades are a lot longer than this but

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.290 
blades are a lot longer than this but
that's<00:03:27.680> just<00:03:27.860> a<00:03:28.010> downside<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.610> run<00:03:28.760> into<00:03:29.060> when

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
that's just a downside you run into when

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.030 
that's just a downside you run into when
you<00:03:29.420> have<00:03:29.570> a<00:03:29.600> one-size-fits-all<00:03:30.110> product

you have a one-size-fits-all product

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.100 
you have a one-size-fits-all product
another<00:03:31.760> downside<00:03:32.270> is<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:32.540> it's<00:03:32.810> made<00:03:32.959> out

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
another downside is that it's made out

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.050 
another downside is that it's made out
of<00:03:33.140> plastic<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:33.860> know<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.340> mentioned<00:03:34.580> this<00:03:34.820> as<00:03:35.030> a

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
of plastic I know I mentioned this as a

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.970

positive before however from a
durability<00:03:37.400> standpoint<00:03:37.880> it<00:03:38.300> does<00:03:38.690> seem<00:03:38.900> like

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
durability standpoint it does seem like

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.960 
durability standpoint it does seem like
this<00:03:39.170> plastic<00:03:39.620> could<00:03:39.860> break<00:03:40.100> if<00:03:40.340> given<00:03:40.760> enough

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
this plastic could break if given enough

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.820 
this plastic could break if given enough

additionally<00:03:49.520> I<00:03:49.640> don't<00:03:50.030> like<00:03:50.269> that<00:03:50.510> it's

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
additionally I don't like that it's

gravity hidden blades on set and that's
just<00:03:55.790> because<00:03:55.910> they're<00:03:56.269> far<00:03:56.480> more

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
just because they're far more

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
set and that's something I like to avoid

not<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.180> say<00:04:08.360> that<00:04:08.540> it<00:04:08.600> would<00:04:08.690> stop<00:04:08.959> me<00:04:09.140> from

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
using this prop on any of my movies I

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.150 
using this prop on any of my movies I
would<00:04:11.660> just<00:04:11.780> be<00:04:11.930> far<00:04:12.230> more<00:04:12.260> cautious<00:04:12.950> with<00:04:13.100> it

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
would just be far more cautious with it

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160 
would just be far more cautious with it
than<00:04:13.459> I<00:04:13.550> would<00:04:13.790> be<00:04:13.970> say<00:04:14.540> with<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.750> gravity

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
than I would be say with the gravity

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.110 
than I would be say with the gravity

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
distressed my first blade a little more

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.279 
distressed my first blade a little more
by<00:04:29.039> covering<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.610> in<00:04:29.759> black<00:04:30.090> paint<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:30.539> wiping

tried to doll it up by distressing it a
little<00:05:19.680> more<00:05:19.889> but<00:05:20.400> that<00:05:20.729> didn't<00:05:21.000> work<00:05:21.030> out

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
little more but that didn't work out

little more but that didn't work out
well<00:05:21.330> either<00:05:21.750> it<00:05:22.650> may<00:05:22.800> look<00:05:23.010> cool<00:05:23.190> for<00:05:23.430> long

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610

as<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:31.570> can<00:05:31.690> tell<00:05:31.840> I<00:05:31.990> really<00:05:32.530> like<00:05:32.710> this<00:05:32.920> prop

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
as you can tell I really like this prop

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.920 
as you can tell I really like this prop
I<00:05:33.490> think<00:05:33.820> it's<00:05:33.940> a<00:05:34.000> lot<00:05:34.210> better<00:05:34.480> than<00:05:34.600> the

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
I think it's a lot better than the

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.780 
I think it's a lot better than the
Edward<00:05:35.560> Kenway<00:05:35.800> hidden<00:05:36.190> blade<00:05:36.400> made<00:05:36.670> by

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
McFarlane Toys now it does have some

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.980 
McFarlane Toys now it does have some
downsides<00:05:40.030> when<00:05:40.270> it<00:05:40.360> comes<00:05:40.540> to<00:05:40.660> filming

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
downsides when it comes to filming

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.960 
downsides when it comes to filming
however<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:41.980> still<00:05:42.280> think<00:05:42.520> it's<00:05:42.640> a<00:05:42.700> really

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
however I still think it's a really

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.970 
however I still think it's a really
solid<00:05:43.150> prop<00:05:43.510> and<00:05:43.990> I<00:05:44.080> would<00:05:44.200> highly<00:05:44.500> recommend

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
solid prop and I would highly recommend

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.280

it to anybody who's interested and that

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.170 
it to anybody who's interested and that
