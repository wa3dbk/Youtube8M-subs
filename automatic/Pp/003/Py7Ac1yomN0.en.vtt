through<00:00:24.269> 3<00:00:24.510> we're<00:00:24.630> going<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.990> hardest

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
through 3 we're going to be the hardest

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410 
through 3 we're going to be the hardest
of<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.590> diet<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.099> then<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.970> was<00:00:27.090> going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> be

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
of this diet and then it was going to be

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.640 
of this diet and then it was going to be
all<00:00:27.630> clear<00:00:27.990> from<00:00:28.140> there<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.160> seems<00:00:29.490> that

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
all clear from there but it seems that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.120 
all clear from there but it seems that
that's<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.920> case<00:00:32.219> at<00:00:32.850> day<00:00:33.809> four<00:00:34.170> day<00:00:34.829> five

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
that's not the case at day four day five

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.060 
that's not the case at day four day five
and<00:00:35.760> part<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.719> day<00:00:36.840> six<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.710> been<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and part of day six have been the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.950 
and part of day six have been the
hardest<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.550> far<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.030> that's<00:00:39.450> not<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:39.809> i<00:00:39.840> was

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
hardest so far and that's not what i was

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.729 
hardest so far and that's not what i was
expecting<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.530> all<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:40.860> really<00:00:41.070> strange<00:00:42.030> so

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
expecting at all it's really strange so

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.660 
expecting at all it's really strange so
anyway<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.980> things<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.520> been<00:00:44.550> going
