00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
some of these quantum gates ok so let's

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.010 
some of these quantum gates ok so let's
take<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.189> look<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.740> new<00:01:19.740> quantum<00:01:20.670> gate<00:01:21.090> it's

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
take a look at a new quantum gate it's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.200 
take a look at a new quantum gate it's
convenient<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.740> describe<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.700> matrix

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.149 
convenient to describe it in the matrix
representation<00:01:25.790> in<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.060> form<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.950> just

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
representation in this form so it just

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.480 
representation in this form so it just
has<00:01:29.310> diagonal<00:01:29.820> entries<00:01:30.390> theta<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.439> Phi<00:01:31.619> real

whatever<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.210> just

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
whatever you like and so it's just

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
acted upon linearly as per usual so you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.370 
acted upon linearly as per usual so you
can<00:01:59.399> easily<00:01:59.490> go<00:01:59.790> away<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.240> check<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:01.200> this

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.830 
can easily go away and check that this
is<00:02:01.590> unitary<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.850> should<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.420> pretty<00:02:03.689> evident

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.249 
is unitary it should be pretty evident
that<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.409> for<00:02:04.860> example<00:02:05.189> length<00:02:05.399> preserving

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
that it's for example length preserving

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.690 
that it's for example length preserving
and<00:02:07.259> therefore<00:02:07.770> unitary<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.550> can

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
and therefore unitary or you can

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.300 
and therefore unitary or you can
explicitly<00:02:08.970> do<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.750> calculation<00:02:10.379> now<00:02:11.250> you

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
explicitly do the calculation now you

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.380 
explicitly do the calculation now you
might<00:02:11.580> wonder<00:02:11.760> whether<00:02:12.480> or<00:02:12.599> not<00:02:12.750> this

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
might wonder whether or not this

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.360 
might wonder whether or not this

better squared these phase factors don't
make<00:02:41.230> any<00:02:41.410> difference<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.100> absolute

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.180 
make any difference to the absolute
value<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.950> alpha<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.960> so<00:02:47.320> it<00:02:47.710> sort<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:47.980> seems

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
value of alpha and so it sort of seems

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.980 
value of alpha and so it sort of seems
like<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.490> you<00:02:48.880> know<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.600> state<00:02:49.870> is

indistinguishable from this one and you

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.420 
indistinguishable from this one and you

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.160 
might wonder whether or not you know
there's<00:02:54.610> really<00:02:54.760> any<00:02:55.030> purpose<00:02:55.450> in<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.900> having

there's really any purpose in to having

there's really any purpose in to having
these<00:02:56.320> states<00:02:56.650> but<00:02:56.950> actually<00:02:57.880> if<00:02:58.120> you're<00:02:58.270> a

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
these states but actually if you're a

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.390 
these states but actually if you're a
little<00:02:58.420> bit<00:02:58.630> more<00:02:58.840> clever<00:02:59.080> in<00:02:59.950> fact<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.280> is

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
little bit more clever in fact it is

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.850 
little bit more clever in fact it is
possible<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.180> distinguish<00:03:01.780> this<00:03:02.440> state<00:03:02.650> from

possible to distinguish this state from
this<00:03:03.520> state<00:03:03.790> at<00:03:04.030> least<00:03:04.650> some<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:05.830> time<00:03:06.070> and

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
this state at least some of the time and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.220 
this state at least some of the time and
I'll<00:03:06.730> give<00:03:06.820> you<00:03:06.910> an<00:03:07.000> explicit<00:03:07.420> example<00:03:08.050> of

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
I'll give you an explicit example of

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.150 
I'll give you an explicit example of
that<00:03:08.830> imagine<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:09.760> we<00:03:09.940> had<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.300> state<00:03:10.540> 0

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
that imagine that we had the state 0

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.580 
that imagine that we had the state 0
plus<00:03:12.160> 1<00:03:12.430> over<00:03:12.760> root<00:03:13.120> 2<00:03:13.470> equal<00:03:14.470> superposition

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
plus 1 over root 2 equal superposition

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.480 
plus 1 over root 2 equal superposition
state<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.520> we'll<00:03:15.880> apply<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.150> particular

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
state and we'll apply a particular

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.760 
state and we'll apply a particular
version<00:03:18.490> of<00:03:18.640> this<00:03:19.150> gate<00:03:19.480> with<00:03:19.930> theta<00:03:20.350> 0<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:22.770> the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
version of this gate with theta 0 so the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.740 
version of this gate with theta 0 so the
0<00:03:23.980> state<00:03:24.370> doesn't<00:03:24.640> get<00:03:24.820> changed<00:03:25.210> at<00:03:25.330> all<00:03:25.420> and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
0 state doesn't get changed at all and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.260 
0 state doesn't get changed at all and
amplitude<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.350> Phi<00:03:26.890> equal<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.310> 1<00:03:27.550> oh<00:03:27.760> sorry

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
amplitude and Phi equal to 1 oh sorry

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.380 
amplitude and Phi equal to 1 oh sorry
Phi<00:03:28.540> equal<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.840> PI<00:03:29.110> so<00:03:29.620> this<00:03:30.000> phase<00:03:31.000> factor<00:03:31.030> is

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
Phi equal to PI so this phase factor is

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.310 
Phi equal to PI so this phase factor is
minus<00:03:32.080> 1<00:03:32.230> overall<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:32.740> this<00:03:32.860> becomes<00:03:33.270> minus<00:03:34.270> 1

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
minus 1 overall so this becomes minus 1

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.880 
minus 1 overall so this becomes minus 1
all<00:03:35.320> over<00:03:35.850> root<00:03:36.850> 2<00:03:37.090> now<00:03:37.930> again<00:03:38.440> if<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.740> do<00:03:38.860> a

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
all over root 2 now again if you do a

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.350 
all over root 2 now again if you do a
measurement<00:03:39.040> in<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.370> computational<00:03:39.910> basis

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
measurement in the computational basis

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.320 
measurement in the computational basis
you<00:03:40.900> get<00:03:41.080> 0<00:03:41.530> or<00:03:41.620> 1<00:03:42.040> here<00:03:42.610> with<00:03:42.790> probability<00:03:43.240> 1/2

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
you get 0 or 1 here with probability 1/2

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.050 
you get 0 or 1 here with probability 1/2
each<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.620> same<00:03:44.830> for<00:03:45.070> this<00:03:45.190> state<00:03:45.460> so

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
each and the same for this state so

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.640 
each and the same for this state so
that's<00:03:46.450> not<00:03:46.600> helping<00:03:46.960> until<00:03:47.230> in<00:03:47.350> these<00:03:47.500> two

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
that's not helping until in these two

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.590 
that's not helping until in these two
states<00:03:47.710> apart<00:03:48.220> but<00:03:48.730> there<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:49.030> a<00:03:49.060> nice<00:03:49.390> little

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
states apart but there is a nice little

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.000 
states apart but there is a nice little
quantum<00:03:49.960> circuit<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.470> could<00:03:50.590> be<00:03:50.680> used<00:03:50.920> to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
quantum circuit that could be used to

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.520 
quantum circuit that could be used to
tell<00:03:51.280> them<00:03:51.510> apart<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:52.630> let<00:03:52.870> me<00:03:52.990> draw<00:03:53.230> that

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530

easily check that if the 0 plus 1 state
comes<00:04:12.040> in<00:04:12.250> then<00:04:12.880> a<00:04:12.970> 0<00:04:13.209> will<00:04:13.510> come<00:04:13.720> out<00:04:13.959> and<00:04:14.260> if<00:04:15.070> a

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
comes in then a 0 will come out and if a

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.940 
comes in then a 0 will come out and if a
0<00:04:15.340> minus<00:04:15.730> 1<00:04:15.880> state<00:04:16.209> comes<00:04:16.450> in<00:04:16.630> then<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.380> 1<00:04:17.650> state

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
0 minus 1 state comes in then a 1 state

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.160 
0 minus 1 state comes in then a 1 state
will<00:04:18.340> come<00:04:18.520> out<00:04:18.730> it's<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.420> little<00:04:19.510> calculation

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
will come out it's a little calculation

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.520 
will come out it's a little calculation
involved<00:04:20.709> there

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
involved there

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.670 
involved there
but<00:04:22.490> it's<00:04:22.639> not<00:04:22.790> difficult<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.240> do<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:23.660> so<00:04:24.139> if

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
but it's not difficult to do and so if

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.090 
but it's not difficult to do and so if
we<00:04:24.920> measure<00:04:25.160> in<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.940> computational<00:04:26.540> basis

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
we measure in the computational basis

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.890 
we measure in the computational basis
we'll<00:04:28.100> either<00:04:28.250> if<00:04:28.550> we<00:04:28.670> get<00:04:28.790> a<00:04:28.820> zero<00:04:29.120> we<00:04:29.750> know

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
we'll either if we get a zero we know

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.750 
we'll either if we get a zero we know
for<00:04:30.080> sure<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.620> was<00:04:30.740> zero<00:04:31.040> plus<00:04:31.280> one<00:04:31.490> state

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
for sure that it was zero plus one state

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.909 
for sure that it was zero plus one state
that<00:04:31.790> came<00:04:32.090> in<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.450> if<00:04:32.840> we<00:04:32.930> get<00:04:33.020> a<00:04:33.080> one<00:04:33.320> we<00:04:33.770> know

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
that came in and if we get a one we know

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.379 
that came in and if we get a one we know
that<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.130> was<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.340> zero<00:04:34.550> minus<00:04:34.940> one<00:04:35.090> state

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
that it was the zero minus one state

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.150 
that it was the zero minus one state
that<00:04:35.570> came<00:04:35.750> in<00:04:35.930> so<00:04:36.350> this<00:04:36.440> quantum<00:04:36.770> circuit

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
that came in so this quantum circuit

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.740 
that came in so this quantum circuit
gives<00:04:37.310> us<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.580> way<00:04:37.730> of<00:04:37.760> distinguishing<00:04:38.240> these

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
gives us a way of distinguishing these

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.870 
gives us a way of distinguishing these
two<00:04:38.990> states<00:04:39.290> from<00:04:39.950> one<00:04:40.100> another<00:04:40.340> they<00:04:40.550> really

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
two states from one another they really

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.330 
two states from one another they really
are<00:04:41.030> different<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:41.930> gates<00:04:42.680> of<00:04:42.860> this<00:04:43.010> form

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
are different and gates of this form

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.210 
are different and gates of this form
really<00:04:43.970> can<00:04:44.300> have<00:04:44.540> a<00:04:44.870> practical<00:04:45.440> impact<00:04:45.889> on

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
really can have a practical impact on

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.370 
really can have a practical impact on
the<00:04:46.310> outcomes<00:04:46.700> of<00:04:46.850> our<00:04:46.970> computations<00:04:47.660> this<00:04:48.260> is

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
the outcomes of our computations this is

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.659 
the outcomes of our computations this is
a<00:04:48.410> very<00:04:48.560> simple<00:04:48.860> kind<00:04:49.010> of<00:04:49.130> an<00:04:49.220> impact<00:04:49.490> of

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
a very simple kind of an impact of

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.820 
a very simple kind of an impact of
course<00:04:49.910> down<00:04:50.330> here<00:04:50.360> it's<00:04:51.320> not<00:04:51.560> particularly

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
course down here it's not particularly

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.790 
course down here it's not particularly
profound<00:04:52.450> but<00:04:53.450> sometimes<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.470> know<00:04:54.530> it's

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
profound but sometimes you know it's

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.980 
profound but sometimes you know it's
it's<00:04:55.100> much<00:04:55.280> more<00:04:55.490> important<00:04:56.000> so<00:04:56.270> these<00:04:56.750> gates

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
it's much more important so these gates

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.810 
it's much more important so these gates
actually<00:04:57.290> really<00:04:57.530> are<00:04:57.680> worth<00:04:58.070> paying

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
actually really are worth paying

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.270 
actually really are worth paying
attention<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.270> and<00:04:59.510> taking<00:04:59.750> seriously

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
attention to and taking seriously

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.010 
attention to and taking seriously
another<00:05:01.280> good<00:05:01.610> example<00:05:01.640> of<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.540> quantum<00:05:02.810> gate

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
another good example of a quantum gate

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.210 
another good example of a quantum gate
is<00:05:03.230> the<00:05:04.100> familiar<00:05:05.350> rotation<00:05:06.350> so<00:05:06.800> something

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
is the familiar rotation so something

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.030 
is the familiar rotation so something

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
that it's a rotation matrix and so it's

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.620

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
which has this familiar form then it has

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.420 
which has this familiar form then it has
two<00:05:55.010> partners<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.180> Y<00:05:56.330> and<00:05:56.479> the<00:05:56.600> Z<00:05:56.630> gate<00:05:57.430> which

two partners the Y and the Z gate which

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.590 
two partners the Y and the Z gate which
have<00:05:59.300> this<00:05:59.510> form<00:06:00.160> so<00:06:01.160> Y<00:06:01.640> is<00:06:01.700> very<00:06:01.910> similar<00:06:02.360> but

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600

qubit gates as I said before you don't

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.550 
qubit gates as I said before you don't
need<00:07:29.430> to<00:07:29.610> remember<00:07:30.000> all<00:07:30.720> these<00:07:30.930> gates<00:07:31.230> at<00:07:31.440> this

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 
need to remember all these gates at this

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.900 
need to remember all these gates at this
point<00:07:31.890> I'll<00:07:32.070> bring<00:07:32.250> them<00:07:32.400> up<00:07:32.520> again<00:07:32.580> as

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:32.910 
point I'll bring them up again as

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.170 
point I'll bring them up again as
they're<00:07:33.120> needed<00:07:34.190> but<00:07:35.190> you<00:07:35.730> know<00:07:35.820> what<00:07:35.940> we<00:07:36.030> need

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 
they're needed but you know what we need

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.760 
they're needed but you know what we need
to<00:07:36.330> do<00:07:36.450> now<00:07:36.660> that<00:07:36.990> we<00:07:37.380> know<00:07:37.470> a<00:07:37.500> lot<00:07:37.740> about

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:37.770 
to do now that we know a lot about

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.280 
to do now that we know a lot about
single<00:07:38.340> qubits<00:07:38.730> is<00:07:38.940> moved<00:07:39.660> to<00:07:39.930> the<00:07:40.020> multi

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:40.290 
single qubits is moved to the multi

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.410 
single qubits is moved to the multi
qubit<00:07:40.940> scenario<00:07:41.940> so<00:07:42.150> you're<00:07:42.330> obviously

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:42.420 
qubit scenario so you're obviously

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.300 
qubit scenario so you're obviously
computations<00:07:43.260> don't<00:07:43.500> involve<00:07:43.710> just<00:07:43.950> a<00:07:44.040> single

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.310 
computations don't involve just a single

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.850 
computations don't involve just a single
qubit<00:07:44.640> all<00:07:44.790> the<00:07:44.910> time<00:07:45.200> they<00:07:46.200> can<00:07:46.380> also<00:07:46.500> involve

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 
qubit all the time they can also involve

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.700 
qubit all the time they can also involve
many<00:07:47.790> qubits<00:07:48.750> if<00:07:49.110> they're<00:07:49.440> going<00:07:49.530> to<00:07:49.590> be

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:49.710 
many qubits if they're going to be

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.680 
many qubits if they're going to be
interesting<00:07:50.190> and<00:07:50.340> we're<00:07:51.060> going<00:07:51.180> to<00:07:51.240> talk<00:07:51.420> in

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:51.690 
interesting and we're going to talk in

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.020 
interesting and we're going to talk in
the<00:07:51.870> next<00:07:51.900> video<00:07:52.320> about<00:07:52.590> the<00:07:53.030> controlled-not

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.030 
the next video about the controlled-not

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.710 
the next video about the controlled-not
gate<00:07:54.660> which<00:07:54.900> is<00:07:54.930> our<00:07:55.140> first<00:07:55.320> example<00:07:55.500> of<00:07:56.040> a<00:07:56.720> two

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 
gate which is our first example of a two

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.020 
gate which is our first example of a two
qubit<00:07:58.110> gate<00:07:58.830> and<00:07:59.070> it<00:07:59.640> turns<00:07:59.820> out<00:07:59.970> that

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.030 
qubit gate and it turns out that

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.820 
qubit gate and it turns out that
actually<00:08:00.330> really<00:08:00.630> it's<00:08:01.020> the<00:08:01.200> only<00:08:01.380> extra

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:01.830 
actually really it's the only extra

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.620 
actually really it's the only extra

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:03.630 
thing that we need to know beyond what

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.750 
thing that we need to know beyond what
