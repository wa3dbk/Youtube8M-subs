00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.759
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:17.210
 second video on lightroom 4 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:21.350
 this video will be about how 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.870
 you take pictures directly from the camera on the 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.500
 pc rather directly into lightroom 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:33.559
 imported and first of all I have to 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:37.360
 Maybe most people say so 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:41.300
 make sure you take the pictures from the camera 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:46.239
 first copy to a folder on 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.700
 the pc that is nice and good though 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:53.149
 This only loses time in 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.640
 Lightroom does it all with the 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.820
 copy function 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.950
 the same applies for photos 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.140
 copy and save a new location 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:10.330
 add a catalog so that means 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.820
 the camera here my chaos 1100 de 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.630
 the photos are in a folder on the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:21.500
 pc copied and at the same time to the catalog 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.619
 added one saves thereby thus 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:29.090
 a whole step I find 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:31.190
 this feature is much more practical and 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.869
 I only use it because of it 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.030
 I just like the photos same lightroom 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.729
 have and continue working immediately 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.210
 can 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:44.240
 We already know this window 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.700
 Here's just up here now 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.390
 no longer the hard drive as a source 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.080
 but the camera here is only there 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.409
 copy two functions as dmg there 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.920
 commented the pictures the same dmg 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.950
 and then adds, and there are still 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.369
 the function copy the function 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:13.130
 Moving and Adding come in 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:18.960
 In this mode not here are the photos 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.500
 this time in raw format format co2 that 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.850
 the format directly from the canon I have yes 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.210
 just a few pictures of mine 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:32.490
 wall made but here 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:37.020
 it works out to see you there 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.450
 yes a few more points the point 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.250
 we already know each other 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.440
 Here is also this function 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.600
 available and we can then the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.080
 photos once and the location 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.350
 copy and still copied somewhere 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.130
 if we have the unprocessed yet 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.810
 want to have extra time here 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.120
 look again at one to one 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.220
 leave 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.810
 then we are with the file 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.770
 Manager already finished file 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.070
 Renaming is new if you are now 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.420
 rename the hook here for files 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:21.430
 There are a few templates 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:24.880
 and for example date and the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.070
 filenames I'll just leave it now 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.220
 times obama because and user defined 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:34.150
 name and edit here below you can 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:39.070
 Create your own name that way though 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.960
 then the photos are renamed the same 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.920
 when importing and are also in 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.480
 the name on the hard disk 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.970
 that is also very practical i use 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.220
 actually always about the photos like here 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.510
 now 700 right back at 1 so the 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.840
 then right back in the right one 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.350
 Sequences are stupid often need 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.460
 We will not do it then during the import 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:16.920
 To apply the procedure we know the window 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:16.920
 yes, I'll give it here 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.670
 this one day 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.740
 then we are already with the rider 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.890
 finished and then there is still a long 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.470
 aim 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:38.740
 here are actually again 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.970
 hard disks and indeed 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.360
 because here are the photos copied from the 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.479
 camera when she copies there and to 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.310
 catalog added and normal would be 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.910
 stop most I think 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.430
 from the camera without lightroom the photos 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.310
 Copy it in here and then copy it again 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.759
 Add to lightroom by adding 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.729
 that works with this function in one 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:09.789
 Now I have a job here 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.520
 folder selected here you can still with 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.289
 subfolder danwerth here again 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.340
 subfolder created if I'm in the name 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.870
 Enter H test there again 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.430
 entertain and there they will be 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:29.199
 purely saved I leave now and times 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:32.819
 by date they are arranged or in 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:37.300
 a folder if you just copied 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:40.509
 the rest is actually the same knows 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.419
 Anything can look at the photos now 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:48.460
 unfortunately not look because they just stop 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:50.229
 not on the pc but that can be done 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.930
 yes then you can always do it in pain 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.889
 still sort out 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.550
 I'll just go there again 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.550
 import 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.150
 now synonymous synonymous photos copy and 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.780
 import and now he renders again 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.780
 to look ahead 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.980
 there a clear 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:20.000
 and that's it now we have the photos 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:22.599
 here in our library and can 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.599
 they look at us 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.750
 the photos from the last import are now 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.860
 also here 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.139
 which I for example in the last video 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.930
 said that for every import one 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:38.320
 new folder then created better 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:41.949
 the folder here says as well as 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.800
 the folders in which they were copied 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:47.320
 we have the photos in the folder 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.270
 import copied from the camera 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.389
 just then the folder is here 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.120
 in lightroom here we can go now 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:07:02.039
 only the pictures from the last tutorial 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:04.860
 look at or just the pictures of this 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:07.030
 Just look at us now 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.340
 and that was it too 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.949
 this video 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:15.570
 i hope i could help you though 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:18.370
 you liked the video thumbs up 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.500
 favor an abo would of course be synonymous 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.330
 very nice i would be real too 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.220
 looking forward 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.620
 the video will spread to your friends 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:32.050
 say further would also be a great 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:33.820
 Matter criticism you can definitely in 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.400
 make the comments I read that to me 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.960
 Definitely by the same way as asking 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.419
 You can also just in the comments 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.530
 make all my videos and 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:45.870
 I'll get you there as soon as possible 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:50.340
 possible to answer thanks for watching 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.340
 see you next time
