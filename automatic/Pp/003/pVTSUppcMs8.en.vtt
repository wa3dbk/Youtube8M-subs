00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.369 

this<00:00:09.800> video<00:00:10.160> is<00:00:11.120> going<00:00:11.420> to<00:00:11.510> show<00:00:11.630> how<00:00:12.110> to<00:00:12.170> use

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:12.379 
this video is going to show how to use

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.179 
this video is going to show how to use
the<00:00:12.620> high-pass<00:00:13.549> filter<00:00:14.389> on<00:00:14.630> a<00:00:14.929> nebula<00:00:15.380> but

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
the high-pass filter on a nebula but

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.580 
the high-pass filter on a nebula but
without<00:00:16.490> affecting<00:00:17.000> the<00:00:17.150> stars<00:00:17.450> and<00:00:17.779> I<00:00:18.500> will

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
without affecting the stars and I will

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.730 
without affecting the stars and I will
do<00:00:18.680> this<00:00:18.860> by<00:00:19.009> making<00:00:19.250> a<00:00:19.520> star<00:00:19.910> mask<00:00:20.439> if<00:00:21.439> you<00:00:21.590> can

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
do this by making a star mask if you can

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.269 
do this by making a star mask if you can
cover<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.099> stars<00:00:22.369> over<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.090> that<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:23.510> mask

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
cover the stars over so that the mask

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.500 
cover the stars over so that the mask
doesn't<00:00:25.279> see<00:00:25.490> them<00:00:25.670> then<00:00:25.939> they<00:00:26.119> won't<00:00:26.330> be

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
doesn't see them then they won't be

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.420 
doesn't see them then they won't be
affected<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:27.140> you<00:00:27.170> then<00:00:27.680> get<00:00:27.859> the<00:00:27.920> desired

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
affected and you then get the desired

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.390 
affected and you then get the desired
effect<00:00:29.260> so<00:00:30.260> to<00:00:30.320> make<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.650> star<00:00:30.920> mask

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
effect so to make the star mask

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.810 
effect so to make the star mask
first<00:00:31.609> of<00:00:31.699> all<00:00:31.760> make<00:00:31.970> a<00:00:32.000> copy<00:00:32.330> of<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:33.320> original

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
first of all make a copy of the original

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.420 
first of all make a copy of the original
using<00:00:34.820> control<00:00:35.330> J<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:38.410> then<00:00:39.410> going<00:00:39.649> to<00:00:39.710> make<00:00:39.920> a

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
using control J and then going to make a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.350 
using control J and then going to make a
star<00:00:40.850> mask<00:00:41.090> using<00:00:41.540> that<00:00:42.070> copied<00:00:43.070> layer<00:00:43.309> if<00:00:44.300> you

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
star mask using that copied layer if you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.760 
star mask using that copied layer if you
go<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:44.660> edit<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.469> certain<00:00:45.920> to<00:00:46.040> image

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
go to edit a certain to image

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.779 
go to edit a certain to image
adjustments<00:00:49.300> threshold<00:00:51.430> you<00:00:52.430> see<00:00:52.640> it's

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
adjustments threshold you see it's

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.670 
adjustments threshold you see it's
converted<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.510> image<00:00:53.719> into<00:00:53.899> just<00:00:54.260> black<00:00:54.649> and

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
converted the image into just black and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.650 
converted the image into just black and
white<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:56.180> slider<00:00:56.899> here<00:00:57.260> is<00:00:57.559> indicates

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
white and the slider here is indicates

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.850 
white and the slider here is indicates
where<00:00:59.660> in<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.899> range<00:01:00.110> of<00:01:00.289> things<00:01:00.500> that<00:01:00.680> which

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
where in the range of things that which

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.130 
where in the range of things that which
will<00:01:01.129> be<00:01:01.250> black<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:01.640> white<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.270> if<00:01:02.809> I<00:01:02.960> move

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
will be black and white and if I move

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.279 
will be black and white and if I move
that<00:01:03.410> to<00:01:04.009> the<00:01:04.129> left<00:01:04.339> then<00:01:04.789> more<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.930> image

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
that to the left then more of the image

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:09.820 
that to the left then more of the image
becomes<00:01:06.740> white<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.759> left<00:01:07.940> less<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:09.590> if<00:01:09.680> I

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
becomes white so the left less and if I

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.980 
becomes white so the left less and if I
get<00:01:09.979> it<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:10.369> that<00:01:10.399> it's<00:01:10.760> just<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:11.360> stars<00:01:11.659> and

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
get it so that it's just the stars and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.149 
get it so that it's just the stars and
not<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.320> nebula<00:01:13.570> then<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.380> what<00:01:16.010> I'm

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
not the nebula then that is what I'm

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.760 
not the nebula then that is what I'm
after<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:17.659> say<00:01:17.869> okay<00:01:18.260> I<00:01:19.720> then<00:01:20.720> used<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.229> magic

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
after and say okay I then used the magic

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.480 
after and say okay I then used the magic
one<00:01:22.040> tool<00:01:22.430> which<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.820> this<00:01:22.970> one<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:24.250> I've<00:01:25.250> got

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
one tool which is this one and I've got

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.100 
one tool which is this one and I've got
to<00:01:25.580> select<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.030> white<00:01:26.210> but<00:01:26.450> it's<00:01:26.600> much<00:01:26.750> easier

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
to select the white but it's much easier

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.050 
to select the white but it's much easier
to<00:01:27.229> actually<00:01:27.380> select<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.979> black<00:01:28.640> because

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
to actually select the black because

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.030 
to actually select the black because
there's<00:01:29.210> more<00:01:29.360> of<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:29.960> just<00:01:30.650> click

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
there's more of it so just click

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.340 
there's more of it so just click
somewhere<00:01:31.310> where<00:01:31.640> it's<00:01:31.790> dark<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:33.020> that's

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
somewhere where it's dark and that's

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.219 
somewhere where it's dark and that's
selected<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.070> black<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:35.600> change<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:36.049> so

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
selected the black and to change it so

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.429 
selected the black and to change it so
that<00:01:36.439> it's<00:01:36.619> selected<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.310> white<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:37.520> go<00:01:37.970> to

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
that it's selected the white I go to

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.120 
that it's selected the white I go to
select<00:01:39.439> inverse<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:42.079> see<00:01:42.619> now<00:01:42.829> we've<00:01:43.009> got

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
select inverse and you see now we've got

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.840 
select inverse and you see now we've got
the<00:01:43.250> little

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.230 

movie<00:01:46.630> dashi<00:01:46.960> bits<00:01:47.290> around<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.310> stars<00:01:48.610> or

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
movie dashi bits around the stars or

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.440 
movie dashi bits around the stars or
where<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.600> stars<00:01:49.869> were<00:01:50.970> now<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.030> make<00:01:52.270> this<00:01:52.390> a

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
where the stars were now to make this a

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.320 
where the stars were now to make this a
little<00:01:52.600> bit<00:01:52.810> better<00:01:52.960> what<00:01:53.290> we<00:01:53.409> do<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:54.330> alter

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
little bit better what we do is alter

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.510 
little bit better what we do is alter
the<00:01:55.450> selection<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.930> little<00:01:56.080> bit<00:01:56.350> so<00:01:57.250> go<00:01:57.460> to

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
the selection a little bit so go to

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.940 
the selection a little bit so go to
select<00:01:58.409> modify<00:02:00.509> expand<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:02.409> I'm<00:02:02.649> going<00:02:02.890> to

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
select modify expand and I'm going to

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.010 
select modify expand and I'm going to
expand<00:02:03.369> those<00:02:03.549> selections<00:02:03.850> by<00:02:04.240> two<00:02:04.299> pixels

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
expand those selections by two pixels

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.350 
expand those selections by two pixels
and<00:02:05.259> if<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.500> say<00:02:06.030> okay<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.729> can<00:02:09.880> see<00:02:10.060> there<00:02:10.270> if

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
and if I say okay you can see there if

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.800 
and if I say okay you can see there if
they've<00:02:10.569> got<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.780> little<00:02:11.080> bit<00:02:11.230> bigger<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:13.600> need

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
they've got a little bit bigger you need

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.449 
they've got a little bit bigger you need
to<00:02:13.900> experiment<00:02:14.440> with<00:02:14.530> how<00:02:14.560> much<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:14.890> expand

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
to experiment with how much you expand

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.309 
to experiment with how much you expand
it<00:02:15.580> but<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:16.660> know<00:02:16.780> once<00:02:16.959> you've<00:02:17.110> got<00:02:17.200> the

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
it but you know once you've got the

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.660 
it but you know once you've got the
technique<00:02:17.680> then<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:20.170> do<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:21.550> other

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
technique then you can do it the other

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.630 
technique then you can do it the other
thing<00:02:21.880> I'll<00:02:22.030> do<00:02:22.239> is<00:02:22.510> feather<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.069> it

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
thing I'll do is feather it so that it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.750 
thing I'll do is feather it so that it
isn't<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.000> sudden<00:02:25.450> change<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.459> go<00:02:27.700> to

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
isn't a sudden change and so go to

isn't a sudden change and so go to
select<00:02:28.470> feather<00:02:29.730> now<00:02:30.730> I'll<00:02:30.880> choose<00:02:31.120> as

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
already there one pixel okay right so

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.650 
already there one pixel okay right so
we've<00:02:37.630> got<00:02:37.810> this<00:02:37.959> these<00:02:38.620> selections<00:02:39.250> there

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
we've got this these selections there

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.120 
we've got this these selections there
what<00:02:40.660> we<00:02:40.780> need<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.049> do<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.319> go<00:02:41.560> back<00:02:41.799> to<00:02:42.040> the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
what we need to do is go back to the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.199 
what we need to do is go back to the
background<00:02:42.519> I'll<00:02:42.700> make<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.030> background

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
background I'll make the background

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.400 
background I'll make the background
layer<00:02:43.660> active<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:48.040> then<00:02:48.280> do<00:02:48.569> ctrl<00:02:49.569> J<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:49.959> copy

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
layer active and then do ctrl J to copy

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.509 
layer active and then do ctrl J to copy
it<00:02:50.620> but<00:02:51.310> it'll<00:02:51.579> only<00:02:51.670> copy<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.570> stars<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:54.370> if<00:02:54.430> I

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
it but it'll only copy the stars so if I

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.039 
it but it'll only copy the stars so if I
do<00:02:54.579> ctrl<00:02:55.090> J<00:02:55.390> now<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:58.299> can<00:02:58.450> see<00:02:58.630> from<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.870> box

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
do ctrl J now you can see from the box

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.550 
do ctrl J now you can see from the box
there<00:02:59.290> there's<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:01.120> original<00:03:01.660> picture<00:03:02.350> from

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
there there's the original picture from

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.470 
there there's the original picture from
below<00:03:02.859> isn't<00:03:03.070> in<00:03:03.310> there<00:03:03.519> but<00:03:03.730> in<00:03:04.120> fact<00:03:04.299> it

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
below isn't in there but in fact it

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.470 
below isn't in there but in fact it
looks<00:03:04.630> as<00:03:04.750> if<00:03:04.870> it's<00:03:05.019> totally<00:03:05.380> empty

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
looks as if it's totally empty

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.280 
looks as if it's totally empty
we'll<00:03:07.480> have<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.630> look<00:03:07.780> at<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.019> in<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.200> minute

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
we'll have a look at that in a minute

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.090 
we'll have a look at that in a minute
the<00:03:08.620> top<00:03:09.340> layer<00:03:10.170> I'm<00:03:11.170> making<00:03:11.440> out<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.680> I'm

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
the top layer I'm making out to I'm

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.949 
the top layer I'm making out to I'm
finished<00:03:12.459> with<00:03:12.519> now<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.150> can<00:03:13.510> just<00:03:13.630> put<00:03:13.840> it

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
finished with now so I can just put it

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.259 
finished with now so I can just put it
into<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.350> rubbish<00:03:14.590> bin<00:03:14.799> just<00:03:15.609> by<00:03:15.730> clicking<00:03:16.060> on

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
into the rubbish bin just by clicking on

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.000 
into the rubbish bin just by clicking on
it<00:03:16.329> and<00:03:16.480> picking<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:16.900> up<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.380> dragging<00:03:17.890> it

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
it and picking it up and dragging it

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.280 
it and picking it up and dragging it
down<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.430> rubbish<00:03:18.579> bin<00:03:18.850> there<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:20.109> that's

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
down to the rubbish bin there and that's

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.430 
down to the rubbish bin there and that's
gone<00:03:21.329> right<00:03:22.329> for<00:03:22.390> where<00:03:22.720> we<00:03:22.840> are<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.200> looks

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
gone right for where we are that looks

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.099 
gone right for where we are that looks
just<00:03:23.829> as<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.250> was<00:03:24.430> before<00:03:24.670> but<00:03:25.180> if<00:03:25.299> I<00:03:25.450> make<00:03:25.900> the

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
just as it was before but if I make the

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.280 
just as it was before but if I make the
bottom<00:03:26.380> layer<00:03:26.410> invisible<00:03:28.079> it's<00:03:29.079> very

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
bottom layer invisible it's very

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.479 
bottom layer invisible it's very
difficult<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.739> see<00:03:29.890> what's<00:03:30.070> going<00:03:30.340> on<00:03:30.430> here

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
difficult to see what's going on here

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.940 
difficult to see what's going on here
but<00:03:30.910> we've<00:03:31.570> now<00:03:31.750> got<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.109> Stars<00:03:32.380> but<00:03:32.650> because

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
but we've now got the Stars but because

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.990 
but we've now got the Stars but because
they're<00:03:33.130> white<00:03:33.370> on<00:03:33.549> a<00:03:33.579> white<00:03:33.670> background

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
they're white on a white background

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.920 
they're white on a white background
they're<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.840> bit<00:03:35.350> of<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.650> job<00:03:35.859> just<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.519> see<00:03:36.930> but

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
they're a bit of a job just to see but

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.430 
they're a bit of a job just to see but
that's<00:03:38.380> what<00:03:38.620> happened<00:03:38.950> anyway<00:03:40.200> right<00:03:41.200> what

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
that's what happened anyway right what

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.340 
that's what happened anyway right what
we<00:03:41.530> do<00:03:41.680> now<00:03:42.010> is<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.250> normal<00:03:42.760> high<00:03:43.630> pass<00:03:43.930> filter

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
we do now is the normal high pass filter

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.520 
we do now is the normal high pass filter
stuff<00:03:44.560> on<00:03:44.799> this<00:03:45.010> bottom<00:03:45.910> one<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.410> make<00:03:47.410> the

stuff on this bottom one so make the
bottom<00:03:47.769> one<00:03:47.859> active<00:03:48.220> I<00:03:48.600> have<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.720> copy<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.049> ctrl

bottom one active I have to copy it ctrl

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.920 
bottom one active I have to copy it ctrl
J

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930

filter other high pass set the slider
wherever<00:04:02.610> we<00:04:02.880> want<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:07.670> I'm<00:04:08.670> removing<00:04:09.210> it

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
wherever we want it I'm removing it

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.240 
wherever we want it I'm removing it
there<00:04:09.780> we<00:04:09.930> are<00:04:11.180> that's<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.300> bit<00:04:12.420> too<00:04:12.630> far

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.789 

maybe<00:04:16.880> something<00:04:17.239> about<00:04:17.269> five<00:04:17.690> six<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.470> you

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
maybe something about five six and you

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.410 
maybe something about five six and you
know<00:04:18.890> just<00:04:19.190> again<00:04:19.610> this<00:04:19.880> is<00:04:20.060> something<00:04:20.329> you

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
know just again this is something you

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.910 
know just again this is something you
can<00:04:20.600> experiment<00:04:20.959> with<00:04:23.560> I'll<00:04:24.560> leave<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.890> there

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
can experiment with I'll leave it there

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.710 
can experiment with I'll leave it there
for<00:04:25.280> now<00:04:25.310> and<00:04:26.150> say<00:04:26.420> okay<00:04:28.180> change<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.480> blend

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
for now and say okay change the blend

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.240 
for now and say okay change the blend
mode<00:04:30.140> to<00:04:30.590> overlay

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
mode to overlay

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.300 
mode to overlay
and<00:04:34.630> basically<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.840> jobs<00:04:36.050> done<00:04:36.350> and<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:37.250> know

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
and basically the jobs done and you know

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.760 
and basically the jobs done and you know
you<00:04:37.580> may<00:04:37.730> notice<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.390> stars<00:04:38.660> are<00:04:38.840> this

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
you may notice that the stars are this

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.930 
you may notice that the stars are this
time<00:04:40.040> no<00:04:40.340> longer<00:04:40.930> like<00:04:41.930> white<00:04:42.200> blobs<00:04:42.590> of<00:04:42.740> paint

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
time no longer like white blobs of paint

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.320 
time no longer like white blobs of paint
if<00:04:43.940> I<00:04:44.180> make<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.140> top<00:04:45.290> layer<00:04:45.350> hidden<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:47.150> can

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
if I make the top layer hidden you can

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.460 
if I make the top layer hidden you can
see<00:04:47.510> what<00:04:48.050> it's<00:04:48.200> done<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.590> stars<00:04:50.470> all

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
see what it's done to the stars all

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.060 
see what it's done to the stars all
right<00:04:51.590> so<00:04:51.920> there's<00:04:52.240> without<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.800> star<00:04:54.800> mask

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
right so there's without the star mask

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.520 
right so there's without the star mask
the<00:04:55.730> stars<00:04:56.030> are<00:04:56.270> like<00:04:56.420> blobs<00:04:56.660> of<00:04:56.840> paint<00:04:57.020> and

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
the stars are like blobs of paint and
