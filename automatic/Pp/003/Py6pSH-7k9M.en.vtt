started<00:01:17.890> okay<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:20.270> very<00:01:20.299> first<00:01:20.869> thing<00:01:21.050> you

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
started okay so the very first thing you

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:22.480 
started okay so the very first thing you
need<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.409> know<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:21.679> obviously<00:01:21.830> this<00:01:22.159> song<00:01:22.340> is

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
need to know is obviously this song is

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.690 
need to know is obviously this song is
in<00:01:22.610> drop<00:01:22.850> D<00:01:22.880> tuning

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.700 

so<00:01:27.700> once<00:01:27.940> you<00:01:28.060> bring<00:01:28.240> this<00:01:28.390> LOI<00:01:28.660> down<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.350> addy

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
so once you bring this LOI down to addy

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.070 
so once you bring this LOI down to addy
you're<00:01:30.640> all<00:01:30.760> set<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.000> go

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
you're all set to go

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.660 
you're all set to go
I<00:01:32.110> know<00:01:32.530> another<00:01:32.770> thing<00:01:32.980> is<00:01:33.100> I'm<00:01:33.310> not<00:01:33.460> going<00:01:33.580> to

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
I know another thing is I'm not going to

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.130 
I know another thing is I'm not going to
get<00:01:33.760> too<00:01:33.940> heavy<00:01:34.150> into<00:01:34.330> where<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:34.840> Fred

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
get too heavy into where the Fred

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.110 
get too heavy into where the Fred
numbering<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:35.710> for<00:01:36.520> your<00:01:36.610> fingers<00:01:36.910> because

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
numbering is for your fingers because

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.090 
numbering is for your fingers because
somewhere<00:01:38.020> in<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.170> description<00:01:38.650> I<00:01:38.830> have<00:01:38.860> a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
somewhere in the description I have a

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.250 
somewhere in the description I have a
link<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.670> my<00:01:39.790> website<00:01:39.940> where<00:01:40.480> I<00:01:40.540> have<00:01:40.810> the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
link to my website where I have the

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.160 
link to my website where I have the
tablature<00:01:41.560> posted<00:01:42.010> so<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:43.450> first<00:01:43.660> part<00:01:43.870> of

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
tablature posted so the first part of

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.720 
tablature posted so the first part of
this<00:01:44.650> harmonic<00:01:45.450> section<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:47.580> knowing<00:01:48.580> where

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
this harmonic section is knowing where

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.750 
this harmonic section is knowing where
the<00:01:48.790> harmonics<00:01:49.240> are<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:49.930> there's<00:01:50.890> four<00:01:51.430> sets

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
the harmonics are so there's four sets

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.270 
the harmonics are so there's four sets
of<00:01:51.880> harmonics<00:01:52.300> one<00:01:52.480> at<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.690> twelfth<00:01:53.050> fret

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
of harmonics one at the twelfth fret

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.340 
of harmonics one at the twelfth fret
two<00:01:54.280> at<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.640> seventh<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.210> one<00:01:55.870> at<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.110> fifth

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
two at the seventh and one at the fifth

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.060 
two at the seventh and one at the fifth
and<00:01:56.590> knowing<00:01:57.520> how<00:01:57.700> they're<00:01:57.880> played<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:59.410> first

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
and knowing how they're played the first

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.920 
and knowing how they're played the first
time<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.490> play<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.910> first<00:02:01.119> set<00:02:01.390> it's<00:02:01.630> with<00:02:01.810> an

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
time you play the first set it's with an

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.730 
time you play the first set it's with an
upstroke<00:02:02.380> kind<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:02.890> like<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.040> rake<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:07.740> then

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
upstroke kind of like a rake that then

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.280 
upstroke kind of like a rake that then
the<00:02:09.010> on<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.310> seventh<00:02:09.700> fret<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.390> second<00:02:11.140> set

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
the on the seventh fret the second set

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.760 
the on the seventh fret the second set
is<00:02:11.410> played<00:02:11.590> with<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.800> full<00:02:12.070> on<00:02:12.250> down<00:02:12.580> stroke

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
is played with a full on down stroke

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.830 
is played with a full on down stroke
hitting<00:02:14.770> off<00:02:14.980> all<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.670> harmonics<00:02:16.660> at<00:02:16.750> the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
hitting off all the harmonics at the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.900 
hitting off all the harmonics at the
same<00:02:17.050> time<00:02:18.870> then<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.020> third<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.440> another

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
same time then the third is another

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.360 
same time then the third is another
upstroke<00:02:21.910> here<00:02:22.480> on<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.690> seventh<00:02:22.959> fret<00:02:23.110> again

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.460 

and<00:02:27.370> then<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.880> last<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> Down<00:02:28.840> stroke<00:02:29.200> on

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
and then the last is a Down stroke on

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:47.040 
and then the last is a Down stroke on
the<00:02:29.830> fifth<00:02:30.100> right<00:02:45.180> okay<00:02:46.180> moving<00:02:46.510> on<00:02:46.630> starting

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
the fifth right okay moving on starting

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:59.010 
the fifth right okay moving on starting
with<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.459> ninth<00:02:48.459> fret<00:02:48.670> here<00:02:49.000> on<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.390> string

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.870 

this<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.710> kind<00:02:59.890> of<00:02:59.920> how<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.040> practiced<00:03:00.550> it<00:03:00.670> real

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
this is kind of how I practiced it real

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:26.339 
this is kind of how I practiced it real
slow<00:03:01.030> each<00:03:01.660> part<00:03:02.020> separately<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.840> next<00:03:05.080> part

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:04:05.089 

then<00:03:27.349> under<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.620> third<00:03:27.859> one

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.350 

okay<00:04:06.099> for<00:04:06.280> this<00:04:06.340> opening<00:04:06.730> here<00:04:06.879> hammering<00:04:07.299> on

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
okay for this opening here hammering on

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:32.430 
okay for this opening here hammering on
to<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.629> fifth<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:07.989> seventh<00:04:08.290> fret

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.399 

you

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.409 
you

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:38.820 
you
you

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.050 

then<00:04:39.830> on<00:04:39.950> to<00:04:40.070> like<00:04:40.190> this<00:04:40.340> bridge<00:04:40.580> part<00:04:40.820> here<00:04:41.000> it

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
then on to like this bridge part here it
