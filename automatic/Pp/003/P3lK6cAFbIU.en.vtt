00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
one cut the steel wire into 2-inch

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.229 
one cut the steel wire into 2-inch
pieces<00:00:46.010> what<00:00:47.010> how<00:00:47.309> do<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.000> go<00:00:48.210> like

your little spiral thing going on and
then<00:01:11.159> put<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.090> little<00:01:12.270> spiral<00:01:12.659> thing<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.990> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
then put the little spiral thing and you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.620 
then put the little spiral thing and you
pinch<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:14.210> said<00:01:15.210> everybody

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
pinch it like that said everybody

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.200 
pinch it like that said everybody
supposed<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.560> right<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.210> nobody

supposed to get right and see it nobody
not<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:20.119> let's<00:01:21.119> go<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.509> loop

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
not like this let's go a little loop

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:30.080 
not like this let's go a little loop
then<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:24.540> take<00:01:27.020> another<00:01:28.020> censored<00:01:28.740> video<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
then you take another censored video and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.810 
then you take another censored video and
then<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.479> take<00:01:30.659> another<00:01:31.079> piece<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.130> you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
then you take another piece and you

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.520 
then you take another piece and you
pinch<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.420> at<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> bottom<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:34.409> you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
pinch it just at the bottom and then you

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.690 
pinch it just at the bottom and then you
twirl<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.009> there's<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.280> little<00:01:38.549> loop

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
twirl it so that there's a little loop

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.380 
twirl it so that there's a little loop
at<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.000> bottom<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:40.280> then<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> easy

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
at the bottom and then this is the easy

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.050 
at the bottom and then this is the easy
part<00:01:42.540> take<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> last<00:01:43.649> piece<00:01:44.040> grip<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.549> right<00:01:44.909> in

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
part take a last piece grip it right in

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.649 
part take a last piece grip it right in
the<00:01:45.149> middle<00:01:45.360> then<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.649> bend<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.590 

insane<00:01:51.659> you've<00:01:51.810> got<00:01:52.040> okay<00:01:53.149> then<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.450> got

going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.369> with<00:01:56.490> them<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.509> make<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> bead

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
going to do with them you make a bead

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.820 
going to do with them you make a bead
person<00:02:00.170> put<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.350> overcomes

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
person put this overcomes

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
okay now you pick a bead preferably a

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.590 
okay now you pick a bead preferably a
big<00:02:08.240> one<00:02:08.590> kinda<00:02:09.590> like<00:02:09.649> this<00:02:09.860> maybe<00:02:10.430> I<00:02:10.729> don't

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
big one kinda like this maybe I don't

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.030 
big one kinda like this maybe I don't
know<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:12.020> can<00:02:12.230> look<00:02:12.350> anything<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.860> want

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
museum then you thrill throat that's it

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.220 
museum then you thrill throat that's it
then<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:16.910> thread<00:02:17.240> it<00:02:17.270> through<00:02:19.390> mm<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:21.220> then

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
then you thread it through mm and then

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.090 
then you thread it through mm and then
okay<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.470> then<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:26.240> pick<00:02:26.630> another<00:02:27.100> smaller

okay and then you pick another smaller

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.130 
okay and then you pick another smaller
bead<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:29.740> thread<00:02:30.740> that<00:02:30.890> one<00:02:31.070> through<00:02:31.220> oh<00:02:32.140> and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
bead you thread that one through oh and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.470 
bead you thread that one through oh and
then<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.470> can<00:02:33.620> keep<00:02:33.770> threading<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.970> then<00:02:35.210> you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
then you can keep threading and then you

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.300 
then you can keep threading and then you
can<00:02:35.660> have<00:02:35.840> two<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.440> one<00:02:37.250> two<00:02:37.490> three<00:02:37.790> beads<00:02:38.090> on

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
can have two to one two three beads on

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.400 
can have two to one two three beads on
before<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:41.300> then<00:02:41.959> when<00:02:42.110> you've<00:02:42.230> got<00:02:42.350> that

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
before and then when you've got that

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
stepped-on take the little these take

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.360 
stepped-on take the little these take
the<00:02:46.220> one<00:02:46.370> with<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.550> loop<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.890> center<00:02:49.220> and

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
the one with the loop in the center and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.170 
the one with the loop in the center and
then<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.990> thread<00:02:51.320> it<00:02:51.350> through<00:02:51.670> like<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.910> and

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
then you thread it through like that and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.350 
then you thread it through like that and
that<00:02:53.660> will<00:02:53.780> be<00:02:53.870> your<00:02:53.900> arms<00:02:54.640> then<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:55.820> take<00:02:56.060> a

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
that will be your arms then you take a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.699 
that will be your arms then you take a
tiny<00:02:56.930> bead<00:02:58.900> like<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.610> ya<00:03:01.840> know<00:03:02.840> whatever

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
tiny bead like this ya know whatever

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.720 
tiny bead like this ya know whatever

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
you just throw it on deep you can get a

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.090 
you just throw it on deep you can get a
matching<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.870> doesn't<00:03:54.230> have<00:03:54.320> to<00:03:54.440> match<00:03:54.650> and

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
matching and doesn't have to match and
