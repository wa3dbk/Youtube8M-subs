 for 4000 rubles someone 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:43.379
 Well, I think this is really a bust 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.079
 yes that is, well, a ball of thread there is a hank 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.620
 it costs 300 rubles there 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.640
 means generally what you want from the beginning 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.469
 say girls yes here's this step yet 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.780

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.449

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.329
 buy pompons fur so here 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.760

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.119
 what i want to say girls mean 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.460
 in general, I recommend you very much 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:17.130
 now learn to really read the schematics 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.220
 descriptions how to knit that is but why yes 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.320
 because well, that's what they are doing in huge 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.640
 the number of different magazines electronic 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.729
 applications yes there publish and that's it 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.079
 real business is bought and sold 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.570
 hire professional people 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.180
 knitters who all count under 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.960
 each size for each drawing all 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.600
 great detail tell you here I 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.110
 I'll show you a little later how to read diagrams yes 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.970
 but that's really straight here with what very 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.180
 a lot of everything free on the Internet 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.090
 free schemes just download yourself and 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:59.039
 knit with detailed descriptions 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.049
 so well here in my opinion here I am not 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.560
 bother about it myself 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.869
 accounting calculate there is some drawing 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.660
 but here a little bit changed 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.549
 American scheme that's just changed 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.349
 not necessarily full of English at home 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.629
 a lot of things are real in Russian 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.209
 the language is very good well, just sit 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.459
 real professional she is not 3 this them 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.629
 business is their job not receive salaries 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.090
 what is the right thing to calculate 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.450
 so do not be lazy really learn 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.190
 read is not so difficult it but I tell you too 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.440
 Iâ€™m not going to tell everything here 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.130
 I'll tell you the principle I will not be together with 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.260
 you knit this hat so well, just 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.150
 I'm real and there is no time, it is very 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.519
 for a long time then otherwise see what's up with this 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.230
 a cap means several lessons 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.280
 I'll tell you what, well, just not for a month 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.470
 all in one means that with this hat 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.810
 It means the first but what is not like me in 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.819
 what kind of threads did I knit her mean well 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.700
 Understandable. I love all pure wool. 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.660
 natural means here I needed 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.190
 gradient well, that's how I wanted 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.030
 it means therefore I needed to take 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.739
 thin strings so I took it siam in 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.530
 instagramme look exactly wrote 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.989
 something now these kids are gone 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.359
 it means it is very long m 400 meters 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.389
 There is a hat connected generally practically 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:24.510
 no knots yes here you see none 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.709
 language is just adding strings yet 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.329
 took nothing just thats real 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.639
 just just knitted just exactly already 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:39.599
 asked therefore here I show now it means 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:41.250
 I took these strings as far as they are 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.319
 very very thin this is real 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.970
 there for a circle is there I do not know of such 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:53.819
 fine things here I took 6 rooms 6 not 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:56.819
 so here I have 6 6 such balls to 6 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.690
 there are six of them, but I divided them 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.750
 Of course, yes, well, 6 is not so 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:10.090
 six threads and i knit 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:13.510
 I knit it out of this yarn so two 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:18.669
 pair of knitting needles means because the rubber band and 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.690
 we knit the top of the head into smaller more 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.139
 fine knitting needles 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.680
 then I was knitting on spokes with three 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.419
 half a millimeter no for yes three with 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.600
 half a millimeter this is the main 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:38.169
 part and three millimeters and this is gum 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:45.100
 and the top here means at first I knit 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:48.040
 clear here below we collect and the knit of 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.630
 circle show how to connect 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.040
 well, in principle, look in a circle 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.729
 Internet is full of all it is poured 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.729
 elementary try to connect means 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.970
 that's such a rubber band 2 on your said 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.070
 that I love her very much this gum here 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.990
 so I wanted what was with the top well 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:16.889
 so I love hats with a lapel so here 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:20.820
 mean this gum I knit 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:24.820
 3 mm knitting needles further I 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:30.039
 moved to the main part and I knitted it 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:32.680
 at 4 millimeters that's gum and 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:38.530
 see her a lot here because i love 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:40.900
 big lapel like this next part 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.460
 I will tell accordingly how many loops and 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.460
 about decreasing while
