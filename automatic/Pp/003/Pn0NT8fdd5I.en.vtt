00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.059
 hello people that as you are today romei 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.980
 today I bring you another episode of deaths 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.289
 epics that would be so much like in my 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.270
 channel that are low clips according to 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.520
 you work chains of casualties of all those 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.160
 nonsense that you get out of yes 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.350
 this time it's that I get out to remind you that 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.940
 you can send me all your clips 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.950
 all our chains of casualties and 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.599
 will come in the next epic deaths 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.399
 say I'm going to make a top three 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.710
 This is going to be the last time I'm going to 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.270
 upload a single click on an epic death and 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.860
 because good and begins to see more 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.140
 people my channel and I guess I'll have more 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.179
 clips and I can put more things I 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.339
 I recommend the following if you have a 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:49.819
 clip upload it to youtube only the chub 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:52.909
 of the clip and send me the tray of 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:54.559
 Youtube entry with the deaths issue 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.800
 epics or leave in the description too 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.970
 put an annotation why 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.270
 you can not send the mail but it's good 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.430
 the last option is worth we will give way to 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.530
 the ultra low that I like as you go to 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.030
 see is a pretty good clip 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.920
 I thought I had made the chain 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.040
 of low the ultra low you already know that they are 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.390
 eight quick casualties is a pass and I the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.580
 true that the low chains cost me 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.590
 very much to get me out I think I have 23 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.630
 in everything that I 'm white in case I'm 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.130
 a fucking manco I can not and what I play 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.900
 very much the look so always in 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.840
 starting bonus when points 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.670
 double events not so but it is impossible 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.920
 that may already be because the war game 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.539
 terrestrial or anything so nothing 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.130
 I hope you liked that you send me 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.930
 all our customers this video what 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.580
 I do just to collect clips and 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.200
 so you can see what is more or less 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.820
 this series for all the new ones so 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.289
 Nothing I hope you liked us 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.899

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.899
