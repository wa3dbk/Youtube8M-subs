00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.599
 Welcome to the Volkswagen 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.290
 wittstock to conclude this season 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.020
 Niclas Fuellkrug sits next to me over the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.160
 I am especially happy 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.980
 why that is so we will tell later 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.730
 Do not start your analysis today 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.849
 this game how does it fall out yes me 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.369
 think that this is not a good game of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.960
 Both teams had the game 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.030
 also from the outside I have it from the outside 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.640
 seen 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.910
 Unfortunately, it was not nice 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.440
 Watch the game beautifully 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.430
 I think it was hard for both of them 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.140
 teams and I think it's a 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.969
 typical draw game it has 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.210
 Much has happened to the field a lot 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.530
 too many mishaps and janko but it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.800
 did not even get that one anymore 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.989
 the bad passes could exploit a lot 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.879
 we even have two or three times 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.550
 played well forward but after 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.989
 in the back then also two situations where we 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.360
 One came to a stop where we went once 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.680
 also get the goat and that is allowed 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.409
 us at the 0 0 stand 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.790
 I do not know 60 and 70 minute that was 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.260
 I do not think so 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.990
 happen that we went one behind 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.189
 after which we will come soon 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.830
 back but I am very happy that one 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.509
 old werderaner here is peter niemeyer 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.830
 the captain of hertha bsc with his 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.009
 Mrs. Peter welcome times 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.780
 Congrats first thing union 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.189
 wins tomorrow even though that is the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.420
 not hertha partners so so much for 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.040
 but your table guide remains beautiful 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.979
 that again put weser back to 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.180
 to the niklas there you sit outside 90 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.090
 minutes is a striker and of course wants 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.979
 In and wants to make the bude there was a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.159
 little frost today with you yes 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.479
 of course the last season game and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.520
 of course you want the season beautiful 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.890
 but also if that is 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.270
 last would have been 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.280
 of course you always want to come in and 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.509
 show something again and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.799
 there team continue to try 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.540
 yes you are so that's you 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.640
 Originally from Hannover to 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.200
 grown up 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.580
 among others the sports friends 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.870
 Ricky, I have too 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.159
 played football so far 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.039
 I always do your way a bit 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.040
 niklas is watching the balance sheet 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.540
 now after this I may say that 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.550
 first real pro season 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.260
 werder 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.870
 yes i am now one year in the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.510
 bundesliga here when I'm in Belek 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.310
 I pushed this and I think that me 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.069
 I think I have 24 games now 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.620
 i made or 23 and i think that 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.200
 it is quite neat that he is up 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.650
 every case has to come more and that 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.959
 so should not go on like it 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.010
 so far it's all very well and nice 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.540
 and you can be satisfied but there 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.630
 something has to come in any case 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.519
 in the substitutions so what come 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.410
 not only does that mean you play more 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.390
 you want to get ahead now 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.880
 Profi always wants to play but me 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.350
 think also to gates you already have that 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.269
 one or the other made what was that 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.709
 most important so far the most beautiful for you 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:09.530
 here at Werder professional squad yes that went 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.900
 Definitely the first Bundesliga goal 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.720
 even the most beautiful feeling is bitter that 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.430
 We learn at the end of 1 1 and otherwise yes 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.500
 the dfb cup goal was actually still 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.950
 pretty important to the 2 1 but there must 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.590
 Nevertheless, unfortunately, then spoiled 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.600
 the perspective of niclas filling jug 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.030
 werder bremen 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.700
 what will she look like what is there 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.959
 great wish to become a tribal player 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.060
 to be introduced slowly 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.650
 How is it if you choose it 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.000
 could go on like this for so 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.290
 Of course, tribe players will also be 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.700
 at the right time, I the 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.799
 Of course, then 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.870
 I'm 100% ready for that 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:52.070
 believe that the trainer with me completely 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.480
 can judge good and he is me 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.500
 then tell me and then he will me 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.950
 Show that too when I do 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.209
 one hundred percent ready yes and that 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.310
 That's the goal I'm here for the first time 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.690
 So tribesman will be in next 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.459
 future, maybe I can do that 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.760
 this season still that would be on everyone 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.500
 fall my goal before this season 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.340
 and let's see if that works like that 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.010
 I hope it was you, I told you so 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.380
 i focus on several federal clubs 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.580
 know that also a bundesliga club 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.840
 Hanover was interested 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.220
 why the decision for werder at that time 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.230
 yes, I already knew that 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.760
 to emergency traffic but in the end it was 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.600
 so that who still is still 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.430
 tried four and yes there I am 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.230
 just felt that I'm not a player 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.700
 but for the next season I'm alone 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.290
 that they really have what they want me to do 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.970
 that they viewed potential 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.830
 so that was combined with the other 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.560
 not so except gladbach has that 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.390
 still quite so but who did that I found 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.480
 always a nice club good 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.790
 So I agree with everything here 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.570
 pretty family and that's why I have 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.390
 then I decided for Werder 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.000
 Well, I think that's pretty good, too 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.860
 was a good decision than when 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.260
 child and as a teenager there was that 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.210
 football idol with you gave such a player 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.830
 where you said so want one 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.100
 Grandma will give you one 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.810
 Oriented did not orientate now 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.660
 but of course there was someone I already knew 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.700
 always well it was didier drogba 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.010
 Didier drogba among those I already found 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.340
 always good then there is also still 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.740
 who now plays in china chelsea london 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.330
 has left and certainly immortal 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.600
 made finale at the champions league 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.950
 against bayern munich unforgotten 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.270
 Thank you for your conversation 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.220
 but you still have to stay here because they are 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.890
 all my ladies and gentlemen have with yes 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.260
 played in the sweepstakes and I know 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.060
 this may even be one today 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.370
 jersey can be won the class 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.900
 Just pull some for now 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.780
 not only have the result right 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.410
 typed but also the scorers 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:57.530
 namely nils petersen 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:59.810
 so one to one is right and that 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.960
 first goal is unfortunately wrong typed 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:07.510
 the tip is ernhard and won 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:12.230
 In this case Silvaner gloves 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.490
 osterholz scharmbeck she is here if 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.650
 she is here then she gets the price 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.990
 equal presented says that again 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.450
 silvana gloves made of osterholz 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.210
 Scharmbeck who is not there then will 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.080
 the price as always delivered niklas 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.940
 Of course, it still stands for 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.730
 autographs an available the 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.800
