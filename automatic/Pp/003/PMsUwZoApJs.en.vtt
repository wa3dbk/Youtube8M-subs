00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hello everyone today, I will tell you 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.870
 the terrible secret of all smartphones cameras about 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.540
 than silent manufacturers 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.090
 and how marketers also cheat us 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.530
 touch the subject of camera phones as a phenomenon and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.839
 in the end I will even take on the role 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.430
 predictor when you talk about the camera in 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.100
 It is very difficult for a smartphone to be objective 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.869
 since both the quality of the pictures and the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.029
 the fact of having a wise camera in the smartphone 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 this is a purely personal matter of each and every 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.349
 man forms his opinion about the camera in 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.390
 smartphone exclusively from their needs 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.369
 I personally like cameras in a smartphone or 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.170
 the tablet's pretty cool so 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.090
 as in the first I have a SLR and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.809
 soap dish to record video 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.760
 and take a photo 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.730
 and secondly shoot something on a smartphone 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.110
 Especially on the tablet personally, I think 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.149
 mockery of the subject in 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.950
 the first is to start with what is 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.050
 general camera in the smartphone if 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
 consider its device in more detail then 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.800
 you can understand that no little 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.199
 little men quickly drawing pictures 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.050
 inside there is not installed there instead 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.270
 the module is usually by virtue of its structure 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.210
 such a wide square glued to the dress 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.949
 magic soldering in the case of an ordinary backgrounds china 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.570
 double-sided tape module in this 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.880
 case connects with internals 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.189
 smartphone or tablet with a bodice of wires 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.659
 to transfer the image processor itself 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.580
 the image is formed pretty 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.650
 the primitive principle is exactly the same 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.780
 very like in ordinary cameras and that is 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.850
 the light enters the eye of the camera and passes 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.290
 through the lens then if there is a smartphone 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.360
 optical stabilization then he 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.340
 stabilizes then focuses on 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.439
 matrix it in turn converts 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.210
 light into electrical impulses and transmit 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.189
 information to the processor which this 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.130
 information processes and places in 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.320
 memory operational constant and displays 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.450
 on the screen and all this in a split second 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.549
 Of course everything is much more complicated than I wrote 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.350
 but for an explanation of two words and this 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.670
 come down before going to talk 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.040
 about megapixels and other interesting 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.649
 words say kosher are considered 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.030
 cameras with autofocus and flash 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.890
 autofocus is such a system allowing 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.180
 no dancing with a tambourine and complicated calculations 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.820
 sharpen the lens on 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.240
 the object being photographed and flash is 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.890
 flash and for 95 percent of people she 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.619
 used as a flashlight now 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.719
 go to the most basic how to choose 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.879
 a smartphone with a good camera that generally 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.530
 considered a good camera and why in 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.720
 first thing they usually look at 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.150
 people when choosing a camera phone this of course 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.700
 same to us 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.890
 And pixels are more correct on their number and in vain 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.319
 of course I will not argue with what 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.540
 more megapixels are better but not 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.489
 less this is not the main parameter because 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.769
 when in the top level mirrors 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.049
 rarely cameras with more than 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.790
 fifteen 18 megapixels 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.620
 in fact, their number of answer 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.689
 just for the resolution of the original photo and 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.700
 shows what resolution has 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.890
 the sensor, that is, if we have a smartphone 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.390
 8 megapixel camera installed 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.670
 This means that the maximum size 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.980
 photos without interpolation stretching 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.900
 will be 3264 by 2448 points if 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.239
 multiply these numbers then we get the number 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.280
 close to eight million pixels then 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.200
 have to 8 megapixels 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.659
 but if you compare photos with 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.909
 8 megapixel camera for example 6 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.470
 iphone and 20 megapixel cabernet 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.870
 famous chinese brand then on 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.819
 iphone snapshots get much better and 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.420
 it's not just tricky Chinese that is to blame 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.459
 craftsmen 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.409
 and marketing megapixels but a whole 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.900
 a number of other reasons like generation 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.480
 sensor its size photosensitivity 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.430
 optics and even software so don’t choose 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.230
 megapixel camera 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.359
 would certainly recommend a look at 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.680
 dimensions of sensor generation but usually this 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.470
 information in the technical specifications 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.629
 there is no smartphone therefore it is better to look at 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.299
 luminosity which is also called aperture 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:34.750
 it is indicated by the letter f and tsiferki 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.639
 like 322 and 620 and so on and here than 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.799
 the lower the better 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:41.079
 if the camera has an optical 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.419
 stabilization it is already very cool 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.209
 then how often do we take down from hand 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.220
 hands tend to shake and blur 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.690
 pictures digital stabilization of course 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.519
 also not bad but for its implementation 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.780
 software algorithms are used 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.729
 which are written Krivorukov 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.440
 manufacturers how it got it all 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:58.959
 undoubtedly concerns not only the main 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.609
 cameras but also the front which value 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.650
 quite difficult to overestimate our 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.720
 Difficult time sat down social networks to kofy 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.510
 yourself different with elves and other 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.970
 evil slyly yellow chinese 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.430
 manufacturers in secret tone wander trends 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.680
 and for several years they have been slapping l siphons 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.659
 with a bang maybe all the fault and mysterious 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.479
 Asian soul and their mentality 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:21.400
 consumer but the fact remains 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.389
 such phenomena as their turning 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.969
 cameras for selfie 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.790
 children pax due to the one with 13 megapixel 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:28.550
 cameras of 2 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.710
 the throne has become the norm and that just does not 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.420
 come up with craftsmen from heaven to 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.910
 lure a demanding customer into 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.280
 their camera networks with camera sensors with 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.680
 voice- activated cameras even 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.820
 six cameras in one smartphone if you don’t 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.220
 want to understand all this 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.620
 diversity and want to just take 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.780
 normal phone with a normal camera 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.880
 remove the best known device 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.540
 manufacturer with optics from sony with 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.120
 samsung 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.400
 or carl zeiss if the last two in 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.890
 china backgrounds are very rare then 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.350
 Sensors from sony quite often and not 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.870
 the cameras are really good and 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.280
 quality but apart from quality 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.530
 cameras have another important 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.350
 parameter that directly determines 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.450
 The quality of the original images is software and 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.620
 Now I will try to explain why I am 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.810
 said it is better to take 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.730
 well-known manufacturer well yes I will take on 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.740
 yourself the role of the captain is obvious very 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.840
 it often happens that as soon as a smartphone 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.670
 the quality of his pictures goes on the market 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.350
 leaves much to be desired but then with 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.780
 subsequent firmware updates 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.670
 quality is improving. 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.500
 famous brands update your device 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.410
 not so that it can affect 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.380
 quality of your photos because everything is available 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:39.020
 modes like white balance hdr corrections 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.120
 panorama colors and other directly depends 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.250
 on the quality of the software responsible for 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.690
 processing and creating photos 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.850
 of course you can install from the store 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.560
 third-party camera apps fix 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.570
 situation or just download 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.970
 instagram and just overlay vintage 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.040
 filters but this is a completely different more 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.980
 sad story probably the same 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.100
 sad as the story of the Chinese and 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.440
 interpolation 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.300
 broadly understood interpolation is 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.580
 stretching the image by 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.950
 special mathematical algorithms but 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.390
 in the understanding of Chinese interpolation is 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.910
 when the smartphone is installed 8 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.640
 megapixel camera capable of doing 13 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.880
 or even 18 megapixel photos 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.530
 Of course, this also affects quality. 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.810
 photos for the worse and done 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.520
 it is solely for marketing purposes 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.620
 but at least in the characteristics they are usually 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.240
 write about interpolation a few words say about 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.790
 the video is not only those 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.710
 do selfi so fotkayut but take off 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.950
 crash or even use a smartphone 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.690
 as 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.520
 avtoregistrator so what to hide 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.530
 many smartphones may well 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.090
 compete with budget soap cases and 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.250
 here in an important parameter 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.740
 is not only the camera itself though she 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.840
 and it matters how much the processor is in capacity 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.270
 which abut the capabilities of the camera 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.040
 for example theoretically whale river and video 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.440
 take off can even 8 megapixel camera 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.449
 but to do so to this 4-ki video 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.470
 maintained by hardware and was in 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:56.540
 good quality 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.970
 this is a processor concern as well 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.979
 frame rate smooth redrawing 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.720
 still a bunch of heap parameters as 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.639
 I’ll say that the Chinese camera is 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.590
 Chinese smartphones is one more 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.150
 random number generator because 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.860
 unscrupulous manufacturers can 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.050
 put one in the camera in software 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.090
 implement it in a different way write on 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.040
 box third with the seller with 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.720
 your hectic fantasies can at compose 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.760
 even some fourth option 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.530
 so when I choose one or another 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.080
 I recommend to watch the device first 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.210
 queue on and video reviews of interest 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.460
 you devices and ask in stores 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.470
 examples of photos and videos in the original 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.910
 I will not talk about the need for cameras 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.620
 and their meaning in the life of every person 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.210
 because in my opinion it is purely 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.669
 personal matter of each but also in quality 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.100
 analysts will probably say that before 

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:41.600
 near future cameras will be 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.460
 evolved new sensors will appear 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.200
 the quantity will also increase 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.120
 megapixels nevertheless the chinese are not 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.669
 stand still and many now 

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:53.120
 camera phones do quite good shots 

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:55.760
 and it is likely that soon smartphones 

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.039
 we will replace the usual soap box on this 

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.060
 all subscribe to the channel join
