00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.759
 Nils that he played last summer by action medeor GWD Minden leaving it in the 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.750
 Become summer junior world champion and served here and TBV Lemgo first league 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.730
 What is changing for you right now? 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.529
 yes, the percent snake 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.619
 significant change now also second Niasse Binya that's all 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.510
 a bit more professional and 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.579
 Of course, how much I still enjoy playing as a lecturer second here 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.579
 because you also know people watching videos on TV and everything under 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.500
 Until now she was having fun with her Rainer was really what he did 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.739
 eat something like his daily routine, I am my left rsn Moers clear first 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.769
 The final goal in the first league is really there again 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.109
 big difference seen everyday design will be there for you - 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.079
 already trained here twice a day 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.519
 but when it comes to here now 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.750
 but once again professionally I have to say 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.980
 Personally, I started training at the first 8 9 percent 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.740
 that now all so the double burden that I still have 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.189
 strict thing but so far i am taking the hat off and around 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.270
 for that too has positive to Zander 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.860
 So Genoa Halo Wars started and what are your goals 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:21.310
 there 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.280
 as an industrial clerk and percent 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.610
 Finish well for injured 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.250
 And now, as Forster has concrete goals, Rola is just the usual 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.450
 Plattigüden and even the types first offer pure grow 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.630
 So for me personally, he sneaked first that I'm with it 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.750
 now we are in the first league too which is very good games show when I am 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.460
 get my chance 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.230
 and as a club now or won as a team, of course, is one 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.140
 play good season and percent why descend 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.500
 Egloff very Paterson is my last one 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.950
 So neuntered Evernote the Bassumer was not the threesome new since 1902 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.399
 Schedule to take 16 year 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.130
 Europe Cup missed the world he now wants to force himself after the out of the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.530
 To become an association 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.440
 for pictures of her parody 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.640
 yes I think 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.929
 last year worldwide 6 so that Borussia year for 5 Elbe v 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.609
 Personally, I have only seen two games so now I can do that 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.269
 not so good judge though 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.109
 which certainly to a demand from us saw that we also against the 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:20.040
 Top teams can really keep up with at least 5 to 40 minutes then 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.839
 is still so little trash but 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.539
 if we get that handle we still have a constant percentage at the moment 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:26.509
 bring 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.389
 how positive that we always play good season 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.919
 okay swivel to the national team on the Saar with the 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.339
 junior national team at percent you are heat world champion Yohan Blake 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:38.669
 and I draw a few words to the pioneers Greece 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.269
 yes, the center went well for us, of course 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.659
 with its grand finale jumble network 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.379
 Baloise from us over with the already six years now it was the youth 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.769
 and then the zoo in the last played by the youth and juniors 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.609
 Championship and again 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.269
 then to become world champion is of course percent and so nice 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.969
 Been feeling and 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:02.640
 So not to describe the net world champion, it's size actually 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.199
 not really imagine 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.109
 okay the last game the junior champions did 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.759
 at the junior national team he came the first of the 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:11.179
 be a national team 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:12.359
 his previous one 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.089
 ol-trainer percent so junior national coach seat 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:18.809
 National coach you have a bit of double hope in that he is you 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.180
 knows and knows what he has in me you are now also the best kipa in 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.089
 Greece has been awarded 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:27.369
 maybe that's about to make it to the jump soon, or at all 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:28.929
 create is 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:31.049
 yes, I see that quite relaxed 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.810
 the tent so he of course percent the players now including the last 8 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:38.200
 Years of well-known from the youth field because he trains the riding hall 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.079
 Has 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.349
 and around there I want to try out one or the other company again but me 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.480
 I take it easy with me now personally and percent make me there 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.469
 no stress 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.479
 if it should be so that I invited who wants that of course super 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.269
 but is yes 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.650
 Zetzwil Geely no pressure on now in the next two years or so 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.489
 that they want to reach as always but simply 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.119
 It is important that she looks at myself that I have my performance here 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:03.709
 that was show and percent 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.679
 Everything else will be about my life then 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.439
 Claim big topic is always the follow-up promotion of the German 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.419
 talents 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.549
 as it has always been and Heiner Brand now the BI Manager 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.689
 need to have clear focus for follow-up promotion in it 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.279
 just got the title we have the draw also just swung back 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.039
 Well, you're watching this discussion as those about the 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.039
 being discussed all the time 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.099
 that's already been said with Livni mission already longer 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.219
 now everything is talking 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:34.800
 Tillich that is the more eager gang really from the youth field in 

00:04:34.799 --> 00:04:37.490
 inner area in the adults without seniors area 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.370
 That really is percent that is the biggest hurdle taken by masters 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.460
 and 10 like that now 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.460
 that would be really good 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:51.370
 it has the space to implement easily 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.750
 absent question where does the TBV end up making the sound what contribution 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.279
 have to 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.850
 yes, hopefully percent 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.140
 say at least one place better sentences or better on the case 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.809
 as sentences say and percent I personally 

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:07.199
 of course then if I did 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.389
 Games when I get my game shares »then percent is possible 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.389
 I want to help the team 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.689
 you have the TV Steinheim points
