00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
about the the stanley part i think that

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.870 
about the the stanley part i think that
part<00:02:12.319> is<00:02:12.410> cool

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
part is cool

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.470 
part is cool
you<00:02:12.970> know<00:02:13.060> he<00:02:13.210> created<00:02:13.570> so<00:02:13.780> many<00:02:14.160> characters

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
you know he created so many characters

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.630 
you know he created so many characters
and<00:02:16.480> having<00:02:17.320> him<00:02:17.500> participate<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:18.220> more<00:02:18.430> than

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
and having him participate in more than

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.270 
and having him participate in more than
just<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.330> cameo<00:02:19.750> or<00:02:19.960> even<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.920> kind<00:02:21.220> of

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
just a cameo or even in that kind of

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.790 
just a cameo or even in that kind of
faux<00:02:21.640> producer<00:02:22.270> credit<00:02:22.600> that<00:02:22.780> he<00:02:22.810> gets<00:02:23.110> in

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
faux producer credit that he gets in

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.530 
faux producer credit that he gets in
these<00:02:23.950> movies<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.460> think<00:02:24.940> it's<00:02:25.090> kind<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:25.360> cool

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
these movies I think it's kind of cool

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.120 
these movies I think it's kind of cool
because<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.840> think<00:02:26.020> he<00:02:26.140> still<00:02:26.350> has<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.800> don't

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
because I think he still has I don't

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.980 
because I think he still has I don't
think<00:02:27.190> he<00:02:27.370> has<00:02:27.730> like<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.450> scripting

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
think he has like the scripting

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.660 
think he has like the scripting
abilities<00:02:29.410> that<00:02:29.590> he<00:02:29.740> used<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.070> but<00:02:30.250> he<00:02:30.400> still<00:02:30.610> I

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
abilities that he used to but he still I

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.250 
abilities that he used to but he still I
think<00:02:30.790> has<00:02:31.090> pretty<00:02:31.420> good<00:02:31.630> ideas<00:02:32.020> and<00:02:32.050> his

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
think has pretty good ideas and his

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.620 
think has pretty good ideas and his
reckon<00:02:32.890> his<00:02:33.100> brain<00:02:33.340> probably<00:02:33.700> has<00:02:33.790> like<00:02:33.880> 50

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
reckon his brain probably has like 50

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.480 
reckon his brain probably has like 50
awesome<00:02:34.990> ideas<00:02:35.350> still<00:02:35.530> there<00:02:35.740> but<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.160> obvi

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
think that they could be two unrelated

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.050 
think that they could be two unrelated
stories<00:02:59.800> I<00:02:59.830> mean<00:02:59.980> related<00:03:00.550> because<00:03:00.790> it's<00:03:00.970> the

stories I mean related because it's the
same<00:03:01.210> universe<00:03:01.630> but<00:03:01.930> unrelated<00:03:02.440> because

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
same universe but unrelated because

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.520 
same universe but unrelated because
