00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.660
 two 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.070
 there are those who are willing to sell their soul to the devil to maintain the eternal 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.950
 youth but more time if massa spells what you have to do is 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.519
 take care of yourself seems to be good 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.989
 and have quality of life 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.390
 they knew that there is a Spanish society of medicine 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.869
 anti-aging and longevity 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.159
 its abbreviations 11 wrong tonight its president is with us 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.190
 josé de marqués r former president semar good night hello that such good night 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.320
 I suppose the crowd will ask questions what the secret of the between 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.750
 youth where I suppose there is no more magical pose but 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.100
 still has to do with how healthy as the goal they refuse to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.460
 doing sport like that is and that's what we think from the association 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.580
 dementia anti-aging and longevity 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.290
 That is why we really raised the question because it was disput 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.910
 one is the control of dietary habits what is the diet 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.420
 then there is the recommendation of physical exercise 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.110
 It is very important even if you are an older person because you walk 30 minutes a day 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.140
 Thirdly, there is stress control nowadays because we live a 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.790
 very complicated society with very large cities with many traffic jams 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.920
 in a hurry 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.590
 but good anyway stress is not all bad is bad and let's say the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.910
 chronic stress and a little bit of acute stress because it is also good and it does not happen 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:30.580
 nothing 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.010
 it is very important also the ministry of suffering 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.680
 nutritional as we get older 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.910
 there is a deficit in the trace mineral vitamins and 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.770
 substances that we absorb 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.610
 and also 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.740
 it can be many times there are hormonal changes that occur 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.350
 that's why they are clearly seen, for example, by women in the last week 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.410
 of the year 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.520
 and in men but we also have andropause that is called that it shows 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.040
 less 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.040
 but we really have it too 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.960
 fatah in short is not about extending life do not get stairs and 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.500
 Christians the idea that yes no 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.830
 the way is extending in any case at the beginning of the century the hope 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.320
 of life was 40 years 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.000
 and at the end of the 20th century, we were already in what we are now 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.730
 in 79 years for men and 83 for women 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.949
 according to they have verified that in 70% of the causes that favor the 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:20.579
 aging 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.509
 buddle does nothing with nutritional and physical habits and only 30% 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.579
 el-erian genetic factors 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.519
 Well now it is believed otherwise 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.019
 sirasa we think you have to know the schedule is really looks thought 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.099
 that the one that the hereditary factor 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.709
 it really influences a lot 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.439
 but the hereditary porter is not so important it is much more important what 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.079
 that we from tomorrow 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.169
 we can start doing for our life habits that is 70 75% and 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:51.349
 what is for example then we can stop smoking tomorrow we can be good 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.469
 Well, take a healthy healthy diet to speed up the time because diet 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.309
 hundred in a mediterranean has a very good press 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:00.949
 we are fortunate so that it does not repeat itself 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:04.599
 it has always been said that the country people what they were living is going to why 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.739
 it feeds very well really we are aware we benefit from the 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.059
 Mediterranean diet 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.799
 no andaluz eduardo portela mazer fishing 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.689
 and I think a little is underestimated and the proof is that you know what 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.129
 good that in the schools and even that the children do not take that diet so healthy 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.919
 mediterranean 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.559
 who take the diet so much more based on fast food from 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.109
 pizza burgers that is not exactly ideal and it's already when we 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.410
 we are doing more 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.499
 that we value more open with fruits and vegetables 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:34.929
 with fish that is with a lot of andalusia 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:38.969
 70 points to those of the t2 equally consumed by haste not for convenience 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.049
 and why when I think that also the zurza 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.519
 maybe the two multinationals have been able to sell very well why because 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.409
 good children could choose another type of food but practically so 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:51.440
 they like to go to 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.769
 to take hamburgers and take this kind of 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.219
 of food to take chips so they are not fried with olive oil 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:01.320
 they have many very healthy properties and do not fear they bet 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.019
 phyta with animal fats with butter etc 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.579
 and sports what role anti-aging medicine plays 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.799
 good sport is a very important process 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.540
 because phonak because in the practice of physical exercise is fundamental 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.720
 then really the sport can help us to do physical exercise 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.849
 since a sport like swimming from will play 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:22.639
 any type of 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.169
 important sport 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.860
 i good 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.969
 I was really going back to insist that even in old age 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:30.830
 It is important 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.029
 no longer the sport if it can not be done without physical exercise 

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:36.669
 like a coffee argaña although it will be tomorrow 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.879
 it's called that it will be in stress aging 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.169
 well yes there is no doubt that stress and is maintained if it is a chronic stress 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.140
 age 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.730
 it does not age us, they have no 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.520
 determined moment as we have a bit of stress as it can result for 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.090
 someone because they talk on television or good post to have to give a 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.110
 conference 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.150
 houbo live a situation 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.310
 but it is a maintained situation 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.520
 of stress 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.900
 percent good for not living at ease with a life of keeping 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.030
 a series of customs or habits that are made projects is very bad 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.770
 and it can even lead us to suffer a report among other important 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.529
 let's say then as depression or as even ica 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.399
 cuéllar appears are fashionable treatments to spas the 

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:18.680
 hydrotherapy 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.880
 the massages 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.250
 That each proved that he knows how to relax but also serves to 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.499
 stop anti-aging 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:29.210
 but specifically those good treatments because they come well to everyone from 

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:31.590
 the point of view that are anti-stress treatments 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.139
 iii when people are important 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.909
 but none of the pillars that I have talked about would be enough without the support 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.200
 from others do not be very important 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.460
 and since the fernandez de la vega diet which the army did not want 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.610
 for me even the miner xstrata a lot of endesa elements 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.980
 nutritional and the replacement of the revolts and apart from all that knows 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.309
 everything would have to take medication 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:59.249
 well not necessarily because we can even detect by analysis 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:02.279
 that we do clinical analysis biochemical analysis 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.550
 Well, a certain hormonal deficit 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.370
 i that hormonal deficit 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.969
 can be corrected 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.200
 taking substances called hormone precursors 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.520
 so that in some way they naturally stimulate the secretion of 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.369
 hormones by the body 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:19.369
 for example, physical exercise, sport 

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:24.629
 will provide growth hormone and hormone cd organisms 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:28.669
 because it is sexual is a pretext but it depends so much on the nation to pay the 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.400
 mother-of-pearl headers in english 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.819
 and that they can not 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.139
 that we managed to detect 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:34.449
 percent 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.699
 you do not point out either you need 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.759
 at the time of improving the appearance but the scalpel only be insufficient not 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.570
 yeah well what we say some way is that the cosmetic surgery and the 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.699
 aesthetic medicine 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:50.169
 what they do is fix the external part of the person as without 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.940
 car was the body 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.450
 king and the internal part would be anti-aging medicine what is the 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.949
 engine 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:01.080
 I suppose the part you have to accept is having enjoyed the small 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.430
 bitter ban things we do in life 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.499
 I assure you that it also helps to stay young 

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:09.429
 well yes without a doubt those are the tips we want in some way for 

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.999
 the control of stress 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:14.539
 It is a cliché to think that one day we will grow old without diseases 

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:19.939
 it's a bit of a cliché but bridge 

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:22.970
 perhaps with the advances that happened there 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.800
 in fact there is the current life expectancy is let's say psoe ss it is thought that the 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.340
 man can normally live a hundred and twenty years in fact in the 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.599
 French chantal met 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:35.020
 has died with 122 years recently 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.080
 and it is estimated then how good and already the limit a little of life are 120 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.510
 years 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.349
 lions in a warehouse 

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:45.389
 yes the Japanese especially those on the island of Okinawa are very long-lived 

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:49.630
 what is important to say is that even p is expected thanks to these 

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:53.180
 advances fundamentally analysts this advances well thanks to the cells 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.900
 mother 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.199
 there was engineering 

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:58.889
 to genetic modifications you can even get to live up to 150 

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:03.990
 well to take care fuci are going to break years accompany this nation many 

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.849
 thank you 

00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:08.979
 we go with another matter the husband and alleged murderer of immaculate ivory has 

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:10.330
 passed this afternoon 

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.580
 to judicial disposition
