00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the software and I if I do is go up in

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.619 
the software and I if I do is go up in
the<00:00:45.629> top<00:00:46.469> right<00:00:46.680> hand<00:00:46.710> corner<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.629> download

of the point so once it's done
downloading<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:57.180> install<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.719> which<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.020> only

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
downloading you install it which it only

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.010 
downloading you install it which it only
takes<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.440> few<00:00:58.469> seconds<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.190> it'll<00:00:59.879> still<00:01:00.149> need

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
takes a few seconds and it'll still need

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.189 
takes a few seconds and it'll still need
someone<00:01:01.230> open<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:02.539> and<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:04.110> course

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
someone open it up here and of course

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.820 
someone open it up here and of course
UAC<00:01:04.979> will<00:01:05.250> pop<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.840> because<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.080> AG<00:01:07.380> exit

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
UAC will pop up because this is AG exit

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.820 
UAC will pop up because this is AG exit

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.200 
so under SPD it'll show on the side slot
1<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.270> slot<00:02:00.509> 2<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:01.049> two<00:02:01.710> memory<00:02:02.579> slots<00:02:02.939> on

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
1 and slot 2 I have two memory slots on

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.340 
1 and slot 2 I have two memory slots on
my<00:02:03.299> computer<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:03.869> that's<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.079> piece<00:02:04.229> of

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
my computer so that's a piece of

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.749 
my computer so that's a piece of
information<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.860> know<00:02:05.009> how<00:02:05.610> many

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
information you know I know how many

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.270

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
slots you have on your computer now slot

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.639 
slots you have on your computer now slot
ones<00:02:08.489> all<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.819> buy<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:10.170> won't<00:02:10.560> know

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
ones all you buy it and you won't know

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.490

what<00:02:10.770> taper<00:02:10.979> what<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> type<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.819> RAM<00:02:12.180> you

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
what taper what the type of RAM you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.490 
what taper what the type of RAM you
be<00:02:13.950> using<00:02:14.310> when<00:02:14.730> upgrading<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.380> would

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
be using when upgrading and that would

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.950 
be using when upgrading and that would
be<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> ddr2<00:02:17.130> right<00:02:17.790> here<00:02:18.030> I'm<00:02:18.180> running<00:02:18.330> ddr2

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
be the ddr2 right here I'm running ddr2

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.800 
be the ddr2 right here I'm running ddr2
RAM<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.250> that's<00:02:20.850> important<00:02:21.330> for<00:02:21.420> me<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:21.720> I'm

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
RAM so that's important for me if I'm

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.950 
RAM so that's important for me if I'm
gonna<00:02:21.900> buy<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.200> new<00:02:22.470> Ram<00:02:22.710> because<00:02:23.960> of

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
gonna buy it new Ram because of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.949 
gonna buy it new Ram because of
obviously<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.950> need<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.430> know<00:02:27.170> or<00:02:28.170> kind<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:29.959> rare

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
obviously I need to know or kind of rare

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.449 
obviously I need to know or kind of rare
I<00:02:30.990> need<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.380> buy<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:33.120> that's<00:02:33.270> what<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.570> have<00:02:33.810> in

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
I need to buy so that's what I have in

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:42.830 
I need to buy so that's what I have in
slot<00:02:35.459> 1<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.890> size<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:39.709> RAM<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:41.840> 2048

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840

is<00:02:50.720> each<00:02:52.100> gigabytes<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.459> gigabyte<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:53.970> ten

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
is each gigabytes a gigabyte is ten

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.620 
is each gigabytes a gigabyte is ten
thousand<00:02:54.750> twenty<00:02:54.870> four<00:02:55.230> megabytes<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.459> RAM<00:02:56.940> so

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
thousand twenty four megabytes of RAM so

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.479 
thousand twenty four megabytes of RAM so

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
RAM it's a simple calculation you can do

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.100

channel<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.910> if<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.440> this<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.590> basically<00:03:41.070> all

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
channel so if you this is basically all

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.590 
channel so if you this is basically all
you<00:03:42.150> know<00:03:42.530> for<00:03:43.730> buying<00:03:44.730> Ram<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.239> let's<00:03:45.450> say

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
you know for buying Ram so let's say

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.840 
you know for buying Ram so let's say
yeah<00:03:45.690> I'll<00:03:46.079> actually<00:03:46.470> buy<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:46.680> Ram<00:03:47.070> I'll<00:03:47.459> go

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
yeah I'll actually buy this Ram I'll go

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.840 
yeah I'll actually buy this Ram I'll go
back<00:03:48.000> down<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.239> my<00:03:48.329> search<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.019> do<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.519> year<00:03:50.519> two

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
back down to my search and do a year two

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.370 
back down to my search and do a year two
or<00:03:51.590> two<00:03:52.940> gram<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.269> let's<00:03:54.450> see<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:54.690> want<00:03:55.110> to<00:03:55.230> add

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
or two gram and let's see I want to add

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.400 
or two gram and let's see I want to add
another<00:03:55.590> three<00:03:56.220> gigabytes<00:03:56.459> or<00:03:57.450> two<00:03:57.989> gigabytes

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.530 
or another one gigabytes
let's<00:04:00.299> just<00:04:00.450> do<00:04:00.570> one<00:04:00.750> gigabytes<00:04:02.269> and<00:04:03.269> it<00:04:03.420> would

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
let's just do one gigabytes and it would

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.370 
let's just do one gigabytes and it would
show<00:04:03.780> here<00:04:04.110> like<00:04:04.549> here<00:04:05.549> we<00:04:05.640> go<00:04:06.019> that's<00:04:07.019> how<00:04:07.230> you

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380
