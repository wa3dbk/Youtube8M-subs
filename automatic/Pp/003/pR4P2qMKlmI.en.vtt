00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.670
 today we will try to write for you 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.860
 new interesting workshop on 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.070
 Christmas Christmas theme but 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.500
 and we come to it with a few other 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.900
 the edges 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.630
 At first, this master class was planned 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.449
 as 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:28.500
 just a master class on writing a book and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:34.610
 candles on a candlestick 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:38.280
 but it would be wrong to do as it were 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.649
 just setting we always try and 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.510
 look for something interesting of their own 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.059
 master classes discover something new 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.219
 for you and in this case naturally 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.469
 it we will not have such a student 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.370
 rock formulation can let ie 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.600
 we certainly wait for the candle that is 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.199
 In this case, you now see the book and 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.229
 candle and let's watch with you how 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.020
 still life can change only 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.020
 due to the fact that the candle is lit 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:30.579
 together with our students we developed 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:35.320
 This topic we visited Pushkin Museum 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:38.350
 held classes and learned along with 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.590
 write a lit candle 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.220
 I would like to just this interesting 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.820
 methods to share with you and go and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.450
 in an unusual way we will approach this 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.090
 still life through grisaille 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.310
 so almost 90 percent 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.610
 master class will be held in 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.200
 black and white and so the fairy tale was 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.720
 full and magic too full 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:10.119
 natural and very effect 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.810
 Perry we take care of last and this will 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.580
 It is the introduction of color using bead 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.630
 here you see it is wonderful 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.420
 candlestick 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.420
 i made it with my own hands he from 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.310
 plasticine from several metal and 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.549
 plastic parts then he from 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.000
 decorated with acrylic under the old 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.910
 to melt the old candle 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.299
 book look again how can 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:43.269
 change on what that's when it appears 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:46.720
 flower that is, immediately we can not 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:50.170
 look at the book but the name of the book 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.160
 can change right away that is it is not 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.810
 surely there will be some 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.400
 old church book it can be 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.569
 already some old 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.970
 novel and what will happen next with 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:09.730
 still life you will learn later 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.959
 now was the moment of the performance 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:17.579
 still life is natural that the layout of 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.680
 we will be horizontal that's why 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.540
 have patience prepare the canvas 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.950
 the canvas will be stained 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:32.519
 I have such a gray green here 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.540
 so I'm starting now 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.629
 directly to the painting and 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.430
 layouts palette I will not show 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.620
 because that is, there is only black and 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.689
 white color and say that you are here 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.400
 a little bit here is a little bit whiter 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.099
 as if there is no sense that is there will be 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:53.939
 realistically only two colors when will 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.939
 the light will then appear
