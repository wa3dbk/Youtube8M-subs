don't even know where I got these but
the<00:03:15.100> little<00:03:15.340> bar<00:03:15.550> in<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.850> middle<00:03:16.000> don't<00:03:16.930> know

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
the little bar in the middle don't know

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.590 
the little bar in the middle don't know
if<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.110> can<00:03:17.230> see<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.610> is<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:21.600> 16

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
if you can see that but this is a 16

gauge<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:23.080> early<00:03:23.950> say<00:03:24.100> think<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.550> might<00:03:25.270> be<00:03:25.360> wrong

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
gauge I early say think I might be wrong

the<00:03:26.440> bar<00:03:26.800> in<00:03:27.069> the<00:03:27.160> middle<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:29.200> fake<00:03:30.130> ones

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
the bar in the middle of the fake ones

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.699 
the bar in the middle of the fake ones
were<00:03:31.860> two<00:03:32.860> sizes<00:03:33.069> bigger<00:03:33.250> than<00:03:33.489> this<00:03:33.700> one<00:03:33.910> so

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
were two sizes bigger than this one so

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.810 
were two sizes bigger than this one so
and<00:03:35.709> we<00:03:35.800> didn't<00:03:36.010> know<00:03:36.100> that<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.519> we<00:03:36.700> were

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
and we didn't know that this we were

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.470 
and we didn't know that this we were
stable

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
stable

plus<00:03:37.690> they<00:03:37.840> were<00:03:37.900> made<00:03:38.110> out<00:03:38.140> of<00:03:39.900> surgical

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
plus they were made out of surgical

steel<00:03:41.080> or<00:03:41.590> you<00:03:42.280> know<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.489> heavy<00:03:42.670> stuff<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.630> it

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
steel or you know the heavy stuff so it

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.690 
steel or you know the heavy stuff so it
not<00:03:44.470> only<00:03:44.739> did<00:03:44.890> it<00:03:44.920> stretch<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.310> because<00:03:45.550> of

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
not only did it stretch it because of

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.850 
not only did it stretch it because of
the<00:03:45.910> width<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.300> it<00:03:46.420> but<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.470> stretched<00:03:47.739> it

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
the width of it but it stretched it

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.180 
the width of it but it stretched it
because<00:03:48.069> of<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.580> heaviness<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:49.959> my<00:03:50.560> ears<00:03:50.830> were

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
because of the heaviness so my ears were

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.990 
because of the heaviness so my ears were
already<00:03:52.380> stretched<00:03:54.300> up<00:03:55.300> to<00:03:55.660> sizes

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
already stretched up to sizes

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.840 
already stretched up to sizes
do<00:03:57.120> anything<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:58.620> apparently<00:03:59.160> sticking

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
do anything that so apparently sticking

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.480 
do anything that so apparently sticking
and<00:04:00.090> mail<00:04:00.240> through<00:04:00.540> my<00:04:00.630> ear<00:04:00.810> was<00:04:01.710> easy<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.340> was

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
and mail through my ear was easy it was

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
like the really thick nails that are

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.110 
like the really thick nails that are
about<00:04:05.220> like<00:04:06.680> really<00:04:07.680> big<00:04:07.980> around<00:04:08.250> like<00:04:08.940> not

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
about like really big around like not

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.390 
about like really big around like not
small<00:04:09.450> ones<00:04:09.690> but<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.440> know<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.770> big<00:04:10.920> ones<00:04:11.100> so

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
small ones but you know the big ones so

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.730 
small ones but you know the big ones so
then<00:04:11.520> about<00:04:11.610> a<00:04:11.760> year<00:04:11.970> later<00:04:12.180> or<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:13.590> know<00:04:13.709> a

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
couple months later I actually decided

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.590 
couple months later I actually decided
that<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.459> was<00:04:20.640> going<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:21.170> stretch<00:04:22.170> my<00:04:22.200> ears
