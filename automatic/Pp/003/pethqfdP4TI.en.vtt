00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.330
 motorola gets loose a little plessis at the conservatory 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.860
 with the doubling of the reduced rate no big news I was told it 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.079
 was going to make some impros 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.449
 I come to you 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.209
 by itself this most important fact of the music scene 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.080
 incidentally a region plagued by the strasbourg philharmonic orchestra 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.869
 but I admit that really the viticultural part and surely the most important 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.500
 in my life the passion of wines and the music press are two things that 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.859
 are not necessarily antinomic I like to mix so 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.689
 tasting licenses with that tested at the hearing for 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.210
 say what if someone talks to you about a risk line 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.490
 the winemaker will be there what do you 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.860
 the days but if we take for example a crémant 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.890
 clemency actually so that's how fast is 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.510
 also in this region is formal if summer in something that she says 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.769
 that the aggressiveness of a panel is no longer there 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.219
 but now we have no chance 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:50.450
 so that could be 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.600
 but really 20 seconds the Russian does it but something that can be 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.679
 work on it precisely on the sorting either 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.160
 speediness late 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 no 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.800
 the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.600
 Apaire 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 when 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.610
 cool that all were interested to be increased on ten lines on the city 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.830
 on the minerality 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.880
 Russia 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.320
 the minerality is something very elegant at the same time 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.220
 and all those who impose themselves very very quickly on the end of the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.020
 language so I think rather left 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.020
 then percent 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.480
 a year 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.800
 the percentage 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.800
 % var 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.280
 montea would lose then be aware that I am not presented meanwhile 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.440
 director of the Paris Conservatoire you are 35 years old 36 years time 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.539
 in a few days after all this time the beginning 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.259
 of october six young and at the head of the conservatoire of paris how how 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.249
 it's written this adventure for the predecessor wine that was even more 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.509
 young who was the creator of the conservatory 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.109
 but it was under the French Revolution in the camp 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.619
 geraldine happened before the age of 40 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:16.969
 it was better to be a young director 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.879
 that's done here the post was vacant the few times you know in 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.719
 life we ​​say that we have benefited enough from the institutions to 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.869
 give a little of your time to give them a little of your time 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:29.469
 to take exactly what we could 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.469
 it seems to me that we agree on parity on my bed 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.549
 it is in any case to change a few things 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.559
 students are often taught less than the day before 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.529
 the culmination of a solo career when you do not arrive and 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.979
 soloists and chamber musicians and when we are not the only ones to wheelwright 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.739
 orchestra musicians gold for me the hierarchy with any other law be 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.499
 a great orchestral musician and that is accomplished in a community this 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.609
 condition was more beautiful than one can book and therefore only 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.939
 work on precisely the report that the community a thing that me 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.519
 passionate and as a general exception since since I took office 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.689
 what did he want to give him a little gift on al-jazeera acting as well as a 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.809
 100% original chain 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.589
 the land we are always happy to euros goes to meet people 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.169
 what could this dog inspire you 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.700
 for the teacher alsace20 this is not my way to write an internet figure 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.229
 the meeting has grown by half its very good and that it really is I 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.229
 do not know things 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.669
 if the new music of alsace in the copyright of orders total 6 years 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:45.129
 or renault
