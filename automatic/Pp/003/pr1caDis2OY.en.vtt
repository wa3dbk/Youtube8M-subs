00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
time ago then I realized I gave it to my

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.600 
time ago then I realized I gave it to my
dad<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.660> last<00:01:53.899> time<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:54.619> took<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:55.069> trip<00:01:55.340> with<00:01:55.460> him

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.770 
and he's had it ever since in his truck
and<00:01:59.470> I<00:02:00.470> find<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.070> so<00:02:01.190> ironic<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:02.240> take<00:02:02.600> I

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
going in the truck I gave him another

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.140 
going in the truck I gave him another
keychain<00:02:07.250> I<00:02:07.430> haven't<00:02:07.730> given<00:02:07.820> him<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.060> few
