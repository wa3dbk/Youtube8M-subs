like i have always presented myself to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.180 
like i have always presented myself to
the<00:00:52.079> world<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.410> more<00:00:52.559> masculine<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.160> feminine

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the world is more masculine and feminine

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.910 
the world is more masculine and feminine
but<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.149> some<00:00:54.449> ways<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.620> feminine

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
but in some ways I do have feminine

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.130 
but in some ways I do have feminine
qualities<00:00:56.370> feel<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.420> was<00:00:57.539> never<00:00:57.719> able<00:00:57.989> to

come<00:00:58.320> across<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> stereotypical<00:00:59.520> bro<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
come across as the stereotypical bro and

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.450 
come across as the stereotypical bro and
on<00:01:00.690> some<00:01:00.989> level<00:01:01.020> I'm<00:01:01.500> okay<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.340> at

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
worn makeup I feel like it's just

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
something that I've not been interested

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.300 
something that I've not been interested
in<00:02:06.750> I'm<00:02:06.960> not<00:02:07.079> opposed<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.560> but<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.190> don't

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
in I'm not opposed to it but I don't

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.699 
in I'm not opposed to it but I don't
know<00:02:08.520> I'm<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.179> not<00:02:09.479> feeling<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.470> next

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
know I'm just not feeling it so the next

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.750 
know I'm just not feeling it so the next
two<00:02:10.830> questions<00:02:10.950> asked<00:02:11.400> about<00:02:11.580> being

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
two questions asked about being

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.580 
two questions asked about being
misgendered<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
misgendered and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.960 
misgendered and
parenting<00:02:12.890> dysphoria<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.550> have<00:02:13.700> never

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
parenting dysphoria I have never

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.850 
parenting dysphoria I have never
experienced<00:02:14.599> either<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.900> those<00:02:15.019> things<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.590> I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
experienced either of those things and I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.990 
experienced either of those things and I
feel<00:02:16.010> like<00:02:16.129> both<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.310> those<00:02:16.489> things<00:02:16.550> can<00:02:16.940> be

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
feel like both of those things can be

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.699 
feel like both of those things can be
really<00:02:17.480> traumatic<00:02:17.750> for<00:02:17.989> people<00:02:18.260> particularly

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
really traumatic for people particularly

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.930 
really traumatic for people particularly
those<00:02:18.950> who<00:02:19.129> are<00:02:19.310> struggling<00:02:19.610> with<00:02:19.760> their

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
those who are struggling with their

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.699 
those who are struggling with their
gender<00:02:20.000> identity<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:20.930> guess<00:02:21.170> on<00:02:21.349> some<00:02:21.379> level

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
gender identity so I guess on some level

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.949 
gender identity so I guess on some level
I'm<00:02:22.280> pretty<00:02:22.730> lucky<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:23.180> not<00:02:23.300> have<00:02:23.450> experienced

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
I'm pretty lucky to not have experienced

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.930 
I'm pretty lucky to not have experienced
that<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.620> that's<00:02:24.980> pretty<00:02:25.160> much<00:02:25.310> my<00:02:25.519> experience

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
that so that's pretty much my experience

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.330 
that so that's pretty much my experience
with<00:02:26.060> gender<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.420> think<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:26.989> am

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
with gender I think that I am

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.130 
with gender I think that I am
unbelievably<00:02:28.340> fortunate<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.420> be<00:02:29.540> cisgender

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
unbelievably fortunate to be cisgender

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.140 
unbelievably fortunate to be cisgender
I'm<00:02:30.349> very<00:02:30.739> lucky<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.370> never<00:02:31.580> have<00:02:31.790> had<00:02:32.000> to

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
I'm very lucky to never have had to

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.119 
I'm very lucky to never have had to
question<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.720> aspect<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.290> myself<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.890> I

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
question that aspect of myself and I

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.220 
question that aspect of myself and I
feel<00:02:34.160> very<00:02:34.370> much<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:34.760> non-typical<00:02:35.629> gender

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
feel very much that non-typical gender

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.650 
feel very much that non-typical gender
identities<00:02:36.739> are<00:02:36.920> valid<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.660> absolutely

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
identities are valid and absolutely

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.720 
identities are valid and absolutely
deserve<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.290> be<00:02:39.410> seen<00:02:39.620> like<00:02:39.799> that<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.610> is
