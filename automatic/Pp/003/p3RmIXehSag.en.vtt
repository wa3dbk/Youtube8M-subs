and<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:45.620> have<00:02:45.829> no<00:02:46.040> problem<00:02:46.670> with<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.890> concept

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.070 

all<00:03:02.070> right<00:03:02.310> let's<00:03:02.850> start<00:03:03.210> this<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.810> from

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
all right let's start this so from

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.400 
all right let's start this so from
scratch<00:03:04.500> you're<00:03:05.160> going<00:03:05.520> open<00:03:05.880> design<00:03:06.270> in<00:03:06.450> it

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.570 

you<00:03:10.410> go<00:03:10.940> interactive<00:03:11.940> knitting<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:14.130> open<00:03:14.460> a

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
you go interactive knitting you open a

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.060 
you go interactive knitting you open a
stitch<00:03:14.880> pattern<00:03:15.420> let's<00:03:16.230> see<00:03:16.350> if<00:03:16.410> we<00:03:16.500> find<00:03:16.710> one

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
stitch pattern let's see if we find one

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
milky stitch design it doesn't have any

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.140 
milky stitch design it doesn't have any
basic<00:03:41.810> stitch<00:03:42.140> so<00:03:42.890> what<00:03:42.980> is<00:03:43.159> it<00:03:43.340> duck<00:03:43.840> stitch

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.120 
you sure that your carriage is knitting
properly<00:06:00.600> all<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:01.140> stitches<00:06:01.500> right<00:06:01.770> place

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
properly all the stitches right place

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.820 
properly all the stitches right place
you<00:06:02.910> can<00:06:03.090> simply<00:06:03.540> go<00:06:03.750> don't<00:06:04.140> show<00:06:04.440> me<00:06:04.650> this

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
you can simply go don't show me this

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.940 
you can simply go don't show me this
again<00:06:05.000> and<00:06:06.000> I'm<00:06:06.810> assume<00:06:07.169> that<00:06:07.410> everything<00:06:07.830> is

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
again and I'm assume that everything is

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.820 
again and I'm assume that everything is
moving<00:06:08.130> fine<00:06:08.700> so<00:06:09.300> you<00:06:09.390> can<00:06:09.630> do<00:06:09.840> that<00:06:10.080> and<00:06:10.470> click

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
moving fine so you can do that and click

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.710 
moving fine so you can do that and click
OK<00:06:11.220> and<00:06:11.250> that<00:06:11.490> means<00:06:11.700> it<00:06:11.850> won't<00:06:12.000> show<00:06:12.270> up<00:06:12.390> again

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
OK and that means it won't show up again

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.470 
OK and that means it won't show up again
if<00:06:13.080> you<00:06:13.919> want<00:06:14.160> to<00:06:14.310> leave<00:06:14.460> it<00:06:14.640> there<00:06:14.850> and<00:06:15.240> keep
