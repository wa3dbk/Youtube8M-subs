things in my life

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.560 
things in my life
yes<00:02:28.100> we're<00:02:28.370> adding<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.730> clothes<00:02:28.970> at<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.330> much

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.730 
and I thought the whole cuts were a lot
more<00:02:32.630> younger<00:02:32.900> though<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.320> embroidery<00:02:33.710> is

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
more younger though the embroidery is

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.860 
more younger though the embroidery is
very<00:02:33.920> intricate<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.550> old<00:02:34.760> world<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.270> things

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
like that took us three three months to

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.490 
like that took us three three months to
embroider<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.000> they<00:02:38.600> are<00:02:38.660> like

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
embroider and they are like

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.280

the<00:02:46.550> men<00:02:46.760> who<00:02:47.270> go<00:02:47.420> over<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.810> pants<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:48.410> their

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
the men who go over the pants and their

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.940 
the men who go over the pants and their
whole<00:02:48.680> attitude<00:02:48.710> was<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.550> lot<00:02:49.700> more<00:02:49.880> modern<00:02:50.030> and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950
