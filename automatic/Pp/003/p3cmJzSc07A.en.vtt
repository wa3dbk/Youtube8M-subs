00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.810
 hello and welcome to a fireworks show 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:26.160
 nice for tv that turned on again 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.970
 i just came from cologne and was 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.040
 shopping at the dance a organic store and 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.520
 was then still in the upper wheel with the aldi 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.040
 and I will show you today 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.420
 what I bought this day in 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.000
 these two transactions I do that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.030
 video for two reasons first because I 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.190
 get mails more often now 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.589
 I will not have one of you again 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.989
 would be ready to make such a video and 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.819
 Second, because I actually do everything 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.350
 got what I needed what 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:56.969
 I have decided to buy me 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.379
 do not make me a shopping list but 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.420
 I know about what else do I need 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.280
 what do I need and they had everything there 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.359
 had 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.100
 and besides, I have for the whole 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.650
 Things your backpack are pretty 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.680
 exactly 30 euro then I can pay you 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.880
 So sometimes show what you for 30 euros 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.790
 you can buy things for that too 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.100
 eat relatively cheap and healthy 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.100
 can be so normal I knew 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:39.790
 but at times here first apples apples 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.010
 more 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:10.780
 4 pack the final course 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.500
 from all 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.470
 What did you say 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.120
 except for the avocados of a bio and now 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.880
 comes what I bought myself 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.880
 of course, everything is great too 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:42.470
 say roccoli 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:10.019
 Topinambur mushrooms are the champignon 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:33.980
 We have lent products 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:33.980
 many more tomatoes 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:52.960
 that means I have everything today 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:56.420
 shopped 30 euros are banal here 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:01.520
 carrots apples as avocado from 1 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.670
 the rest of the bioladen thinks and yes me 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.870
 would appreciate now just now 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.710
 group head calculates something over 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.780
 8,000 calories from 18 1,500 calories that 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.570
 a woman's daily requirement of 2000 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.220
 Calorie has the so probably so 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.600
 that would be over four days 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:24.050
 Accordingly, now on the month 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.440
 the 204 would pull a bit more 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:31.130
 spend as much as 200 euros a month for a lot 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.140
 vegan vegan raw food and much fruit 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:38.420
 that's all, except for the avocados 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:40.240
 bio so sustainably healthy everything one 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:53.450

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:55.670

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.040

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.290

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.970
 turn on again in the future and 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.400
 which has not yet made it quite clear 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.770
