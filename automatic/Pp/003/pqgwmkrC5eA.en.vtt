00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
then for the white bits of the eyes

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.880 
then for the white bits of the eyes
you're<00:00:03.540> going<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.780> need<00:00:03.899> small<00:00:04.200> pieces<00:00:04.440> half

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
you're going to need small pieces half

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.950 
you're going to need small pieces half
the<00:00:05.040> size<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.430> normal<00:00:05.549> triangle<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.720> just

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
the size of a normal triangle you just

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.360 
the size of a normal triangle you just
get<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.259> normal<00:00:07.440> white<00:00:07.710> triangle<00:00:08.189> and

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
get you a normal white triangle and

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.240 
get you a normal white triangle and
unfold<00:00:09.290> you<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.500> cut<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> half<00:00:11.099> down

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
unfold you just cut it on a half down

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.249 
unfold you just cut it on a half down
the<00:00:11.309> middle<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:12.059> use<00:00:12.420> those<00:00:12.690> two<00:00:12.960> small

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
the middle and use those two small

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.959 
the middle and use those two small
rectangles<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.009> fold<00:00:14.250> into<00:00:14.400> two<00:00:14.670> small

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
rectangles to fold into two small

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.359 
rectangles to fold into two small
triangles<00:00:15.230> so<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.410> between<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.890> spec<00:00:17.130> piece

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
triangles so in between the spec piece

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.710 
triangles so in between the spec piece
you're<00:00:17.670> going<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.880> insert<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> small<00:00:18.539> white

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
you're going to insert a small white

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.950 
you're going to insert a small white
triangle

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
triangle

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.079 
triangle
then<00:00:21.800> on<00:00:21.919> top<00:00:22.099> of<00:00:22.160> it<00:00:22.310> put<00:00:22.490> it<00:00:22.609> back<00:00:22.759> in<00:00:22.880> vert

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:23.089 
then on top of it put it back in vert

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.909 
then on top of it put it back in vert
apiece<00:00:23.359> so<00:00:23.810> I'll<00:00:23.900> turn<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.140> piece<00:00:24.320> around<00:00:24.560> so

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
apiece so I'll turn the piece around so

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.740 
apiece so I'll turn the piece around so
the<00:00:24.980> straight<00:00:25.250> side<00:00:25.400> is<00:00:25.550> facing<00:00:25.730> you<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:26.179> it's

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
the straight side is facing you and it's

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.770 
the straight side is facing you and it's
going<00:00:26.900> to<00:00:26.960> go<00:00:27.050> over<00:00:27.079> all<00:00:27.560> four<00:00:27.859> points

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.689 

now<00:00:33.469> when<00:00:33.620> I<00:00:33.649> put<00:00:33.890> this<00:00:33.980> on<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.219> white<00:00:34.489> piece

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
now when I put this on the white piece

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.970 
now when I put this on the white piece
move<00:00:34.940> down<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:35.899> you<00:00:36.140> want<00:00:36.320> it<00:00:36.350> to<00:00:36.440> stay<00:00:36.680> up<00:00:36.860> a

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
move down and you want it to stay up a

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.069 
move down and you want it to stay up a
little<00:00:37.129> bit<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:37.610> that<00:00:37.640> it's<00:00:37.879> in<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.059> middle<00:00:38.180> so

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
little bit so that it's in the middle so

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.579 
little bit so that it's in the middle so
just<00:00:39.350> take<00:00:39.530> this<00:00:39.680> off<00:00:40.930> then<00:00:41.930> just<00:00:42.230> push<00:00:42.410> the

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
just take this off then just push the

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:44.680 
just take this off then just push the
white<00:00:42.710> piece<00:00:42.920> in<00:00:43.129> as<00:00:43.339> far<00:00:43.610> as<00:00:43.730> it<00:00:43.820> can<00:00:44.000> go<00:00:44.059> and

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
white piece in as far as it can go and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.319 
white piece in as far as it can go and
if<00:00:45.230> it's<00:00:45.379> press<00:00:45.649> they<00:00:45.890> can<00:00:46.070> fall<00:00:46.280> out<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:47.089> just

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
if it's press they can fall out so just

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.369 
if it's press they can fall out so just
put<00:00:47.629> a<00:00:47.660> piece<00:00:47.899> into<00:00:48.230> it<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:48.649> puff<00:00:48.829> it<00:00:48.979> up<00:00:53.379> so

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
put a piece into it to puff it up so

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.380 
put a piece into it to puff it up so
let's<00:00:54.469> just<00:00:54.800> like<00:00:54.979> the<00:00:55.129> nose<00:00:55.309> you<00:00:56.120> have<00:00:56.239> to

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
let's just like the nose you have to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.000 
let's just like the nose you have to
slide<00:00:56.659> these<00:00:56.839> into<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.290> sides<00:00:57.530> of<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.829> black

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
slide these into the sides of the black

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.950 
slide these into the sides of the black
pockets<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:59.089> it<00:00:59.149> doesn't<00:00:59.449> go<00:00:59.510> into<00:00:59.629> the<00:00:59.809> white

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
pockets so it doesn't go into the white

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.039 
pockets so it doesn't go into the white
piece<00:01:01.149> then<00:01:02.149> you<00:01:02.269> put<00:01:02.420> on<00:01:02.510> one<00:01:02.659> back<00:01:02.839> piece

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
piece then you put on one back piece

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.410 
piece then you put on one back piece
normally<00:01:03.469> on<00:01:03.649> top<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.820> bumpy<00:01:05.089> side<00:01:05.239> is

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
normally on top so the bumpy side is

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.490 
normally on top so the bumpy side is
facing<00:01:05.600> out<00:01:07.750> so<00:01:08.750> do<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:09.020> same<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.470> other

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
facing out so do the same to the other

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:18.040 
facing out so do the same to the other
side<00:01:16.000> then<00:01:17.000> on<00:01:17.119> top<00:01:17.179> of<00:01:17.360> these<00:01:17.569> three<00:01:17.840> pieces

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
side then on top of these three pieces

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.480 
side then on top of these three pieces
and<00:01:18.530> two<00:01:18.770> pieces<00:01:19.100> on<00:01:19.250> top<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.770> then<00:01:22.159> three

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
and two pieces on top and then three

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.999 
and two pieces on top and then three
pieces<00:01:22.759> on<00:01:23.060> top<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:23.539> so<00:01:24.440> you<00:01:24.530> put<00:01:24.710> one<00:01:24.890> in

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
pieces on top of that so you put one in

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.309 
pieces on top of that so you put one in
the<00:01:25.100> middle<00:01:25.280> then<00:01:26.270> with<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.600> pieces<00:01:26.810> next<00:01:27.140> to

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
the middle then with the pieces next to

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.600 
the middle then with the pieces next to
it<00:01:27.409> that's<00:01:27.560> going<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.830> slide<00:01:28.009> over<00:01:28.039> these<00:01:28.429> two

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
it that's going to slide over these two

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:37.080 
it that's going to slide over these two
pieces<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:34.340> next<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.789> I<00:01:34.819> cut<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.630> pieces

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
pieces the next to the I cut to pieces

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.080 
pieces the next to the I cut to pieces
one<00:01:38.090> piece<00:01:38.299> on<00:01:38.450> top<00:01:38.509> of<00:01:38.750> that<00:01:38.899> and<00:01:39.909> then<00:01:40.909> one

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
one piece on top of that and then one

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.859 
one piece on top of that and then one
piece<00:01:41.329> sliding<00:01:41.750> over<00:01:41.990> these<00:01:42.170> two<00:01:42.380> pieces<00:01:43.869> do

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
piece sliding over these two pieces do

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.639 
piece sliding over these two pieces do
the<00:01:45.020> same<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.439> other<00:01:45.530> side<00:01:50.320> now<00:01:51.320> fill<00:01:51.560> in

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
the same to the other side now fill in

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.490 
the same to the other side now fill in
the<00:01:51.710> rest<00:01:51.829> of<00:01:52.039> those<00:01:52.189> three<00:01:52.460> rows<00:01:52.759> with<00:01:53.030> white

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.950 

once<00:01:59.190> you<00:01:59.310> fold<00:01:59.550> up<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> head<00:02:00.030> you're<00:02:00.810> going

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
once you fold up the head you're going

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.630 
once you fold up the head you're going
to<00:02:01.020> add<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.170> more<00:02:01.500> row<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.920> white<00:02:02.100> above<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
to add one more row of white above the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:15.209 
to add one more row of white above the
eye<00:02:08.479> now<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> row<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.960> bright<00:02:10.380> red

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:15.219 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.440 

now<00:02:16.219> you're<00:02:16.340> going<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:16.579> decrease<00:02:16.879> on<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.239> next

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
now you're going to decrease on the next

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.869 
now you're going to decrease on the next
row<00:02:17.599> so<00:02:18.409> to<00:02:18.469> decrease<00:02:19.010> instead<00:02:19.489> of<00:02:19.579> putting

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
row so to decrease instead of putting

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.149 
row so to decrease instead of putting
one<00:02:20.030> piece<00:02:20.239> over<00:02:20.540> two<00:02:20.689> points<00:02:21.079> and<00:02:21.890> put<00:02:22.069> it

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
one piece over two points and put it

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.420 
one piece over two points and put it
over<00:02:22.250> three<00:02:22.609> points<00:02:24.129> so<00:02:25.129> you've<00:02:25.250> got<00:02:25.310> a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
over three points so you've got a

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
over three points so you've got a
decrease<00:02:25.939> twice<00:02:27.400> then<00:02:28.400> put<00:02:28.640> on<00:02:28.670> two<00:02:29.030> pieces

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
decrease twice then put on two pieces

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.699 
decrease twice then put on two pieces
normally<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.780> decrease<00:02:33.290> twice<00:02:33.530> again<00:02:35.680> put<00:02:36.680> on

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
normally and decrease twice again put on

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:43.500 
normally and decrease twice again put on
to<00:02:37.010> normal<00:02:37.340> pieces<00:02:40.000> decreased<00:02:41.000> ice<00:02:41.209> again

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
to normal pieces decreased ice again

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.059 
to normal pieces decreased ice again
then<00:02:44.510> there's<00:02:44.810> only<00:02:44.989> space<00:02:45.200> left<00:02:45.620> for<00:02:45.769> three

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
then there's only space left for three

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.790 
then there's only space left for three
normal<00:02:46.400> pieces
