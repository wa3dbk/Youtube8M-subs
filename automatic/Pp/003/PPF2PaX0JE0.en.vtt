00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.680 
attached these two green microphone the
second<00:01:49.759> rule<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:49.909> that<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.240> cannot<00:01:50.479> like

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
second rule is that you cannot like

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.630 
second rule is that you cannot like
opposing<00:01:51.049> coloured<00:01:51.500> microphones<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.610> I

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
opposing coloured microphones so I

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.460 
opposing coloured microphones so I
couldn't<00:01:53.299> place<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.659> tile<00:01:53.810> like<00:01:53.990> this<00:01:54.170> I've

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
couldn't place the tile like this I've

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.170 
couldn't place the tile like this I've
attached<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.979> green<00:01:55.220> in<00:01:55.369> an<00:01:55.490> orange<00:01:55.700> microphone

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
attached a green in an orange microphone

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.340 
attached a green in an orange microphone
which<00:01:56.360> is<00:01:56.390> an<00:01:56.570> illegal<00:01:56.750> play<00:01:58.750> if<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.929> catalyst

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
which is an illegal play if the catalyst

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.870 
which is an illegal play if the catalyst
touches<00:02:00.679> a<00:02:00.710> microphone<00:02:01.190> or<00:02:01.399> a<00:02:01.490> microphone

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
touches a microphone or a microphone

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.460 
touches a microphone or a microphone
touches<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.360> catalyst<00:02:02.840> then<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.110> catalyst

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
touches a catalyst then the catalyst

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.010 
touches a catalyst then the catalyst
goes<00:02:03.649> off<00:02:03.830> and<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.039> get<00:02:04.159> its<00:02:04.280> benefit<00:02:04.840> so<00:02:05.840> for

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
goes off and you get its benefit so for

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.660 
goes off and you get its benefit so for
instance<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:06.319> could<00:02:06.409> place<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:06.890> here<00:02:07.190> it's

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
instance I could place this here it's

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.009 
instance I could place this here it's

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.530 
play I don't get the benefit to here
though<00:02:28.340> because<00:02:28.370> I've<00:02:28.760> attached<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.180> catalyst

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
though because I've attached a catalyst

though because I've attached a catalyst
to<00:02:29.569> a<00:02:29.720> catalyst<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.500> need<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.069> attach<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.519> a

microphone to get some effect however if
I<00:02:33.799> rotate<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.190> tile<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.489> place<00:02:34.549> it<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:34.820> this

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
I rotate the tile and place it like this

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.420 
I rotate the tile and place it like this
it<00:02:35.269> still<00:02:35.959> links<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.470> orange<00:02:36.799> microphones<00:02:37.250> and

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
it still links to orange microphones and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.620 
it still links to orange microphones and
now<00:02:37.610> I've<00:02:37.700> linked<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.000> microphone<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.600> a

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
now I've linked a microphone to a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.050 
now I've linked a microphone to a
catalyst<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.260> goes<00:02:39.380> off<00:02:39.560> again<00:02:43.060> another

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
catalyst so it goes off again another

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.340 
catalyst so it goes off again another
type<00:02:44.299> of<00:02:44.329> catalyst<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.959> double<00:02:45.230> dot

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
type of catalyst is the double dot

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.920 
type of catalyst is the double dot
catalyst<00:02:46.180> if<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.359> attach<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.810> a

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
catalyst if you attach that to a

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.360 
catalyst if you attach that to a
microphone<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.440> get<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.650> draw<00:02:48.799> two<00:02:48.980> tiles

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
microphone you get to draw two tiles

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.560 
microphone you get to draw two tiles
from<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.609> general<00:02:49.940> supply<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.299> add<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.540> to

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
from the general supply and add it to

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.030 
from the general supply and add it to
your<00:02:50.750> personal<00:02:51.109> supply<00:02:53.230> as<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.440> said<00:02:54.620> there<00:02:54.859> are

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
your personal supply as I said there are

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.949 
your personal supply as I said there are
tiles<00:02:55.430> called<00:02:55.820> big<00:02:56.060> microphones<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.690> act<00:02:56.810> as

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
tiles called big microphones that act as

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.410 
tiles called big microphones that act as
both<00:02:57.140> microphones<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:57.890> catalysts<00:02:58.489> so<00:02:59.269> for

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
both microphones and catalysts so for

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.170 
both microphones and catalysts so for
instance<00:02:59.660> I<00:02:59.810> can<00:02:59.959> play<00:03:00.079> this<00:03:00.230> here<00:03:01.180> this

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
instance I can play this here this

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.940 
instance I can play this here this
counts<00:03:02.510> as<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.690> green<00:03:02.900> microphone<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:03.769> it's

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
counts as a green microphone so it's

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.080 
counts as a green microphone so it's
still<00:03:04.130> legal<00:03:04.310> play<00:03:04.519> because<00:03:04.760> I've<00:03:04.850> attached

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
still legal play because I've attached

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.940 
still legal play because I've attached
it<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.390> different<00:03:05.690> green<00:03:05.989> microphone<00:03:06.410> since

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
it to a different green microphone since

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.069 
it to a different green microphone since
it<00:03:07.070> also<00:03:07.220> acts<00:03:07.549> as<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.760> cross<00:03:08.030> catalyst<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.690> get

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
it also acts as a cross catalyst I get

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.099 
it also acts as a cross catalyst I get
an<00:03:09.170> extra<00:03:09.440> turn<00:03:09.620> I<00:03:10.299> can<00:03:11.299> take<00:03:11.420> might<00:03:11.570> return<00:03:11.870> to

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
an extra turn I can take might return to

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.670 
an extra turn I can take might return to
link<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.590> here<00:03:13.989> again<00:03:14.989> it's<00:03:15.290> illegal<00:03:15.500> play

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
link this here again it's illegal play

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.810 
link this here again it's illegal play
because<00:03:15.950> remember<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:16.489> is<00:03:16.640> still

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
because remember this is still

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.610 
because remember this is still
microphone<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.510> as<00:03:18.049> you'll<00:03:18.200> notice<00:03:18.260> I've

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
microphone and as you'll notice I've

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.710 
microphone and as you'll notice I've
linked<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.010> microphone<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.670> catalyst<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:20.450> again

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
linked a microphone to catalyst so again

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.300 
linked a microphone to catalyst so again
I<00:03:20.900> get<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.109> benefit<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.620> cross<00:03:21.799> which<00:03:22.280> is

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
I get the benefit of the cross which is

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.930 
I get the benefit of the cross which is
another<00:03:22.670> turn

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.790 

the<00:03:27.750> second<00:03:28.080> action<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.410> could<00:03:28.560> take<00:03:28.680> with

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
the second action you could take with

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.200 
the second action you could take with
your<00:03:28.950> turn<00:03:29.100> is<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.340> draw<00:03:29.580> tile<00:03:29.850> from<00:03:30.030> your

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
your turn is a draw tile from your
