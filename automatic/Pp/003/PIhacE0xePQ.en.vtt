that hardener can get absorbed into it

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.210 
that hardener can get absorbed into it
and<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:54.780> need<00:01:54.930> all<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.470> hardener<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.890> order<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
and we need all the hardener in order to

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.740 
and we need all the hardener in order to
thoroughly<00:01:56.520> mix<00:01:56.730> with<00:01:57.090> our<00:01:57.210> resident<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.720> the

thoroughly mix with our resident for the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.930 
thoroughly mix with our resident for the
pipe<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.260> work<00:01:58.380> correctly<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.730> let<00:01:59.850> me

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
pipe so it's work correctly so let me

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.310 
pipe so it's work correctly so let me
just<00:02:00.120> emphasize<00:02:00.180> one<00:02:00.659> more<00:02:00.810> time<00:02:01.050> how

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
just emphasize one more time how

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.380 
just emphasize one more time how
important<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.980> to<00:02:02.220> get<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.820> hardener<00:02:03.120> mix

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
important it is to get the hardener mix

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.270 
important it is to get the hardener mix
thoroughly<00:02:03.600> into<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> resin<00:02:04.409> basically<00:02:05.159> it's

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
thoroughly into a resin basically it's

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.219 
thoroughly into a resin basically it's
all<00:02:05.370> in<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.490> mix

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
all in the mix

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.380 
all in the mix
so<00:02:06.950> right<00:02:07.100> now<00:02:07.219> I'm<00:02:07.340> just<00:02:07.369> thoroughly<00:02:07.759> mixing

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
so right now I'm just thoroughly mixing

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.360 
so right now I'm just thoroughly mixing
the<00:02:08.810> hardener<00:02:09.140> into<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.470> resin<00:02:12.370> fully

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
the hardener into the resin fully

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.369 
the hardener into the resin fully
preparing<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.239> just<00:02:14.510> make<00:02:14.690> sure<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:14.989> get<00:02:15.110> all

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
preparing it just make sure you get all

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:22.720 
preparing it just make sure you get all
of<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:16.480> mixture<00:02:17.480> completely<00:02:19.150> smooth<00:02:21.730> okay

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
of that mixture completely smooth okay

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.070

I'm just going to grab some of that pipe
seal<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:28.069> apply<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.640> all<00:02:28.849> sides<00:02:29.180> that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.699

doesn't really matter what it looks like
at<00:02:33.830> this<00:02:33.950> point<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.700> can<00:02:34.880> shave<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.269> off<00:02:35.390> later

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319

heat quick so on I've grabbed a standard

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.660 
heat quick so on I've grabbed a standard
heat<00:02:46.940> gun<00:02:47.440> I'm<00:02:48.440> now<00:02:48.590> going<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:48.829> apply<00:02:49.130> heat<00:02:49.489> to

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
heat gun I'm now going to apply heat to

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.009 
heat gun I'm now going to apply heat to
the<00:02:49.730> pipe<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:50.120> product<00:02:50.540> I'm<00:02:50.750> gonna<00:02:50.870> make<00:02:50.989> sure

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
the pipe so product I'm gonna make sure

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.979 
the pipe so product I'm gonna make sure
that<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.380> get<00:02:51.440> both<00:02:51.829> ends<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.730> pipe<00:02:52.989> nice

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
that I get both ends of the pipe nice

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.059 
that I get both ends of the pipe nice
and<00:02:54.290> hot<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:55.060> little<00:02:56.060> bit<00:02:56.150> underneath<00:02:57.069> right

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
and hot a little bit underneath right

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.430 
and hot a little bit underneath right
now<00:02:58.250> has<00:02:58.610> somewhat<00:02:59.420> of<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.569> philosophy<00:03:00.079> finish

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
now has somewhat of a philosophy finish

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.970 
now has somewhat of a philosophy finish
and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.280 

it's<00:03:03.159> gonna<00:03:03.310> start<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.670> build<00:03:04.170> as<00:03:05.170> it's<00:03:05.409> curing

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
it's gonna start to build as it's curing

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:16.059 
it's gonna start to build as it's curing
begins<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.530> Mardin

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:30.460 

quite<00:03:16.879> nice<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.359> mine

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.900 

and<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.710> can<00:03:30.860> see<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.190> that<00:03:31.430> finish<00:03:31.760> is

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
and you can see that that finish is

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.150 
and you can see that that finish is
beginning<00:03:32.800> to<00:03:33.800> go

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.940 

okay<00:03:37.520> so<00:03:37.700> now<00:03:37.820> it's<00:03:38.470> completely<00:03:39.470> don't<00:03:39.680> finish

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
okay so now it's completely don't finish

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.090 
okay so now it's completely don't finish
which<00:03:40.220> means<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:40.850> it's<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.210> fully<00:03:41.840> cured<00:03:42.170> nice

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
which means that it's a fully cured nice

which means that it's a fully cured nice
and<00:03:43.340> setup<00:03:43.670> now<00:03:44.450> we're<00:03:44.570> gonna<00:03:44.690> go

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
and setup now we're gonna go

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
and setup now we're gonna go
okay<00:03:47.300> so<00:03:47.360> we've<00:03:47.840> left<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.110> pipe<00:03:48.290> cool<00:03:48.500> down

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
okay so we've left the pipe cool down

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.260 
okay so we've left the pipe cool down
it's<00:03:51.320> fully<00:03:51.590> cured<00:03:51.920> now<00:03:52.070> as<00:03:52.700> you<00:03:52.940> can<00:03:53.060> see<00:03:53.180> it

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
it's fully cured now as you can see it

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.690 
it's fully cured now as you can see it
