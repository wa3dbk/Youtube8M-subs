it is actually gun patch cloth and it's
white<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.700> what<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.880> did<00:01:51.180> was<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.860> use<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.100> a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
white so what I did was I use just a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.560 
white so what I did was I use just a
regular<00:01:53.370> magic<00:01:54.060> marker<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.260> make<00:01:55.440> it<00:01:56.210> black

regular magic marker to to make it black

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.520 
regular magic marker to to make it black
I<00:01:57.600> used<00:01:57.900> a<00:01:58.110> sharpie<00:01:59.600> then<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.720> put<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.230> in

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
I used a sharpie then I put that in

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.550 
I used a sharpie then I put that in
place<00:02:01.740> where<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.190> holes<00:02:02.460> were<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.320> I<00:02:04.320> used

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
place where the holes were and I used

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.430 
place where the holes were and I used
the<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> rubber<00:02:05.160> cement<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:07.110> noticed

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
the the rubber cement and I noticed

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.920 
the the rubber cement and I noticed
there<00:02:07.590> was<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.980> stress<00:02:08.399> cracks<00:02:08.790> all<00:02:09.180> all<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
there was like stress cracks all all the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.110 
there was like stress cracks all all the
way<00:02:09.990> around<00:02:10.320> here<00:02:10.619> some<00:02:10.920> one<00:02:11.040> all<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:12.030> way

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
way around here some one all the way

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.210 
way around here some one all the way
went<00:02:12.360> around<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.990> surround<00:02:13.670> too<00:02:14.670> with<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
went around the surround too with the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.790 
went around the surround too with the
rubber<00:02:17.220> cement<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.930> there's<00:02:19.140> another<00:02:19.410> patch

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
rubber cement and there's another patch

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.940 
rubber cement and there's another patch
right<00:02:20.160> here<00:02:20.220> there's<00:02:21.210> another<00:02:21.740> pretty<00:02:22.740> good

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
right here there's another pretty good

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.870 
right here there's another pretty good
hole<00:02:23.240> right<00:02:24.240> right<00:02:24.540> there<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.190> used<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
hole right right there so I used the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.720 
hole right right there so I used the
patch<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.390> do<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:29.400> think<00:02:29.459> what

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
patch to do that and I think what

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.790 
patch to do that and I think what
someone<00:02:30.030> had<00:02:30.180> done<00:02:30.420> was<00:02:30.690> when<00:02:31.620> they<00:02:31.740> were

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
someone had done was when they were

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.760 
someone had done was when they were
mounting<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.280> speaker<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.880> think<00:02:33.180> they<00:02:33.770> shoved

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
mounting the speaker I think they shoved

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.220 
mounting the speaker I think they shoved
the<00:02:35.070> studs<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.209> cabinet<00:02:36.750> through<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
the studs in the cabinet through the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.850 
the studs in the cabinet through the
surround

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
surround

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.790 
surround
I<00:02:37.890> think<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.250> would<00:02:38.430> put<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.790> holes<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.800> so

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
I think this would put the holes in so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.590 
I think this would put the holes in so
let<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.130> be<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.370> lesson<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.730> us<00:02:41.940> all<00:02:42.120> be<00:02:42.420> real

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
let that be a lesson to us all be real

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.720 
let that be a lesson to us all be real
careful<00:02:42.900> putting<00:02:43.350> speaker's<00:02:43.890> mounting<00:02:44.610> in

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
careful putting speaker's mounting in

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.000 
careful putting speaker's mounting in
the<00:02:44.850> cabinet's<00:02:45.330> because<00:02:45.540> cz<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.590> put<00:02:46.800> holes

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
the cabinet's because cz you put holes

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.580 
the cabinet's because cz you put holes
through<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.459> through<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.970> paper<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:49.500> that's

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
through the through the paper so that's

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.670
