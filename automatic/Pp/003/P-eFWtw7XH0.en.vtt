 tutorial of cowen cheating in videogames 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.759
 all that variety of a program called chepe cinema 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.849
 This is the one that decides 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.130
 it is a crime of lesa unmarked from the jury 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.519
 also know as 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.390
 also know as 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.189
 aitor of rumors about free 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.499
 few days the government does not know how it works and to do so choose a classic 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.499
 of the old ones I mean the one of super mario bros 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.590
 what we do not want to do is this or brain since what we have started 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.860
 we will see chance to him 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.860
 the emulator along with the program that I showed you 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.860
 it was like I have started the videogame now we go randomly 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.980
 the xerez has 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.980
 We call when we open a house that will open this window 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.950
 we go from here where it is with what shines 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.370
 and it will open a list of processes 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 in this list of processes 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.480
 we press the double run button 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.130
 for what 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.380
 did not show the wells that are running into account at this time 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.149
 we look for the work in this case teresa vera 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.520
 jn 3 0 points 6 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.960
 our list of processes 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.960
 we search 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.000
 So be it 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.430
 the other one we stumble we press to what there is 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.430
 at this time we already have it in the villacero room 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.780
 the best way the comptroller 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.780
 find codes of being judged and that we play 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.480
 they provoked ceres this place is in total seasons since 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.660
 this collector to work 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.130
 as they found him morelos what I have to do is grab 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.160
 the three winners of the video game 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
 we returned to our program before 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.179
 liquid of that bulwark value 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:16.639
 in the bar he claimed he got two out of 100 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.579
 as you will see we grab two coins 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.889
 and those act values 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.719
 we reiterate clip people 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.059
 first stereo that did not locate part 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:29.059
 5000 results 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.059
 obviously no more than one of them is the profile we are looking for 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.779
 we return to the river as if to catch a bad win 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.379
 We were Javier a residence 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:46.999
 we click on the name of 70 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.629
 type of scan 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.029
 on this visit 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.029
 we put you here that increased our value 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.069
 wants after we do pérez who says it following careers 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.389
 no doubt this only three 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.829
 --results 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.949
 let's pay off the check 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.949
 has the same number of discomforts with the video game 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.499
 ubera 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:18.529
 we are going to dedicate the way in which we can have until the goal in the test 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.649
 someday and managers of the postseason 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.209
 in the first with Ávila March inn 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.179
 warns again in love 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:28.769
 notice that yes 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.769
 if I keep playing like that 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.839
 we have located 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.459
 the counter the currency 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.459
 let's find out 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:51.779
 we are going to put the locations through the network but in this case we are going to 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.349
 freeze value 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.349
 to always have the twenty so 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:00.249
 as hierarch the bottom part 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:15.099
 carmona that rice as if every time he grabbed claimed lagarde 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.940
 the first base of the raptors to score 42 25 scholarships is from the Caesar 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.940
 so I've been collecting a lot of coins 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.870
 now if you want to see even more cheaters 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.520
 what a dictator we put him 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.520
 the naval signature of the border region 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.469
 pinto is going to get went crazy 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:09.370
 there are days that I do not have to grab moragas 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.370
 to make reality 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.669
 but not enough 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.819
 we can activate exhibits the trick here tells us decision 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:29.860
 we can put you 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.960
 for example 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.960
 in his name the trick he was able to find 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.659
 and we can save this code in it 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.659
 the desk for german 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.150
 statements that we wanted to win but the video game will be charged 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:49.900
 link the wall 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.879
 - It seems that no 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:55.689
 and we can ask to load here directly the trick without needing 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.689
 go searching again 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:03.029
 as you can see 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.969
 that's because he wants to look for values 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:25.969
 values ​​highlighted these known values ​​on the previous day 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.159
 for him palm the second part of the money 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.960
 I will show you how against locating values 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.120
 unknown in the video game fighters are known values ​​but 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.120
 they do not look at the naked eye 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:43.520
 already to say goodbye I'd like to 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.949
 send a greeting to my cameraman 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.089
 cameraman and video editor and when to oscar what is 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:54.240
 in his farewell words but possible 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.800
 for 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.509
 to operate 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.030
 doubts and comments look at their ordered phases dress up of frac web inf 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.870
 until next time
