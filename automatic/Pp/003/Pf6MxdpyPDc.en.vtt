a great way for you to develop your
round<00:01:52.799> kicks<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
round kicks and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.060 
round kicks and
power<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.210> speed<00:01:54.530> well<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.590> took<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.890> weights

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
power and speed well I took the weights

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.789 
power and speed well I took the weights
out<00:01:56.220> I<00:01:56.460> felt<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.909> lot<00:01:57.299> faster<00:01:57.840> absolutely<00:01:58.530> fast

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
out I felt a lot faster absolutely fast

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
out I felt a lot faster absolutely fast
