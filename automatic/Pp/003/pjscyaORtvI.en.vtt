00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
here's what the mitt looks like when I

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.100 
here's what the mitt looks like when I
face<00:01:37.229> wrist<00:01:37.829> strap<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.220> came<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:39.110> that's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
face wrist strap I came up with that's

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.630 
face wrist strap I came up with that's
probably<00:01:40.350> about<00:01:40.470> my<00:01:40.680> third<00:01:40.890> attempt<00:01:43.640> that's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
probably about my third attempt that's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.190 
probably about my third attempt that's
gonna<00:01:45.079> fit<00:01:46.079> underneath<00:01:46.740> here

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.370 

and<00:01:51.330> hopefully<00:01:52.330> it'll<00:01:52.479> work<00:01:52.600> pretty<00:01:52.930> well<00:01:53.020> a

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
and hopefully it'll work pretty well a

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.789 
and hopefully it'll work pretty well a
little<00:01:54.720> fuzzy<00:01:55.720> padding<00:01:56.110> underneath<00:01:56.380> and

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
little fuzzy padding underneath and

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.460 
little fuzzy padding underneath and
sewed<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.159> edges<00:01:57.720> it's<00:01:58.720> not<00:01:58.869> perfect<00:01:59.320> but

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
sewed the edges it's not perfect but

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.320 
sewed the edges it's not perfect but
it's<00:01:59.799> gonna<00:02:00.100> be<00:02:00.250> functional<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:00.850> think<00:02:01.180> it'll

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
it's gonna be functional I think it'll

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.480 
it's gonna be functional I think it'll
work<00:02:01.390> just<00:02:01.509> fine<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.290> I'll<00:02:03.040> show<00:02:03.250> you<00:02:03.340> what

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
work just fine and I'll show you what

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.609 
work just fine and I'll show you what
commit<00:02:03.759> looks<00:02:04.060> like<00:02:04.290> completed<00:02:05.290> in<00:02:05.350> just<00:02:05.560> a
