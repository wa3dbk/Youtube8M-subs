00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.400
 11 13 13 modern medicine is unthinkable 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.839
 without high technology precision 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.090
 diagnostic equipment 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.130
 today has become permanent and irreplaceable 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.800
 assistant doctors of almost everyone 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.260
 the realities of the real revolutionary 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.359
 changes in recent years experiencing 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.310
 classical radiology 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.470
 radiology and ultrasound studies 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.279
 supplemented with this modern method 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.600
 visualization 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.850
 as computed tomography technique 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.829
 allows you to explore all the organs and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.379
 human body systems receive 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:52.289
 information about their states allows 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:56.329
 get very thin and small sections with 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.899
 their subsequent computer processing 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.239
 computed tomography is 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.250
 high tech highly informative 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.610
 method and radiological 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.500
 computed tomography studies this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.470
 above all accurate diagnosis and 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.060
 minimum of human intervention 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.490
 and in a very short time without 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.070
 extra punctures and cuts are very 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.830
 informative in the study 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.880
 brain because others 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.600
 research methods do not allow 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.820
 penetrate the bones of the skull it 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.110
 facial skull examination of accessory 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.820
 sinuses of the temporal bone with 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.670
 having here opinion one of the onions 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.160
 this study

 neck with laryngeal thyroid 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.900
 pelvic organs are indispensable 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 computed tomography and 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.850
 study of the bones of the skeleton of the joints 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.170
 spine especially

 lumbosacral large 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.770
 help this visualization method has 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.110
 and dentists 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.810
 for example, without it is very difficult to correctly 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.180
 and qualitatively put the implant however 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.730
 there are diseases in the diagnosis of which 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.640
 computed tomography is a method 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.600
 selection of great information computer 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.280
 tomography has a diagnosis of diseases 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.230
 light that MRI 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.010
