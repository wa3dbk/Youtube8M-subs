Adventures of rad gravity for the
nintendo<00:00:11.309> entertainment<00:00:11.340> system<00:00:11.910> or<00:00:12.769> nests

whatever<00:00:14.580> let's<00:00:15.540> just<00:00:15.660> start<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:17.779> so<00:00:18.779> this

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
whatever let's just start this so this

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.950 
whatever let's just start this so this
is<00:00:18.930> right<00:00:19.260> gravity<00:00:19.529> ship<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:21.210> computer<00:00:21.660> talks

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
is right gravity ship and computer talks

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.620 
is right gravity ship and computer talks
to<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.430> it's<00:00:23.430> telling<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.330> i<00:00:24.359> go<00:00:24.539> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
to you it's telling you you can i go to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.890 
to you it's telling you you can i go to
one<00:00:24.779> place<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:26.150> as<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.390> progress<00:00:27.720> through

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
one place and as you progress through

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.160 
one place and as you progress through
the<00:00:28.140> game<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.710> kind<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.640> branches<00:00:30.150> off<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:31.080> you

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the game it kind of branches off and you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.510 
the game it kind of branches off and you
go<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> more<00:00:31.619> places<00:00:33.110> but<00:00:34.110> really<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.399> to

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
go to more places but really you have to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.360 
go to more places but really you have to
go<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> every<00:00:35.850> place<00:00:36.890> or<00:00:37.890> else<00:00:38.040> they'll<00:00:38.250> be

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
go to every place or else they'll be

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.549 
go to every place or else they'll be
really<00:00:38.640> difficult<00:00:39.440> so<00:00:40.670> let's<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.879> this

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.010 

basically<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> plot<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.370> game<00:00:48.020> isn't

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
basically the plot of the game isn't

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.830 
basically the plot of the game isn't
really<00:00:49.440> known<00:00:49.890> unless<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
really known unless you have the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.779 
really known unless you have the
instruction<00:00:52.410> man<00:00:53.059> manual<00:00:54.170> which<00:00:55.170> i<00:00:55.980> don't

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
instruction man manual which i don't

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:04.039 
instruction man manual which i don't
have<00:00:56.940> anymore<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:59.660> display<00:01:02.510> this<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
have anymore so display this is just a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.149 
have anymore so display this is just a
basic<00:01:05.450> platformer<00:01:09.650> takes<00:01:10.650> place<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
basic platformer takes place in the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.090 
basic platformer takes place in the
future<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:14.220> i<00:01:14.549> already<00:01:14.939> got<00:01:15.060> hit<00:01:15.439> whatever

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.609 

so<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.490> game<00:01:20.670> isn't<00:01:20.880> really<00:01:21.240> known<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:22.409> my

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
so this game isn't really known to my

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.580 
so this game isn't really known to my
knowledge<00:01:23.420> because<00:01:24.420> i<00:01:24.659> hear<00:01:24.869> no<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.350> talked

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
knowledge because i hear no one talked

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.350 
knowledge because i hear no one talked
about<00:01:27.110> like<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.290> didn't<00:01:28.560> hear<00:01:28.710> any<00:01:28.920> rad<00:01:29.880> gravity

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
about like I didn't hear any rad gravity

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.830 
about like I didn't hear any rad gravity
for<00:01:30.570> brawl<00:01:30.930> or<00:01:30.960> anything<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.840> it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
for brawl or anything like that so it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.490 
for brawl or anything like that so it
can't<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> known<00:01:36.200> well<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.409> just

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
can't be that known well it's just

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.880 
can't be that known well it's just
another<00:01:37.890> flat<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.990> platform<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> NES<00:01:41.240> so

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
another flat for platform for the NES so

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.530 
another flat for platform for the NES so
and<00:01:44.150> there's<00:01:45.150> loads<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.320> those<00:01:47.510> but<00:01:48.510> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and there's loads of those but I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.990 
and there's loads of those but I
particularly<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.190> grew<00:01:50.940> up

guys<00:03:08.519> can<00:03:08.820> actually<00:03:09.209> be<00:03:09.329> used<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.750> hit<00:03:09.900> each

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
guys can actually be used to hit each

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.150 
guys can actually be used to hit each
other<00:03:10.230> which<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.310> really<00:03:11.519> cool<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.890> other<00:03:14.040> one

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
other which is really cool the other one

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.569 
other which is really cool the other one
didn't<00:03:14.400> shoot<00:03:14.610> or<00:03:15.540> whatever<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.400> these<00:03:17.400> guys

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
didn't shoot or whatever and these guys

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.680 
didn't shoot or whatever and these guys
kind<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.970> hurt<00:03:18.120> right<00:03:18.329> now<00:03:20.390> well<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.570> the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
kind of hurt right now well it is the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.920 
kind of hurt right now well it is the
first<00:03:21.840> level

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.300 

and<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.020> like<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.410> how<00:03:27.560> there's<00:03:27.830> different

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
and I like it how there's different

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.940 
and I like it how there's different
enemies<00:03:28.670> in<00:03:28.850> every<00:03:29.180> world<00:03:29.590> which<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.740> have<00:03:30.830> to

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
enemies in every world which you have to

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:39.250 
enemies in every world which you have to
adjust<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.400> which<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.330> really<00:03:32.510> cool<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:39.110> is

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
adjust to which is really cool this is

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.920 
adjust to which is really cool this is
kind<00:03:39.470> of<00:03:39.500> like<00:03:39.590> a<00:03:39.650> halfway<00:03:39.950> point<00:03:40.810> there's<00:03:41.810> not

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
kind of like a halfway point there's not

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.040 
kind of like a halfway point there's not
many<00:03:42.110> of<00:03:42.260> them<00:03:42.320> in<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.530> game<00:03:42.710> I<00:03:43.840> really<00:03:44.840> can't

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
many of them in the game I really can't

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.630 
many of them in the game I really can't
think<00:03:45.230> of<00:03:45.380> any<00:03:45.500> of<00:03:45.680> their<00:03:45.860> once<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.920> yeah<00:03:49.310> I

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
think of any of their once so yeah I

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.560 
think of any of their once so yeah I
went<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.450> picked<00:03:50.630> up<00:03:50.750> our<00:03:51.340> gun<00:03:52.340> our<00:03:52.970> first<00:03:53.240> one

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
went to picked up our gun our first one

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.790 
went to picked up our gun our first one
which<00:03:54.440> basically<00:03:54.830> updates<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.670> laser<00:03:55.880> sword

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
which basically updates the laser sword

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.910 
which basically updates the laser sword
already<00:03:57.880> we<00:03:58.880> just<00:03:59.060> started<00:03:59.210> the<00:03:59.330> game<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.500> yeah

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
already we just started the game so yeah

already we just started the game so yeah
laser<00:04:03.920> sword<00:04:04.250> will<00:04:04.490> come<00:04:04.730> in<00:04:04.850> handy<00:04:04.880> later

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
laser sword will come in handy later

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
laser sword will come in handy later
when<00:04:06.140> we<00:04:06.260> find<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.560> better<00:04:06.710> one<00:04:06.950> right<00:04:07.760> now<00:04:08.170> kind

when we find a better one right now kind

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:17.110 
when we find a better one right now kind
of<00:04:09.230> useless<00:04:12.010> as<00:04:13.010> a<00:04:13.190> gun<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.640> just<00:04:14.150> as<00:04:14.330> strong<00:04:16.120> so

so<00:07:02.760> now<00:07:02.880> that's<00:07:03.180> done<00:07:04.669> should<00:07:05.669> be<00:07:05.820> able<00:07:06.060> to

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:06.389 
so now that's done should be able to

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:12.530 
so now that's done should be able to
finish<00:07:06.600> up<00:07:06.870> this<00:07:06.990> level<00:07:11.090> so<00:07:12.090> that's<00:07:12.300> pretty

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.060 
much the first level of rat gravity I
don't<00:07:15.720> think<00:07:15.780> there's<00:07:16.200> any<00:07:16.380> more<00:07:16.530> enemies<00:07:16.680> the
