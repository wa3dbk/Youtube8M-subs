the<00:04:13.470> Norwich<00:04:13.739> of<00:04:13.830> one<00:04:13.950> or<00:04:14.099> vice<00:04:14.130> versa<00:04:14.520> you

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
the Norwich of one or vice versa you

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.819 
the Norwich of one or vice versa you
know<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:15.599> that<00:04:15.630> kind<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:16.049> evens<00:04:16.560> things<00:04:16.620> out

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
know so that kind of evens things out

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.229 
know so that kind of evens things out
and<00:04:16.980> I<00:04:17.070> think<00:04:17.250> that's<00:04:17.400> pretty<00:04:17.549> good<00:04:17.730> process

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239
