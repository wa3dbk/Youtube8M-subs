00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.199
 timor steffens is one of the throwing 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.810
 graves associated with julia and he makes 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.090
 part of the graph there is no itself 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.739
 plays in the i'm hungry 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.420
 I'm here today at the codarts 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.680
 college of the arts that is 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.570
 actually a school district itself also two 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.610
 and have studied for half a year before I 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.110
 moved to alone and I am now 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.640
 actually so right now 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.530
 I'm recording an audition 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.089
 keep his students behind me 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.480
 or second-year students 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.480
 very talented 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.550
 that again in the Netherlands of course 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.020
 known for its second place at so you 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.820
 think you can dance 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.220
 but also as possible dances of 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.010
 Michael Jackson and at the moment he is 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.740
 a dance in by the dancers of madonna 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.470
 his dance will have a small link 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.380
 to hip-hop and will be after 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.070
 continued with the entire orchestra 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.650
 the poor families image of mosul or one 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.070
 piece full of violence and and special sounds 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.840
 which is actually a border crossing 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.390
 towards hip hop so I try to look 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.910
 how to put a sticker together 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.490
 where I use elements that affect me 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.530
 have inspired in in in in in 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.390
 during my career so i did 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.920
 for this piece i have amazing 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.920
 dancers from codarts who totally 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.530
 are technically and modernly trained and 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.750
 I also have two very, very talented ones 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.060
 urban dancers and come more from hip hop 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.130
 scene and i want to see how i way it 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.759
 can find to put that together 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.320
 a real 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.340
 to look up a bit of a contradiction 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.340
 with the orchestra 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.750
 lots of emotion synthesizer and stiles 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.300
 and avoided appointment new 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.300
 I like him but the guest and ice cream coupe 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.080
 polite and had doubts in two 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.370
 amusement contemp w bush herent 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.670
 want very bad exalith for brand 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.010
 sprite 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.860
 yes it is a combination of modern 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.320
 dance and also classical 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.360
 technology that uses what you post as to 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.500
 be precise in the music sentinel 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.880
 increase 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.880
 chance of no ships per page 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.489
 and I do not want to wait but especially 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.489
 patience so you can see 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.489
 Yes
