00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
apparently like the Japanese that's the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.940 
apparently like the Japanese that's the
way<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.540> they<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:21.990> oh<00:01:22.259> wow

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
way that they do it oh wow

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.670 
way that they do it oh wow
and<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.570> they<00:01:24.659> tested<00:01:25.080> over<00:01:25.200> there<00:01:25.409> no
