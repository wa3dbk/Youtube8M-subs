00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
at the ends of each tray and I don't

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.420 
at the ends of each tray and I don't
like<00:01:02.420> those<00:01:02.659> to<00:01:02.839> get<00:01:02.960> plugged<00:01:03.260> up<00:01:03.469> with<00:01:03.739> seed

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.899 
know if you can see that here's the
alfalfa<00:02:45.159> so<00:02:46.159> now<00:02:46.310> we're<00:02:46.459> going<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.610> go<00:02:46.790> ahead

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
alfalfa so now we're going to go ahead

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.290 
alfalfa so now we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:47.470> put<00:02:48.470> them<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.769> EZ<00:02:48.950> green<00:02:49.250> sprout<00:02:49.550> err

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
and put them in the EZ green sprout err

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.770 
and put them in the EZ green sprout err
so<00:02:52.300> here's<00:02:52.569> my<00:02:52.810> easy<00:02:53.019> green<00:02:53.260> sprouter<00:02:53.680> and

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
so here's my easy green sprouter and

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.420 
so here's my easy green sprouter and
I've<00:02:55.780> gone<00:02:55.989> ahead<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.459> placed<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.670> two<00:02:57.849> trays

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
I've gone ahead and placed the two trays

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.180 
I've gone ahead and placed the two trays
inside<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.610> sprouter

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
inside the sprouter

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.130 
inside the sprouter
now<00:03:03.190> there's<00:03:03.400> enough<00:03:03.610> room<00:03:03.879> in<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.720> EZ<00:03:04.840> Green

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
now there's enough room in the EZ Green

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.839 
now there's enough room in the EZ Green
sprouter<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:06.040> hold<00:03:06.390> up<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.629> five<00:03:07.870> trays<00:03:08.849> so

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
sprouter to hold up to five trays so

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.600 
sprouter to hold up to five trays so
that<00:03:10.000> means<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.420> can<00:03:10.709> start<00:03:11.709> one<00:03:11.980> tray<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.519> a

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
that means you can start one tray and a

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.580 
that means you can start one tray and a
few<00:03:12.910> days<00:03:13.060> later<00:03:13.120> start<00:03:13.720> another<00:03:13.900> tray<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.440> so

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
few days later start another tray and so

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.130 
few days later start another tray and so
on<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.010> forth<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.840> continually<00:03:16.840> have

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
on and so forth and continually have

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.430

fresh<00:03:17.530> sprouts<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:18.280> eat<00:03:19.019> throughout<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.110> week

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
fresh sprouts to eat throughout the week

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.550 
fresh sprouts to eat throughout the week
and<00:03:20.620> month<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:23.910> as<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:24.970> former<00:03:25.569> commercial

sprout<00:03:27.010> grower<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.579> have<00:03:28.360> found<00:03:28.629> that<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.079> easy

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
sprout grower I have found that the easy

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.809 
sprout grower I have found that the easy
green<00:03:29.440> sprouter<00:03:30.450> easily<00:03:31.450> rivals<00:03:32.819> the

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
green sprouter easily rivals the

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.150 
green sprouter easily rivals the
commercial<00:03:34.480> equipment<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:35.109> I<00:03:35.140> used<00:03:35.530> in<00:03:35.890> the

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
commercial equipment that I used in the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.229 
commercial equipment that I used in the
past<00:03:37.170> not<00:03:38.170> only<00:03:38.230> in<00:03:38.769> growing<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.489> strong

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
past not only in growing a strong

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.080 
past not only in growing a strong
healthy<00:03:40.690> sprout<00:03:41.019> but<00:03:41.950> also<00:03:42.160> in<00:03:42.640> growing<00:03:42.879> the

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
healthy sprout but also in growing the

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.759 
healthy sprout but also in growing the
sprouts<00:03:43.390> a<00:03:44.049> lot<00:03:44.769> more<00:03:45.040> quickly<00:03:45.750> than<00:03:46.769> growing

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
sprouts a lot more quickly than growing

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.490 
sprouts a lot more quickly than growing
in<00:03:48.040> jars<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.900> we'll<00:03:50.680> go<00:03:50.829> ahead<00:03:50.859> and<00:03:52.319> come<00:03:53.319> back

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
in jars so we'll go ahead and come back

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.080 
in jars so we'll go ahead and come back
tomorrow<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:54.129> see<00:03:54.310> how<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.519> sprouts<00:03:54.940> are

er that I didn't mention yesterday is I
don't<00:04:09.459> have<00:04:09.579> to<00:04:09.700> soak<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.090> seed<00:04:10.329> before<00:04:10.900> I

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
don't have to soak the seed before I

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.690 
don't have to soak the seed before I
plant<00:04:11.169> it<00:04:11.290> which<00:04:11.440> is<00:04:11.590> kind<00:04:11.799> of<00:04:11.859> nice<00:04:12.010> it<00:04:12.310> just

are looking amazing and I have to add
some<00:04:45.880> water<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.690> reservoir<00:04:47.080> today<00:04:47.380> too<00:04:47.440> I

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
some water to the reservoir today too I

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.710 
some water to the reservoir today too I
usually<00:04:48.099> have<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.340> do<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:48.610> every<00:04:49.210> couple<00:04:49.660> of

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
setup where water is added automatically

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.610 
setup where water is added automatically
that's<00:04:57.820> pretty<00:04:58.090> simple<00:04:58.330> so<00:04:59.169> anyways<00:04:59.469> we'll

like the sprouts are ready to be greened

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.710 
like the sprouts are ready to be greened
up<00:05:10.020> so<00:05:10.470> I'm<00:05:10.770> going<00:05:10.889> to<00:05:10.949> go<00:05:11.040> ahead<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:11.720> take

up so I'm going to go ahead and take

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.200 
up so I'm going to go ahead and take
them<00:05:12.840> out<00:05:12.900> of<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.110> sprouter<00:05:13.380> as<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:13.710> can<00:05:13.860> see

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
them out of the sprouter as you can see

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.450 
them out of the sprouter as you can see
growing<00:05:15.210> in<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.389> EZ<00:05:15.539> Green<00:05:15.810> is<00:05:16.020> not<00:05:16.979> only<00:05:17.190> easy

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
growing in the EZ Green is not only easy

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.520 
growing in the EZ Green is not only easy
but<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:18.090> sprouts<00:05:18.419> do<00:05:18.660> grow<00:05:18.870> up<00:05:18.960> quicker<00:05:19.259> than

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
but the sprouts do grow up quicker than

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.920 
but the sprouts do grow up quicker than
growing<00:05:20.160> them<00:05:20.340> in<00:05:20.430> jars<00:05:20.669> half<00:05:21.419> grow<00:05:21.660> them<00:05:21.810> in

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
growing them in jars half grow them in

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.710 
growing them in jars half grow them in
jars<00:05:22.110> before<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.860> takes<00:05:23.759> about<00:05:23.880> six<00:05:24.270> or<00:05:24.389> seven

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
jars before and takes about six or seven

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.070 
jars before and takes about six or seven
days<00:05:24.870> I've<00:05:25.110> found<00:05:25.470> in<00:05:25.770> jars<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:27.840> reason

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
days I've found in jars and the reason

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.510 
days I've found in jars and the reason
it<00:05:28.169> takes<00:05:28.320> longer<00:05:28.800> is<00:05:28.860> because<00:05:29.070> they<00:05:29.370> don't

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
it takes longer is because they don't

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.460 
it takes longer is because they don't
get<00:05:29.669> rinsed<00:05:29.940> as<00:05:30.180> off<00:05:30.330> it<00:05:30.539> would<00:05:30.690> be<00:05:30.840> one<00:05:31.020> reason

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
get rinsed as off it would be one reason

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.980 
get rinsed as off it would be one reason
and<00:05:32.090> they're<00:05:33.090> not<00:05:33.240> getting<00:05:33.539> as<00:05:33.630> much<00:05:33.750> oxygen

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
and they're not getting as much oxygen

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.140 
and they're not getting as much oxygen
most<00:05:34.770> definitely<00:05:35.340> like<00:05:35.669> they<00:05:35.789> do<00:05:35.850> an<00:05:36.000> easy

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
most definitely like they do an easy

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.140 
most definitely like they do an easy
