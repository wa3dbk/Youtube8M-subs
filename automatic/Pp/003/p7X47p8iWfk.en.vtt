00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.480 
while Rapunzel is barefoot all the time
so<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.930> thought<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.470> kind<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.680> shoe<00:01:43.920> kind<00:01:44.369> of

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.039 
so I thought what kind of shoe kind of
looks<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.670> barefoot<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.750> found<00:01:45.930> these

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
looks like barefoot and I found these

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.929 
looks like barefoot and I found these
and<00:01:46.560> they're<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> little<00:01:47.070> tan<00:01:47.460> suede

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and they're just a little tan suede

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.240 
and they're just a little tan suede
really<00:01:48.930> dirty<00:01:49.140> now<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.829> wore<00:01:49.979> them<00:01:50.130> at
