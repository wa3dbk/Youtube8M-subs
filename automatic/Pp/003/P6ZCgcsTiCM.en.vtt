lesson today all right well the link I'd

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.400 
lesson today all right well the link I'd
like<00:00:42.790> to<00:00:42.940> do<00:00:43.120> is<00:00:43.329> something<00:00:43.690> actually<00:00:44.020> kind<00:00:44.320> of

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
like to do is something actually kind of

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.350 
like to do is something actually kind of
simple<00:00:44.829> but<00:00:44.860> it'll<00:00:45.399> sound<00:00:45.670> more<00:00:46.000> complicated

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
simple but it'll sound more complicated

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.590 
simple but it'll sound more complicated
than<00:00:46.930> it<00:00:47.050> is<00:00:47.170> but<00:00:47.470> it's<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.829> kind<00:00:48.040> of<00:00:48.070> guy<00:00:51.600> that

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
than it is but it's a kind of guy that

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.840 
than it is but it's a kind of guy that
would<00:00:52.719> be<00:00:52.809> that<00:00:52.989> speed<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:54.489> just<00:00:54.610> basically

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
would be that speed it's just basically

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.220 
would be that speed it's just basically
an<00:00:55.090> atomic<00:00:55.510> grip<00:00:55.630> but<00:00:55.780> just<00:00:55.960> done<00:00:56.079> in<00:00:56.170> a

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
an atomic grip but just done in a

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:09.969 
an atomic grip but just done in a
different<00:00:56.500> position<00:00:56.620> so<00:00:57.239> slowly

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.149 

you<00:01:10.939> can<00:01:11.060> add<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.509> other<00:01:11.659> notes<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.890> reason

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
you can add the other notes the reason

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.249 
you can add the other notes the reason
why<00:01:13.250> I<00:01:13.280> like<00:01:13.460> that<00:01:13.729> that<00:01:14.180> mode<00:01:14.600> is<00:01:14.630> because<00:01:15.020> it

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
why I like that that mode is because it

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.160 
why I like that that mode is because it
transitions<00:01:16.039> very<00:01:16.159> well<00:01:16.729> from<00:01:17.060> from<00:01:17.930> any

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
transitions very well from from any

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.480 
transitions very well from from any
place<00:01:18.439> on<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.770> fret<00:01:18.979> board<00:01:19.009> as<00:01:19.250> you're<00:01:19.399> moving
