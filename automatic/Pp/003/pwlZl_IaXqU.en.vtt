 are now considering their guests 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.550
 combinations of course it's great and 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.310
 it feels like a chance to hit 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.290
 when the joint itself is not necessary to come as it were 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.090

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.030

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.000
 level 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.050
 mastery of the first team of course 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.430

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.830
 youth 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.320
 youth hockey skill level 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.370
 players are therefore faster and faster 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:07.510
 faster we faster movement faster 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.520

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.290
 guys who are still fighting 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:18.609
 they fight are afraid of themselves above all 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.939
