the term dubbing has two meanings one is

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.509 
the term dubbing has two meanings one is
the<00:00:06.480> material<00:00:06.930> which<00:00:07.620> can<00:00:07.830> be<00:00:07.890> both<00:00:08.160> synthetic

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
the material which can be both synthetic

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.270 
the material which can be both synthetic
and<00:00:08.910> natural<00:00:09.440> and<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.590> other<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
and natural and the other is the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.310 
and natural and the other is the
technique<00:00:11.639> involving<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.750> spinning<00:00:13.170> of

technique involving the spinning of

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.730 
technique involving the spinning of
material<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:15.660> range<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.990> dubbing<00:00:16.289> material

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
material the range of dubbing material

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.580 
material the range of dubbing material
is<00:00:16.920> rather<00:00:17.160> huge<00:00:17.520> meaning<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.480> unless<00:00:19.439> you

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
is rather huge meaning you unless you

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.710 
is rather huge meaning you unless you
are<00:00:19.650> making<00:00:19.859> your<00:00:20.100> own<00:00:20.130> blends<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> lot<00:00:21.570> to

will<00:02:35.780> show<00:02:35.989> you<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.410> technique<00:02:37.269> which<00:02:38.269> is<00:02:38.450> the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
will show you the technique which is the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.130 
will show you the technique which is the
most<00:02:38.870> simple<00:02:39.230> one<00:02:39.349> of<00:02:39.470> those<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.069> that<00:02:40.340> is

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
most simple one of those and that is

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.039 
most simple one of those and that is
direct<00:02:42.140> dubbing<00:02:42.470> on<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.890> time<00:02:43.220> thread<00:02:44.049> make

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
direct dubbing on the time thread make

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.610 
direct dubbing on the time thread make
sure<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.799> material<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.340> want<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.549> use<00:02:47.620> is

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
sure the material you want to use is

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.640 
sure the material you want to use is
free<00:02:49.010> from<00:02:49.220> lumps<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.450> prepare<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.380> in<00:02:51.530> your

thread or even take away some by just
ripping<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.470> out<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:40.600> this<00:03:41.600> is<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.780> good

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
ripping it out and this is a good

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.580 
ripping it out and this is a good
opportunity<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:43.840> form<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.049> taper<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.500> the

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
body by making it more narrow in this

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:56.930 
body by making it more narrow in this
