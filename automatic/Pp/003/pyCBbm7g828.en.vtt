00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
course was a Kawasaki Ninja because it

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.130 
course was a Kawasaki Ninja because it
looked<00:00:34.030> like<00:00:34.060> it<00:00:34.270> was<00:00:34.360> from<00:00:34.450> the<00:00:34.570> future<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:34.990> I

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
looked like it was from the future and I

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.040 
looked like it was from the future and I
thought<00:00:35.290> it<00:00:35.410> was<00:00:35.470> the<00:00:35.620> coolest<00:00:35.860> thing<00:00:36.190> ever

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
thought it was the coolest thing ever

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.800 
thought it was the coolest thing ever
and<00:00:38.200> so<00:00:38.740> a<00:00:38.770> couple<00:00:39.040> years<00:00:39.130> went<00:00:39.460> by<00:00:39.520> and<00:00:39.850> I

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
and so a couple years went by and I

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.600 
and so a couple years went by and I
decided<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.230> do<00:00:41.290> some<00:00:41.470> research<00:00:41.620> see<00:00:42.430> if<00:00:42.520> I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
decided to do some research see if I

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.520 
decided to do some research see if I
could<00:00:42.760> actually<00:00:42.880> get<00:00:43.450> into<00:00:43.660> motorcycling<00:00:44.230> and
