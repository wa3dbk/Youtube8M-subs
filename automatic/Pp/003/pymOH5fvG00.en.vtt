out<00:00:46.710> keep<00:00:46.920> coming<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.750> one<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.780> these<00:00:48.930> two

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
out keep coming out so one of these two

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
out keep coming out so one of these two
years<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.590> usually<00:00:49.620> pretty<00:00:50.039> cool<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.969> one's

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
years is usually pretty cool this one's

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.610 
years is usually pretty cool this one's
nice<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.020> at<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.170> beginning<00:00:52.559> of

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
nice because it's at the beginning of

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.229 
nice because it's at the beginning of
the<00:00:52.710> level<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.550> exit<00:00:53.910> out<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the level and you can just exit out and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.600 
the level and you can just exit out and
come<00:00:54.360> back<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:55.010> which<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.129> kind<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.460> we

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
come back in which is kind of what we

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.729 
come back in which is kind of what we
did<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.449> played<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.809> professional<00:00:58.379> our<00:00:58.500> first

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
did we played on professional our first

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.319 
did we played on professional our first
time<00:00:58.949> through<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.760> didn't<00:01:00.059> seek

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
time through so we really didn't seek

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.900 
time through so we really didn't seek
you<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> lot<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.020> enemies<00:01:01.609> we<00:01:02.609> really

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
you see a lot of enemies we really

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.910 
you see a lot of enemies we really
relied<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.270> our<00:01:03.480> guns<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.049> when<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.500> got<00:01:04.710> here

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
relied on our guns so when we got here

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.649 
relied on our guns so when we got here
we<00:01:04.979> had<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.369> kill<00:01:05.549> quite<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> bit<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> zombies<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
we had to kill quite a bit of zombies I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.020 
we had to kill quite a bit of zombies I
think<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> took<00:01:07.560> about<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.070> don't<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.490> three

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
think it took about I don't know three

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.500 
think it took about I don't know three
to<00:01:09.270> five<00:01:10.010> turns<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.180> come<00:01:12.360> in

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
to five turns to get this like come in

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
to five turns to get this like come in
and<00:01:12.659> coming<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.220> eventually<00:01:14.340> got<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and coming out and we eventually got it
