00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 m 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.810
 m 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.910
 and well hello to all these mafia stenting 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.290
 I hope you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.119
 nickel and today we end up 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.700
 for a top 5 of things that annoys me the 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.990
 more in the booth on gta 5 and you 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.789
 go see that you too I think 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.199
 you will find yourself there for those 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.920
 who give themselves a little bit so that's 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.570
 party in 5 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.210
 the first thing that annoys me is 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.470
 when I create a race and my spot 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.760
 is completely rotten the one I 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.710
 chosen at the base I can not manage it 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.000
 do it and then I go to a 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.010
 another who is in the same straight line 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.870
 let's imagine but this spot brings it to me in 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.239
 another direction and there it puts me a 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.920
 big misinterpretations in the middle of the screen and 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.390
 I assure you I have already happened to you 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.530
 for a stone that I managed more and 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.119
 I had the misinterpretation in the middle of 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.040
 the screen it drives me crazy it is necessary to redo 

00:00:53.119 --> 00:01:00.710
 an express race for that in 4 wanted 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.689
 reappear in the race after you are 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.100
 range and the ones with your moto motorcycle is 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:05.510
 right next to you are 200 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.369
 minutes in your race to want 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.140
 try a stock more and more and more and 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.570
 there you press y or triangle to 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.130
 reappear and of course the character 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.329
 he will ride on the bike what must 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.310
 to make you completely crazy 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:20.780
 in any case me it is the case in 3 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.909
 succeed a huge spot without doing it 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.460
 expressly you are in the race to walk you 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.890
 or even solo where you want you 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.109
 wander makes you a huge stone you 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.210
 do not know how of course it's a fail 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.380
 and tell you well I'll have them 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.090
 tried since he looks really good 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.159
 and he looks easy to take 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.469
 and there you will spend the whole evening 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.759
 to them and try and you're not going to 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.759
 not getting there it makes me completely 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.970
 crazy 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.970
 in two 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.120
 Oh 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400
 we 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.969
 and the first thing that annoys me 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.069
 more in the booth on gta 5 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.109
 it does not completely relate to the 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.790
 really stunt in the game but I you 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.349
 explain what it is simply 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.420
 when you keep your best spots 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.700
 for months for a huge benefit 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.829
 is that there you end up your spots 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.329
 in montages more recent than 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.349
 some people have succeeded and 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.700
 blow it right there you are completely 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.700
 disgusted or so some examples 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.480
 Well here is the end of this top 5 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.700
 I hope you will have appreciated and I 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.959
 think you're pretty good at being in 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.520
 the same case as me so if ever 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.020
 leave a little comment to say 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.010
 what do you think I tell you to very 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.550
 quickly for new videos 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.550
 ciao 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.220
