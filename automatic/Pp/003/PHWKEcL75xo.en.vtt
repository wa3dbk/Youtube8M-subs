because sadly and well firstly it's only
well<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.980> only<00:00:11.099> ones<00:00:11.340> they<00:00:11.429> had<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.730> shop

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
well the only ones they had in the shop

well the only ones they had in the shop
in<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.360> size<00:00:12.660> were<00:00:13.019> only<00:00:13.290> available<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.799> this

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
in this size were only available in this

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.519 
in this size were only available in this
rather<00:00:14.160> hideous<00:00:14.580> shade<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.910> blue<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.529> it's

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
rather hideous shade of blue and it's

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.439 
rather hideous shade of blue and it's
painted<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:17.340> two-way<00:00:17.789> plastic<00:00:18.330> though

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
painted on two-way plastic though

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.240 
painted on two-way plastic though
basically<00:00:19.020> they've<00:00:19.439> taken<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.800> cases<00:00:20.130> and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
basically they've taken the cases and

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.340 
basically they've taken the cases and
just<00:00:20.430> spray-painted<00:00:21.060> them<00:00:21.119> cover<00:00:21.420> which<00:00:22.050> I

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
just spray-painted them cover which I

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.620 
just spray-painted them cover which I
think<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.039> prefer<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> solid<00:00:23.609> colored<00:00:24.119> plastic

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
think I prefer a solid colored plastic

it's<00:00:25.170> dead<00:00:25.769> easy<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.189> scratch<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.240> one

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
it's dead easy to scratch this this one

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.710 
it's dead easy to scratch this this one
and<00:00:28.250> it<00:00:29.250> comes<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.609> little<00:00:29.699> instruction<00:00:30.390> manual

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
and it comes a little instruction manual

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260 
and it comes a little instruction manual
and<00:00:31.309> the<00:00:32.309> reason<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:32.700> opened<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.090> there

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
and the reason I have opened it there

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.920 
and the reason I have opened it there
and<00:00:33.590> before<00:00:34.590> actually<00:00:35.579> doing<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:36.000> usual

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and before actually doing this usual

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.979

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
sort of tear apart tape video the reason

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.180 
sort of tear apart tape video the reason
I<00:00:40.020> opened<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.379> before<00:00:40.440> was<00:00:40.739> because<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
I opened it before was because the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.580 
I opened it before was because the
instruction<00:00:42.120> manual<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.629> very<00:00:42.660> clearly

instruction manual is very clearly

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.520

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
to be generic instructions that it comes

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.069 
to be generic instructions that it comes

charging for more than three to five
hours<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.530> definitely<00:02:05.009> don't<00:02:05.250> charge<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.790> for

really

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
really

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.050 
really
I am<00:02:12.689> so<00:02:13.260> just<00:02:13.920> over<00:02:14.069> interests<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.579> made<00:02:14.939> me

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
I am so just over interests it made me

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.089 
I am so just over interests it made me
think<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.540> maybe<00:02:16.079> a<00:02:16.170> charging<00:02:16.709> problem

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
think is this maybe a charging problem

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.129 
think is this maybe a charging problem
that<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.370> know<00:02:17.519> if<00:02:17.879> you<00:02:18.209> leave<00:02:18.329> it<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.599> trickle

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.139 
that you know if you leave it on trickle

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.199 
that you know if you leave it on trickle
charge<00:02:19.349> all<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.560> time<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:20.249> well<00:02:20.430> it's

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
charge all the time just well it's

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.209 
charge all the time just well it's
lithium<00:02:21.659> so<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:21.989> goes<00:02:22.109> up<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.439> 4.2<00:02:22.920> hole

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
lithium so it goes up to the 4.2 hole

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.789 
lithium so it goes up to the 4.2 hole
hopefully<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.019> then<00:02:25.019> goes<00:02:25.349> into<00:02:25.499> standby

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
hopefully and then goes into standby

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.849 
hopefully and then goes into standby
mode<00:02:26.189> and<00:02:26.900> won't<00:02:27.900> push<00:02:28.230> any<00:02:28.409> more<00:02:28.530> current

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
mode and won't push any more current

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.949 
mode and won't push any more current
into<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.219> cells<00:02:29.579> at<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.849> point<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.719> I

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
into the cells at that point and I

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.640 
into the cells at that point and I
tested<00:02:31.409> it<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.859> put<00:02:32.639> a<00:02:32.700> voltmeter<00:02:32.969> on<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.389> and

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
tested it I put a voltmeter on it and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.520 
tested it I put a voltmeter on it and
monitor<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.739> current<00:02:34.889> and<00:02:35.359> it<00:02:36.359> shuts<00:02:36.989> off<00:02:37.170> on

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
monitor the current and it shuts off on

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.500 
monitor the current and it shuts off on
4.2<00:02:38.310> volts<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.879> had<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.900> been<00:02:40.019> note<00:02:40.319> somewhere

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
4.2 volts and had it been note somewhere

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.569 
4.2 volts and had it been note somewhere
which<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.689> had<00:02:42.780> probably<00:02:43.019> lost<00:02:43.349> now<00:02:43.620> we<00:02:44.430> have

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
which I had probably lost now we have

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.209 
which I had probably lost now we have
lost<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.000> note<00:02:45.590> which<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.739> shame<00:02:47.040> really

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
lost the note which the shame really

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.849 
lost the note which the shame really
because<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.489> had<00:02:47.669> a<00:02:47.700> data<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.719> the<00:02:48.840> chips<00:02:49.680> a

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
because I had a data and the chips a

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:58.369 
because I had a data and the chips a
hold<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.129> a<00:02:50.189> second<00:02:56.659> know<00:02:57.659> I've<00:02:57.930> misplaced

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
hold on a second know I've misplaced

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.229 
hold on a second know I've misplaced
that<00:02:58.620> bit<00:02:58.889> of<00:02:59.040> paper<00:02:59.280> with<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.639> data<00:02:59.849> which<00:03:00.120> is

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
that bit of paper with the data which is

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.250 
that bit of paper with the data which is
a<00:03:00.269> shame<00:03:00.569> really<00:03:01.310> yet<00:03:02.310> no<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.549> haven't<00:03:02.689> yes<00:03:03.719> it's

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
a shame really yet no I haven't yes it's

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.789 
a shame really yet no I haven't yes it's
charged<00:03:05.069> up<00:03:05.189> to<00:03:05.310> 4.2<00:03:05.760> volts<00:03:05.939> and<00:03:06.419> then<00:03:07.139> after

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
charged up to 4.2 volts and then after

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.699 
charged up to 4.2 volts and then after
I've<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:08.340> left<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:09.199> charging<00:03:10.199> for<00:03:10.409> ages

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
I've just left it on charging for ages

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.050 
I've just left it on charging for ages
and<00:03:10.829> then<00:03:10.889> measure<00:03:11.189> the<00:03:11.310> voltage<00:03:11.609> again<00:03:11.730> and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
and then measure the voltage again and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.030 
and then measure the voltage again and
it<00:03:12.239> actually<00:03:12.540> dropped<00:03:13.109> down<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.349> four<00:03:13.799> point

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
it actually dropped down to four point

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.280 
it actually dropped down to four point
one<00:03:14.189> seven<00:03:14.489> eight<00:03:14.669> so<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.659> has<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.139> full

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
one seven eight so it has the full

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.530 
one seven eight so it has the full
protection<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:17.069> can<00:03:17.340> leave<00:03:17.549> it<00:03:17.639> charging<00:03:18.060> it

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
protection you can leave it charging it

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.140 
protection you can leave it charging it
also<00:03:18.889> says<00:03:19.889> things<00:03:20.189> they<00:03:20.400> can<00:03:22.909> where<00:03:23.909> is<00:03:24.030> it

on<00:03:55.949> a<00:03:56.009> high<00:03:56.159> current<00:03:56.370> charger<00:03:56.939> and<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.239> low

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
on a high current charger and a low

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.479 
on a high current charger and a low
current<00:03:57.959> charger<00:03:58.379> as<00:03:58.919> long<00:03:59.189> as<00:03:59.280> it's<00:03:59.400> getting

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
current charger as long as it's getting

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.990 
current charger as long as it's getting
5<00:03:59.879> volts<00:04:00.269> it<00:04:00.389> charges<00:04:00.689> about<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.259> usual<00:04:02.069> 788

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
5 volts it charges about the usual 788

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.249 
5 volts it charges about the usual 788
milliamp<00:04:04.099> sort<00:04:05.099> of<00:04:05.159> region<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.599> it's<00:04:06.810> charging

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:07.259 
milliamp sort of region so it's charging

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:08.869 
milliamp sort of region so it's charging
it<00:04:07.409> less<00:04:07.560> than<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.889> whatever<00:04:08.430> load<00:04:08.609> you<00:04:08.729> put

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
it less than that whatever load you put

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.290 
it less than that whatever load you put
it<00:04:08.969> on

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
it on

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.130 
it on
and<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.970> yeah<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:13.450> this<00:04:13.570> is<00:04:13.720> just<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.990> generic

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
and but yeah so this is just a generic

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.590 
and but yeah so this is just a generic
guide<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.250> makes<00:04:15.490> this<00:04:15.700> look<00:04:15.970> really<00:04:16.180> you

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
guide and it makes this look really you

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.880 
guide and it makes this look really you
know<00:04:16.720> if<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:16.930> read<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.110> guide<00:04:17.380> it's<00:04:17.590> like<00:04:17.739> oh

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
know if you read the guide it's like oh

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.350 
know if you read the guide it's like oh
god<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.370> don't<00:04:18.550> want<00:04:18.730> to<00:04:18.790> touch<00:04:18.910> it's<00:04:19.120> going<00:04:19.300> to

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
them is a basically doing the switching

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.350 
them is a basically doing the switching
side<00:05:35.980> because<00:05:36.190> it's<00:05:36.400> connected<00:05:37.120> directly

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
side because it's connected directly

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.830 
side because it's connected directly

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
where to the the inductor here but I'm

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.560 
where to the the inductor here but I'm
not<00:05:40.900> sure<00:05:41.230> with<00:05:41.350> other<00:05:41.470> ones<00:05:41.710> for<00:05:41.950> I<00:05:42.570> thought

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
not sure with other ones for I thought

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.500 
not sure with other ones for I thought
maybe<00:05:43.810> it's<00:05:44.050> for<00:05:44.850> isolating<00:05:45.850> the<00:05:45.940> battery<00:05:46.330> but

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
maybe it's for isolating the battery but

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.570 
maybe it's for isolating the battery but
then<00:05:46.690> if<00:05:47.410> you<00:05:47.620> look<00:05:47.650> down<00:05:47.890> at<00:05:48.070> this<00:05:48.160> end<00:05:48.220> it's

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
then if you look down at this end it's

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.390 
then if you look down at this end it's
got<00:05:48.670> two<00:05:48.880> 6-pin<00:05:49.390> chips<00:05:49.810> it's<00:05:50.110> got<00:05:50.290> our<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:53.400> DW

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
used to disconnect the battery so I'm

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:12.730 
used to disconnect the battery so I'm
not<00:06:06.760> sure<00:06:06.970> this<00:06:07.180> other<00:06:07.330> ones<00:06:07.540> for<00:06:09.180> yeah<00:06:10.210> odd

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.249

but erm other than that other than the

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.230 
but erm other than that other than the
fact<00:06:15.349> the<00:06:15.620> case<00:06:15.830> that<00:06:15.979> it<00:06:16.130> is<00:06:16.160> color<00:06:16.580> and<00:06:16.789> it's

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
fact the case that it is color and it's

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.360 
fact the case that it is color and it's
barely<00:06:17.750> the<00:06:18.289> LEDs<00:06:18.680> are<00:06:18.860> barely<00:06:19.250> visible

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
barely the LEDs are barely visible

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.600 
barely the LEDs are barely visible
through<00:06:19.880> it<00:06:19.970> on<00:06:20.360> that<00:06:20.750> it<00:06:20.930> actually<00:06:21.110> seems

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
through it on that it actually seems

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.070 
through it on that it actually seems
quite<00:06:22.610> a<00:06:22.639> decent<00:06:22.940> chunky<00:06:23.449> little<00:06:23.569> plaque<00:06:23.870> have

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
quite a decent chunky little plaque have

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.969 
quite a decent chunky little plaque have
not<00:06:24.199> checked<00:06:24.530> it<00:06:24.680> for<00:06:24.770> capacity<00:06:25.250> yet<00:06:25.479> but<00:06:26.979> all

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
not checked it for capacity yet but all

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.589 
not checked it for capacity yet but all
the<00:06:28.340> other<00:06:28.430> ones<00:06:28.460> have<00:06:28.789> hads<00:06:28.970> from<00:06:29.270> the<00:06:29.389> same

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 
the other ones have hads from the same

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.080 
the other ones have hads from the same
sort<00:06:29.900> of<00:06:30.020> stable<00:06:31.009> so<00:06:31.190> to<00:06:31.250> speak<00:06:31.550> have<00:06:31.729> had<00:06:31.910> the

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
sort of stable so to speak have had the

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.120 
sort of stable so to speak have had the
the<00:06:32.449> fill<00:06:32.630> capacity<00:06:32.840> it's<00:06:33.319> not<00:06:33.470> the<00:06:33.590> V<00:06:33.680> Chinese

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
the fill capacity it's not the V Chinese

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.680 
the fill capacity it's not the V Chinese
ones<00:06:34.340> that<00:06:34.520> give<00:06:35.000> you<00:06:35.030> the<00:06:35.150> one<00:06:35.360> ampere

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
ones that give you the one ampere

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.800 
ones that give you the one ampere
ourselves<00:06:36.729> but<00:06:37.729> yeah<00:06:37.880> that's<00:06:38.180> decent<00:06:38.630> enough

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
ourselves but yeah that's decent enough

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.839 
ourselves but yeah that's decent enough
it<00:06:39.199> looks<00:06:39.259> alright<00:06:39.590> I'll<00:06:40.009> be<00:06:40.160> giving<00:06:40.460> it<00:06:40.580> some

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849 
it looks alright I'll be giving it some

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.930 
it looks alright I'll be giving it some
use<00:06:41.120> oh<00:06:41.380> there<00:06:42.380> is<00:06:42.500> one<00:06:42.710> thing<00:06:43.099> that<00:06:43.340> is<00:06:43.729> a

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
use oh there is one thing that is a

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.180 
use oh there is one thing that is a
slight<00:06:44.360> niggle<00:06:45.340> if<00:06:46.340> you<00:06:46.550> plug<00:06:46.789> in<00:06:46.909> a<00:06:47.000> lord<00:06:48.190> it

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
slight niggle if you plug in a lord it

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.460 
slight niggle if you plug in a lord it
does<00:06:49.460> that<00:06:49.669> thing<00:06:50.030> where<00:06:50.360> it<00:06:50.659> detects<00:06:51.199> a<00:06:51.319> lord

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:51.470 
does that thing where it detects a lord

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.350 
does that thing where it detects a lord
and<00:06:51.530> it<00:06:51.620> turns<00:06:51.860> on<00:06:52.039> and<00:06:52.340> then<00:06:52.789> do<00:06:52.909> we<00:06:53.000> LEDs

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
and it turns on and then do we LEDs

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.830 
and it turns on and then do we LEDs
start<00:06:54.940> lighting<00:06:55.940> and<00:06:56.240> stuff<00:06:56.419> like<00:06:56.569> that<00:06:56.690> well

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
start lighting and stuff like that well

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.360 
start lighting and stuff like that well
obviously<00:06:56.960> it's<00:06:57.380> fully<00:06:57.590> charged<00:06:57.889> now<00:06:57.979> so

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
obviously it's fully charged now so

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.529 
obviously it's fully charged now so
they're<00:06:58.520> not<00:06:58.580> going<00:06:58.759> to<00:06:58.849> do<00:06:58.940> that<00:06:59.090> sure<00:06:59.389> the

00:06:59.529 --> 00:06:59.539 
they're not going to do that sure the

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:04.059 
they're not going to do that sure the
bar<00:06:59.780> graph<00:06:59.990> level<00:07:00.319> but<00:07:01.310> this<00:07:02.030> one<00:07:03.039> what<00:07:04.039> is

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:04.069 
bar graph level but this one what is

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:05.920 
bar graph level but this one what is
obviously<00:07:04.610> looking<00:07:04.789> from<00:07:05.210> modest<00:07:05.539> load<00:07:05.750> to

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
obviously looking from modest load to

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.659 
obviously looking from modest load to
keep<00:07:06.080> it<00:07:06.229> running<00:07:06.470> because<00:07:07.009> this<00:07:07.190> little<00:07:07.460> M

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669 
keep it running because this little M

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:09.700 
keep it running because this little M
light<00:07:08.180> here<00:07:08.449> just<00:07:08.659> doesn't<00:07:08.900> provide<00:07:09.380> enough

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.710 
light here just doesn't provide enough

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.129 
light here just doesn't provide enough
fluid<00:07:09.979> and<00:07:10.220> after<00:07:11.180> a<00:07:11.210> while<00:07:11.360> it<00:07:11.539> just<00:07:11.569> turns<00:07:11.960> it

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:12.139 
fluid and after a while it just turns it

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:14.469 
fluid and after a while it just turns it
off<00:07:12.259> and<00:07:12.590> alternate<00:07:13.370> it<00:07:13.550> glows<00:07:13.849> very<00:07:14.000> dimly

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 
off and alternate it glows very dimly

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:16.059 
off and alternate it glows very dimly
you<00:07:14.870> can<00:07:14.990> just<00:07:15.169> barely<00:07:15.470> see<00:07:15.620> it<00:07:15.860> glowing

00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:16.069 
you can just barely see it glowing

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:18.550 
you can just barely see it glowing
because<00:07:16.280> it's<00:07:16.430> obviously<00:07:16.729> testing<00:07:17.330> see<00:07:17.659> if

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
because it's obviously testing see if

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.100 
because it's obviously testing see if
you<00:07:19.340> know<00:07:19.460> there's<00:07:19.969> our<00:07:20.150> load<00:07:20.330> there<00:07:20.599> but<00:07:20.780> when

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110 
you know there's our load there but when

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.540 
you know there's our load there but when
you<00:07:21.199> take<00:07:21.380> it<00:07:21.469> out<00:07:21.560> put<00:07:21.770> it<00:07:21.830> back<00:07:21.949> in<00:07:22.250> again<00:07:22.340> it

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.550 
you take it out put it back in again it

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.510 
you take it out put it back in again it
kicks<00:07:22.789> it<00:07:22.940> off<00:07:23.060> again<00:07:23.360> there<00:07:24.199> so<00:07:24.919> it's<00:07:25.340> only

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 
kicks it off again there so it's only

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.050 
kicks it off again there so it's only
suitable<00:07:26.000> for<00:07:26.120> modestly<00:07:26.840> high-ish<00:07:27.650> loads<00:07:28.060> but

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.060 
suitable for modestly high-ish loads but

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.209 
suitable for modestly high-ish loads but
yeah<00:07:29.270> it's<00:07:29.599> a<00:07:29.870> nice<00:07:30.320> enough<00:07:30.560> design

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:31.219 
yeah it's a nice enough design

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:33.550 
yeah it's a nice enough design
that's<00:07:31.460> quite<00:07:31.759> a<00:07:31.820> compact<00:07:32.479> design<00:07:32.690> but<00:07:33.440> it

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 
that's quite a compact design but it

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.890 
that's quite a compact design but it
still<00:07:33.800> has<00:07:34.039> plenty<00:07:34.310> of<00:07:34.520> sort<00:07:34.880> of<00:07:34.909> room<00:07:35.780> around

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900 
still has plenty of sort of room around

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.810 
still has plenty of sort of room around
the<00:07:36.110> circuit<00:07:36.469> board<00:07:36.650> and<00:07:36.919> it<00:07:37.099> all<00:07:37.219> fits<00:07:37.580> very

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:37.820 
the circuit board and it all fits very

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.029 
the circuit board and it all fits very
well<00:07:38.120> and<00:07:38.270> it's<00:07:38.389> got<00:07:38.509> nice<00:07:38.690> robust<00:07:39.530> plastic

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 
well and it's got nice robust plastic

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:43.959 
well and it's got nice robust plastic
films<00:07:40.400> but<00:07:41.300> yeah<00:07:41.990> it's<00:07:42.650> ok<00:07:43.009> it's<00:07:43.310> not<00:07:43.550> too<00:07:43.759> bad

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:43.969 
films but yeah it's ok it's not too bad

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:47.350 
films but yeah it's ok it's not too bad
apart<00:07:44.630> from<00:07:44.780> the<00:07:44.990> the<00:07:45.729> little<00:07:46.729> niggles<00:07:47.000> I<00:07:47.120> have

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 
apart from the the little niggles I have

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.180 
apart from the the little niggles I have
mentioned<00:07:47.870> and<00:07:48.440> the<00:07:48.770> really<00:07:49.389> scare<00:07:50.389> mongering

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:51.190 
mentioned and the really scare mongering

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.649 
mentioned and the really scare mongering
instructions<00:07:52.190> that<00:07:52.430> basically<00:07:52.819> say<00:07:53.509> it's

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:53.659 
instructions that basically say it's

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:55.570 
instructions that basically say it's
going<00:07:53.840> to<00:07:53.900> explode<00:07:54.349> in<00:07:54.560> your<00:07:54.590> hands<00:07:55.039> it's<00:07:55.340> just

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:55.580 
going to explode in your hands it's just

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.300 
going to explode in your hands it's just
weird
