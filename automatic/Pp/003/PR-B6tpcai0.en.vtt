actually get up at like 2:00 you can see

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
actually get up at like 2:00 you can see
it's<00:00:15.360> pretty<00:00:15.990> much<00:00:16.230> all<00:00:16.529> put<00:00:16.859> back<00:00:16.890> together

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
it's pretty much all put back together

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.460 
it's pretty much all put back together
nice<00:00:19.140> red<00:00:19.740> block<00:00:20.250> I'm<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.420> good<00:00:21.630> at<00:00:21.660> painting<00:00:22.020> I

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
nice red block I'm so good at painting I

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.990 
nice red block I'm so good at painting I
didn't<00:00:22.859> think<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.160> side<00:00:23.369> but<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.760> can't

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
didn't think this side but you can't

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.189 
didn't think this side but you can't
even<00:00:24.180> see<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.420> anyway<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.930> doesn't<00:00:25.140> really

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
even see it anyway so it doesn't really

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.330 
even see it anyway so it doesn't really
matter<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:28.080> if<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.619> think<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.039> does<00:00:29.160> matter

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
matter and if you think it does matter

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.040 
matter and if you think it does matter
then<00:00:29.670> your<00:00:29.939> opinion<00:00:30.269> doesn't<00:00:30.480> matter<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:30.929> go

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
then your opinion doesn't matter so go

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.880 
then your opinion doesn't matter so go
 yourself<00:00:31.560> oh<00:00:32.329> la<00:00:33.329> la<00:00:33.510> la<00:00:33.690> la<00:00:33.870> la<00:00:34.079> okay<00:00:34.829> so

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
 yourself oh la la la la la okay so

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.380 
 yourself oh la la la la la okay so
2:00<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.340> morning<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.760> told<00:00:35.850> myself<00:00:36.120> that

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
2:00 in the morning I told myself that

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.700 
2:00 in the morning I told myself that
would<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> cutoff<00:00:36.989> point<00:00:37.140> if<00:00:37.590> this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
would be the cutoff point if this

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.110 
would be the cutoff point if this
thing's<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.010> running<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.610> was<00:00:38.730> gonna<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
thing's not running I was gonna go to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.690 
thing's not running I was gonna go to
bed<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.510> tackle<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.899> tomorrow<00:00:40.550> figured<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
bed and tackle it tomorrow figured that

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.610 
bed and tackle it tomorrow figured that
thinking<00:00:42.059> electrical<00:00:42.570> problems<00:00:42.960> not<00:00:43.260> that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
thinking electrical problems not that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.119 
thinking electrical problems not that
I'm<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.190> slow<00:00:44.520> putting<00:00:45.090> back<00:00:45.239> together

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
I'm so slow putting back together

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.770 
I'm so slow putting back together
so<00:00:47.129> slow<00:00:49.370> got<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> air<00:00:50.640> box<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.210> got<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:51.629> that

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
so slow got the air box and got all that

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.389 
so slow got the air box and got all that
pretty<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.649> whole<00:00:52.890> side<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
pretty much this whole side of the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.060 
pretty much this whole side of the
engine<00:00:53.579> bay<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.879> completely<00:00:54.719> done<00:00:55.820> save<00:00:58.070> plug

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
engine bay is completely done save plug

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.990 
engine bay is completely done save plug
in<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.760> coil<00:01:00.210> which<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.530> guess<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.609> forgot<00:01:02.879> about

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
in the coil which I guess I forgot about

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.929 
in the coil which I guess I forgot about
and<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> can't<00:01:05.189> remember<00:01:05.280> which<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:05.790> goes

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and now I can't remember which one goes

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.140 
and now I can't remember which one goes
on<00:01:06.119> where<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.770> bottom<00:01:08.130> most<00:01:08.340> bolts<00:01:08.670> of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
on where and the bottom most bolts of

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.770 
on where and the bottom most bolts of
the<00:01:11.570> down<00:01:12.570> pipe<00:01:12.780> flange<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.540> can't<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.689> my

pretty<00:01:37.320> much<00:01:37.470> done<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.390> just<00:01:39.390> need<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.840> put<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
pretty much done I just need to put the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.560 
pretty much done I just need to put the
fuel<00:01:40.470> rail<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:44.420> run<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.950> continuity<00:01:46.950> meter

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
fuel rail on run the continuity meter

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.990 
fuel rail on run the continuity meter
voltmeter<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.810> these<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.759> remember

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
voltmeter on these so I can remember

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.139 
voltmeter on these so I can remember
which<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.570> actually<00:01:51.840> goes<00:01:52.320> where<00:01:53.149> because

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
which one actually goes where because

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.810 
which one actually goes where because
I'm<00:01:54.450> pretty<00:01:54.659> sure<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.990> matters<00:01:55.820> probably

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
I'm pretty sure it matters probably

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.120 
I'm pretty sure it matters probably
probably<00:01:57.210> matters<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.990> know<00:01:58.079> when<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> right

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
probably matters you know when the right

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.670 
probably matters you know when the right
valve<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> knob<00:02:00.509> actually<00:02:00.960> spraying<00:02:01.500> fuel

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
valve of the knob actually spraying fuel

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.130 
valve of the knob actually spraying fuel
into<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.159> cylinder<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.149> valve<00:02:03.869> force

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
into that cylinder you know valve force

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.990 
into that cylinder you know valve force
about<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.530> fire<00:02:04.770> let's<00:02:05.130> saw<00:02:05.340> spray<00:02:05.670> some<00:02:05.820> fuel

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
about to fire let's saw spray some fuel

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.969 
about to fire let's saw spray some fuel
in<00:02:06.060> valve<00:02:06.270> 2<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.689> don't<00:02:07.560> want<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> happen

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
in valve 2 I don't want that to happen

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.990 
in valve 2 I don't want that to happen
so<00:02:09.319> or<00:02:10.319> at<00:02:10.679> valve<00:02:11.069> 2<00:02:11.340> because<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:11.879> even

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
so or at valve 2 because it's not even

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.180 
so or at valve 2 because it's not even
open<00:02:12.270> yet<00:02:12.420> all<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.590> attached<00:02:13.890> I

steering wheel I had on plug that so I

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.100 
steering wheel I had on plug that so I
could<00:03:44.909> pull<00:03:45.060> wire<00:03:45.239> in<00:03:45.420> through<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.690> fire

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
could pull wire in through the fire

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.320 
could pull wire in through the fire
firewall<00:03:46.830> gonna<00:03:47.519> have<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.700> plug<00:03:47.879> that<00:03:48.030> back<00:03:48.090> in

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330
