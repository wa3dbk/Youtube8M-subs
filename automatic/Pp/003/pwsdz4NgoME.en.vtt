 between the previous protagonist when leaving 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.159
 he maintains himself with more fans and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.840
 a much richer history explored the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.330
 history of the franchise is focused on a

 enormous eternal war in which assassins and

 games and even in other 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.100
 series media 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.210
 who has many of the curiosities of 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.000
 few creeds are legal of 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.369
 quote but as only a few know is good 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.590
 mention that if the two 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.289
 murderers in which the protagonists are 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.880
 of the game existed and was known as 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.770
 hashish in season 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.420
 not to mention that it was only the brotherhood 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.219
 that was real 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.649
 many of the main characters in the 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.950
 series actually existed between them 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.810
 cesÃ¡rio borga leonardo da vinci galileo 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.680

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.930
 humanity 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.090
 another interesting curiosity is that 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.849
 through steroids and influences 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.799
 found even characters 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.049
 we can conclude that the universe of 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:30.400
 assassin's creed and the hat docs is the same 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.230
