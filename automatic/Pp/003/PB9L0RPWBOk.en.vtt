00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 to everyone new tutorial of art 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.270
 this time a really great idea with 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.890
 which can be made of water 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.110
 take off with any print us 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.300
 we want the idea I saw it on instagram 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.219
 from a girl called yagala who 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.020
 but also the youtube channel and then 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.580
 lincoln and the information box I wanted 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.990
 try it said oh well let's record the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.930
 Video so precisely with them 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.699
 then I applied a base then two 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.289
 pass by a white glaze this is the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.689
 number 72 and pucas 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.429
 then take the prints I want from 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.560
 a glossy magazine and can be 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.420
 so anything can be 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.700
 anything really a face one 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
 figure anything I put top coat on 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.210
 above and wait for me to dry here in the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.100
 meanwhile I had already cut some 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.450
 another image this for example and mark 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.210
 paper and clipping well the image and then 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.920
 I put it in the water to look around 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.559
 thirty forty seconds are enough 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.780
 then gently with the nail 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.399
 I'm going to remove the euro card 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.199
 as you can see it splits just because it is 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.629
 been in the water while the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.129
 fixer then the enamel does not 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.580
 it obviously dissolves with water 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.920
 gently with my nails I go to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.630
 remove all the paper and you must 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.479
 see the image just fine 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.130
 see I no longer have to see paper ie 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.840
 in this case yes there is a paper mark because 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.580
 I want to see the newspaper more 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.240
 but I have to see the image right there 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.640
 is behind it 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.590
 after that, I simply need it 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.970
 put it on the nail on the nail nando 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.090
 put nothing else then mine 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.130
 dry and lean my water take off 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.079
 which therefore I can go to position 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.180
 as best as I can because I can so much 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.329
 take it back here instead I put it 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.900
 the real time logo with the symbol of 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.090
 in live this taking alessio of the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.649
 in short, I did a good mix right 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.689
 because I wanted to try to see how 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.640
 it came so I made my own mix ho 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.840
 also put the symbol of seconds files 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.990
 of summer 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.100
 I put harry day one direction in short 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.479
 as you can see I put a bit of everything 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.729
 just to do tests 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.920
 the idea is really nice 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.420
 because any press from a newspaper 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.159
 from a glossy magazine I can 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.799
 put it over my nails 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.069
 if as in some cases as you have seen 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.720
 already an example with mark paper 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.649
 the image passed your nail from 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.690
 free margin 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.940
 you can safely go to 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.040
 remove the excess with a file of 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.330
 very gently of course here 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.640
 instead I 'm giving it to you 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.110
 cutting out harry to make it fit into the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.750
 better my nail then I took it off 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.280
 a bit of real hair done 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.170
 a hairstyle that we see alessio that 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.280
 omitted on the index and here is the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.900
 moment of harry and on the side then in the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.340
 the cuticle protruded a bit from the image 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.150
 I went to remove it 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.860
 simply correct with a pen 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.840
 enamel because in the end it is 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.790
 just a tom court film 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.700
 then it is removed with the solvent for 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.860
 nails still at the end of all I 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.250
 I simply apply a pass or two 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.500
 passed tops as you prefer and of course 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.209
 the figure will become part of the nail 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.040
 you absolutely don't see that it is something 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.660
 of printed and put on so it is 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.859
 so cool because they are super super 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.560
 thin 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.880
 let me know what you think i will 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.870
 I send a kiss and see you at 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.989
 next video 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.989
 Hello
