softened dreamy kind of like the 24 as
well<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:05.130> still<00:02:05.310> quite<00:02:05.909> usable<00:02:06.390> at<00:02:06.539> a<00:02:06.570> wide

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.810 
focal length as well as a wider aperture
it<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> bit<00:02:13.950> more<00:02:14.160> creamy<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.730> delicious

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
it is a bit more creamy and delicious

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.960 
it is a bit more creamy and delicious
than<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.630> would<00:02:15.900> say<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.319> 35<00:02:16.710> millimeter

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
than I would say the 35 millimeter

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.250 
than I would say the 35 millimeter
alright<00:02:17.970> next<00:02:18.270> in<00:02:18.420> our<00:02:18.480> lineup<00:02:18.750> we<00:02:18.960> have<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
alright next in our lineup we have the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.100 
alright next in our lineup we have the
85<00:02:19.710> 1/2<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.190> think<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.480> book<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:21.750> God

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
85 1/2 I think this is the book of God

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.260 
85 1/2 I think this is the book of God
alright<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.740> 85<00:02:23.069> 1/2<00:02:23.430> has<00:02:23.880> about<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.240> same

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
alright the 85 1/2 has about the same

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.170 
alright the 85 1/2 has about the same
amount<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:25.050> bokeh<00:02:25.290> as<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.650> 50<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:26.910> with<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
amount of bokeh as the 50 but with the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.460 
amount of bokeh as the 50 but with the
additional<00:02:27.630> lens<00:02:27.840> compression<00:02:28.380> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
additional lens compression the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.960 
additional lens compression the
background<00:02:28.860> elements<00:02:29.010> are<00:02:29.250> pulled<00:02:29.490> forward<00:02:29.910> a

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
background elements are pulled forward a

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.640 
background elements are pulled forward a
bit<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.240> they<00:02:30.630> fall<00:02:30.930> out<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.200> focus<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.530> little

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
bit and they fall out of focus a little

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.330 
bit and they fall out of focus a little
bit<00:02:31.830> quicker

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
bit quicker

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.890 
bit quicker
making<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.790> background<00:02:33.000> or<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> book<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
making the background or the book in the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.390 
making the background or the book in the
background<00:02:34.260> look<00:02:34.410> even<00:02:34.650> stronger<00:02:35.099> but<00:02:35.250> it's

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
background look even stronger but it's

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.370 
background look even stronger but it's
also<00:02:35.550> noticeably<00:02:36.390> sharper<00:02:36.630> as<00:02:36.900> well<00:02:37.080> when

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
also noticeably sharper as well when

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.460 
also noticeably sharper as well when
wide<00:02:37.650> open<00:02:38.010> over<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.459> 50<00:02:38.670> million<00:02:38.819> 1.2<00:02:39.330> now<00:02:40.200> it

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
wide open over the 50 million 1.2 now it

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.380 
wide open over the 50 million 1.2 now it
does<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.890> bit<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.580> dreamy<00:02:41.880> softness

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
does have a bit of that dreamy softness

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.390 
does have a bit of that dreamy softness
but<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.870> still<00:02:43.050> pretty<00:02:43.530> awesome<00:02:43.950> when<00:02:44.160> shot

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
but is still pretty awesome when shot

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.100 
but is still pretty awesome when shot
wide<00:02:44.580> open<00:02:44.880> alright<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.450> next<00:02:45.660> we<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:46.020> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
wide open alright so next we have the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.380 
wide open alright so next we have the
100<00:02:46.230> meter<00:02:46.620> f/2<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.190> this<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.550> only<00:02:47.730> non<00:02:48.090> L

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
100 meter f/2 and this is the only non L

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.910 
100 meter f/2 and this is the only non L
lens<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.840> lineup<00:02:49.019> but<00:02:49.230> again<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.650> creates

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
lens in the lineup but again it creates

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.089 
lens in the lineup but again it creates
more<00:02:49.980> bokeh<00:02:50.550> than<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.849> 2.8<00:02:51.750> macro<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:52.920> does

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
more bokeh than the 2.8 macro so it does

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.650 
more bokeh than the 2.8 macro so it does
create<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.400> beautiful<00:02:53.790> amount<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.030> bokeh<00:02:54.300> f2

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
create a beautiful amount of bokeh f2

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.360 
create a beautiful amount of bokeh f2
and<00:02:54.870> with<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.140> 100<00:02:55.680> meter<00:02:55.860> focal<00:02:56.160> length<00:02:56.280> it

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
and with the 100 meter focal length it

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.890 
and with the 100 meter focal length it
has<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.489> really<00:02:56.940> nice<00:02:57.060> look<00:02:57.360> with<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.660> extra

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
has a really nice look with that extra

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.839 
has a really nice look with that extra
compression<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:58.950> also<00:02:59.130> very<00:02:59.400> sharp<00:02:59.730> one

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
compression it's also very sharp one

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.339 
compression it's also very sharp one
wide<00:03:00.000> open<00:03:00.300> but<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.510> does<00:03:00.660> have<00:03:00.840> noticeably

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
wide open but it does have noticeably

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.910 
wide open but it does have noticeably
less<00:03:01.620> bokeh<00:03:02.010> than<00:03:02.340> b85<00:03:02.940> 1.2<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:03.810> we<00:03:04.590> do<00:03:04.709> have<00:03:04.860> a

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
less bokeh than b85 1.2 so we do have a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.740 
less bokeh than b85 1.2 so we do have a
leader<00:03:05.160> here<00:03:05.430> alright<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.060> next<00:03:06.299> up<00:03:06.480> we<00:03:06.600> have

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
leader here alright so next up we have

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.289 
leader here alright so next up we have
the<00:03:06.870> 200<00:03:07.290> million<00:03:07.440> f2<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.180> like

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
bouquet

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.380 
bouquet
all<00:03:44.430> right<00:03:44.579> I<00:03:44.609> would<00:03:44.850> say<00:03:44.970> somewhere<00:03:45.329> between

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
all right I would say somewhere between

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.380 
all right I would say somewhere between
the<00:03:45.840> 51.2<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.040> 85<00:03:47.459> 1/2<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.090> between

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
the 51.2 and the 85 1/2 and between

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.449 
the 51.2 and the 85 1/2 and between
these<00:03:48.690> two<00:03:48.750> I'd<00:03:49.290> probably<00:03:49.350> go<00:03:49.920> with<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.069> 85

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
these two I'd probably go with the 85

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.150 
these two I'd probably go with the 85
1/2<00:03:50.970> simply<00:03:51.780> because<00:03:52.019> when<00:03:52.170> wide<00:03:52.470> open<00:03:52.890> it's<00:03:53.069> a

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
1/2 simply because when wide open it's a

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.890 
1/2 simply because when wide open it's a
bit<00:03:53.400> sharper<00:03:53.910> than<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.180> 50<00:03:54.420> millimeter<00:03:54.600> it

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
bit sharper than the 50 millimeter it

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.750 
bit sharper than the 50 millimeter it
doesn't<00:03:55.170> have<00:03:55.290> that<00:03:55.319> kind<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.769> same<00:03:56.040> dreamy

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
doesn't have that kind of same dreamy

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.640 
doesn't have that kind of same dreamy
hazy<00:03:57.120> look<00:03:57.420> when<00:03:57.569> wide<00:03:57.780> open<00:03:58.079> as<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.290> 50<00:03:58.560> as

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
hazy look when wide open as the 50 as

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.009 
hazy look when wide open as the 50 as
well<00:03:58.890> now<00:03:59.519> with<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.790> 85mm<00:04:00.269> your<00:04:00.600> focal<00:04:00.870> length

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
well now with the 85mm your focal length

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.300 
well now with the 85mm your focal length
we<00:04:01.139> also<00:04:01.380> get<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.739> little<00:04:01.980> bit<00:04:02.069> of<00:04:02.190> additional

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
we also get a little bit of additional

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.740 
we also get a little bit of additional
lens<00:04:02.760> compression<00:04:03.239> that<00:04:03.359> pulls<00:04:03.600> the

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
lens compression that pulls the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.569 
lens compression that pulls the
background<00:04:04.170> forward<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.530> bit<00:04:04.680> more<00:04:04.859> and<00:04:05.040> ends

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
background forward a bit more and ends

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.640 
background forward a bit more and ends
up<00:04:05.670> creating<00:04:05.940> kind<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.329> stronger<00:04:06.840> look<00:04:07.079> to

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
up creating kind of a stronger look to

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.860 
up creating kind of a stronger look to
the<00:04:07.920> bouquet<00:04:08.280> but<00:04:08.880> I<00:04:09.090> actually<00:04:09.269> have<00:04:09.600> three

de bit boat lenses now for a semi
wide-angle<00:04:14.970> lens<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.389> would<00:04:15.630> go<00:04:15.750> with<00:04:15.840> out<00:04:15.989> of

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
wide-angle lens I would go with out of

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.890 
wide-angle lens I would go with out of
35<00:04:16.500> 1/4<00:04:17.100> or<00:04:17.310> with<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.700> 50<00:04:17.970> 1/2<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.539> the<00:04:18.600> 50<00:04:18.840> is

35 1/4 or with the 50 1/2 and the 50 is

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.479 
35 1/4 or with the 50 1/2 and the 50 is
not<00:04:19.019> necessarily<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.620> wide<00:04:19.979> angle<00:04:20.160> or<00:04:20.459> you

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
not necessarily a wide angle or you

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.069 
not necessarily a wide angle or you
really<00:04:20.760> send<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.060> wide<00:04:21.239> but<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.750> does<00:04:21.900> have<00:04:22.019> a

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
really send you wide but it does have a

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.110 
really send you wide but it does have a
wider<00:04:22.289> field<00:04:22.530> of<00:04:22.680> view<00:04:22.740> now<00:04:23.490> personally<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:24.060> do

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
wider field of view now personally I do

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.940 
wider field of view now personally I do
prefer<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.720> 51<00:04:25.110> too<00:04:25.320> but<00:04:25.530> if<00:04:25.620> you're<00:04:25.710> thinking

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
prefer the 51 too but if you're thinking

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.550 
prefer the 51 too but if you're thinking
about<00:04:26.190> getting<00:04:26.490> say<00:04:26.789> the<00:04:26.910> 85<00:04:27.419> 1/2<00:04:27.870> then<00:04:28.440> you

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
about getting say the 85 1/2 then you

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.770 
about getting say the 85 1/2 then you
might<00:04:28.740> be<00:04:28.770> better<00:04:29.010> off<00:04:29.100> going<00:04:29.400> with<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.610> 35<00:04:30.180> 1/4

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
might be better off going with a 35 1/4

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
might be better off going with a 35 1/4
that<00:04:31.050> way<00:04:31.139> you<00:04:31.200> have<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.410> little<00:04:31.500> bit<00:04:31.650> more

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
that way you have a little bit more

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.710 
that way you have a little bit more
variance<00:04:32.340> in<00:04:32.490> your<00:04:32.910> focal<00:04:33.270> length<00:04:33.419> across

variance in your focal length across

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.370 
variance in your focal length across
your<00:04:33.900> primes

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
your primes

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.310 
your primes
either<00:04:34.979> way<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.610> 35<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.389> 50<00:04:36.690> are<00:04:36.870> very

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
either way the 35 and the 50 are very

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
overall look so I would choose between

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.290 
overall look so I would choose between
them<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.650> since<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:41.010> mainly<00:04:41.340> shoot<00:04:41.880> portraits

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
them and since I mainly shoot portraits

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.210 
them and since I mainly shoot portraits
I<00:04:42.630> have<00:04:43.229> the<00:04:43.320> 50<00:04:43.500> Miller<00:04:43.650> lens<00:04:43.919> because<00:04:44.159> it

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
I have the 50 Miller lens because it

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.190 
I have the 50 Miller lens because it
gives<00:04:44.370> me<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.520> bit<00:04:44.849> better

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
gives me a bit better

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.900

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.370

the<00:04:47.300> focal<00:04:47.600> length<00:04:47.630> is<00:04:47.780> just<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.080> bit<00:04:48.260> more

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
the focal length is just a bit more

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.900 
the focal length is just a bit more
conducive<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.950> portraiture<00:04:49.460> because<00:04:49.700> we<00:04:49.820> get

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
conducive to portraiture because we get

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.390 
conducive to portraiture because we get

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
extremely low light but based on the way

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.310 
extremely low light but based on the way
that<00:06:07.790> I<00:06:08.000> shoot<00:06:08.300> I'm<00:06:08.480> generally<00:06:08.900> not<00:06:08.930> looking

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
that I shoot I'm generally not looking

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.410 
that I shoot I'm generally not looking
to<00:06:09.410> create<00:06:09.740> a<00:06:09.770> lot<00:06:10.130> of<00:06:10.250> Boquete<00:06:10.520> with<00:06:11.030> wide

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
to create a lot of Boquete with wide

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.240 
to create a lot of Boquete with wide
angle<00:06:11.720> shots<00:06:11.960> typically<00:06:12.800> when<00:06:12.920> I<00:06:12.980> shoot<00:06:13.190> a

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
angle shots typically when I shoot a

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.800 
angle shots typically when I shoot a
wide-angle<00:06:13.460> image<00:06:13.940> I'm<00:06:14.090> carefully<00:06:14.510> choosing

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
wide-angle image I'm carefully choosing

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.120 
wide-angle image I'm carefully choosing
my<00:06:14.900> composition<00:06:15.440> because<00:06:15.650> we<00:06:15.740> have<00:06:15.830> a<00:06:15.860> lot<00:06:16.100> of

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
my composition because we have a lot of

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.190 
my composition because we have a lot of
things<00:06:16.400> in<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.580> frame<00:06:16.820> and<00:06:17.090> I'm<00:06:17.600> going<00:06:17.990> for

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
things in the frame and I'm going for

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.670 
things in the frame and I'm going for
sharpness

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
sharpness

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.850 
sharpness
so<00:06:19.190> the<00:06:19.310> 2470<00:06:20.090> f28<00:06:20.630> mark<00:06:20.870> ii<00:06:21.080> takes<00:06:21.530> care<00:06:21.830> of

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
so the 2470 f28 mark ii takes care of

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.410 
so the 2470 f28 mark ii takes care of
that<00:06:22.040> roll<00:06:22.280> for<00:06:22.550> me<00:06:22.640> while<00:06:22.940> it<00:06:23.060> does<00:06:23.210> offer

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.420 
that roll for me while it does offer

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.540 
that roll for me while it does offer
also<00:06:23.870> a<00:06:24.200> little<00:06:24.620> bit<00:06:24.740> of<00:06:24.830> bokeh<00:06:25.010> performance

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
also a little bit of bokeh performance

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.090 
also a little bit of bokeh performance
when<00:06:25.760> shot<00:06:26.000> wide<00:06:26.210> open<00:06:26.540> at<00:06:26.690> f28<00:06:27.290> if<00:06:27.470> I<00:06:27.680> were<00:06:27.890> to

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
when shot wide open at f28 if I were to

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.860 
when shot wide open at f28 if I were to
need<00:06:28.250> it<00:06:28.370> the<00:06:28.700> hundred<00:06:28.970> million<00:06:29.090> or<00:06:29.180> f/2<00:06:29.570> it's

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
need it the hundred million or f/2 it's

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.170 
need it the hundred million or f/2 it's
nice<00:06:30.260> but<00:06:30.590> the<00:06:30.680> 85<00:06:31.100> millimeter<00:06:31.550> does<00:06:31.760> a<00:06:31.790> better

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
nice but the 85 millimeter does a better

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.270 
nice but the 85 millimeter does a better
job<00:06:32.330> with<00:06:32.600> the<00:06:32.720> bokeh<00:06:32.960> it<00:06:33.230> creates<00:06:33.590> a<00:06:33.740> higher

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
job with the bokeh it creates a higher

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.790 
job with the bokeh it creates a higher
quality<00:06:34.730> image<00:06:35.030> and<00:06:35.240> if<00:06:35.660> I<00:06:35.780> need<00:06:36.050> that<00:06:36.290> focal

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
quality image and if I need that focal

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.560 
quality image and if I need that focal
length<00:06:36.950> I<00:06:37.070> can<00:06:37.280> use<00:06:37.430> the<00:06:37.610> macro<00:06:37.850> which<00:06:38.300> serves

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
length I can use the macro which serves

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.210 
length I can use the macro which serves
again<00:06:38.900> a<00:06:38.930> different<00:06:39.410> purpose<00:06:39.680> in<00:06:39.740> my<00:06:39.860> toolkit

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
again a different purpose in my toolkit

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.220 
again a different purpose in my toolkit
because<00:06:40.460> I<00:06:40.520> use<00:06:40.640> it<00:06:40.790> for<00:06:40.910> macro<00:06:41.180> photography

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
because I use it for macro photography

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.770 
because I use it for macro photography
or<00:06:42.230> I<00:06:42.260> can<00:06:42.470> also<00:06:42.620> use<00:06:42.860> the<00:06:42.980> 7200<00:06:43.670> f28<00:06:44.240> mark<00:06:44.540> to

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
or I can also use the 7200 f28 mark to

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.680 
or I can also use the 7200 f28 mark to
the<00:06:45.530> 300<00:06:46.100> f28<00:06:46.700> is<00:06:46.820> a<00:06:46.850> beautiful<00:06:47.360> lens<00:06:47.510> but

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
the 300 f28 is a beautiful lens but

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.360 
the 300 f28 is a beautiful lens but
again<00:06:47.960> generally<00:06:48.470> I<00:06:48.500> don't<00:06:48.920> need<00:06:49.190> that

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
again generally I don't need that

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.040 
again generally I don't need that
extreme<00:06:49.760> of<00:06:49.790> zoom<00:06:50.150> with<00:06:50.600> that<00:06:50.750> level<00:06:50.930> of

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
extreme of zoom with that level of

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.080 
extreme of zoom with that level of
low-light<00:06:51.380> performance<00:06:51.410> and<00:06:52.040> it<00:06:52.460> is<00:06:52.550> a<00:06:52.580> very

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
low-light performance and it is a very

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.730 
low-light performance and it is a very
specialized<00:06:53.750> lens<00:06:54.050> and<00:06:54.290> if<00:06:54.380> you're<00:06:54.500> taking

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
specialized lens and if you're taking

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.870 
specialized lens and if you're taking
portraits<00:06:55.130> or<00:06:55.220> something<00:06:55.400> you<00:06:55.460> get<00:06:55.550> this<00:06:55.640> 10

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
portraits or something you get this 10

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.850 
portraits or something you get this 10
so<00:06:56.150> incredibly<00:06:56.780> far<00:06:57.080> back<00:06:57.320> to<00:06:57.500> get<00:06:57.650> them<00:06:57.770> in

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
so incredibly far back to get them in

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.300 
so incredibly far back to get them in
the<00:06:57.920> frame

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
the frame

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.340 
the frame
it's<00:06:58.460> a<00:06:58.700> little<00:06:58.910> bit<00:06:59.030> just<00:06:59.210> too<00:06:59.390> much<00:06:59.600> whereas

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
it's a little bit just too much whereas

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.170 
it's a little bit just too much whereas
the<00:07:00.500> 200<00:07:00.920> f2<00:07:01.130> I<00:07:01.310> can<00:07:01.490> actually<00:07:01.640> take<00:07:01.940> it<00:07:02.030> out<00:07:02.150> on

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
the 200 f2 I can actually take it out on

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.000 
the 200 f2 I can actually take it out on
say<00:07:02.510> an<00:07:02.750> engagement<00:07:03.080> session<00:07:03.560> or<00:07:03.650> portrait

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.010 
say an engagement session or portrait

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.370 
say an engagement session or portrait
session<00:07:04.310> and<00:07:04.670> I<00:07:04.760> can<00:07:04.910> actually<00:07:05.030> find<00:07:05.360> uses<00:07:05.900> to

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
session and I can actually find uses to

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.200 
session and I can actually find uses to
really<00:07:06.650> just<00:07:06.980> narrow<00:07:07.340> down<00:07:07.550> the<00:07:07.730> background

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 
really just narrow down the background

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.610 
really just narrow down the background
to<00:07:08.300> compress<00:07:08.750> everything<00:07:09.020> and<00:07:09.290> create<00:07:09.530> that

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
to compress everything and create that

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.860 
to compress everything and create that
beautiful<00:07:10.010> look<00:07:10.340> in<00:07:10.520> this<00:07:10.670> lens<00:07:10.940> so<00:07:11.510> that's<00:07:11.690> it

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
beautiful look in this lens so that's it

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.880
