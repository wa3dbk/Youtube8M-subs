 satse infobae 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.630
 in a conference his chad attendant dried up exact this is possible 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.630
 in the market 10 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.730
 trinity dates sectors 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.930
 for starting one of the things more 7 bush p 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.490
 because there would be a country 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.800
 a victim mets optician to peru a tantrum that ended 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.060
 it's phone was invented by alexander see 1876 and wireless communication 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.109
 has its countries the intent of the radio by nicola and tesla 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.600
 in the 1880s 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.320
 it was natural socrates technology would be sooner or later combined 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.490
 the importance of cellular telephony this infrastructure required 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.110
 have fun in Celtic cells 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.700
 I studied his name Celso Borges 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.310
 allows you to use frequent tricks that spread through the city 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.740
 in a way that millions of people all scare us cellular lessons 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.480
 musteriense 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.220
 To facilitate your understanding, let's compare with a little 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.030
 because I think that is positive to the touch 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.540
 this means that people communicating by erc one of these 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.680
 apparatuses just before the judge 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.950
 which means that only one person can talk at a time 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.250
 cell phones a sculpture device etc this means that you 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.010
 bush a proposal to talk 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.660
 and the second separate proposal to listen 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.660
 both people the aiem empowered the substations 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.550
 on the other hand potito team usually comes a channel 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.770
 a cell phone and therefore can communicate hathaway and four channels or 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.890
 plus 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.850
 the güerito type of transmitting 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.290
 River lost 1 points and used kilometers made the third points 5 4 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.200
 among these cell phones on the other hand parameters cells divisions 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.690
 within the region and can be changed from one act to another as 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.919
 move 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:19.799
 fairy cells cell phone an incredible transmission range 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.930
 someone is a cell phone can drive hundreds of kilometers and 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.810
 keep a fluent conversation all journey thanks to the cellular system 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.619
 the companies that operate the transmission knew as carrier 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.079
 and see the city through the Celtic cells region 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.269
 each cell is about 26 square kilometers that are normally shaped 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.119
 hexagon 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.499
 of allbebe and hexagonal 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:45.859
 as a key role 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.679
 like what to see now on screen 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:52.499
 each cell has occupation pass and consists of a tower and a small 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.999
 interior that contains the radio equipment 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.369
 cell phones on the other hand have a low power transmitter 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:59.789
 inside of her 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:03.389
 the base of transmission also works with passports our mission 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.610
 it's comical to have some goals between them 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.640
 The low power consumption that the device allows 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.479
 is normally operated with batteries 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.459
 although energy meant small tea 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.259
 this is what makes it possible for the cell phone to be highly portable 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.419
 the cellular system requires a large number of stations is going to be a 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.419
 city ​​or region 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.989
 a large city cueter towers seats 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.340
 but because a lot of people use cell phone the cost per users 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.869
 separated 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:35.709
 when and without cell phone it looked for a signal called cicpc 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.979
 Sígler de system that identifies this act in that control channel 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.639
 the control channel is a sequence that this is the one in front of being a 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.189
 ride uses to communicate between them 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.039
 what this configuration relates magically winning 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:53.619
 if it is that the zone can not against which the sip of a control channel 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:57.569
 then he interprets me as out of optimal range between the battle the 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.719
 message here ica is without service outside of coverage area 

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:04.400
 thorny also allows a signal 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.459
 criticizes the cell in which it is 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.749
 the fans shared question their phone in this cell to take the 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:12.919
 call 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:17.120
 Central communicated by telephone through the control channel to demand 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.879
 that is cooked to use and once the phone and the tower as paris-niza 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.770
 that suffers judges the call connect now we have spoken with another person by 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.969
 a two-way radio 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:32.769
 environment can be done by your tsjc cell the judge in a note that 

00:04:32.769 --> 00:04:35.300
 the strength of the skin appearance 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.639
 on the other hand the base station of the cell so which feels good is 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.250
 chasing and pressing the strength of the signal in all the frequency note that 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.259
 the force of events in afghanistan 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.330
 Xunta seven passes and curtains put through you and some other hotels 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:59.849
 47 control channel is simple that comes also after this relay camps 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.949
 phone at dusk 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.789
 who in the recent transfer spend mguez
