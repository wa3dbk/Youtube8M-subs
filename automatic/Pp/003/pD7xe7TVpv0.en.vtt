 to say talk about it today I wanted to show 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.400
 how to light a fire on the disk I will go 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.680
 to me then we leave immediately with the total 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.900
 liguria born a fireman or the 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.000
 thicket equal value to go near a 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.040
 bush in shining rows once 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.500
 did what pretending belongings 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.660
 of the inventory of purists reappear 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.340
 what eastwood ministers I will need 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.040
 for let's say make fire base with 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.300
 of the tents and these you could but this 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.790
 we'll see other parts 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.560
 I 'll do this tutorial because it's not 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.350
 very simple to understand 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.770
 how to do little you need to do different 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.530
 things then go to a tree 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.290
 let's say bigger and always do what 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.490
 eni in two different times until the tree 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.920
 will not fall once the tree between 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.390
 dropped this option on the wall 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.570
 will try to cut menavo disk wood 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.320
 space taken two and right I was 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.600
 on the ground then they are looking for a space 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.600
 where we say this little to do 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:45.030
 ok as I said you have to 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:47.010
 combine sells them to other issues 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.890
 ex and pick up the second option 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:56.010
 once you have created this base 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.870
 you are preparing the wood I do not follow me and 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.370
 you have to open the magic boxes there 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.420
 will serve precisely to light the 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:06.930
 fire take them in your hand and do 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.280
 shake the knights again I have to do 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.890
 because as we are an evil genius 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.580
 of the fact while it was raining therefore it was not 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.470
 turned on waited for it to finish raining 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.080
 I have recovered the wounds I have 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.600
 approached the fire and the census 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.490

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.890
