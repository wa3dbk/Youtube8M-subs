00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
special to do it for the first time and

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.160 
special to do it for the first time and
in<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.180> manner<00:00:43.360> that<00:00:43.449> we<00:00:43.600> did<00:00:43.870> at<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.140> last

race with Sebastian then inevitably the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.250

just<00:01:09.010> testimony<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:10.120> you<00:01:10.750> know<00:01:10.870> to<00:01:10.930> all<00:01:11.229> the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
just testimony to you know to all the

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.520 
just testimony to you know to all the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.430 

I<00:01:23.760> think<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:25.360> circumstances<00:01:25.570> are<00:01:26.230> slightly

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
I think the circumstances are slightly

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.270 
I think the circumstances are slightly
different<00:01:27.390> last<00:01:28.390> year<00:01:28.780> we<00:01:29.740> made<00:01:29.920> lots<00:01:30.220> of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
different last year we made lots of

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.800 
different last year we made lots of
mistakes<00:01:30.460> through<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.030> year<00:01:31.270> we<00:01:31.540> had<00:01:31.690> some

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
mistakes through the year we had some

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.290 
mistakes through the year we had some
unreliability<00:01:32.470> problems<00:01:33.070> one<00:01:34.060> or<00:01:34.180> two

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
unreliability problems one or two

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.810 
unreliability problems one or two
driving<00:01:34.570> mistakes<00:01:35.050> and<00:01:35.470> we<00:01:35.920> chucked<00:01:36.220> away<00:01:36.550> a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
driving mistakes and we chucked away a

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.910 
driving mistakes and we chucked away a
lot<00:01:37.030> of<00:01:37.060> points<00:01:37.540> so<00:01:37.690> it<00:01:37.750> was<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.870> very<00:01:38.710> difficult

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
lot of points so it was a very difficult

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.640 
lot of points so it was a very difficult
year<00:01:39.220> where<00:01:39.550> we<00:01:39.670> had<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:39.820> quick<00:01:40.090> car<00:01:40.330> but<00:01:41.110> didn't

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
year where we had a quick car but didn't

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.860 
year where we had a quick car but didn't
seem<00:01:41.800> to<00:01:41.950> be<00:01:42.130> able<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.490> make<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.390> count<00:01:43.630> at

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
seem to be able to make that count at

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.610 
seem to be able to make that count at
times<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.520> result<00:01:45.850> was<00:01:46.000> that<00:01:46.630> certainly

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
times and the result was that certainly

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.110 
times and the result was that certainly
the<00:01:47.740> drivers<00:01:48.160> went<00:01:48.340> right<00:01:48.520> down<00:01:48.730> to<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:48.970> wire

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
the drivers went right down to the wire

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.060 
the drivers went right down to the wire
and<00:01:49.240> we<00:01:49.300> really<00:01:50.020> went<00:01:50.200> into<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.470> last<00:01:50.650> race<00:01:50.890> on

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
and we really went into the last race on

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.980 
and we really went into the last race on
the<00:01:51.160> back<00:01:51.310> foot<00:01:51.580> and<00:01:51.850> Fernando<00:01:52.540> looking<00:01:52.810> very

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
the back foot and Fernando looking very

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.190 
the back foot and Fernando looking very
strong<00:01:53.320> so<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:55.150> actually<00:01:55.330> come<00:01:55.660> away<00:01:55.750> with<00:01:56.110> the

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
strong so to actually come away with the

had<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.380> fastest<00:02:11.830> car<00:02:11.890> but<00:02:12.310> we've<00:02:12.820> managed<00:02:13.120> to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
had the fastest car but we've managed to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.410 
had the fastest car but we've managed to
keep<00:02:13.300> our<00:02:13.480> nose<00:02:13.690> ahead<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.700> to

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
chance that as far as the Constructors

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.940 
chance that as far as the Constructors
goes<00:03:21.440> we<00:03:22.280> could<00:03:22.489> end<00:03:22.670> up<00:03:23.110> counting<00:03:24.110> points<00:03:24.379> all

I think if I had to say a single
standout<00:04:20.470> in<00:04:20.889> many<00:04:21.159> ways<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.609> would<00:04:21.669> be<00:04:21.849> Monza

00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:22.379 
standout in many ways it would be Monza

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.260

because you that's not been a happy

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.909 
because you that's not been a happy
hunting<00:04:25.719> ground<00:04:25.960> for<00:04:26.050> us<00:04:26.199> the<00:04:26.319> last<00:04:26.469> few<00:04:26.710> years

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
hunting ground for us the last few years

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.189 
hunting ground for us the last few years
have<00:04:27.099> been<00:04:27.129> off<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.610> pace<00:04:27.819> we<00:04:28.659> went<00:04:28.870> into<00:04:29.080> that

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
have been off the pace we went into that

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.279 
have been off the pace we went into that
race<00:04:29.879> fearing<00:04:30.879> that<00:04:30.909> we<00:04:31.210> would<00:04:31.360> be<00:04:31.569> it<00:04:32.199> would

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
race fearing that we would be it would

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.869 
race fearing that we would be it would
be<00:04:32.349> a<00:04:32.439> damage<00:04:32.770> limitation<00:04:32.949> race<00:04:33.550> that<00:04:33.789> we

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:33.879 
be a damage limitation race that we

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.480 
be a damage limitation race that we
wouldn't<00:04:34.090> really<00:04:34.270> be<00:04:34.479> competitive<00:04:35.430> so<00:04:36.430> to

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
wouldn't really be competitive so to

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.909 
wouldn't really be competitive so to
qualify<00:04:37.360> on<00:04:37.539> pole<00:04:37.750> there<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.229> for<00:04:38.680> Sebastian

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
qualify on pole there and for Sebastian

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.679 
qualify on pole there and for Sebastian
to<00:04:39.449> disappear<00:04:40.449> in<00:04:40.539> the<00:04:40.659> race<00:04:40.840> was<00:04:41.139> a<00:04:42.689> great

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:43.689 
to disappear in the race was a great

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:44.820 
to disappear in the race was a great
surprise<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.379> I<00:04:44.439> think<00:04:44.590> it's<00:04:44.680> those

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
surprise and I think it's those

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.890 
surprise and I think it's those
surprises<00:04:45.250> that<00:04:45.729> always<00:04:46.330> become<00:04:46.689> most

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
surprises that always become most

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.350 
surprises that always become most
memorable<00:04:47.819> crikey

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
memorable crikey

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.050 
memorable crikey

as well so there's been so many there's

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.350 
as well so there's been so many there's

achieve a one two there after the

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.610 
achieve a one two there after the
problems<00:05:09.490> we<00:05:09.580> had<00:05:09.729> in<00:05:09.849> Istanbul<00:05:10.389> last<00:05:10.659> year<00:05:11.020> to

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
problems we had in Istanbul last year to

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.800 
problems we had in Istanbul last year to
go<00:05:11.800> back<00:05:12.009> and<00:05:12.219> get<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.370> one-two<00:05:12.789> this<00:05:12.819> year<00:05:13.360> in

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
go back and get a one-two this year in

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.719 
go back and get a one-two this year in
the<00:05:14.050> manner<00:05:14.259> that<00:05:14.349> we<00:05:14.469> did<00:05:14.680> as<00:05:14.800> well<00:05:14.919> so<00:05:15.219> it's

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
the manner that we did as well so it's

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:27.510 
the manner that we did as well so it's
hard<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.270> hard<00:05:16.810> to<00:05:16.870> name<00:05:17.169> one

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.290 

I<00:05:27.720> think<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:29.080> key<00:05:29.590> thing<00:05:29.620> is<00:05:30.190> that<00:05:30.940> now<00:05:31.090> we<00:05:31.150> can

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
I think the key thing is that now we can

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.839 
I think the key thing is that now we can
just<00:05:31.599> go<00:05:31.750> out<00:05:31.780> and<00:05:31.960> enjoy<00:05:32.319> each<00:05:32.800> race<00:05:33.099> and<00:05:33.430> and

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
just go out and enjoy each race and and

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.689 
just go out and enjoy each race and and
see<00:05:34.360> how<00:05:34.539> he'd<00:05:34.720> you<00:05:35.229> know<00:05:35.319> the<00:05:36.159> results<00:05:36.550> will

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
see how he'd you know the results will

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.570 
see how he'd you know the results will
be<00:05:36.909> as<00:05:37.180> they<00:05:37.900> are<00:05:37.930> but<00:05:38.440> we<00:05:38.680> haven't<00:05:39.009> got<00:05:39.340> that

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
be as they are but we haven't got that

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.180 
be as they are but we haven't got that
constant<00:05:40.210> background<00:05:40.419> pressure<00:05:40.990> of<00:05:41.620> trying

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
constant background pressure of trying

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.089 
constant background pressure of trying
to<00:05:42.340> keep<00:05:43.229> thinking<00:05:44.229> of<00:05:44.379> the<00:05:44.500> championship<00:05:44.979> all

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
to keep thinking of the championship all

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.950 
to keep thinking of the championship all
the<00:05:45.220> time<00:05:45.400> we<00:05:45.610> can<00:05:45.729> just<00:05:45.940> go<00:05:46.360> out<00:05:46.539> and<00:05:46.569> enjoy<00:05:46.750> it

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
the time we can just go out and enjoy it

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.460 
the time we can just go out and enjoy it
and<00:05:47.319> and<00:05:47.620> if<00:05:48.039> we<00:05:48.190> win<00:05:48.370> we<00:05:48.569> win<00:05:49.569> if<00:05:49.960> we<00:05:50.110> don't<00:05:50.289> we

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
and and if we win we win if we don't we

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.189 
and and if we win we win if we don't we
don't<00:05:50.620> it's<00:05:51.550> it's<00:05:51.940> not<00:05:52.150> as<00:05:52.389> key<00:05:52.659> as<00:05:52.840> the

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
don't it's it's not as key as the

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.610 
don't it's it's not as key as the
championship<00:05:54.120> pressure<00:05:55.259> mounting<00:05:56.259> up<00:05:56.379> over

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
championship pressure mounting up over

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.059 
championship pressure mounting up over
the<00:05:56.710> last<00:05:56.830> few<00:05:57.099> races<00:05:57.690> so<00:05:58.690> I<00:05:59.110> think<00:05:59.440> looking

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.069 
the last few races so I think looking

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:02.430 
the last few races so I think looking
forward<00:06:00.340> some<00:06:00.870> purely<00:06:01.870> under<00:06:02.139> sense<00:06:02.319> of

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
forward some purely under sense of

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.890 
forward some purely under sense of
enjoyment<00:06:02.710> terms<00:06:03.699> of<00:06:03.880> India<00:06:04.210> as<00:06:04.330> a<00:06:04.360> Grand<00:06:04.630> Prix

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
enjoyment terms of India as a Grand Prix

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.460 
enjoyment terms of India as a Grand Prix
then<00:06:05.169> always<00:06:06.270> good<00:06:07.270> to<00:06:07.449> go<00:06:07.599> to<00:06:07.659> a<00:06:07.780> new<00:06:07.990> circuit

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
then always good to go to a new circuit

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.469 
then always good to go to a new circuit
to<00:06:08.620> a<00:06:08.680> new<00:06:08.800> continent<00:06:09.310> I've<00:06:09.970> not<00:06:10.240> been<00:06:10.419> to

to a new continent I've not been to

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.420 
to a new continent I've not been to
India<00:06:10.840> before<00:06:11.110> so<00:06:11.229> I'm<00:06:11.319> very<00:06:12.009> much<00:06:12.159> looking

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
India before so I'm very much looking

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.399 
India before so I'm very much looking
forward<00:06:12.610> to<00:06:12.880> that<00:06:13.060> and<00:06:13.270> on<00:06:13.840> a<00:06:13.900> personal<00:06:14.349> note

quite<00:06:26.319> challenging<00:06:26.409> and<00:06:27.129> enjoyable<00:06:27.490> lots<00:06:28.150> of

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
quite challenging and enjoyable lots of

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.740 
quite challenging and enjoyable lots of
undulations<00:06:28.960> and<00:06:29.610> elevation<00:06:30.610> which<00:06:30.849> always

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
undulations and elevation which always

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.980 
undulations and elevation which always
makes<00:06:32.169> a<00:06:32.319> circuit<00:06:33.180> good<00:06:34.180> for<00:06:34.330> spectating<00:06:34.750> I

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
makes a circuit good for spectating I

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.740 
makes a circuit good for spectating I
think<00:06:38.190> what<00:06:39.190> India<00:06:39.430> is<00:06:39.520> gonna<00:06:39.669> be<00:06:39.819> fantastic<00:06:40.719> I

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
think what India is gonna be fantastic I

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.019 
think what India is gonna be fantastic I
think<00:06:40.900> it's<00:06:41.020> gonna<00:06:41.199> be<00:06:41.380> a<00:06:41.880> really<00:06:42.880> good

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:43.029 
think it's gonna be a really good

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:44.969 
think it's gonna be a really good
circuit<00:06:43.509> from<00:06:43.569> what<00:06:43.750> we've<00:06:43.900> seen<00:06:43.930> it's<00:06:44.889> gonna

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
circuit from what we've seen it's gonna

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.850 
circuit from what we've seen it's gonna
be<00:06:45.099> fascinating<00:06:45.279> to<00:06:45.639> go<00:06:45.699> to<00:06:45.880> India<00:06:46.210> and<00:06:46.830> yeah<00:06:47.830> I

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
be fascinating to go to India and yeah I

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.649 
be fascinating to go to India and yeah I
mean<00:06:48.069> the<00:06:48.430> last<00:06:48.610> three<00:06:48.789> races<00:06:48.940> for<00:06:49.300> us<00:06:49.360> to<00:06:49.479> like

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:49.659 
mean the last three races for us to like

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.709 
mean the last three races for us to like

if we find parts in the research for
next<00:07:34.460> year<00:07:34.640> that<00:07:35.300> can<00:07:35.450> be<00:07:35.540> fitted<00:07:35.870> to<00:07:35.960> this

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 
next year that can be fitted to this

next year that can be fitted to this
year's<00:07:36.320> car<00:07:36.620> where<00:07:36.890> we<00:07:37.160> may<00:07:37.550> or<00:07:37.670> may<00:07:37.790> not<00:07:37.820> do<00:07:38.120> so

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 
year's car where we may or may not do so

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.570 
year's car where we may or may not do so
depending<00:07:39.020> on<00:07:39.080> whether<00:07:39.800> that's<00:07:40.040> a<00:07:40.100> part<00:07:40.340> that

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.580 
depending on whether that's a part that

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.090 
depending on whether that's a part that
could<00:07:41.570> if<00:07:41.750> you<00:07:41.870> like<00:07:42.050> be<00:07:42.290> easily<00:07:42.530> copied<00:07:42.770> in

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.100 
could if you like be easily copied in

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.060 
could if you like be easily copied in
therefore<00:07:43.660> give<00:07:44.660> the<00:07:45.170> potential<00:07:45.620> advantage

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.070 
therefore give the potential advantage

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:53.050 
therefore give the potential advantage
for<00:07:46.190> next<00:07:46.460> year<00:07:46.640> away<00:07:51.070> it's<00:07:52.070> just<00:07:52.400> getting

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.060 
for next year away it's just getting

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.750 
for next year away it's just getting
under<00:07:53.300> there<00:07:53.450> now<00:07:53.600> as<00:07:54.260> I'd<00:07:54.740> say<00:07:55.010> it's<00:07:55.490> a<00:07:55.550> matter

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:55.760 
under there now as I'd say it's a matter

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.290 
under there now as I'd say it's a matter
of<00:07:55.850> enjoying<00:07:56.270> the<00:07:56.390> rest<00:07:56.660> of<00:07:56.750> the<00:07:56.810> season<00:07:57.020> and

00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:58.300 
of enjoying the rest of the season and

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.240 
of enjoying the rest of the season and
but<00:07:59.300> getting<00:07:59.570> our<00:07:59.690> heads<00:07:59.870> down<00:08:00.080> and

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.250 
but getting our heads down and

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.790 
but getting our heads down and
concentrating<00:08:01.250> on<00:08:01.340> next<00:08:01.610> year
