00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.520
 so that you also put together 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.660
 It is very simple if you are very classic 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.280
 maybe the lipstick now 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.020
 a bit decent power is great 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.330
 for everyday life, super school if you can 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.460

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.830

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.759

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.009
 and yes that is just a pleasingly on 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.939
 the hot nude eyeshadow are used 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.680
 baked this 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.230
 These are six different ones 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.350
 colors of and they are all so soft 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.550
 and just great pigmented so the 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.850
 I can highly recommend it in front of everyone 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.620
 A user is very natural 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.480
 Every day you have it easy in there 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.070
 can combine so only nude tones yes 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.080
 then I have new eyebrows 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.550
 Products used by very excited 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.830
 was how I'll find them and me 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.510
 think she's super good up to now 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.340
 then I'll have you some time 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.740
 Products used so is a highlight 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.150
 and yes you will then see that 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.220
 only thing I have on it is 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.710
 my my make-up and my concealer 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.510
 because there is no suitable renovation 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.729
 For me, I hope that you 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.040
 video also like and beautiful here 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.180
 see new products or maybe 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.650
 that's what I see anyway 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.850
 interested and writes in the 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.680
 Comments what you might still 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.420
 you also want to see what you already have 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.799
 couple have seen the other videos 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.270
 because I can still imagine that 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.490
 and then I wish you all right now 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.900
 Have fun with the tutorial course 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.090
 I use a brother first and mine 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.619
 already split make up to fix 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.550
 I use this beautiful 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.520
 baked 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.500
 unique user in 10 june that still has 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.810
 non-reflective pigments in there too 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.240
 does not like that he has anyway 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.540
 still looks natural and I just 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.610
 is very marked then I use that 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.170
 then it worked out in 1 bronx in powder 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.300
 in ten sunshine 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.090
 By the way, that does not smell like cocos 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.010
 other sun cloud products and that give 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.410
 I just put something on my face 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.090
 to contour it but I can handle it 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.070
 Do not make a strong account because of it 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.290
 I think that is a little too warm 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.350
 then I take this sticky touch glas 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.790
 in the color 90 summer dreaming and that 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.760
 I think that's really great 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.470
 great pigmented and also has such a 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.970
 Thorough glow in there I can do that 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.160
 Do not really describe it 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.510
 looks really great and then 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.950
 I use again from the 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.110
 previous product just the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.730
 highlighter side that is a very 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.160
 discreet parts what is the situation now 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.110
 better on the lips but it works 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.580
 still very nice, then I start 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.980
 even with the eyes others are there 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.610
 and the kathrin bauerfeind base and 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.350
 the same expensive eyes again something 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.030
 not very strong but a bit 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.610
 and then I use this eichhorn 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.500
 youtube-link shadow in 01 agile and 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.660
 I just have my complete one 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.220
 Do not move and you will see how 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.800
 Cover that is that is also one of the 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.560
 more sounds and then I still had 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.670
 my eyebrows brother with as 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.590
 next i use a song wrong 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.300
 brush the spiritual has to be 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.150
 Blender is and there I use the color 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.790
 05 my favorite topping that's the same 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.209
 a bad orb but the still 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.760
 something yes so that defines the lid fold 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.530
 then something and then also relies 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.050
 a darker tone so the dazzling is 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.150
 here a and o I have that too much 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.430
 get cut out with it but 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.440
 really blinded that looks beautiful then 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.510
 It's even better and that's just it 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.950
 the color 06 coffee beans that's something 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.810
 darker and actually still shimmering 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.310
 Something but you do not have that way now 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.650
 seen and compared that still 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.870
 with a larger hole fluffy gutters 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.820
 and clean brush next target 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.370
 I re-stroke with this one 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.959
 Appeal in bottrop calls he is not new 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.730
 the desire for quite a long time and intel 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.130
 not really great because he is black 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.530
 very easy in the order and is 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.620
 uncovered and next I use 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.690
 first 05 my favorite talking and then 06 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.810
 cafÃ© vienna also at my bottom 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.810
 eyelash wreath 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.970
 after I bent my eyelashes 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.259
 I also use eyelash curler from 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.580
 esther I stumble then my eyelashes 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.680
 but with a bit older 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.570
 mascara she is already longer in the 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.759
 assortment with the syringe 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.470
 Mascara I think you have so great 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.090
 you look at it because you and that 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.520
 creates and thus new ones 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.100
 eyebrow products once the 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.990
 ball fixing penzel that's just the way it is 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.820
 a wax pencil and I just give it 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.370
 on my eyebrows and then you will 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.470
 Do it again with the panties 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.300
 Such monitoring donate stifter you know yes 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.099
 forward to my other videos, it is 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.900
 just one more, not the rent 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.270
 is and I'm really good too 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.099
 Next, I find my eyebrows 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.970
 Nevertheless, continue with the make me woman 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:38.360
 eyebrow oscar ag run and that of 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.160
 has that on such fibers in there that yours 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.320
 eyes are still natural and fuller 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.900
 look and of course that is very much the case 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.310
 this is very reminiscent of this benefit 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.320
 use and I really think so 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.199
 By the way, that was the color 01 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.750
 blondie braus and next on the edge 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.760
 my lips with one of mine 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.280
 favorite highlights products and indeed 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.620
 this is the long lasting lipliner 0 2 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.330
 friedrich am rande them first and fill 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.440
 Look for it because I like the color that way 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.990
 think nice 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.580
 and she also keeps super long like her 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.960
 She is like you can but still go 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.690
 But I have it now 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.909
 left because they last a long time 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.260
 keep even eat and drink and 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.570
 then a few more hours 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.639
 and yes that's my finished look now 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.070
 as I said very natural but still 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.620
 a natural glow and yes something 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.030
 fresh color and yes I hope you guys 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.919
