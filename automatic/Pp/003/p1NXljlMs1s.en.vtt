00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.440
 we know 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.990
 wed 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.490
 on a straight line 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.419
 I do not know whether such a regime was in food 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.499
 but here as it is more real rub say 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.400
 like first person 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.710
 ip cameras and very cool by the way 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.710
 by saying 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.579
 Here is this mode 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.169
 the game was somehow 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.780
 forgot the name 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.780
 there is also running 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.230
 Potap May 1000 Digital Cameras 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 but as salary moron stalks 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.290
 Igor Czech probably answer the answer 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.640
 Junior pipets question so you will not find 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 give attention to the ball 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.190
 environment of course and vata building here and there 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.540
 basically 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.810
 on the one hand it is logical 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.580
 but from another country you could get 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.610
 paint 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.360
 and so generally cool by the way 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.780
 saying i like better for now 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.659
 true arrogance maybe camera 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.659
 switch because no 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.740
 in general, the same football 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.070
 almost like sang with 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.580
 so look closely to him 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.830
 you won't see much difference 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.810
 it is clear that we can say that firstly 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.040
 I suppose this measure 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.040
 I also read that he has one with me 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.710
 she names slowing down books 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.860
 does not slow down but straight along 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.860
 right melody in the truest sense of the word 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.470
 which is generally unpleasant 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.470
 And it is unlikely where it will go most likely 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.140
 plus nuts will be modest saved already 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.140
 as it looks worse than sang with 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.880
 In this regard, Tver shpak pen 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.880
 will definitely 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.739
 and the rest 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.219
 to others about the trace 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.589
 In the opinion of management and senior coach 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:29.589
 something else that I think 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.899
 Generally indifferent 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.309
 rain and bend the fuck 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.909
 and what is it all 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.909
 the president 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.239
 I suppose more and more easier 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.239
 fraps account is affected 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.959
 what is total assets in the article 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.959
 games to play 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.739
 still not cool at all 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.230
 didn't affect the hostel not cool not 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.230
 inserts 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.010
 Well, so about any reluctance to play
