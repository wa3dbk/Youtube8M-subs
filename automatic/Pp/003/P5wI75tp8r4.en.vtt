00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 what hi dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.130
 with nyx and today in what after a couple 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.620
 Easter eggs on the map than the construct or 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.780
 constructs in garry's mod 13 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.809
 Yes, I decided to take a little start 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.630
 in the video as I thought that few 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.520
 knows about those poshalki possible but 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.949
 beginners just do not know exactly but everything 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.410
 the rest let's see first and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.170
 the simplest and at the same time enough 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.460
 funny easter eggs we see we 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.109
 we are on the usual and i am on 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.200
 normal map but here something is not right 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.780
 on the background are rebuilt people and a little 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.079
 rich after death is nothing but what 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.270
 happens we have no one how to do it 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.800
 and how it works well what is it possible 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.480
 You can just call Easter eggs 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.520
 features it as to most likely that is in 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.520
 all maps but i will show you but for 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.949
 rod shown on fly and fly 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.860
 vertically up to penetration 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.140
 through the black layer here it is here we 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.140
 see this city namely the view we see 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.539
 the background is our background this one 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.949
 remove the city here is our town 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.479
 as you can see he is completely passing 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.010
 art can be held itself 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.530
 interesting 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.540
 save up as you can see this died but no from 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.650
 they are cleaned and the essence is better not a performer 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.350
 people who kill each 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.240
 general on this town you can burn that 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.390
 whatever it will be displayed in the map and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.970
 by the way the card itself seems to be 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.800
 which looks you can pass and 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:33.120
 and if we remembered here that is 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:37.620
 let's and here let's remember but not 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.280
 I know so some objects fall through 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.780
 him and tobacco as we did not hold 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.850
 Here we are now back to the bottom and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.060
 we see firstly how to look there 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.290
 below put and it is very simple here 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.000
 so here you see here we have two 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.740
 giant man need of course 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.770
 useless but here we see that 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.190
 tile appeared on the background 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.590
 sofas in general indiana so what we have 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.660
 In general, I think you understand what it is and 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.580
 that with these poison so it was first possible 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.950
 say easter eggs no easter eggs on she 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.520
 interesting and the last last Easter eggs on 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.220
 map and the only 2 on 2 of his standing in 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.990
 In general, what everyone knows this card but 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.630
 some people for some reason don't know a 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.370
 Bundchen them on this map but earlier in 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.160
 early versions he was right here but 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.750
 it was removed and add another place now 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.750
 we can find this bunker and even drop by 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.090
 its even without hwa i followed we must 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.700
 go to this honest building and here where 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.070
 a little bridge is suitable for those 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.940
 say we should we will see here lagado 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.190
 half-life 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.440
 and what does it mean you think well 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.209
 of course the secret passage and we must 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.330
 go to hell cube this dan we appear on 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.120
 bunker 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.940
 it says 13 maybe it's a version 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.470
 harris fashion rush version harris 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.780
 fashion but also for some reason reminds me 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.760
 shelters from fallout 13 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.170
 and then we have here and take off valchik 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.590
 there is a card itself 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.660
 name card developers and there are also 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.670
 low textures of youth wall because 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.410
 my texture is set at least later 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.150
 I will explain why she think so does not matter 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.440
 also we can find here to the corner 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.930
 which by the way is present on others 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.180
 original maps and is some 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.060
 by sending so to speak easter eggs of truth from 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.610
 developers sofa that we can 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.020
 yourself spawn the water and the table that's all yes 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.270
 such a short one decided to show you 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.670
