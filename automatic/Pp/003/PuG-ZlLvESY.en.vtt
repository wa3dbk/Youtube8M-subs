00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.630
 hello hello hello people we're on 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.080
 come back because in the channel starting 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.180
 this 2015 had not uploaded video by 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.980
 issues of time had been 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.210
 busy but we're back here 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.890
 with more videos tutorials blogs and many 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.350
 new things that come in the channel and 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.930
 today to start with this first video 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.290
 of the year I want to bring you a comparison 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.800
 that for many saxophonists especially 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.410
 for playing the gender Northern 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.100
 they ask in what type of mouthpiece 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.680
 use to get better sound because to 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.680
 to the genre that is heard in the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.989
 songs this as it should be more to 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.739
 more to the style as we named 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:01.780
 and well let's compare two nozzles 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:04.460
 which are widely used by different 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.240
 saxophonists is already a matter of 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.340
 perception and from the mouthpiece that some 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.789
 of you already want to use me in what 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.740
 staff because I've only tried this 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.670
 mark that would be the tried larsen that already 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.240
 we all know 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.369
 I have only tried three measures 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.979
 I'm going to show you the two most 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.070
 used we make the comparison and already 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.479
 you choose or decide with which 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.479
 stay of these nozzles 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.570
 lately my window 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.369
 yes 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.240
 This nozzle personally we like 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.240
 its serious as it handles them is a 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.479
 very wide mouthpiece in a matter of 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.470
 sound because in physical matter is a 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.920
 mouthpiece very closed not as much as 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.020
 like 100 or 90 but it's a 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.709
 nozzle that you can handle it very 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.400
 well even when it's cold you can 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.640
 handle very very well and gives you a sound 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.820
 very father in his serious notes ok now 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.070
 let's try the 100 10 over 0 is a 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.880
 Very bright utility is more open 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.880
 that the 100 5 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.580
 but not 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.660
 and they have a little more brightness than 100 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.810
 5 is a little more open therefore 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.600
 she is more tired and with the cold because your 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.700
 jaws will go numbing little to 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:04.420
 little and then it will not get a sound 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.420
 so permanent in every moment 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.900
 but no 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.900
 but not everything 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.920
 but good 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.950
 with everything 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.579
 good race up here the video today the 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.379
 comparison of two nozzles very 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.840
 used in the northern honor 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.560
 I hope you liked it and I have 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.379
 served for you to choose your 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.659
 nozzle with which they wish to work already 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.209
 that it is a matter of comfort that 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:57.329
 you choose I could not you 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.359
 recommend some especially since 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.819
 It is according to your embouchure 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.739
 that I'm used to can be that a 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.510
 make you a little harder another one a little 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:11.669
 brighter and it's a matter of you 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.150
 you choose very well how you want it to sound 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:19.500
 your saxophone and so you can choose the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.609
 mouthpiece that fits with your 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.440
 needs 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.759
