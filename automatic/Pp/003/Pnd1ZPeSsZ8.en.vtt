camo<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.539> would<00:00:27.689> assume<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:27.930> that's<00:00:28.140> just

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
camo and I would assume that that's just

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.290 
camo and I would assume that that's just
because<00:00:28.470> i<00:00:28.650> already<00:00:28.949> had<00:00:29.250> diamond<00:00:29.699> camo

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
