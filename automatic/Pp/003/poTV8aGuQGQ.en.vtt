00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.560
 so I'm going to boot there a little 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.750
 series of two videos that are going to be 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.280
 dedicated to childish songs then 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.900
 not especially for children 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.370
 learn the guitar no it would be 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.160
 rather finally eventually also to that 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.589
 it would be rather for the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.210
 adults starts the guitar but of 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.619
 this way by imagining for example 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.359
 you are parents and you have 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.769
 young children and then so everything 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.119
 just the night of the meeting and 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.329
 pretty stories that was very 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.189
 well you enjoy it too why not 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.550
 for him to fall asleep singing them a 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.550
 little song 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.360
 a sweet song that sings me 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.360
 at 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.250
 that would want them to be locked up round 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.500
 very well to the melodious sounds of the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.080
 guitar and that it will harmonize our 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.790
 apart as music therapy does exist 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.320
 if you have plants next door would like 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.290
 that it will grow better if you do 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.460
 also young people and my songs here 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.769
 so children the plantains 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.619
 ultimately it is the same thing for 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:08.280
 education had the guitar this said 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.930
 So here so if you are also 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.000
 teacher and you work with 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.119
 Children in kindergarten or greater 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.039
 has up to cm2 or even after you can 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.440
 to want to do the guitar is 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.000
 very popular with children 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.740
 and in addition it is very educational and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.119
 very useful to learn songs 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.920
 even texts enjoins the guitar 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.840
 so and more or less songs 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.070
 easy what is practical is that the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.690
 children's songs 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.509
 the famous children's songs at 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.430
 moonlight etc have everyone 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.350
 knows them more or less you yourself 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.940
 you have worked them when 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 visit children you have the melodies 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.479
 in the head so started the guitar 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.000
 with that it will be easy 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.380
 so here is here a game gives a little 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.580
 the explanations for this first 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.630
 video to put things right like 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.270
 I had the opportunity a moment of 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.799
 to take care of that I had thought well 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.390
 to try to find a compromise that 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.970
 be well in all directions then 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.140
 first the chords the songs 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.590
 children I always go to them 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.930
 show in tone of D major so at 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.119
 the guitar 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.649
 for two simple reasons it is that the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.650
 tone had major if you start 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.140
 the guitar is an agreement that is pretty 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.520
 simple to do barrel and when you 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.080
 need to do because of other agreements 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.030
 most childish songs on 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.280
 do them in one two three three four chords 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.300
 maximum the other agreements this front of the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.300
 simple acts to do too 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.990
 whereas if we go to C major 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.990
 will have to make bars and it's not 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.620
 practice here on the other hand if you are 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.690
 in D major 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.250
 it will also be a good height a good 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.440
 compromise for children's voices the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.150
 women's voices and men's voices by 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.670
 example me if I sing in the clear of the 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.530
 brother's moon 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.060
 for me it is a correct author 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.440
 children that will be body is also for them 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.840
 women too so what if you play 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.390
 as is often the case 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.500
 pieces in G major will go for them 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.490
 children for women and for 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.040
 men that may pose problems 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.990
 if they are, for example, baritones 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.520
 is not tenors so here we go 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.920
 I will show you that what will you do 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.770
 allow it to kick if you start the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.290
 guitar to learn about four 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.240
 basic chords the majors the ground 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.700
 the 7th hedge and in particular the 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.610
 minors here and to warn we will do 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.870
 a fifth it allows you to play 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.760
 dozens and dozens of songs 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.400
 childish very easily with very little 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.200
 okay 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.150
 so now that I have done this 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.500
 presentation we go right away 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.120
 do one to show how it's 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.879
 very simple the easier we will do 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.310
 to make Jacques with a single chord 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.810
 major and rubbing it down on 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.610
 the same rhythm as if we were singing in 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.220
 striking in the mores of the brothers 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.540
 each brother 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.540
 every time like that where 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:48.120
 brother jacques fouroux 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.980
 that in 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.410
 in 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.930
 sounded the mornings the only din din 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.090
 din daeng teeth 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.019
 and here I go again slowly to 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.250
 that you can work me brother 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:10.270

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.930

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.880
