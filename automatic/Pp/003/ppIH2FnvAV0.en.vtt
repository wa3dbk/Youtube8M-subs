00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.779
 the roads are alive car week exists twenty years and we are already working one again 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.459
 next big old one 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:11.999
 welcome to car week news from August 4 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:14.919
 the new 9 3 is the first millers of ape 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.299
 american jetta 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.230
 other than the european 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.499
 what's on the paris salon 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:23.449
 currently the saab becomes 9 5 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.050
 as said in the Netherlands 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.589
 but we also look forward to the new saab 9 3 not coming when 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.449
 well in 2012 has been a whole new model as business goes to the 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.039
 Expect Samsons and about a Sisser this year get about 5 out of 5 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.829
 current 9 3 also geert jan nikken however still not different appearance and what 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.060
 modern engines of the weather can compete a bit 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.240
 you can tell further because you get the technology where they get it from 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.530
 9 3 three were 93 bad strokes is going to disappear further that has the most 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.650
 those are the first messages and he now also has the name of 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.470
 everything stands 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.620
 both techniques ladies are still a bit unclear all are huge 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.690
 Apothecaries is busy with b and w getting there 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.360
 after about a complete closing so bmw engines will most likely be 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.240
 but it can still go in all directions 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.140
 but the most beautiful Greeks have the confidence of the Belgians easily 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.190
 Someone who ties that, however, is not broken 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.160
 well i also don't know where his parents the new trainer will come on the market in 2011 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.060
 can be seen this week in wooden week 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.130
 we have driven the new volkswagen jetta 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.659
 however, it was an American version and that differs from the 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:24.550
 European 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.320
 so has the judge for the usa 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.940
 a simple rear axle construction and also the materials for the interior 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.330
 are of lesser quality than Volkswagen is used to at the beginning of 2011 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.680
 European version of the jetta and which is hopefully a lot more refined than the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.570
 American 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.050
 another two months and then this again the paris salon took place 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.200
 one year it is the honor of francs for the other the paris salon 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.300
 In addition, it is the most important European stock market of the year 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.410
 what can we do this year an unexpected 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.820
 the stunner of the paris salon is of course the peso 5 0 8 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.610
 good for the french pride 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.990
 this new middle class does not follow members find seven he must also be the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.750
 sister of seven make dnb suggest the new x3 is for the second generation 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.519
 longer than its predecessor but still weighs and less 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.959
 at the introduction the choice is a three-point turbo petrol engine and 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.189
 signed on diesel four-cylinder also follow with a completely new estate car 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.409
 the v60 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.389
 of course that is a special version of the new s60 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.639
 he is at the paris salon but we are going to start a mmo earlier 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.889
 September get behind the wheel 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:30.060
 If even for another uptake smaller then you can say that it is one 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:34.199
 mental season has penetrated everywhere in paris we get to know the race 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.219
 about your people 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.219
 which comes across it was on the market in the summer of 2011 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:42.389
 of course we will again be celebrating the 20th anniversary this week 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.370
 we look back 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.499
 running for two decades on horseback 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.359
 and then see how in the past twenty years the car is like a dairy cow 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.139
 further 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.419
 naturally this week also has the chance to win the new Mazda MX 5 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.209
