their band so much and what I was not
saying<00:03:21.670> is<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:25.239> board<00:03:25.629> is<00:03:25.959> perfect<00:03:26.849> for

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
saying is that this board is perfect for

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.630 
saying is that this board is perfect for
beginners<00:03:28.299> if<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:28.989> actually<00:03:29.230> grind<00:03:29.920> on<00:03:30.220> once

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
beginners if you actually grind on once

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.039 
beginners if you actually grind on once
or<00:03:30.849> twice<00:03:31.290> it'll<00:03:32.290> break<00:03:32.560> its<00:03:32.620> throat<00:03:33.129> in<00:03:33.220> there

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
or twice it'll break its throat in there

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.809 
or twice it'll break its throat in there
um<00:03:37.290> what<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.319> like<00:03:38.560> teasing<00:03:38.829> boards<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.579> know

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
um what I like teasing boards I know

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.420 
um what I like teasing boards I know
this<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.299> bad<00:03:40.329> for<00:03:40.780> skateboards<00:03:41.349> but<00:03:41.590> it's

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
this is bad for skateboards but it's

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.699 
this is bad for skateboards but it's
like<00:03:42.790> if<00:03:43.150> you're<00:03:43.420> kind<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:43.870> freakish<00:03:44.379> about

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
like if you're kind of freakish about

skateboarding with you like it a lot

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.849 
skateboarding with you like it a lot
that<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.840> would<00:03:46.959> be<00:03:47.079> great<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.829> like<00:03:49.799> take<00:03:50.799> it

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
that it would be great to like take it

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.940 
that it would be great to like take it
out<00:03:51.099> in<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.310> water<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:52.720> that's<00:03:53.650> what<00:03:53.829> I<00:03:53.859> do

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
out in the water and that's what I do

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.770 
out in the water and that's what I do
with<00:03:54.220> this<00:03:54.400> because<00:03:54.909> I<00:03:55.180> got<00:03:55.540> an<00:03:55.780> awesome

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
with this because I got an awesome

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.460 
with this because I got an awesome
really<00:03:58.780> better<00:03:59.019> skateboard<00:04:00.900> just<00:04:01.900> went<00:04:02.169> first

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
really better skateboard just went first

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.129 
really better skateboard just went first
I'm<00:04:03.010> just<00:04:03.310> surprised<00:04:03.790> how<00:04:04.150> much<00:04:04.359> tout<00:04:04.720> torn<00:04:05.049> of

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
I'm just surprised how much tout torn of

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:08.430 
I'm just surprised how much tout torn of
it<00:04:05.290> is<00:04:06.299> even<00:04:07.299> why<00:04:07.540> I've<00:04:07.690> never<00:04:08.139> done<00:04:08.379> anything

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
it is even why I've never done anything

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.990 
it is even why I've never done anything
a<00:04:08.949> bit<00:04:09.160> really<00:04:09.519> just<00:04:10.269> learning<00:04:10.599> how<00:04:10.629> to<00:04:10.780> all

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
a bit really just learning how to all

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.030 
a bit really just learning how to all
and<00:04:13.000> it's<00:04:13.209> already<00:04:13.449> torn<00:04:13.780> up<00:04:13.930> this<00:04:14.349> much<00:04:14.739> I

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
and it's already torn up this much I

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:24.469 
and it's already torn up this much I
really<00:04:15.340> don't<00:04:15.549> know<00:04:15.579> how<00:04:15.730> that<00:04:15.970> got<00:04:16.299> there<00:04:17.970> and

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.000 

it's<00:04:25.479> good<00:04:25.870> for<00:04:25.900> beginner<00:04:26.560> but

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010
