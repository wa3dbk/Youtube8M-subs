00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.530
 and friends, today I'm going to make you another 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.800
 good new recipe this is a reissue 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.810
 of the 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.210
 from the Milanese to the Neapolitan 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.369
 I did some time ago but since the video is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.860
 that looks like that for pooch and I say that 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.570
 I'm going to record it again and also like that 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.640
 I take advantage and see as a couple of them 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.130
 well I will eat one the other will have to 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 give it but do not think it 's good 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.750
 win I'll have to close some of my 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.150
 children because that good coma life is 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.239
 a nice nao is explained you itched in 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.690
 the recipe that I already wrote that is a dish 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.310
 very typical in argentina some 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.550
 Uruguayans have told me that they are fighting 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.019
 there is also eaten much and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.879
 they had the time the world because this 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.530
 It is an extraordinary dish 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.250
 extraordinary that is me since the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.160
 I met and I do not stop eating it I love it and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.100
 I hope that when you do it for your 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.300
 part exactly the same I keep I had 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.800
 a faithful but as here at home or 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.640
 very large pans so I divide it into 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.480
 two this was a stifle fillet that is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.940
 a piece of beef that in short that is 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.640
 very appropriate to do this this guy 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.370
 of fillet 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.110
 I see that compared in flour and egg 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.700
 Now I'm going to fry it and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.190
 then I'm going to put a pizza on 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.070
 they are going to take tomato to put 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.380
 mozzarella cheese I'm going to put the bacon 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.900
 and toss a grated cheese that I have 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.020
 four cheeses on top after I put it 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.910
 to grate the oven and I'm going to put it there 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.509
 if it 's that I'm tool and nothing 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.340
 more than thinking about it I hope it comes out 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.710
 nice to be able to take some pictures and 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.450
 that gives you much envy until I 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.170
 do yes 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.110
 Well, I'm already here giving cane to 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.479
 the customers and the one that caught fried 1 and 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.520
 now writing the second one agrees not 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.799
 open them excessively because as 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.810
 but we will be worse for simply 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.119
 do latina they always do a little bit 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.590
 more then even though it's a steak 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:15.180
 fat you do not have to go to the time of me 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:18.150
 at least I prefer to leave it or a little 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.879
 - done normal because that's how 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.599
 had to do in the oven as you can 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:28.200
 see good I think you appreciate a 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.840
 considerable size and now look already 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.510
 while it's cool I'm doing this one 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.930
 it's not served like that if you see if I put it 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.930
 tomato 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.650
 here as well for the base of the pizza 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.420
 now I'm going to put a couple of slices 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.099
 of mozzarella 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.660
 that this cheese is that I think that 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.660
 we are very appropriate to put this 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.420
 case 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.410
 it runs well after we're going to put it 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.410
 bacon 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:05.310
 smoked bacon in the benito and now 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.240
 just over I'm going to throw we have 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.069
 the 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.099
 the grated cheese and we have here we go 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.260
 an authentic work of art this is a 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.700
 work of art of the routine that 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.330
 they mixed as they say 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.330
 good 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.910
 and if it did not happen I can not do the paris 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.440
 dental 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.440
 and then it seems wonderful to me 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.440
 good 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.810
 like this I think it's appreciated I'll 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.770
 bring the camera a little closer so 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.770
 the best 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.450
 and both of the oven au gratin for five 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.660
 or six cheese tries the blood 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.270
 we make a good picture, good, I have 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.790
 and the two units mounted now 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.160
 I just put the refiner oven 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.770
 at full power 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.620
 i 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.800
 to the center up in the band of the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.269
 terror 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:22.350
 let's see how it looks then 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:25.460
 within a short time this good good 10 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.730
 it smells that it feeds that it takes here 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.790
 It looks extraordinary because it does not 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.550
 can be more than rich because with those 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.720
 conditioning 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.720
 if I'm going to die 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.969
 and painted good is that it's so good 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.679
 look 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.599
 I'm going to leave it here to eat 

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:50.089
 some son of mine because I with others the 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.469
 truth is that surely I could not 

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:54.949
 I'm going to try to take a pretty picture 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:57.499
 to get you to behave the video 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.929
 This is the Neapolitan Milanese that 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:02.809
 I like it and many times thanks 

00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:05.389
 to jaime radusky the Argentine cook 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:06.949
 who explained to me how it was done from 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.959
 then for me it has become 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.959
 authentic passion until I always say
