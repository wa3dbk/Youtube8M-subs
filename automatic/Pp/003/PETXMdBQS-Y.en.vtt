00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.419 

hey<00:00:00.719> guys<00:00:00.930> for<00:00:01.199> the<00:00:01.260> win<00:00:01.410> here<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:01.860> I'm<00:00:02.370> just

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hey guys for the win here and I'm just

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.700 
hey guys for the win here and I'm just
doing<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:03.000> little<00:00:03.149> experiment<00:00:03.810> I<00:00:03.990> found<00:00:04.560> out

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
doing a little experiment I found out

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.880 
doing a little experiment I found out
that<00:00:04.859> my<00:00:04.980> TV<00:00:05.339> has<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.670> game<00:00:06.270> mode<00:00:06.480> on<00:00:06.750> so<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.589> want

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
that my TV has a game mode on so I want

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.190 
that my TV has a game mode on so I want
to<00:00:07.950> see<00:00:08.220> if<00:00:08.550> having<00:00:09.210> game<00:00:09.450> mode<00:00:09.660> on<00:00:09.840> really

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
to see if having game mode on really

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.230 
to see if having game mode on really
makes<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.530> difference<00:00:10.759> it's<00:00:11.759> supposed<00:00:12.120> to

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
makes a difference it's supposed to

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.650 
makes a difference it's supposed to
reduce<00:00:12.570> latency<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:13.200> bit<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:14.480> hopefully<00:00:15.480> make

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
reduce latency a bit and hopefully make

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.730 
reduce latency a bit and hopefully make
the<00:00:15.780> controls<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.470> bit<00:00:16.590> more

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
the controls a little bit more

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.189 
the controls a little bit more
responsive<00:00:17.750> right<00:00:18.750> now<00:00:20.449> this<00:00:21.449> would<00:00:21.630> pop<00:00:21.930> up

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
responsive right now this would pop up

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.330 
responsive right now this would pop up
there<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.070> go

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
there we go

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.620 
there we go
as<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.699> can<00:00:23.789> see<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.060> game<00:00:24.269> mode<00:00:24.449> off

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
as you can see I have game mode off

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.540 
as you can see I have game mode off
right<00:00:24.869> now<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.230> basically<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.279> I'm<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
right now so basically what I'm going to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.660 
right now so basically what I'm going to
do<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:27.060> I'm<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.949> put<00:00:28.949> my<00:00:29.070> controller<00:00:29.340> in

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
do is I'm going to put my controller in

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.370 
do is I'm going to put my controller in
front<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> camera<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.539> then<00:00:31.320> see<00:00:32.099> if<00:00:32.460> like

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
front of the camera and then see if like

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.229 
front of the camera and then see if like
the<00:00:34.380> dropping<00:00:35.190> animation<00:00:35.760> takes<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.090> little

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the dropping animation takes a little

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.389 
the dropping animation takes a little
bit<00:00:36.390> longer<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:37.110> set<00:00:38.010> in

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
bit longer to set in

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.819 
bit longer to set in
I<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:39.210> game<00:00:39.480> mode<00:00:39.690> off<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.469> might<00:00:40.649> have

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
I have game mode off that might have

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.580 
I have game mode off that might have
done<00:00:41.180> but<00:00:42.180> anyway<00:00:42.690> let's<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.320> started

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
done but anyway let's just get started

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.000 
done but anyway let's just get started
so<00:00:44.280> right<00:00:44.489> now<00:00:44.610> game<00:00:44.820> modes<00:00:45.090> off<00:00:45.239> right<00:00:46.010> my

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
so right now game modes off right my

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.799 
so right now game modes off right my
camera<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.460> front<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.820> screen<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.329> mean<00:00:48.420> my

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
camera in front of the screen I mean my

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.799 
camera in front of the screen I mean my
controller<00:00:49.410> before<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> screen<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.809> here

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
controller before on the screen and here

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.689 
controller before on the screen and here
we<00:00:51.899> go<00:00:54.020> see<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.410> three<00:00:55.590> times<00:00:58.520> okay

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
we go see this like three times okay

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.229 
we go see this like three times okay
now<00:00:59.910> let's<00:01:00.149> turn<00:01:00.750> game<00:01:01.109> mode<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.210> see<00:01:03.210> if

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
now let's turn game mode on and see if

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.340 
now let's turn game mode on and see if
it<00:01:03.840> reacts<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.739> little<00:01:04.949> bit<00:01:05.040> quicker<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.110> here

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
it reacts a little bit quicker so here

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.490 
it reacts a little bit quicker so here
we<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.560> game<00:01:07.799> modes<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:10.130> table<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.220> that

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
we go game modes on table like that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.450 
we go game modes on table like that
now<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:13.650> should<00:01:13.860> happen<00:01:14.540> is<00:01:16.009> that<00:01:17.009> Y<00:01:17.189> press<00:01:17.490> a

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
now what should happen is that Y press a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.240 
now what should happen is that Y press a
should<00:01:20.460> be<00:01:20.580> more<00:01:20.850> instantaneous<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.590> let's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
should be more instantaneous so let's

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.580 
should be more instantaneous so let's
say<00:01:26.090> okay<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.509> now<00:01:27.750> I'm<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> slow<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
say okay so now I'm going to slow the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.679 
say okay so now I'm going to slow the
video<00:01:28.710> down<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.490> hopefully<00:01:30.299> we'll<00:01:30.509> be<00:01:30.659> able

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
video down and hopefully we'll be able

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.440 
video down and hopefully we'll be able
to<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:31.049> difference<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.590> slow-motion<00:01:32.450> I've

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
to see difference in slow-motion I've

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.730 
to see difference in slow-motion I've
been<00:01:33.659> playing<00:01:33.900> with<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.290> bit<00:01:34.439> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
been playing with it a little bit and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.770 
been playing with it a little bit and
seems<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.430> making<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.759> difference<00:01:36.150> but

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
seems like it's making a difference but

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.719 
seems like it's making a difference but
I<00:01:37.020> guess<00:01:37.259> we'll<00:01:37.409> find<00:01:37.439> out<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.280> let's<00:01:38.549> just

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
I guess we'll find out so let's just

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.840 
I guess we'll find out so let's just
start<00:01:39.770> okay<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:40.829> now<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.369> two<00:01:41.520> videos

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
start okay so now I have the two videos

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.789 
start okay so now I have the two videos
lined<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.659> before<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> go<00:01:43.470> into<00:01:43.590> slow

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
lined up and before I go into slow

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.260 
lined up and before I go into slow
motion<00:01:43.829> let<00:01:44.340> me<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.610> show<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.820> what<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
motion let me just show you what it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.230 
motion let me just show you what it
looks<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:46.020> normal<00:01:46.500> speed<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.180> see<00:01:48.180> if

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
looks like in normal speed and see if

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
looks like in normal speed and see if
you<00:01:48.329> notice<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.720> difference<00:01:49.049> okay<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.250> we

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
you notice a difference okay so here we

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.719 
you notice a difference okay so here we
go<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.950> as<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.130> probably<00:01:53.280> tell<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
go and as you can probably tell it's a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.010 
go and as you can probably tell it's a
little<00:01:53.909> bit<00:01:54.000> hard<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.180> tell<00:01:54.270> difference<00:01:54.750> so

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
little bit hard to tell difference so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.020 
little bit hard to tell difference so
let's<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.040> slow<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.310> down<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> half

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
let's go and slow it down to you half

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.160 
let's go and slow it down to you half
speed<00:01:59.000> still<00:02:00.000> kind<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.630> hard<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.869> tell<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
speed still kind of hard to tell the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.440 
speed still kind of hard to tell the
difference<00:02:01.610> now<00:02:02.610> I'm<00:02:02.790> going<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.000> take<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.270> down

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
difference now I'm going to take it down

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.440 
difference now I'm going to take it down
to<00:02:03.509> one<00:02:04.079> quarter<00:02:04.259> speed<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.119> if<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.240> can't

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
to one quarter speed and if we can't

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.300 
to one quarter speed and if we can't
tell<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> difference<00:02:06.810> here<00:02:07.350> then<00:02:07.560> it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
tell the difference here then it

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.350 
tell the difference here then it
probably<00:02:08.670> isn't<00:02:08.789> one<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.509> let's<00:02:09.660> go

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
probably isn't one so let's go

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.690 
probably isn't one so let's go
once<00:02:12.360> again<00:02:12.620> absolutely<00:02:13.620> no<00:02:14.129> difference

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
once again absolutely no difference

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.880 
once again absolutely no difference
actually<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> slowed<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.079> down<00:02:16.319> even<00:02:16.709> further

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
actually I slowed this down even further

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.539 
actually I slowed this down even further
and<00:02:17.250> went<00:02:17.430> frame<00:02:17.790> by<00:02:18.060> frame<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:19.370> Premiere<00:02:20.370> and

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
and went frame by frame in Premiere and

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.050 
and went frame by frame in Premiere and
I<00:02:21.299> could<00:02:21.689> not<00:02:21.930> see<00:02:22.200> different<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:22.890> game<00:02:23.849> mode

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
I could not see different so game mode

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.330 
I could not see different so game mode
actually<00:02:24.599> does<00:02:24.870> absolutely<00:02:25.140> nothing<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.159> my

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
actually does absolutely nothing on my

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.800 
actually does absolutely nothing on my
toshiba<00:02:26.909> tv<00:02:28.549> maybe<00:02:29.549> it<00:02:29.970> works<00:02:30.269> better<00:02:30.659> on

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
toshiba tv maybe it works better on

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.030 
toshiba tv maybe it works better on
different<00:02:31.530> models<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:32.159> know<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:33.269> think

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
different models I know that I think

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.270 
different models I know that I think
panasonic<00:02:35.040> has<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.370> game<00:02:36.090> mode<00:02:36.299> on<00:02:36.510> their<00:02:36.689> TVs

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
panasonic has a game mode on their TVs

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.940 
panasonic has a game mode on their TVs
so<00:02:38.280> not<00:02:39.180> entirely<00:02:39.540> sure<00:02:39.689> about<00:02:39.989> those<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:40.709> at

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
so not entirely sure about those but at

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.009 
so not entirely sure about those but at
least<00:02:41.099> on<00:02:41.340> my<00:02:41.370> TV<00:02:41.909> it<00:02:42.090> did<00:02:42.299> absolutely<00:02:42.569> nothing

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
least on my TV it did absolutely nothing

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.830 
least on my TV it did absolutely nothing
and<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:44.340> was<00:02:44.790> really<00:02:45.090> surprising<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.720> was

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
and that was really surprising I was

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.809 
and that was really surprising I was
expecting<00:02:46.290> at<00:02:46.409> least<00:02:46.470> like<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.950> 1<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.370> 2<00:02:47.519> frame

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
expecting at least like a 1 to 2 frame

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.860 
expecting at least like a 1 to 2 frame
difference<00:02:48.239> but<00:02:48.510> nope<00:02:49.670> nothing<00:02:50.670> at<00:02:50.730> all<00:02:50.879> I

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
difference but nope nothing at all I

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.460 
difference but nope nothing at all I
recorded<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:52.920> 30fps<00:02:53.579> so<00:02:54.540> maybe<00:02:54.840> if<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.139> record

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
recorded in 30fps so maybe if I record

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.550 
recorded in 30fps so maybe if I record
it<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.769> 60<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.579> slowed<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.629> down<00:02:57.659> maybe<00:02:58.230> there

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
it at 60 and slowed it down maybe there

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.690 
it at 60 and slowed it down maybe there
would<00:02:58.680> be<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.799> little<00:02:59.129> bit<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.370> difference

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
would be a little bit of a difference

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.580 
would be a little bit of a difference
but<00:03:00.299> I<00:03:00.359> really<00:03:01.079> doubt<00:03:01.290> it

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
but I really doubt it

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.740 
but I really doubt it
um<00:03:02.540> yeah<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.989> kind<00:03:04.859> of<00:03:04.920> disappointing<00:03:05.659> but<00:03:06.659> I

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
um yeah so kind of disappointing but I

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.300 
um yeah so kind of disappointing but I
