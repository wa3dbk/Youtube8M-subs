sort dialog because just sorting by one

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.730 
sort dialog because just sorting by one
column<00:00:21.000> could<00:00:21.510> require<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.080> say<00:00:22.320> four

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
column could require you to say four

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.040 
column could require you to say four
sort<00:00:22.980> by<00:00:23.130> red<00:00:23.369> then<00:00:23.880> by<00:00:24.150> orange<00:00:24.570> then<00:00:24.900> by

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
sort by red then by orange then by

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.249 
sort by red then by orange then by
yellow<00:00:25.380> then<00:00:25.589> by<00:00:25.740> green<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.339> so<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.630> old<00:00:27.839> sort

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
yellow then by green and so the old sort

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.439 
yellow then by green and so the old sort
dialog<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.830> only<00:00:28.949> offered<00:00:29.279> three<00:00:29.669> rules

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449

just<00:00:31.169> wasn't<00:00:31.529> enough<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.790> also<00:00:32.970> use<00:00:33.750> the

just wasn't enough you can also use the

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.460 
just wasn't enough you can also use the
same<00:00:34.140> basic<00:00:34.680> idea<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.280> filter<00:00:35.760> by<00:00:35.970> color

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470

all<00:00:39.190> right<00:00:39.310> so<00:00:39.460> here<00:00:39.610> we<00:00:39.700> have<00:00:39.820> a<00:00:39.850> data<00:00:40.090> set

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
all right so here we have a data set

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.360 
all right so here we have a data set
you'll<00:00:40.810> see<00:00:40.990> that<00:00:41.080> a<00:00:41.170> conditional<00:00:41.680> formatting

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
you'll see that a conditional formatting

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.190 
you'll see that a conditional formatting

do the fast way to sort by color is to

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.630 
do the fast way to sort by color is to
choose<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:52.990> cell<00:00:53.290> that<00:00:53.440> has<00:00:53.680> either<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.220> icon

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
remembers the order of the last sort so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.050 
remembers the order of the last sort so
the<00:01:32.220> greens<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.790> at<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> top<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.440> yellow

the greens are at the top of the yellow
formatted<00:01:36.060> cells<00:01:36.270> now<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:38.070> pretty

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
formatted cells now it can get pretty

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.490 
formatted cells now it can get pretty
confusing<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.540> sorts<00:01:39.870> in<00:01:40.080> that<00:01:40.230> quick

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
confusing to do the sorts in that quick

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.850

so<00:01:41.370> sometimes<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:41.970> want<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.180> actually<00:01:42.360> do<00:01:42.720> the

so sometimes we want to actually do the

so sometimes we want to actually do the
full-blown<00:01:43.650> sort<00:01:44.190> dialog<00:01:44.900> strangely<00:01:45.900> there's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
full-blown sort dialog strangely there's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.780 
full-blown sort dialog strangely there's
three<00:01:46.800> different<00:01:47.040> ways<00:01:47.160> to<00:01:47.190> do<00:01:47.430> this

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
three different ways to do this

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.270 
three different ways to do this
we<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.030> choose<00:01:48.210> sort<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.440> custom<00:01:50.040> sort

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
we can choose sort and then custom sort

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
we can choose sort and then custom sort
that's<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.700> right-click<00:01:51.180> choose<00:01:51.390> sort<00:01:51.990> and

so<00:02:02.960> let's<00:02:03.109> say<00:02:03.200> that<00:02:03.229> we<00:02:03.380> want<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.619> sort<00:02:03.979> by

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
so let's say that we want to sort by

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.190 
so let's say that we want to sort by
revenue<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:04.909> we're<00:02:05.390> going<00:02:05.539> to<00:02:05.630> sort<00:02:05.990> on

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
revenue and we're going to sort on

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.499 
revenue and we're going to sort on
instead<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.250> sorting<00:02:07.520> on<00:02:07.700> values<00:02:08.209> we're<00:02:08.390> going

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
instead of sorting on values we're going

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.809 
instead of sorting on values we're going
to<00:02:08.569> sort<00:02:08.720> on<00:02:08.899> cell<00:02:09.200> color<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.709> say<00:02:10.519> that<00:02:10.700> we

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
to sort on cell color and say that we

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.740 
to sort on cell color and say that we
want<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.420> red<00:02:11.780> on<00:02:12.050> top<00:02:12.910> now<00:02:13.910> next<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.540> want<00:02:14.690> to

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
want the red on top now next I want to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.930 
want the red on top now next I want to
specify<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.200> second<00:02:15.769> color<00:02:15.950> so<00:02:16.459> rather<00:02:16.670> than

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
specify the second color so rather than

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.030 
specify the second color so rather than
building<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.660> new<00:02:17.900> level<00:02:18.260> I'm<00:02:18.410> going<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.739> copy

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
building a new level I'm going to copy

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.920 
building a new level I'm going to copy
this<00:02:19.310> level<00:02:20.500> sort<00:02:21.500> on<00:02:21.709> cell<00:02:22.099> color<00:02:22.930> orange

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
this level sort on cell color orange

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:35.589 
this level sort on cell color orange
next<00:02:24.400> copy<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.580> level<00:02:27.340> yellow<00:02:31.150> green<00:02:34.599> blue

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
next copy the level yellow green blue

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.500 
next copy the level yellow green blue
and<00:02:38.440> then<00:02:39.440> purple<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:40.430> then<00:02:40.579> maybe<00:02:40.819> we<00:02:41.360> also

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
and then purple and then maybe we also

so<00:03:07.739> when<00:03:08.129> I<00:03:08.159> first<00:03:08.489> heard<00:03:08.730> sort<00:03:09.209> by<00:03:09.329> color<00:03:09.599> I

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
so when I first heard sort by color I

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.479 
so when I first heard sort by color I
thought<00:03:09.989> well<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.319> know<00:03:10.409> that's<00:03:10.560> fairly

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
thought well you know that's fairly

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.190 
thought well you know that's fairly
crazy<00:03:11.849> I'm<00:03:12.090> not<00:03:12.209> sure<00:03:12.329> why<00:03:12.510> anyone<00:03:12.689> would<00:03:12.989> want

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
crazy I'm not sure why anyone would want

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.770 
crazy I'm not sure why anyone would want
to<00:03:13.260> do<00:03:13.439> that<00:03:13.879> but<00:03:14.879> you<00:03:15.180> run<00:03:15.329> into<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> lot<00:03:15.689> of

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
to do that but you run into a lot of

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.750 
to do that but you run into a lot of
people<00:03:15.989> who<00:03:16.200> mark<00:03:16.500> certain<00:03:16.829> cells<00:03:17.040> in<00:03:17.220> red<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
people who mark certain cells in red and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.550 
people who mark certain cells in red and
then<00:03:18.000> they<00:03:18.120> want<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:18.390> total<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.780> red<00:03:18.930> cells<00:03:19.230> or

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
then they want to total the red cells or

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.649 
then they want to total the red cells or
do<00:03:19.680> something<00:03:19.920> like<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.099> well<00:03:20.430> it's<00:03:21.150> now

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
do something like that well it's now

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.949 
do something like that well it's now
possible<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.230> do<00:03:22.439> using<00:03:23.310> sort<00:03:24.000> by<00:03:24.180> color<00:03:24.420> I'm

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
possible to do using sort by color I'm

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.140 
possible to do using sort by color I'm
going<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.139> go<00:03:25.230> back<00:03:25.409> and<00:03:25.650> sort<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.639> data<00:03:26.700> into

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
going to go back and sort this data into

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.750 
going to go back and sort this data into
alphabetical<00:03:27.510> sequence<00:03:27.930> by<00:03:28.230> date<00:03:28.670> we<00:03:29.670> can

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
alphabetical sequence by date we can

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.089 
alphabetical sequence by date we can
also<00:03:30.000> filter<00:03:30.510> by<00:03:30.840> color<00:03:31.049> so<00:03:31.319> if<00:03:31.379> we<00:03:31.500> turn<00:03:31.769> on

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
also filter by color so if we turn on

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.149 
also filter by color so if we turn on
the<00:03:32.579> filter<00:03:32.819> either<00:03:33.689> with<00:03:33.930> data<00:03:34.230> filter<00:03:34.859> or
