00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:14.269
 Today I would like to introduce the Sylvanian family of washing machine iron sets 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:18.520
 Here it is the second-tub washing machine 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.520
 After ironing board and iron are included 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.260
 I will open it soon 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.520
 After all the sixth 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.250
 The tone is different from the picture 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.690
 Here 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:48.879
 Such a thin blue in the package 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.879
 It was, but the real thing looks a little dull, but feeling green 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.360
 We thus 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.160
 After all I feel a little different colors 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 Hmm 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.650
 Cormorant is this dial 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.400
 I can not turn it 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.400
 It's pretty 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.950
 30% open 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.590
 I 'm going there 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.590
 8 dogs 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.509
 The hose is 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.330
 But this I bus 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.330
 Here it looks like opportunity is 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.380
 Good 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.380
 I can not enter 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.719
 thin 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.720
 Kew 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.800
 But it is forced or a woman 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.800
 I met 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.189
 This is a clothes-dryer. 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.189
 It's like toweling 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.660
 This is 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.660
 Suite Kitago 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.869
 Put your own MO in this 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.869
 And personality 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.940
 It's no objection I 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.940
 4 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.910
 If you can win 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.910
 It looks like this 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.599
 This is a potential 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.200
 Do 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.550
 It is the last time 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.560
 This is 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:17.060
 It is laundry, and this is writing bib 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.060
 You are about to sleep 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.790
 This is not good 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.710
 This is 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.350
 handkerchief 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:37.550
 Handkerchief from the nose and polka dots 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.550
 There are 2 pieces of Kira 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.540
 This is a mister 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.250
 Trainee student when ironing 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.250
 There is a mist blowing there 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.790
 Iron 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.190
 It's like this 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.250
 It's like this when it comes to ironing with a handkerchief 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.590
 I tried to line up 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.590
 Sylvania family was a washing machine ironing student
