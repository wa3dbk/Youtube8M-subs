00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.899 
then have it not happened for one reason
or<00:01:57.390> another<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.250> think<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.579> was<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.850> to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
or another and I think that was going to

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.569 
or another and I think that was going to
be<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> key<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.600> success<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> series

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
be the key to the success of the series

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.340 
be the key to the success of the series
everybody<00:02:02.579> was<00:02:02.790> writing<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.479> saying

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
everybody was writing in and saying

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.640 
everybody was writing in and saying
can<00:02:04.980> listen<00:02:05.610> Clark<00:02:05.760> finally<00:02:06.150> unite<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.440> and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
can listen Clark finally unite and and

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.190 
can listen Clark finally unite and and
we<00:02:07.890> backed<00:02:08.490> off<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.880> we<00:02:09.030> held<00:02:09.270> off<00:02:09.420> from<00:02:10.020> from

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
we backed off and we held off from from

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.390 
we backed off and we held off from from
doing<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.590> because<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.950> sexual<00:02:11.280> tension

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
doing that because the sexual tension

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.460 
doing that because the sexual tension
was<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:11.910> great<00:02:12.180> between<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.660> two<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.900> them<00:02:12.990> he

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
was so great between the two of them he

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.110 
was so great between the two of them he
always<00:02:13.620> wanted<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.190> more<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.730> we<00:02:14.970> always

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
always wanted to see more and we always

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.550 
always wanted to see more and we always
wanted<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.570> give<00:02:15.720> just<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.990> little<00:02:16.020> bit<00:02:16.260> less

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
wanted to give just a little bit less

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.000 
wanted to give just a little bit less
because<00:02:17.810> we<00:02:18.810> knew<00:02:18.930> there<00:02:19.080> was<00:02:19.200> too<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.890> know
