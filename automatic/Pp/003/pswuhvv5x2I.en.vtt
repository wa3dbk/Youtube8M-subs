okay<00:00:03.810> guys<00:00:03.959> now<00:00:04.020> we<00:00:04.529> are<00:00:04.770> going<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.069> talk<00:00:05.250> about

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
okay guys now we are going to talk about

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.789 
okay guys now we are going to talk about
the<00:00:05.759> code<00:00:06.420> translational<00:00:07.080> targeting<00:00:07.649> of

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
the code translational targeting of

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.180 
the code translational targeting of
secretory<00:00:08.280> proteins<00:00:08.900> to<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.740> mouthful

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
secretory proteins to the is a mouthful

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.610 
secretory proteins to the is a mouthful
of<00:00:11.250> name<00:00:11.519> but<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.240> actual<00:00:12.540> message<00:00:13.170> about

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
of name but the actual message about

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.589 
of name but the actual message about
this<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.250> shown<00:00:14.580> here<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.000> picture<00:00:15.179> short

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
this is shown here in this picture short

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.019 
this is shown here in this picture short
pictures<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.049> can<00:00:16.170> see<00:00:16.350> now<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.310> protein<00:00:17.820> is

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
pictures you can see now the protein is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.510 
pictures you can see now the protein is
being<00:00:18.539> secured<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.230> being<00:00:19.470> translated<00:00:19.890> and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
being secured is being translated and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.480 
being secured is being translated and
the<00:00:20.760> protein<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.359> translated<00:00:22.130> in<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
the protein is translated in the in the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.670 
the protein is translated in the in the

sit on the endoplasmic reticulum and
right<00:00:28.859> after<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> protein<00:00:29.760> synthesis<00:00:30.240> is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
right after the protein synthesis is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.749 
right after the protein synthesis is
done<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:31.140> protein<00:00:31.500> has<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.830> transported

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
done the protein has to be transported

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
done the protein has to be transported
inside<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.360> endoplasmic<00:00:33.600> rumen<00:00:34.410> which<00:00:34.649> is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
inside the endoplasmic rumen which is

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.130 
inside the endoplasmic rumen which is
called<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> core<00:00:35.460> translational<00:00:36.450> targeting

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
of this proteins and most of the time

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.090 
of this proteins and most of the time
the<00:00:39.540> protein<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:40.020> are<00:00:40.110> talking<00:00:40.410> about<00:00:40.559> are<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
the protein we are talking about are the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.250 
the protein we are talking about are the
secretory<00:00:41.610> proteins<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.300> means<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.930> need<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
secretory proteins that means we need to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.569 
secretory proteins that means we need to
produce<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.770> protein<00:00:44.100> inside<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
produce that protein inside the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.700 
produce that protein inside the
endoplasmic<00:00:44.760> reticulum<00:00:45.510> lumen<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.110> then<00:00:46.559> we

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
endoplasmic reticulum lumen and then we

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.889 
endoplasmic reticulum lumen and then we
need<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.950> transfer<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.730> protein<00:00:48.059> from<00:00:48.239> ER<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
need to transfer that protein from ER to

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.840 
need to transfer that protein from ER to
Golgi<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.440> via<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.829> ER<00:00:50.070> Golgi<00:00:50.250> pathway<00:00:50.789> to

Golgi and via the ER Golgi pathway to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.450 
Golgi and via the ER Golgi pathway to
finally<00:00:51.449> which<00:00:52.170> will<00:00:52.350> finally<00:00:53.010> fuse<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
finally which will finally fuse with the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.400 
finally which will finally fuse with the
cell<00:00:53.550> membrane<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.210> release<00:00:54.480> those<00:00:55.050> protein

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.520 
cell membrane and release those protein
outside<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.129> cell<00:00:56.370> okay<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.870> now<00:00:58.050> let<00:00:58.260> us<00:00:58.289> look

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
outside the cell okay so now let us look

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.760 
outside the cell okay so now let us look
at<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.460> detail<00:01:00.390> now<00:01:00.989> all<00:01:01.230> protein

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
at that in detail now all protein

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.950 
at that in detail now all protein
synthesis<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.430> eukaryotic<00:01:02.910> begins<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
synthesis in eukaryotic begins in the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.500 
synthesis in eukaryotic begins in the
cytosol<00:01:04.350> where<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> ribosomal<00:01:05.880> subunits

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
cytosol where the ribosomal subunits

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.340 
cytosol where the ribosomal subunits
come<00:01:06.780> together<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.560> begin<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.790> transfer

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
come together and begin the transfer

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.590 
come together and begin the transfer
translating<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.500> mRNA<00:01:11.159> near<00:01:11.580> its<00:01:11.939> five<00:01:12.270> prime

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
translating and mRNA near its five prime

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.289 
translating and mRNA near its five prime
end<00:01:12.900> okay<00:01:13.740> soon<00:01:14.310> after<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> proteins<00:01:15.060> start

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
end okay soon after the proteins start

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.179 
end okay soon after the proteins start
to<00:01:15.479> emerge<00:01:15.869> from<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.320> ribosome<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:17.040> may

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
to emerge from the ribosome it may

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.070 
to emerge from the ribosome it may
become<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> directed<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> endoplasmic

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
become the directed to the endoplasmic

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.310 
become the directed to the endoplasmic
reticulum<00:01:20.040> which<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.580> ER<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.600> targeted<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.580 
reticulum which is ER it is targeted to

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.250 
translocated from the external portion
of<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.230> ER<00:03:58.500> into<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:58.920> lumen<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.550> ER<00:04:00.260> okay

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
of the ER into the lumen of the ER okay

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.920 
of the ER into the lumen of the ER okay
so<00:04:01.560> that's<00:04:01.739> how<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.760> protein<00:04:03.150> synthesis<00:04:03.840> and

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
so that's how the protein synthesis and

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.590 
so that's how the protein synthesis and
code<00:04:04.470> translational<00:04:05.310> synthesis<00:04:05.820> is<00:04:06.000> done<00:04:06.060> and

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
code translational synthesis is done and

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.540 
code translational synthesis is done and
I<00:04:06.989> hope<00:04:07.200> that's<00:04:07.470> going<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.709> help<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:08.040> thank

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
I hope that's going to help you thank

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.700 
I hope that's going to help you thank
you
