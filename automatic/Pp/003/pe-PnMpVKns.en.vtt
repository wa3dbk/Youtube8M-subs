the great fight is a great champion a

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.760

that<00:04:38.220> was<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.400> close<00:04:38.610> fight<00:04:38.910> but<00:04:39.570> I<00:04:39.600> think<00:04:39.960> that

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
that was a close fight but I think that

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.680 
that was a close fight but I think that
we<00:04:40.800> need<00:04:40.950> a<00:04:40.980> part<00:04:41.340> three<00:04:41.640> and<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:42.000> also<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.480> think

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
we need a part three and I also I think

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.590 
we need a part three and I also I think
the<00:04:42.780> fans<00:04:43.080> want<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.680> see<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.980> part<00:04:44.250> three<00:04:44.520> in<00:04:45.180> I

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
the fans want to see a part three in I

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.000 
the fans want to see a part three in I
believe<00:04:45.930> it<00:04:46.050> was<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.230> fourth<00:04:46.470> round<00:04:46.710> where

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
believe it was the fourth round where

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.160 
believe it was the fourth round where
you<00:04:47.130> heard<00:04:47.370> him<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:48.210> seemed<00:04:48.570> that<00:04:48.690> you<00:04:48.810> let<00:04:49.050> him

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
you heard him it seemed that you let him
