00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.499 
idea because I don't know if New York
has<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.259> same<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.680> California<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.390> know

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
has the same as California with you know

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.749 
has the same as California with you know
you<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> ABC<00:01:37.439> ratings<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.430> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you have the ABC ratings you know and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.520 
you have the ABC ratings you know and
then<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.780> blue<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.170> B<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.350> in

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
then like the a is in blue the B is in

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.050 
then like the a is in blue the B is in
green<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> season<00:01:41.280> red<00:01:41.490> you're<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.909> all

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
green in the season red you're like all

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.760 
green in the season red you're like all
 if<00:01:42.450> they<00:01:42.540> got<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.049> everybody

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
 if they got to see everybody

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410 
 if they got to see everybody
speculate<00:01:44.250> you're<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.970> only<00:01:45.119> gets<00:01:45.329> to

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
speculate you're like it only gets to

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.670 
speculate you're like it only gets to
see<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.630> somebody's<00:01:45.960> rats<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.380> there

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
see if somebody's rats in there

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.020 
see if somebody's rats in there
it<00:01:47.040> only<00:01:47.189> gets<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.729> they<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:47.909> this

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
it only gets to be if they have this

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.359 
it only gets to be if they have this
scenario<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:49.200> between<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.710> clear<00:01:50.189> head

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
scenario if it's between a clear head

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.249 
scenario if it's between a clear head
like<00:01:50.549> an<00:01:50.670> 89%<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.450> they<00:01:51.570> yeah<00:01:51.720> true<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.110> one

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
like an 89% if they yeah true this one

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.510 
like an 89% if they yeah true this one
thing<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.560> everybody<00:01:52.710> speculates<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.460> we

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
thing so everybody speculates and we

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.460 
thing so everybody speculates and we
don't<00:01:53.670> really<00:01:53.790> know<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:55.049> much<00:01:55.229> people

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
don't really know and it's much people

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.959 
don't really know and it's much people
act<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.799> they<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.250> what<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> problem<00:01:56.850> was

it's good we get to know a little bit of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.580

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you know I can um you can see if it's a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.350 
you know I can um you can see if it's a
low<00:02:09.209> B<00:02:09.690> or<00:02:09.959> high<00:02:10.530> B<00:02:10.770> like<00:02:11.039> it's<00:02:11.280> 89
