Freddy<00:02:13.400> nose<00:02:13.640> isn't<00:02:13.940> on<00:02:14.240> this<00:02:15.160> price<00:02:16.160> on<00:02:16.370> that

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
Freddy nose isn't on this price on that

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:30.510 
Freddy nose isn't on this price on that
bit<00:02:17.750> weird<00:02:18.880> bit<00:02:19.880> different<00:02:24.250> okay

so<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.590> think<00:02:35.680> my<00:02:35.950> tactic<00:02:36.519> is<00:02:36.879> use<00:02:37.360> those<00:02:37.599> two

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
so I think my tactic is use those two

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.119 
so I think my tactic is use those two
rooms<00:02:40.079> because<00:02:41.079> whatever<00:02:41.290> i<00:02:41.500> use<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.709> different

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
rooms because whatever i use a different

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:51.750 
rooms because whatever i use a different
tactic<00:02:42.519> i<00:02:42.760> always<00:02:43.120> lose<00:02:49.739> I'm<00:02:50.739> glad<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.069> I<00:02:51.250> did
