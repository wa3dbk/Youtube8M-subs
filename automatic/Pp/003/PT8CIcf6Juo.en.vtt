00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
trigger reset distance is a little bit

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.420 
trigger reset distance is a little bit
longer<00:02:56.500> than<00:02:56.830> I'd<00:02:56.950> like

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
longer than I'd like

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.950 
longer than I'd like
and<00:02:57.670> when<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.030> talk<00:02:58.240> about<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.540> trigger<00:02:58.810> reset

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
and when I talk about the trigger reset

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.630 
and when I talk about the trigger reset
distance<00:02:59.500> I'm<00:02:59.620> talking<00:03:00.010> about<00:03:00.070> okay<00:03:00.490> watch

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
distance I'm talking about okay watch

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.890 
distance I'm talking about okay watch
this<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.450> um

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
this so um

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.810 
this so um
of<00:03:02.410> course<00:03:02.650> we're<00:03:02.830> still<00:03:03.040> on<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> live<00:03:03.550> range

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
of course we're still on a live range

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.850 
of course we're still on a live range
even<00:03:04.120> though<00:03:04.240> you<00:03:04.930> know<00:03:05.110> there's<00:03:05.350> no<00:03:05.500> rounds

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
even though you know there's no rounds

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.910 
even though you know there's no rounds
in<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.070> gun<00:03:07.260> unless<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.440> am<00:03:08.560> shooting<00:03:08.800> this

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
in the gun unless I am shooting this

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.430 
in the gun unless I am shooting this
downrange<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.240> so<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.690> pull<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.960> trigger<00:03:11.200> once

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
downrange so so I pull the trigger once

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.080 
downrange so so I pull the trigger once
so<00:03:11.890> now<00:03:12.010> let's<00:03:12.130> pretend<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.490> gun<00:03:12.670> goes<00:03:12.910> off

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
so now let's pretend the gun goes off

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.880 
so now let's pretend the gun goes off
slide<00:03:13.750> racks<00:03:14.310> okay<00:03:15.310> oops<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.380> slide<00:03:17.620> racks

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
slide racks okay oops so the slide racks

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.400 
slide racks okay oops so the slide racks
so<00:03:18.820> now<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.000> trigger<00:03:19.390> reach<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.900> distance

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
so now the trigger reach that distance

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.140 
so now the trigger reach that distance
is<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.710> distance<00:03:20.740> that<00:03:21.370> my<00:03:21.550> trigger<00:03:21.820> at<00:03:22.000> my

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
is the distance that my trigger at my

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.960 
is the distance that my trigger at my
finger<00:03:22.570> has<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.810> come<00:03:23.020> out<00:03:23.670> before<00:03:26.940> which<00:03:27.940> is

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
finger has to come out before which is

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.340 
finger has to come out before which is
right<00:03:28.240> there<00:03:28.270> which<00:03:28.570> is<00:03:28.660> pretty<00:03:28.870> much<00:03:28.990> almost

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
right there which is pretty much almost

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.440 
right there which is pretty much almost
all<00:03:29.710> the<00:03:29.860> way<00:03:29.950> out<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.400> lot<00:03:30.910> like<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.210> roar-ball

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
all the way out a lot like the roar-ball

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.220 
all the way out a lot like the roar-ball
380<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.500> r9<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:34.600> I'll<00:03:34.870> have<00:03:34.960> to<00:03:35.050> go<00:03:35.200> back

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
380 and the r9 so I'll have to go back

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.110 
380 and the r9 so I'll have to go back
and<00:03:35.590> see<00:03:35.770> if<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:35.950> 40<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.340> 45<00:03:36.610> are<00:03:36.820> like<00:03:36.940> that

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
and see if the 40 and 45 are like that

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.310 
and see if the 40 and 45 are like that
because<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.420> don't<00:03:37.630> like<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:37.990> mean<00:03:38.230> that's

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
because I don't like that I mean that's

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.260 
because I don't like that I mean that's
that<00:03:38.470> trigger<00:03:39.040> reset<00:03:39.190> distance<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.820> just<00:03:40.030> too

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
that trigger reset distance is just too

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.250 
that trigger reset distance is just too
too<00:03:40.780> long<00:03:41.610> okay<00:03:42.640> so<00:03:43.000> what<00:03:43.180> else<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:44.080> grip

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
too long okay so what else the grip

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.320 
too long okay so what else the grip
itself<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.740> really<00:03:45.010> like<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.310> grip<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.940> the

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
itself I really like the grip the the

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.740 
itself I really like the grip the the
front<00:03:47.020> and<00:03:47.200> back<00:03:47.380> strap<00:03:47.680> serrations<00:03:48.280> are<00:03:48.750> just

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
front and back strap serrations are just

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.510 
front and back strap serrations are just
like<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.050> PM<00:03:50.260> 40<00:03:50.590> they're<00:03:50.740> very<00:03:50.950> sharp<00:03:51.310> but

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
like the PM 40 they're very sharp but

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.040 
like the PM 40 they're very sharp but
they<00:03:51.640> feel<00:03:51.850> good<00:03:52.120> it's<00:03:52.600> not<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.780> negative

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
they feel good it's not a negative

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.590 
they feel good it's not a negative
sharpness<00:03:53.680> at<00:03:53.830> that<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.490> feels<00:03:54.940> comfortable

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
sharpness at that it feels comfortable

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.960 
sharpness at that it feels comfortable
in<00:03:55.690> your<00:03:55.840> hand<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.830> slide<00:03:57.070> serrations<00:03:57.370> also

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
in your hand the slide serrations also

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
pretty sharp relatively deep so they

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.060 
pretty sharp relatively deep so they

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
it has this giant extension on the

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.910 
it has this giant extension on the
bottom<00:05:05.970> which<00:05:06.120> may<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:07.110> understand<00:05:07.560> why<00:05:07.740> they

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
bottom which may I understand why they

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.220 
bottom which may I understand why they
think<00:05:07.950> that<00:05:08.940> would<00:05:09.060> make<00:05:09.180> sense<00:05:09.420> but<00:05:09.900> hey<00:05:10.050> this

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
think that would make sense but hey this

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.770 
think that would make sense but hey this
is<00:05:10.320> a<00:05:10.350> concealed<00:05:10.710> carry<00:05:10.950> gun<00:05:11.010> so<00:05:11.490> so<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.090> think<00:05:12.390> I

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
is a concealed carry gun so so I think I

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.850 
is a concealed carry gun so so I think I
personally<00:05:13.200> think<00:05:13.320> that<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.710> magazines

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
personally think that the magazines

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.500 
personally think that the magazines
should<00:05:14.280> be<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.520> same<00:05:14.700> but<00:05:14.940> that's<00:05:15.030> that's<00:05:15.360> my

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
should be the same but that's that's my

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.220 
should be the same but that's that's my
personal<00:05:15.810> opinion

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
personal opinion

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.590

if<00:07:16.250> you<00:07:16.340> just<00:07:16.550> weren't<00:07:17.000> a<00:07:17.270> 45<00:07:17.780> Auto<00:07:18.050> person<00:07:18.530> if

if you just weren't a 45 Auto person if

if you just weren't a 45 Auto person if
you've<00:07:18.889> already<00:07:19.639> made<00:07:19.789> the<00:07:20.030> decision<00:07:20.150> to

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:20.510 
you've already made the decision to

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.730 
you've already made the decision to
standard<00:07:20.930> standardize<00:07:21.500> on<00:07:21.710> a

standard standardize on a

standard standardize on a
nine-millimeter<00:07:22.370> round<00:07:22.460> then<00:07:23.210> the<00:07:23.330> nine

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:23.510 
nine-millimeter round then the nine

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.930 
nine-millimeter round then the nine
really<00:07:23.780> would<00:07:23.960> be<00:07:24.050> the<00:07:24.169> way<00:07:24.289> to<00:07:24.320> go<00:07:24.700> and<00:07:25.700> I

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:25.940 
really would be the way to go and I

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.430 
really would be the way to go and I
guess<00:07:26.150> really<00:07:26.539> the<00:07:26.660> only<00:07:26.810> reason<00:07:26.990> to<00:07:27.229> do<00:07:27.320> the
