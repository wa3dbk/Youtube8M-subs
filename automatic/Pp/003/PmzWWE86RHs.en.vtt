00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
to apply a liquid liner this is ultra

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.070 
to apply a liquid liner this is ultra
liner<00:05:36.430> by<00:05:36.729> Maybelline<00:05:36.910> it's<00:05:37.389> waterproof<00:05:37.720> and

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
liner by Maybelline it's waterproof and

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.659 
liner by Maybelline it's waterproof and
it's<00:05:38.169> got<00:05:38.349> a<00:05:38.380> patent<00:05:38.860> black<00:05:38.979> shine<00:05:39.370> it's

it's got a patent black shine it's

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.969 
it's got a patent black shine it's
probably<00:05:40.060> one<00:05:40.240> of<00:05:40.270> my<00:05:40.569> favorite<00:05:41.110> liquid

probably one of my favorite liquid

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.219 
probably one of my favorite liquid
liners<00:05:42.400> you<00:05:43.060> are<00:05:43.270> more<00:05:43.720> than<00:05:43.810> welcome<00:05:43.930> to<00:05:44.110> use

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.180 

I<00:05:54.300> think<00:05:54.960> adding<00:05:55.229> liquid<00:05:55.530> liner<00:05:55.710> makes<00:05:55.979> this<00:05:56.130> a

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
I think adding liquid liner makes this a

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.339 
I think adding liquid liner makes this a
little<00:05:56.430> bit<00:05:56.639> less<00:05:56.910> editorial<00:05:57.840> looking<00:05:58.169> and

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
little bit less editorial looking and

00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.990 
little bit less editorial looking and
makes<00:05:58.500> it<00:05:58.710> a<00:05:58.770> little<00:05:58.979> bit<00:05:59.190> more<00:05:59.460> everyday

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
makes it a little bit more everyday

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.520 
makes it a little bit more everyday
wearable<00:06:00.539> even<00:06:01.139> though<00:06:01.229> you<00:06:01.349> don't<00:06:01.500> really
