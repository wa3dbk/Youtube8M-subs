 Oh, what's up with Youtube people here?

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.480

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.369
 I'll let this one read the description now 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.640
 Even if I open it, it will not leave me because 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.170
 He says 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.990

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.900

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.620
 will authorize and hopefully I will be able to 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.620
 Well, we are going to download 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.059

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.510
 and here we have it the first thing we have 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.480
 what to do is 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.820

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.430
 program to extract or compress 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.320
 records 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.159
 and we go there 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.630
 it will take a little bit because they already get 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.510
 giordano 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.640

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.140
 to the list we return here 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.280
 we hope it ends 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.060
 good 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.860
 they caught childish 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.070

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.580
 OK 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.680
 well I hope I have an idea when I already 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.680

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.030

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.319
 I come back 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.019
 good if you see this is this 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.910
 then it's going to look like it's 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.040
 downloading some things more bookstores 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.330
 a few things and work the mindfulness 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.980
 that I remember myself that is important 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.709
 in case you do not know what it is to try 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.450
 a ratillo here I have a little 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.819
 worse connection I like a little 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.069
 more but others sure you are giving 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.530
 much much much a minute 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.290

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.530

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.530
 records 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.370
 and if we bring it to have last or lack of 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.560
 little bit 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.000
 if you passed the last 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.000
 without like a stick 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.240
 to that I went back to say that this serves to 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.900
 minecraft and none premium that these 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.060
 forests are ready from the page of 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.740
 the same official minecraft page the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.819
 that you get off, they will always serve you 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:40.150
 for mike the three thousand a few prizes 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.150
 and well we are going to see each other 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.269
 worse you do not open 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.269
 half an hour will open minecraft 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.280
 and here the adarve also forgives him in 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.490
 the minecraft amount folder here I've 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.490
 declared 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.190
 we created a folder and now we are going to 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.100
 put the mod 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.430
 As you can see, I've been caught like that 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.050
 I hope it was downloaded, it's worth 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.580
 we're around here this is what we 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.129
 will appear 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.940
 and if I'm not wrong we can install 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:22.000
 directly without having to close 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.590
 minecraft but we will not agree 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.590
 try it we get into bots 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.500
 I do not think what you have to carry the 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.980
 monster 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.980
 try it is not going to lower us 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.980
 there is work 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.980
 you can grab this too 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.270
 and see 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.849
 yes i do not think 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.710
 if it has arrived well it closes 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.849
 minecraft I speak it and when I'm in the 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.849

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:06.530

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:08.629
 Minecraft without recording and greatest perfect 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.150

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.800
 closed the main craft has petado pc and 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.610
