personal edition windows XP iso that

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.969 
personal edition windows XP iso that
we've<00:01:12.210> created<00:01:12.479> from<00:01:13.140> my<00:01:13.200> base<00:01:13.500> operating

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
we've created from my base operating

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.789 
we've created from my base operating
system<00:01:16.970> when<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.570> still<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.020> Skyrim<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.650> there

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
system when I still have Skyrim in there

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.340 
system when I still have Skyrim in there
so<00:01:19.979> can't<00:01:20.610> actually<00:01:20.729> use<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.869> virtual

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
so can't actually use that for a virtual

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.840 
so can't actually use that for a virtual
machine<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.830> we've<00:01:22.950> got<00:01:23.100> our<00:01:23.130> windows<00:01:23.520> XP

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
machine so we've got our windows XP

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.310 
machine so we've got our windows XP
professional<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.900> they<00:01:25.020> were<00:01:25.080> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> be

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
professional is so they were going to be

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.010 
professional is so they were going to be
using<00:01:25.880> now<00:01:26.880> these<00:01:27.119> already<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> windows

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
using now these already have a windows

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.780 
using now these already have a windows
product<00:01:28.259> key<00:01:28.560> built<00:01:29.009> into<00:01:29.369> them<00:01:29.490> because<00:01:29.579> it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
product key built into them because it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.780 
product key built into them because it
came<00:01:29.970> off<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.299> my<00:01:30.450> last<00:01:31.189> instance<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.400> Windows

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
came off of my last instance of Windows

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.520 
came off of my last instance of Windows
so<00:01:33.390> there's<00:01:33.659> no<00:01:33.750> need<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.930> put<00:01:34.140> one<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.409> here

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
so there's no need to put one in here

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.350 
so there's no need to put one in here
now<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.430> we're<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> go<00:01:38.850> ahead<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.180> name

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
now so we're going to go ahead and name

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.969 
now so we're going to go ahead and name
our<00:01:39.540> virtual<00:01:39.900> machine<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
our virtual machine this one can be the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.170 
our virtual machine this one can be the
tech<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.790> toe<00:01:41.970> virtual<00:01:42.630> machine<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:44.180> we're

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
tech to toe virtual machine and we're

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.490 
tech to toe virtual machine and we're
going<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> set<00:01:45.570> how<00:01:45.960> much<00:01:46.110> hard<00:01:46.320> drive<00:01:46.350> space

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
going to set how much hard drive space

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.560 
going to set how much hard drive space
we<00:01:46.890> want<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.310> now<00:01:47.850> virtual<00:01:48.149> machines<00:01:48.420> are

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
we want for it now virtual machines are

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.660 
we want for it now virtual machines are
usually<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> lot<00:01:49.110> smaller<00:01:49.590> than<00:01:50.310> an<00:01:50.490> actual

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
usually a lot smaller than an actual

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
going to drop it down to four and it can

we're<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.759> customize<00:02:03.270> hardware<00:02:03.630> here

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.300 
we're going to customize hardware here

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and it will allow us to customize what

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.190 
and it will allow us to customize what

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
normally on my virtual machines I like

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.410 
normally on my virtual machines I like
to<00:02:14.980> run<00:02:15.160> quite<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> few<00:02:15.820> programs<00:02:16.210> in<00:02:16.360> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.510

up<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.790> one<00:02:19.030> gig<00:02:19.380> even<00:02:20.380> also<00:02:20.590> acts<00:02:20.770> as<00:02:20.950> the

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.760 
alright welcome back guys as you can see
our<00:04:20.879> installation<00:04:21.539> is<00:04:21.690> finished<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:22.229> only<00:04:22.620> took

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
our installation is finished I only took

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.469 
our installation is finished I only took
about<00:04:22.830> another<00:04:23.250> five<00:04:23.550> minutes<00:04:23.819> but<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.180> figured

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
about another five minutes but I figured

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.809 
about another five minutes but I figured
I<00:04:24.569> wouldn't<00:04:24.780> just<00:04:24.900> leave<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.319> there<00:04:25.349> for<00:04:25.500> you

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:25.819 
I wouldn't just leave it there for you

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.360 
I wouldn't just leave it there for you
so<00:04:26.819> now<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.120> have<00:04:27.389> this<00:04:28.009> virtual<00:04:29.009> machine

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
so now you have this virtual machine

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.550 
so now you have this virtual machine
installed<00:04:29.729> you<00:04:30.419> have<00:04:30.539> a<00:04:30.569> fully<00:04:30.930> usable

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
installed you have a fully usable

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.520 
installed you have a fully usable
secondary<00:04:32.280> system<00:04:32.729> that<00:04:33.449> cannot<00:04:33.960> access<00:04:34.379> your

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
secondary system that cannot access your

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.960 
secondary system that cannot access your
primary<00:04:34.919> system<00:04:35.310> unless<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:35.699> give<00:04:35.849> it

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
primary system unless you give it

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.510 
primary system unless you give it
explicit<00:04:36.539> permission<00:04:36.979> this<00:04:37.979> can<00:04:38.129> be<00:04:38.159> handy

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
explicit permission this can be handy

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.089 
explicit permission this can be handy
for<00:04:39.050> running<00:04:40.050> through<00:04:40.229> multiple<00:04:40.560> proxies<00:04:41.069> or

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
background as I mentioned before

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.360 
background as I mentioned before
security<00:04:45.300> it's<00:04:45.509> a<00:04:45.949> alternative<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.099> using<00:04:47.129> a

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
security it's a alternative to using a

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.129 
security it's a alternative to using a
sandbox<00:04:47.819> so<00:04:48.449> you<00:04:48.509> can<00:04:48.629> install<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.930> program

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
sandbox so you can install a program

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.659 
sandbox so you can install a program
that<00:04:49.440> you<00:04:49.500> don't<00:04:49.650> exactly<00:04:49.860> trust<00:04:50.220> but<00:04:50.430> you<00:04:50.520> do

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
that you don't exactly trust but you do

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.240 
that you don't exactly trust but you do
want<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:50.940> try<00:04:51.319> here<00:04:52.319> in<00:04:52.530> your<00:04:52.680> virtual<00:04:52.949> machine

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
want to try here in your virtual machine

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.010 
want to try here in your virtual machine
and<00:04:53.400> not<00:04:53.880> worry<00:04:54.150> about<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:54.509> damaging<00:04:54.930> your
