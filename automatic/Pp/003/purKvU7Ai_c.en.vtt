00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
carbon fiber it's very stiff so it will

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.899 
carbon fiber it's very stiff so it will
take<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.920> breaking<00:01:38.250> stage<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.729> these

are quite long actually it takes it took
me<00:01:41.970> at<00:01:42.060> least<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.420> month<00:01:42.690> until<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.400> kind<00:01:44.400> of<00:01:44.520> got

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
me at least a month until I kind of got

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.670 
me at least a month until I kind of got
few<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.360> them<00:01:45.510> like<00:01:45.780> feel<00:01:46.080> like<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.440> finally

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
few of them like feel like I finally

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.620 
few of them like feel like I finally
broke<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.159> into<00:01:47.280> them<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.880> around<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> month

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
broke it into them like around the month

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.039 
broke it into them like around the month
I<00:01:48.750> guess<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:49.110> bit<00:01:49.200> more<00:01:49.560> maybe<00:01:50.330> but<00:01:51.330> I<00:01:51.360> only<00:01:51.630> play

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
I guess a bit more maybe but I only play

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.170 
I guess a bit more maybe but I only play
it<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.320> twice<00:01:52.680> maybe<00:01:53.640> three<00:01:53.909> times<00:01:53.940> that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it like twice maybe three times that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.580 
it like twice maybe three times that
most<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.600> per<00:01:54.780> week<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.260> yeah<00:01:57.409> anyways<00:01:58.409> are

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
most of per week but yeah anyways are

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.830 
most of per week but yeah anyways are
these<00:01:58.830> are<00:01:58.950> quite<00:01:59.190> easy<00:01:59.400> to<00:01:59.520> plan<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.119> they

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
these are quite easy to plan but they

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.940 
these are quite easy to plan but they
don't<00:02:01.080> scuff<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.860> much<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.369> super<00:02:03.000> fire<00:02:03.180> ones

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
don't scuff as much as super fire ones

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.100 
don't scuff as much as super fire ones
but<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.700> stuff<00:02:06.299> oh<00:02:06.540> actually<00:02:06.780> this

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
but they do stuff oh actually this

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.690 
but they do stuff oh actually this
they're<00:02:07.500> actually<00:02:07.799> getting<00:02:08.159> stuff<00:02:08.549> as<00:02:08.670> much

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
they're actually getting stuff as much

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.930 
they're actually getting stuff as much
as<00:02:09.090> super<00:02:09.569> 53

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
as super 53

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.300 
as super 53
I<00:02:11.940> still<00:02:12.870> prefer<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.349> super<00:02:13.620> five<00:02:13.800> threes<00:02:14.099> but

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
I still prefer the super five threes but

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.280 
I still prefer the super five threes but
that's<00:02:14.640> another<00:02:14.849> review<00:02:15.239> i'll<00:02:15.360> just<00:02:15.630> do<00:02:16.050> later

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
that's another review i'll just do later

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.520 
that's another review i'll just do later
and<00:02:16.849> but<00:02:17.849> yeah<00:02:18.360> these<00:02:18.630> are<00:02:18.690> still<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
and but yeah these are still one of the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.050 
and but yeah these are still one of the
best<00:02:20.120> papers<00:02:21.500> one<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.680> vapors<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.489> you

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
best papers one of the vapors that you

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.000 
best papers one of the vapors that you
could<00:02:24.239> recommend<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.470> guys<00:02:25.739> should

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
could recommend that you guys should

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.150 
could recommend that you guys should
probably<00:02:26.520> try<00:02:26.670> out<00:02:27.110> only<00:02:28.110> because<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.500> quite

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
probably try out only because it's quite

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.330 
probably try out only because it's quite
durable<00:02:29.340> for<00:02:30.319> for<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.410> sin<00:02:31.590> material<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.220> this

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
durable for for the sin material on this

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.430 
durable for for the sin material on this
it's<00:02:32.580> not<00:02:32.640> super<00:02:33.390> thin<00:02:33.569> like<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.900> addy<00:02:34.020> zeros

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
it's not super thin like the addy zeros

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.430 
it's not super thin like the addy zeros
but<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:35.400> still<00:02:35.610> more<00:02:35.850> padded<00:02:36.239> than<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
but it's still more padded than the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.259 
but it's still more padded than the
school<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.739> five<00:02:38.010> ones<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.730> problem<00:02:39.030> with<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
school of five ones the problem with the

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.870 
school of five ones the problem with the
super<00:02:39.510> five<00:02:39.660> ones<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.140> they<00:02:40.830> tended<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.550> rip

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
super five ones that they tended to rip

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.300 
super five ones that they tended to rip
at<00:02:42.120> first<00:02:42.420> but<00:02:42.720> they<00:02:42.900> also<00:02:43.080> states<00:02:43.500> they

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
at first but they also states they

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.910 
at first but they also states they
recall<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.180> actual<00:02:45.690> initial<00:02:45.870> ones<00:02:46.230> back<00:02:46.500> and

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
recall the actual initial ones back and

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.640 
recall the actual initial ones back and
like<00:02:47.190> they<00:02:47.850> toughened<00:02:48.780> those<00:02:48.959> up<00:02:49.170> too<00:02:49.410> but

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
like they toughened those up too but

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.979 
like they toughened those up too but
there<00:02:49.950> were<00:02:50.040> also<00:02:50.220> still<00:02:50.760> shoot<00:02:51.480> some

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
there were also still shoot some

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.720 
there were also still shoot some
situations<00:02:52.500> with<00:02:52.709> like<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.130> still<00:02:53.430> wrapping

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
situations with like the still wrapping

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.780 
situations with like the still wrapping
of<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:53.970> but<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.049> adage<00:02:55.380> did<00:02:55.890> layer<00:02:56.549> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
of it but the adage did layer the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.180 
of it but the adage did layer the
synthetic<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:58.200> change<00:02:58.410> in<00:02:58.500> material<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.160> a

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
synthetic the change in material is a

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.860 
synthetic the change in material is a
bit<00:02:59.370> better<00:02:59.519> with<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.970> supervised<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.660> mean

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
bit better with the supervised I mean

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.750 
bit better with the supervised I mean
the<00:03:01.019> Flywire<00:03:01.350> here<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:01.799> you<00:03:02.100> can<00:03:02.160> see<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.549> fine

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
the Flywire here as you can see the fine

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.210 
the Flywire here as you can see the fine
lines<00:03:03.000> that's<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.989> Flywire<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:04.980> basically

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
lines that's the Flywire so basically

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.120 
lines that's the Flywire so basically
what<00:03:05.370> till<00:03:05.519> what<00:03:06.030> what<00:03:06.480> Superfly<00:03:07.350> does<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.920> or

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
what till what what Superfly does it or

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.850 
what till what what Superfly does it or
for<00:03:08.819> flywire<00:03:09.180> sorry<00:03:09.450> when<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.440> tighten<00:03:10.650> up

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
for flywire sorry when you tighten up

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.500 
for flywire sorry when you tighten up
your<00:03:10.920> lace<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.400> basically<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.299> wraps

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
your lace is basically just a wraps

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.420 
your lace is basically just a wraps
around<00:03:12.690> your<00:03:12.930> foot<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.890> kind<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.190> like

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
around your foot so it kind of like

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.539 
around your foot so it kind of like
moles<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.840> food<00:03:16.079> I<00:03:16.200> guess<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.980> yeah

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
moles on to to a food I guess and yeah

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.170 
moles on to to a food I guess and yeah
that's<00:03:17.970> why<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.280> upper<00:03:20.519> itself<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.030> not

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
that's why it the upper itself is not

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.390 
that's why it the upper itself is not
too<00:03:21.480> hard<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.810> break<00:03:21.989> into<00:03:22.200> it's<00:03:22.440> just<00:03:22.620> carbon

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
too hard to break into it's just carbon

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.690 
too hard to break into it's just carbon
fiber<00:03:23.670> plate<00:03:24.060> that's<00:03:24.329> just<00:03:24.630> so<00:03:25.380> stiff<00:03:26.040> really

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
fiber plate that's just so stiff really

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.970 
fiber plate that's just so stiff really
add<00:03:26.820> you<00:03:27.600> had<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.049> first<00:03:28.290> one<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.709> but<00:03:28.859> when

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
add you had the first one you but when

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.940 
add you had the first one you but when
you<00:03:29.010> first<00:03:29.310> play<00:03:29.489> with<00:03:29.609> them<00:03:30.709> one<00:03:31.709> great<00:03:31.890> thing

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
you first play with them one great thing

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.150 
you first play with them one great thing
about<00:03:32.250> these<00:03:32.489> is<00:03:32.549> that<00:03:32.790> in<00:03:33.209> from<00:03:33.540> here<00:03:33.840> as<00:03:34.160> you

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
about these is that in from here as you

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.550 
about these is that in from here as you
can<00:03:35.400> see<00:03:35.670> these<00:03:35.790> little<00:03:36.030> spice<00:03:36.420> on<00:03:36.630> front<00:03:36.870> well

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
can see these little spice on front well

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.610 
can see these little spice on front well
they're<00:03:38.370> good<00:03:38.820> rip<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.780> can't<00:03:40.019> really<00:03:40.350> know

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
they're good rip you can't really know

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.110 
they're good rip you can't really know
this<00:03:40.829> big<00:03:41.010> difference<00:03:41.340> but<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:41.850> could<00:03:42.030> just

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
this big difference but you could just

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.210 
this big difference but you could just
add<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:42.989> guess<00:03:43.140> it's<00:03:43.290> like<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.530> psychological

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
add it I guess it's like a psychological

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.069 
add it I guess it's like a psychological
thing<00:03:44.340> but<00:03:44.549> you<00:03:44.730> feel<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.090> it's<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.630> bit<00:03:45.930> more

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
thing but you feel it it's a bit more

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.590 
thing but you feel it it's a bit more
stable<00:03:46.320> because<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.970> these<00:03:47.970> little<00:03:48.329> little

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
stable because of these little little

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.660 
stable because of these little little
studs<00:03:49.170> in<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.380> front<00:03:49.590> what<00:03:50.160> they<00:03:50.250> do<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:50.519> just

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
studs in the front what they do is just

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.750 
studs in the front what they do is just
say<00:03:50.940> they're<00:03:51.420> just<00:03:51.900> like<00:03:52.440> spice<00:03:52.890> I<00:03:53.190> guess<00:03:53.220> for

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760
