kind of a plastic and foam late in
suffered<00:01:16.420> for<00:01:16.689> 60<00:01:17.109> years<00:01:17.609> very<00:01:18.609> cool<00:01:18.850> very

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
suffered for 60 years very cool very

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.669 
suffered for 60 years very cool very
cool<00:01:19.209> so<00:01:19.479> how<00:01:19.659> long<00:01:19.869> did<00:01:20.020> these<00:01:20.170> boards<00:01:20.439> last

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
cool so how long did these boards last

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.410 
cool so how long did these boards last
well<00:01:21.340> we<00:01:21.520> build<00:01:21.759> them<00:01:21.850> with<00:01:21.999> the<00:01:22.060> intent<00:01:22.119> at

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
well we build them with the intent at

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.359 
well we build them with the intent at
the<00:01:22.509> last<00:01:22.719> a<00:01:22.810> lifetime<00:01:23.020> plus<00:01:23.709> I<00:01:23.740> mean<00:01:24.069> we

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
the last a lifetime plus I mean we

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.919 
the last a lifetime plus I mean we
really<00:01:24.939> think<00:01:25.329> that's<00:01:25.539> part<00:01:25.779> of<00:01:25.810> the

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
really think that's part of the

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:27.330 
really think that's part of the
environmental<00:01:26.469> aspect<00:01:26.859> of<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.009> boy<00:01:27.159> it's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
environmental aspect of the boy it's

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.340 
environmental aspect of the boy it's
longer<00:01:27.729> aboard<00:01:28.420> lasts<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.649> less<00:01:31.350> consumer

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
longer aboard lasts the less consumer

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.620 
longer aboard lasts the less consumer

riding<00:02:41.040> your<00:02:41.099> boards<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.489> know<00:02:41.549> you<00:02:41.670> guys

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
riding your boards I know you guys

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.880 
riding your boards I know you guys
started<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.569> just<00:02:42.989> shaping<00:02:43.230> for<00:02:43.530> yourself

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
started this just shaping for yourself

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.530 
started this just shaping for yourself
yeah<00:02:44.519> we<00:02:44.879> built<00:02:45.090> them<00:02:45.209> for<00:02:45.420> ourselves

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
yeah we built them for ourselves

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.960 
yeah we built them for ourselves
initially<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.409> but<00:02:47.069> like<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.519> said<00:02:47.579> people

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
initially but but like I said people

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.339 
initially but but like I said people
started<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.329> notice<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.810> then<00:02:48.989> we<00:02:49.079> got<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
started to notice and then we got the

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.500 
started to notice and then we got the
idea<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:50.430> maybe<00:02:50.879> maybe<00:02:51.239> other<00:02:51.450> people

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
idea that that maybe maybe other people

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.089 
idea that that maybe maybe other people
could<00:02:51.810> build<00:02:51.989> them<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:52.440> themselves<00:02:52.560> as<00:02:52.920> well

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
could build them for themselves as well

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.949 
could build them for themselves as well
so<00:02:53.370> we<00:02:53.640> started<00:02:53.910> packaging<00:02:54.299> with<00:02:54.450> kids<00:02:54.690> and

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
so we started packaging with kids and

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.869 
so we started packaging with kids and
we've<00:02:55.920> sent<00:02:56.160> them<00:02:56.250> all<00:02:56.400> over<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.760> world
