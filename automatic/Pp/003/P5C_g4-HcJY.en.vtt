00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
grain women work when I'm cutting if I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.930 
grain women work when I'm cutting if I
am<00:01:27.650> going<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.800> right<00:01:28.920> direction<00:01:28.980> I<00:01:29.490> manage<00:01:29.820> to

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
am going the right direction I manage to

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.630 
am going the right direction I manage to
get<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> nice<00:01:30.300> little<00:01:30.540> chip<00:01:30.870> with<00:01:31.560> every<00:01:31.860> with

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
get a nice little chip with every with

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.970 
get a nice little chip with every with
every<00:01:32.880> cut

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
every cut

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.440 
every cut
but<00:01:34.980> if<00:01:35.100> however<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.730> some<00:01:35.850> reason<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:37.130> forget

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
but if however for some reason I forget

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.720 
but if however for some reason I forget
then<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.870> get<00:01:40.230> some<00:01:40.380> nasty<00:01:40.560> tear<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:43.170> it's

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
then I get some nasty tear up so it's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.760 
then I get some nasty tear up so it's
it's<00:01:44.730> not<00:01:45.000> easy<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.290> probably

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it's not easy going this is probably

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.600 
it's not easy going this is probably
about<00:01:47.010> 12<00:01:47.880> hours<00:01:48.350> here<00:01:49.350> another<00:01:50.220> two<00:01:50.580> hours

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
about 12 hours here another two hours

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.370 
about 12 hours here another two hours
here<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.330> is<00:01:51.480> just<00:01:51.690> completely<00:01:52.050> rough

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
here but this is just completely rough

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.980 
here but this is just completely rough
then<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.400> final<00:01:53.730> process<00:01:53.970> I'm<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.870> be

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
then the final process I'm going to be

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.950 
then the final process I'm going to be
dimpling<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.650> background<00:01:56.540> which<00:01:57.540> I've<00:01:57.750> made
