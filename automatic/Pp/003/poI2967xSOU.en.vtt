okay<00:00:00.570> I'm<00:00:00.630> gonna<00:00:00.840> show<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.050> little<00:00:01.140> bit<00:00:01.410> about

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
okay I'm gonna show a little bit about

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.210 
okay I'm gonna show a little bit about
the<00:00:01.800> axe<00:00:01.979> on<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.490> MIDI<00:00:03.500> guitar<00:00:04.500> converter

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
the axe on the MIDI guitar converter

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.930 
the axe on the MIDI guitar converter
with<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.000> neural<00:00:06.359> net<00:00:07.370> two<00:00:08.370> paddles<00:00:08.670> really

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
with the neural net two paddles really

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.660 
with the neural net two paddles really
important<00:00:09.330> like<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.599> said<00:00:09.809> before<00:00:10.190> one<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.519> a

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
important like I said before one it's a

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.580 
important like I said before one it's a
sustain<00:00:12.030> pedal<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.660> get<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.960> benefits<00:00:13.410> of

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
sustain pedal so you get the benefits of

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.770 
sustain pedal so you get the benefits of
a<00:00:13.679> piano<00:00:13.950> player<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.910> know<00:00:15.120> lift<00:00:15.420> your<00:00:15.599> hand

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
a piano player you know lift your hand

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.529 
a piano player you know lift your hand
off<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.529> chord<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.670> set<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:18.029> for<00:00:18.240> something

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
off a chord and set up for something

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.660 
off a chord and set up for something
else<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.289> that's<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.160> whole<00:00:20.310> new<00:00:20.490> way<00:00:20.640> of

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
else so that's a whole new way of

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.740 
else so that's a whole new way of
playing<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.300> other<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> MIDI<00:00:22.350> volume<00:00:22.769> pedal

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
playing the other is a MIDI volume pedal

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.759 
playing the other is a MIDI volume pedal
basically<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:24.900> well<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.410> your<00:00:25.590> MIDI

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
basically it's well as your MIDI

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.570 
basically it's well as your MIDI
information<00:00:27.560> of<00:00:28.560> course<00:00:28.619> I'm<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.099> very<00:00:29.310> track

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
information of course I'm not very track

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.749 
information of course I'm not very track
right<00:00:29.760> now<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.090> I'm<00:00:30.390> using<00:00:30.539> logic<00:00:31.080> paint<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
right now but I'm using logic paint and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.549 
right now but I'm using logic paint and
got<00:00:32.759> mostly<00:00:33.090> presets<00:00:33.719> from<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.050> except<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
got mostly presets from that except the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.799 
got mostly presets from that except the
Native<00:00:34.860> Instruments<00:00:35.180> electric<00:00:36.180> piano<00:00:36.570> for

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
Native Instruments electric piano for

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.660 
Native Instruments electric piano for
that<00:00:37.579> so<00:00:38.579> presets<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.450> X<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:41.010> X<00:00:41.219> 50<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that so presets on the X on the X 50 is

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.030 
that so presets on the X on the X 50 is
what<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> use<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.480> just<00:00:42.960> basically<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.500> four<00:00:43.890> or

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
what I use I just basically have four or

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.049 
what I use I just basically have four or
five<00:00:44.250> or<00:00:44.489> six<00:00:44.730> presets<00:00:45.320> one<00:00:46.550> is<00:00:47.550> set<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:47.910> for

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
five or six presets one is set up for

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.479 
five or six presets one is set up for
playing<00:00:48.270> solos<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.770> got<00:00:49.950> pitch<00:00:50.250> Bend

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
playing solos so it's got pitch Bend

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.600 
playing solos so it's got pitch Bend
enabled<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:52.110> gives<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> sensitivity

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
enabled and that gives the sensitivity

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.650 
enabled and that gives the sensitivity
for<00:00:53.850> vibrato<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.579> string<00:00:56.579> bends<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.539> an

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
for vibrato and string bends to an

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.020 
for vibrato and string bends to an
extent<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.039> nuances<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.609> guitar

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
extent you know the nuances of guitar

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.680 
extent you know the nuances of guitar
playing<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:01.649> next<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> preset<00:01:03.210> -<00:01:03.390> it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
playing the next one is a preset - it's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.780 
playing the next one is a preset - it's
for<00:01:03.870> bass<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> same<00:01:04.860> thing<00:01:04.890> tuned

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
for bass it's just the same thing tuned

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.550 
for bass it's just the same thing tuned
down<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.210> octave<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.869> triggers<00:01:07.080> anything

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
down an octave so it triggers anything

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.060 
down an octave so it triggers anything
one<00:01:08.490> octave<00:01:08.820> lower<00:01:08.869> a<00:01:09.869> third<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:10.650> instead<00:01:10.979> of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
one octave lower a third one instead of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.270 
one octave lower a third one instead of
for<00:01:11.189> playing<00:01:11.430> pads<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.479> lush<00:01:13.350> things<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.100> no

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
for playing pads and lush things with no

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.780 
for playing pads and lush things with no
pitch<00:01:14.520> band<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:16.049> use<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.009> MIDI<00:01:17.400> volume

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
pitch band so I use the MIDI volume

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
pitch band so I use the MIDI volume
pedal<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.240> sustain<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> lot<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.080> those<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
pedal and sustain a lot for those and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.730 
pedal and sustain a lot for those and
then<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> couple<00:01:20.610> four<00:01:20.970> different<00:01:21.740> heat

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
then a couple four different heat

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
then a couple four different heat
instruments<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.520> pianos<00:01:24.090> or<00:01:24.299> roads<00:01:24.509> or

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
instruments like pianos or roads or

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.300 
instruments like pianos or roads or
things<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.409> because<00:01:25.710> they<00:01:25.860> respond

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
things like that because they respond

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.969 
things like that because they respond
differently<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.930> try<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.140> get<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
differently so you want to try to get it

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.440 
differently so you want to try to get it
as<00:01:29.070> close<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.430> possible<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:30.030> your<00:01:30.210> guitar

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
as close as possible for your guitar

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.530 
as close as possible for your guitar
play

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
play

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.290 
play
so<00:01:33.110> I<00:01:33.470> just<00:01:34.400> have<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.670> little<00:01:34.880> loop<00:01:35.030> here<00:01:35.210> to

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
so I just have a little loop here to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.970 
so I just have a little loop here to
play<00:01:35.480> over<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:35.960> I'll<00:01:36.080> show<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.470> few<00:01:36.680> things

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
play over so I'll show you a few things

00:01:36.980 --> 00:02:29.640 
play over so I'll show you a few things
first<00:01:37.790> with<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.150> pads

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.550 

leave<00:02:30.650> town<00:02:30.920> for<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.310> axon<00:02:31.700> preset<00:02:32.440> well<00:02:33.440> you

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
leave town for the axon preset well you

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.840 
leave town for the axon preset well you
can<00:02:33.680> put<00:02:33.830> whatever<00:02:33.980> plugin<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.519> want<00:02:34.670> on<00:02:34.819> it

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
can put whatever plugin you want on it

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.540 
can put whatever plugin you want on it
but<00:02:35.090> it'll<00:02:35.569> behave<00:02:36.140> as<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:37.100> preset<00:02:37.459> you

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
but it'll behave as the preset you

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:57.610 
but it'll behave as the preset you
created<00:02:38.120> in<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.269> axon<00:02:38.720> editor

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.890 

I<00:02:57.650> have<00:02:58.580> said<00:02:58.819> they've<00:02:58.970> been<00:02:59.000> second<00:02:59.540> so<00:02:59.660> if<00:02:59.810> I

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
I have said they've been second so if I

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.280 
I have said they've been second so if I
bend<00:03:00.080> over<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.530> on<00:03:00.650> that

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:07:01.070 

yeah<00:03:09.370> over<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.400> second

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.139 

you
