00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.889 

the<00:00:19.980> Rams<00:00:20.160> make<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:22.640> bounces<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.090> let's<00:00:24.810> just

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:24.899 
the Rams make it bounces and let's just

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:32.979 
the Rams make it bounces and let's just
check<00:00:25.140> out

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989

so you can control and its really nice
and<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.650> a<00:00:54.079> get<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.170> right<00:00:55.409> there<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
and we have a get it right there on a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.270 
and we have a get it right there on a
table<00:00:56.909> 2<00:00:57.059> megapixel<00:00:57.600> camera

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.340 

the<00:01:00.430> Australian<00:01:01.120> too<00:01:01.300> is<00:01:01.449> they<00:01:02.020> have<00:01:02.199> the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
the Australian too is they have the

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.760 
the Australian too is they have the
n-word<00:01:03.180> 23.2<00:01:04.180> that's<00:01:04.390> insulting<00:01:04.930> of<00:01:05.530> course

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
n-word 23.2 that's insulting of course

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.030 
n-word 23.2 that's insulting of course
on

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.330 

we<00:01:09.370> have<00:01:09.580> redevelop<00:01:10.420> it<00:01:10.510> just<00:01:10.720> shot

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.440 

and<00:01:15.340> maybe<00:01:15.670> let's<00:01:16.270> just<00:01:16.360> equate<00:01:16.899> this<00:01:17.049> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and maybe let's just equate this to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.290 
and maybe let's just equate this to
maybe

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.940 

and<00:01:27.300> then<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.690> see<00:01:27.960> I'll<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.650> well

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
and then we will see I'll really well

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.980 
and then we will see I'll really well

this nvidia tegra

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.680 
this nvidia tegra
something<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.590> go<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.040> has

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
something to go to it has

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.740 
something to go to it has
for<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:35.010> also<00:01:35.190> do<00:01:36.090> better<00:01:36.420> than<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
for what we can also do better than to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.550 
for what we can also do better than to
go<00:01:36.870> to<00:01:37.050> and<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:38.040> it

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
go to and as it

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.850 
go to and as it
place<00:01:39.100> 720p<00:01:40.060> videos<00:01:40.479> also<00:01:41.320> if<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:41.619> doesn't

only<00:02:44.000> half<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.240> brightness<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.870> display

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
only half the brightness of the display

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.740 
only half the brightness of the display
and<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.800> maximum<00:02:46.160> brightness<00:02:46.550> would<00:02:47.270> look

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
and the maximum brightness would look

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.910 
and the maximum brightness would look
like<00:02:47.990> this

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
like this

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.220
