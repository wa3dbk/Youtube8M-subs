to see and our cats are masters at

to see and our cats are masters at
masking<00:00:28.890> most<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.119> health<00:00:30.300> issues<00:00:30.779> heart

masking most of the health issues heart
disease<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.070> cats<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.610> quite<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> bit

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
disease for cats is quite a bit

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.150 
disease for cats is quite a bit
different<00:00:33.149> than<00:00:33.690> dogs<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.860> biggest

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
different than dogs the biggest

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.770 
different than dogs the biggest
difference<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.850> cats<00:00:36.180> are<00:00:36.360> more<00:00:36.510> prone

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
difference is that cats are more prone

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.630 
difference is that cats are more prone
to<00:00:36.809> inherited<00:00:37.620> heart<00:00:37.829> muscle<00:00:38.160> disease<00:00:38.460> is

to inherited heart muscle disease is

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.060 
to inherited heart muscle disease is
called<00:00:38.989> cardiomyopathies<00:00:40.020> these<00:00:40.770> are<00:00:40.890> things

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
called cardiomyopathies these are things

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.350 
called cardiomyopathies these are things
that<00:00:41.100> they<00:00:41.280> get<00:00:41.489> from<00:00:41.640> their<00:00:41.790> parents<00:00:42.270> or

that they get from their parents or

that they get from their parents or
grandparents<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.829> often<00:00:44.160> they<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
relatively early age of onset so the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
relatively early age of onset so the
classic<00:00:47.969> condition<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.539> called<00:00:48.750> hypertrophic
