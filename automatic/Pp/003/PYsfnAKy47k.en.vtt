00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.429
 hello ladies and gentlemen today we are 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:11.040
 Consider two ways to distribute Wi Fi 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.059
 laptop first way is the easiest and 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.529
 simple it is to download third party by 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:25.699
 which does not require special knowledge about eco 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:25.699
 the name of the program room and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.600
 I will leave the link to this program in 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:51.570
 description of this video download and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:58.110
 install start prescribe 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:02.180
 name and password and start so now we 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.680
 consider the second way is creation 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.450
 hosted network for this us 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:19.229
 need a notebook we run a notebook 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:24.170
 and prescribe two teams first team 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.310
 no v.n. well, no hosted site 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:32.090
 I explain what kind of team 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.940
 this is the command to create a hosted network 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.420
 which sets your parameters 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:44.890
 Hallowed are what options 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:51.330
 name and kay 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:56.880
 this is the password of your hosted city 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.880
 of tank password at least 6 characters 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.830
 everything is written in English 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.830
 otherwise you will fail 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.610
 next team no helmet star o 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.720
 antiques turn this is the launch of your 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:25.120
 hosted network when you do all this 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:30.430
 list you save the file as a type 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.470
 file set all the files the file name is 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.380
 want to 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.620
 the most important thing is to prescribe the formations 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.620
 ppm 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:51.680
 This is the very times and save 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.680
 i saved it on my desktop 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.450
 that's how it will look 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.530
 next we right-click and 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.530
 run here and gave me 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:20.659
 confirm yes you agree given 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.430
 moment placed 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.430
 7 starts 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.989
 now we need to go to the center 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.989
 network and sharing management 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:48.640
 I have already registered this private network 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.910
 if this is mine I created literally 10 minutes 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.580
 backwards 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.310
 but when you create you won't have 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.750
 Internet you will just be posted 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.750
 network but without internet 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.470
 here is the type of access without internet access 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:17.260
 what you need to do so that you have appeared 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:26.580
 internet you need to go in general 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:26.580
 namely available among the properties available 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.259
 and put two checkmarks here and here 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.789
 here we allow other users 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.830
 network use connection to 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.870
 Internet of this computer choose 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:46.210
 LAN connection 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:49.770
 I have, in this case from the exercise 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.990
 locality 5 you do not know what 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:57.750
 choose 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:01.389
 put two jackdaws clamping hands 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.469
 wait a minute and two will you 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.469
 Internet will appear 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.319
 everything 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:15.000
 let's finish this like and
