00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.920
 the DIY section today we do 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.660
 the most classic thing of all 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.539
 we change a car battery the 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.250
 we replace no because the machine of 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.359
 daniele does not go but simply to 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.949
 to make people live as they do then 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.300
 useful tips to remove one 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.189
 I need the usual battery 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.029
 usual two or three a month or a pair 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.760
 of key us known and normal english from 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.520
 10 and 13 ok usually everything is done with 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.510
 let 's start our battery 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.450
 taking apart we begin to disassemble it by unscrewing 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.170
 the data that is placed down at the bottom 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.120
 how you see that given this body it 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.250
 we disassemble in order to loosen the band 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.870
 ok 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:01:03.440
 let's take apart not paying attention 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:08.930
 lose anything they work way here is the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:12.170
 die and then continue with the take off 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.630
 the band in such a way that now the 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.370
 our battery can be replaced 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.430
 let's always keep the band 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.280
 quite whole because usually below 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.250
 takes with a hook that if it loosens 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.380
 too much you could 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.690
 dissolve at this point we go to the 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.520
 removal of battery poles 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.920
 clamps applied over the poles 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.620
 obviously the standard rule is the clamp 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.560
 negative is marked by color 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.440
 black the positive clamp that all 80 for 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.240
 one hundred cases is in the part 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.430
 right of the battery seeing it with i 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.200
 the poles facing the belly is the one 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.080
 short also before disassembling the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.690
 battery to always keep a door 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.509
 open and keys not entered in the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.310
 framework because 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.070
 for machines that have control units 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.930
 could cause us to close problems 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.290
 the damper machine with the keys 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.640
 at this point we proceed to unscrew the 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.709
 negative pole please excuse the positive 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.920
 we loosen it up here is not that we reveal it 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.959
 completely and at this point we move on to 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.069
 removing the clamps before the clamp 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.420
 negative 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.910
 we are very careful in this 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.440
 a circumstance that never makes contact 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.569
 one of the two terminals with a part 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.250
 metal of the machine otherwise yes 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.319
 threatens to go haywire and everything 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.630
 the facility 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:39.230
 then eco really love another can 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:41.540
 even positive text brought we explain the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.549
 positive clamp doing the same 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.370
 attention that we have done before in the 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:49.250
 do not touch it with metal parts us 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:54.200
 we fit our battery now is 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.690
 loose and free we take the a 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.959
 this point the very important thing in 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.220
 this moment is taking up the battery 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.430
 exactly as cia mounted below 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.750
 don't look for street vendors who 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.269
 they want to make here we have 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.820
 resumed the new battery as you see 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.670
 all the data correspond to the measurements 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.980
 or the measures are very important and 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.420
 more obviously the polarity as well 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.190
 let's see if we are going to remove ours 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.190
 cappuccinos of our beautiful battery 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.130
 film is the least is always characterized 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.329
 from black it is the biggest to agree 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.069
 now we can remove the pole covers 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.290
 go stall the drummer wing 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.750
 be careful as always not to do i 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.489
 contacts with the poles 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.109
 after which, to reassemble it, a shrewdness 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:45.530
 wants to start from the positive pole in 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:49.430
 so that it cannot be mirrored 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.000
 lay the pole in this case if you have 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.670
 contact fat is always better 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.299
 put it there now in this case not 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:03.350
 let's do it for a while and let's go 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:05.239
 to restrict our rosy video 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.310
 hold them too strong because yes 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.330
 threatens to break them a right thing 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:15.319
 here we are after that we go to 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:18.109
 install the negative terminal itself 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:21.530
 talk if you have a little fat there 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.139
 put we shrink our polo for 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.190
 make it adhere to our clamp for 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.669
 make it stick well to the pole and finally 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.389
 let's go with our belt a 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:37.370
 repeating that put it right back from 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:42.680
 where we had taken it as you see the 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:48.610
 pin is the ing we put it in the sternum 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:51.310
 here he can indeed see the pin well 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:59.870
 the one in front of it as you see here 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:05:04.430
 let's enter the data and finally a 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.650
 push to solder well from battery 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:11.680
 this is very important and tightens up 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:14.630
 how much the battery does not move 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.090
 here we are with the cordial importance of 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.120
 produced a good product a good one 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.740
 suggestion will help you to lengthen the 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.070
 life of your car of yours 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.660
 battery definitely thanks a lot and the 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.660
 next I close the neck 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.940
 Yup
