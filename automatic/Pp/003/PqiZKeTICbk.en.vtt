00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.150
 we 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.260
 222 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.610
 Let's take a look at the way the perfume comes out on the U Bus Coverskin. 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:15.610
 I'll do it 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.390
 b In the minor seventh chord, when you hit a rhythm of 8-bit while holding the food 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.250
 It is. 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.570
 The point is to be careful when you r the abolition of us in the shuffle feeling seoyeonju 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.130
 You must 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.130
 I will try to slow down again 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.480
 Once I know the sting number 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.090
 63 64 masters 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.079
 5 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.079
 Next code 2 Minor code I hope to use the same state law 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.420
 That 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:01:00.290
 I'll take the following code a7 and do it . 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.860
 U 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.460
 At the time of the next code t Major Seven 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:15.350
 Because the root base is already different 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:20.119
 5 4 MONT WORK You can use the same method in three-phase cell formula 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.360
 To look after the four codes on the nature Two rats play each code 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.360
 I'll do it 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.380
 wire 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.490
 5 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.390
 Thank you. 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:02:05.030
 Let's do it a little quicker . 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:02:07.030
 You 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.030
 U 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:20.750
 Next, let's take a look at the chorus method. 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:23.810
 Holding the non-Eleven Main're coming to Ford first applied Kyle sounds, etc. 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.629
 There 's a line in the middle of it. 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.250
 Duplicate and Pooh 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:34.069
 It is important to note that this pucker sword method is included . 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.850
 I'll try to do it slowly. 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.750
 U 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:43.950
 nae ge 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:48.080
 Note gritty as you point and applies the shuffle feels 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.080
 A little different rhythm 5 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.730
 It will be used in this way to try again the following code e minor chord 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.910
 I'll do it 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.910
 Yes 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:07.769
 Then the code a7 Edna will have to try again to code 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.769
 Yes 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.959
 The following code in d major line 6 when used to try in your state u2 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.019
 I'll do it 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.019
 Yes 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:44.670
 This time, let's play then the four codes 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:44.670
 5 be be 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.980
 I'll finish explaining the trick. 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.610
 we 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.630
