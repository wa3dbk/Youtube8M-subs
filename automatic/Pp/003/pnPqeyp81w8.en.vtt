bottom of the watch face these are

bottom of the watch face these are
actually<00:03:36.199> very<00:03:36.409> useful<00:03:36.949> and<00:03:37.129> sometimes<00:03:37.730> I

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
actually very useful and sometimes I

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.580 
actually very useful and sometimes I
found<00:03:38.030> myself<00:03:38.150> using<00:03:38.569> these<00:03:38.840> glances<00:03:39.349> more

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
found myself using these glances more

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.110 
found myself using these glances more
than<00:03:39.739> I've<00:03:39.829> been<00:03:39.949> using<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.310> actual<00:03:40.669> apps<00:03:40.879> on

the home screen performance on the Apple

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.129 
the home screen performance on the Apple
watch<00:03:43.250> is<00:03:43.609> usually<00:03:44.090> very<00:03:44.120> fluent<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.870> smooth

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.689 
watch is usually very fluent and smooth
but<00:03:45.470> sometimes<00:03:45.799> you<00:03:45.919> will<00:03:46.010> experience<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.549> few

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
but sometimes you will experience a few

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.490 
but sometimes you will experience a few
drops<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.269> frames<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.870> bit<00:03:47.989> of<00:03:48.079> lag<00:03:48.260> here

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
drops and frames and a bit of lag here

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.240 
drops and frames and a bit of lag here
and<00:03:48.650> there<00:03:48.769> when<00:03:48.919> you're<00:03:49.040> closing

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
and there when you're closing

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.890 
and there when you're closing
applications<00:03:49.970> but<00:03:50.449> the<00:03:50.569> Apple<00:03:50.780> watch<00:03:50.840> does

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
applications but the Apple watch does

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.809 
applications but the Apple watch does
have<00:03:51.319> pretty<00:03:51.500> good<00:03:51.709> hardware<00:03:52.099> inside<00:03:52.489> of<00:03:52.669> it

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
have pretty good hardware inside of it

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.909 
have pretty good hardware inside of it
the<00:03:53.389> only<00:03:53.569> downside<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.079> software<00:03:54.530> so<00:03:54.680> far

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
the only downside of the software so far

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.050 
the only downside of the software so far
from<00:03:55.010> out<00:03:55.099> of<00:03:55.220> experience<00:03:55.729> is<00:03:55.879> the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
from out of experience is the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.089 
from out of experience is the
third-party<00:03:56.690> apps<00:03:56.900> there's<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.650> massive

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
third-party apps there's a massive

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.349 
third-party apps there's a massive
selection<00:03:58.370> of<00:03:58.579> third-party<00:03:58.970> apps<00:03:59.120> for<00:03:59.239> the

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
selection of third-party apps for the

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:00.849 
selection of third-party apps for the
Apple<00:03:59.599> watch<00:03:59.629> but<00:03:59.780> the<00:04:00.109> only<00:04:00.349> problem<00:04:00.709> is<00:04:00.799> that

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
Apple watch but the only problem is that

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.770 
Apple watch but the only problem is that
they<00:04:01.159> actually<00:04:01.310> run<00:04:01.699> off<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.150> your<00:04:02.299> phone<00:04:02.540> and

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
they actually run off of your phone and

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.000 
they actually run off of your phone and
not<00:04:03.169> on<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.500> Apple<00:04:03.829> watch

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
not on the Apple watch

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.439 
not on the Apple watch
so<00:04:04.519> they're<00:04:04.639> basically<00:04:04.729> streaming<00:04:05.329> content

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
so they're basically streaming content

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.149 
so they're basically streaming content
from<00:04:05.840> your<00:04:05.989> phone<00:04:06.169> to<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.440> watch<00:04:06.650> which<00:04:06.949> makes

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
from your phone to the watch which makes

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.309 
from your phone to the watch which makes
them<00:04:07.340> very<00:04:07.609> slow<00:04:07.940> to<00:04:08.150> start<00:04:08.479> and<00:04:08.720> very<00:04:09.079> slow<00:04:09.260> to

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
them very slow to start and very slow to

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.319 
them very slow to start and very slow to
update<00:04:09.500> information<00:04:09.919> the<00:04:10.849> apps<00:04:11.000> are<00:04:11.150> pretty

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
update information the apps are pretty

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.490 
update information the apps are pretty
well<00:04:11.479> designed<00:04:11.629> but<00:04:11.930> it's<00:04:12.079> really<00:04:12.199> hard<00:04:12.409> to

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
well designed but it's really hard to

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.719 
well designed but it's really hard to
decide<00:04:12.709> if<00:04:12.859> you<00:04:12.949> should<00:04:12.979> use<00:04:13.250> them<00:04:13.430> or<00:04:13.549> not

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:13.729 
decide if you should use them or not

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:15.369 
decide if you should use them or not
for<00:04:14.239> example<00:04:14.690> should<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:14.959> really<00:04:15.079> be<00:04:15.199> making

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
for example should I really be making

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.319 
for example should I really be making
calculations<00:04:16.159> or<00:04:16.370> browsing<00:04:16.549> Instagram<00:04:17.120> on<00:04:17.239> my

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
calculations or browsing Instagram on my

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.789 
calculations or browsing Instagram on my
Apple<00:04:17.570> watch<00:04:17.599> I<00:04:17.870> can<00:04:18.019> just<00:04:18.229> take<00:04:18.349> out<00:04:18.470> my<00:04:18.500> phone

what the software can do it would take

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.810 
what the software can do it would take
forever<00:04:30.470> but<00:04:31.280> it<00:04:31.370> pretty<00:04:31.460> much<00:04:31.639> does

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
forever but it pretty much does
