00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.760 
gameplay it will probably be like a
screen<00:01:45.250> like<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:46.210> pie<00:01:46.360> record<00:01:46.870> my<00:01:47.050> own<00:01:47.230> screen

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
screen like a pie record my own screen

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.260 
screen like a pie record my own screen
but<00:01:48.190> sides<00:01:48.460> like<00:01:48.550> that<00:01:48.700> like<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:48.850> capture<00:01:49.240> card

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
but sides like that like a capture card

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.150 
but sides like that like a capture card
but<00:01:50.020> let<00:01:50.140> me<00:01:50.170> just<00:01:50.230> talk<00:01:50.440> about<00:01:50.620> we<00:01:50.710> gotta<00:01:50.890> seen

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
but let me just talk about we gotta seen

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.040 
but let me just talk about we gotta seen
the<00:01:51.250> trailer<00:01:51.640> so<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.150> clips<00:01:52.690> add<00:01:52.870> together

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
the trailer so the clips add together

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.420 
the trailer so the clips add together
actually<00:01:53.440> looked<00:01:53.710> pretty<00:01:53.920> good<00:01:54.070> we<00:01:54.280> saw

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
actually looked pretty good we saw

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.820 
actually looked pretty good we saw
batman<00:01:54.850> fight<00:01:55.120> Deathstroke<00:01:55.570> Deadshot<00:01:56.410> vain

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
batman fight Deathstroke Deadshot vain

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.670 
batman fight Deathstroke Deadshot vain
and<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.760> characters<00:01:58.120> look<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.360> same<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
and the characters look the same the

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.080 
and the characters look the same the
fighting<00:02:00.040> moves<00:02:00.220> looked<00:02:00.490> pretty<00:02:00.940> good

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
fighting moves looked pretty good

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.140 
fighting moves looked pretty good
obviously<00:02:01.330> was<00:02:01.630> like<00:02:02.610> minimized<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.940> like<00:02:04.120> a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
obviously was like minimized to like a

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.120 
obviously was like minimized to like a
mobile<00:02:04.540> standard<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.560> fighting<00:02:05.800> didn't

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
mobile standard so the fighting didn't

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.010 
mobile standard so the fighting didn't
look<00:02:06.250> like<00:02:06.310> precise<00:02:07.030> like<00:02:07.300> obviously<00:02:07.720> the

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
look like precise like obviously the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.759 
look like precise like obviously the
xbox<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.830> ps3<00:02:09.099> games<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:11.319> one<00:02:11.530> thing<00:02:11.650> I

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
xbox and ps3 games but the one thing I

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.619 
xbox and ps3 games but the one thing I
liked<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.069> we<00:02:12.489> saw<00:02:12.670> lots<00:02:12.879> of<00:02:13.060> skins<00:02:13.359> we<00:02:13.480> saw

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
liked is we saw lots of skins we saw

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.080 
liked is we saw lots of skins we saw
like<00:02:13.750> Batman<00:02:14.170> Beyond<00:02:14.439> skin<00:02:14.799> thank<00:02:15.099> God<00:02:15.310> and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
like Batman Beyond skin thank God and

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.610 
like Batman Beyond skin thank God and
I<00:02:16.180> think<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.510> was<00:02:16.599> like<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.840> Liberty<00:02:17.200> skin<00:02:17.500> we

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
I think it was like the Liberty skin we

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.890 
I think it was like the Liberty skin we
saw<00:02:17.769> at<00:02:18.040> least<00:02:18.099> a<00:02:18.400> bunch<00:02:18.849> of<00:02:18.970> skins<00:02:19.239> at<00:02:19.450> aren't

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.320 
haven't been even be reeled for the main
game<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.680> thought<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:25.000> free

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330
