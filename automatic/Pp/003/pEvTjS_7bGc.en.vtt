00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.410
 doorway before installation 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:15.540
 freed from all interfering protrusions 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.570
 residual mortar or wallpaper door 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.320
 usually comes with a box 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.029
 custom-made door 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.920
 opening box should be installed in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.920
 effortless opening but firmly 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.410
 it is very important to align it vertically 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.630
 if you don't do it later 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.030
 will spontaneously open and 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
 close further a box with a door 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.890
 fixed in place with wedges 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.930
 softwood usually pine 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.260
 if they are not clogged to the surface 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.260
 approximately 2 3 boxes on each side 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.500
 so as not to spoil the view 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.270
 hats screw hole for Chris too 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.270
 drilled in loops 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.609
 directly mount short 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.560
 made with long screws 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.890
 which must pass the box 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.890
 through 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.980
 but 2 screws are not enough therefore 3 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.610
 still there will be a video in the middle of the height 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.610
 the boxes 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.750
 when fasteners are made openings between 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.090
 box and wall moistened with 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.670
 spray gun to enhance the effect 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.670
 subsequent foaming with foam 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.310
 it is necessary to take into account that as 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.790
 polymerization foam volume increases in 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.790
 two or three times 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.950
 installation of fittings hard work 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.120
 for this it is better to use 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.340
 power tools but in some 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.920
 cases can not do without manual 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.930
 if pine hollow out a hole and 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.300
 completely under fittings pretty simple 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.620
 then the oak doors require much 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.320
 more voltage 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.800
 analyze the installation on the door 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.750
 bark than latch 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.950
 frezoy or drill wood chooses 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.950
 under the latch 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.719
 the latch is temporarily secured with self-tapping screws 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.349
 I drill holes for mounting 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:11.790
 screws and sharp special knife 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.790
 contour 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.530
 choose to sleep plate thickness 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.530
 latches 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.520
 there is a hole for the handle and 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.410
 ribbed rod transmitting force 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.830
 handles on the latch 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.560
 its standard size is 8 by 8 millimeters 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.340
 hole is drilled loop or 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.340
 twist drill 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.950
 fastened with a latch 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.689
 rod is inserted 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:07.050
 attached pens are outlined 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.050
 hole for mounting screws 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.530
 handles are fixed in place 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.250
 similarly mounted on the box lining 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:03.199
 under the latch 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.569
 we put in place mark the hole 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:10.449
 under fasteners 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:10.449
 ream through the sharp knife 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:28.430
 choose the thickness of the lining, taking into account 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.430
 surface curvature 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:41.080
 select the slot for the latch plate with 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.080
 stocks
