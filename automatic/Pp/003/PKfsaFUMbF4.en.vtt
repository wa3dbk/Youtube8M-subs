we<00:00:10.400> just<00:00:10.610> started<00:00:10.820> module<00:00:10.970> 24<00:00:11.719> I'm<00:00:12.019> actually

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
we just started module 24 I'm actually

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.039 
we just started module 24 I'm actually
finishing<00:00:12.830> up<00:00:13.160> module<00:00:13.549> 22<00:00:13.760> and<00:00:14.420> that<00:00:14.719> feel

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
finishing up module 22 and that feel

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.990 
finishing up module 22 and that feel
like<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.379> momentum<00:00:15.889> is<00:00:16.040> building<00:00:16.550> I<00:00:16.820> think

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
like the momentum is building I think

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.030 
like the momentum is building I think
listening<00:00:17.420> is<00:00:18.050> sort<00:00:18.349> of<00:00:18.439> the<00:00:18.619> biggest<00:00:18.830> thing

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
listening is sort of the biggest thing

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.470 
listening is sort of the biggest thing
and<00:00:19.430> I<00:00:19.490> think<00:00:19.759> it's<00:00:19.880> something<00:00:20.029> that<00:00:20.210> I've

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.960 
and I think it's something that I've
started<00:00:20.810> doing<00:00:21.320> outside<00:00:21.890> of<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:22.460> clients

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
started doing outside of the clients

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.970 
started doing outside of the clients
that<00:00:23.000> I'm<00:00:23.270> seeing<00:00:23.540> trying<00:00:24.259> that<00:00:24.560> with<00:00:24.830> my
