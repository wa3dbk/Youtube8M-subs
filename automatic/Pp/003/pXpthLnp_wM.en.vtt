00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
people looking at cook trees I always

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.670 
people looking at cook trees I always
wince<00:00:50.940> when<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.570> them<00:00:51.750> take<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.050> out<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
wince when I see them take it out of the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.590 
wince when I see them take it out of the
scabbard<00:00:52.980> because<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.210> them<00:00:54.390> nearly

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
scabbard because I can see them nearly

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.290 
scabbard because I can see them nearly
taking<00:00:55.020> their<00:00:55.170> fingers<00:00:55.530> off<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.030> this<00:00:57.030> does

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
taking their fingers off and this does

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.420 
taking their fingers off and this does
unfortunately<00:00:57.600> happen<00:00:58.440> quite<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> lot<00:00:58.949> because

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
unfortunately happen quite a lot because

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.450 
unfortunately happen quite a lot because
if<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.030> draw<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> cookery<00:01:01.050> incorrectly<00:01:01.829> what

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
if you draw the cookery incorrectly what

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.080 
if you draw the cookery incorrectly what
happens<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.470> edge<00:01:04.710> cuts<00:01:05.580> through

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
happens is that this edge cuts through

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.570 
happens is that this edge cuts through
that<00:01:06.689> inner<00:01:07.020> side<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> leather<00:01:08.130> here

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that inner side of the leather here

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.700 
that inner side of the leather here
because<00:01:09.210> you've<00:01:09.330> got<00:01:09.510> two<00:01:10.049> pieces<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.470> wood

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
because you've got two pieces of wood

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.859 
because you've got two pieces of wood
and<00:01:11.010> not<00:01:11.369> an<00:01:11.580> awful<00:01:11.850> lot<00:01:11.970> at<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> edge<00:01:12.330> except

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and not an awful lot at the edge except

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.020 
and not an awful lot at the edge except
for<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> leather<00:01:13.560> okay<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:14.970> very

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
for the leather okay so it's very

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.149 
for the leather okay so it's very
important<00:01:15.810> when<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.170> pick<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.590> cookery<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
important when you pick up a cookery and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.940 
important when you pick up a cookery and
you<00:01:17.430> want<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.759> draw<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.240> out<00:01:18.450> push<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.680> blade

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you want to draw it out push the blade

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.760 
you want to draw it out push the blade
towards<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> back<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.110> back<00:01:22.290> okay

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
towards the back this is the back okay

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920 
towards the back this is the back okay
the<00:01:22.979> edges<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.460> inside<00:01:23.610> curve<00:01:24.360> remember

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the edges on the inside curve remember

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.749 
the edges on the inside curve remember
so<00:01:25.500> when<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.799> go<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> draw<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.340> keep<00:01:26.610> your

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
so when you go to draw it keep your

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.920 
so when you go to draw it keep your
don't<00:01:27.390> hold<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.020> or<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:29.430> that

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
don't hold it like that or like that

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.840 
don't hold it like that or like that
keep<00:01:30.930> your<00:01:31.110> fingers<00:01:31.530> away<00:01:31.680> from<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.549> edge

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
keep your fingers away from the edge

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.960 
keep your fingers away from the edge
hold<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.689> back<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.140> blade<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.590> push<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
hold the back of the blade and push the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270 
hold the back of the blade and push the
back<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> cookery<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.680> back<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
back of the cookery to the back of the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.609 
back of the cookery to the back of the
scabbard<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.000> will<00:01:39.090> come<00:01:39.329> out<00:01:39.360> easily<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
scabbard and it will come out easily the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.830 
scabbard and it will come out easily the
same<00:01:40.890> thing<00:01:41.159> goes<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.640> putting<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.420> back<00:01:42.570> in

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
same thing goes for putting it back in

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
same thing goes for putting it back in
and<00:01:43.079> actually<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.860> actually<00:01:44.159> where<00:01:44.310> most

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
and actually this is actually where most

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.789 
and actually this is actually where most
people<00:01:44.640> mess<00:01:45.030> up<00:01:45.060> when<00:01:45.899> they<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> slide<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
people mess up when they go to slide it

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.200 
people mess up when they go to slide it
