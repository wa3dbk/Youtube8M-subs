okay<00:00:01.550> so<00:00:03.020> um<00:00:04.160> let's<00:00:05.160> do<00:00:05.430> this<00:00:06.150> example<00:00:06.690> problem

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
okay so um let's do this example problem

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.759 
okay so um let's do this example problem
and<00:00:07.620> here's<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.760> chemical<00:00:08.910> agent<00:00:09.570> so<00:00:10.440> I've

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
and here's the chemical agent so I've

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.650 
and here's the chemical agent so I've
written<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.340> chemical<00:00:11.730> equation<00:00:12.000> out<00:00:12.330> for

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
written the chemical equation out for

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.860 
written the chemical equation out for
you<00:00:12.870> but<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.500> should<00:00:14.219> be<00:00:14.670> able<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.150> do<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.570> on

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
you but you should be able to do this on

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.410 
you but you should be able to do this on
your<00:00:16.109> own<00:00:16.139> if<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.710> can't<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:18.210> need<00:00:18.359> to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
your own if you can't do it you need to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.200 
your own if you can't do it you need to
start<00:00:18.779> getting<00:00:19.140> together<00:00:19.260> okay<00:00:19.890> well<00:00:20.850> anyway

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
start getting together okay well anyway

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.880 
start getting together okay well anyway
so<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.539> says<00:00:21.750> calculate<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.500> number<00:00:22.859> of

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
so it says calculate the number of

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.340 
so it says calculate the number of
waters<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.609> hydration<00:00:23.840> present<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.140> sample

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
waters of hydration present in a sample

data one point five zero zero zero gram

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.180 
data one point five zero zero zero gram
sample<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.850> heated<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.630> stirring<00:00:37.050> until<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
sample is heated with stirring until the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.150 
sample is heated with stirring until the
crystals<00:00:38.640> are<00:00:38.790> reduced<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.360> dry<00:00:39.660> powder

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
crystals are reduced to a dry powder

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.220 
crystals are reduced to a dry powder
after<00:00:41.160> cooling<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.940> residue<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.660> found<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
after cooling the residue was found to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.479 
after cooling the residue was found to
weigh<00:00:44.510> 0.847<00:00:45.510> six<00:00:46.379> grams<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:49.250> let's<00:00:50.250> write

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
weigh 0.847 six grams so let's write

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.850 
weigh 0.847 six grams so let's write
down<00:00:50.520> what<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.210> problem<00:00:51.960> gives<00:00:52.199> us<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.710> just

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
down what the problem gives us it's just

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.400 
down what the problem gives us it's just
a<00:00:53.070> mass<00:00:53.280> total

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.950 

and<00:00:59.410> it<00:00:59.560> says<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.980> mass<00:01:00.250> of<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.700> residue<00:01:01.330> so

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
and it says the mass of the residue so

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.220 
and it says the mass of the residue so
what<00:01:02.260> is<00:01:02.830> the<00:01:03.100> residue<00:01:03.730> in<00:01:04.390> this<00:01:04.660> equation

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
what is the residue in this equation

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
what is the residue in this equation
what<00:01:05.560> would<00:01:05.740> be<00:01:05.860> left<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:08.020> magnesium<00:01:08.470> sultan

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
what would be left the magnesium sultan

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:19.170 
what would be left the magnesium sultan
right<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.820> mass<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.540> mag<00:01:16.750> sulfate<00:01:18.180> we

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
right so the mass of the mag sulfate we

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:29.219 
right so the mass of the mag sulfate we
said<00:01:19.479> was<00:01:22.500> 0.847<00:01:23.910> six<00:01:24.910> cream<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:28.270> can<00:01:29.110> we

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
said was 0.847 six cream so can we

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.109 
said was 0.847 six cream so can we
figure<00:01:29.440> out<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.950> mass<00:01:30.160> of<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.490> water<00:01:30.670> from

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
figure out the mass of the water from

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:46.950 
figure out the mass of the water from
this<00:01:31.300> then<00:01:32.310> okay<00:01:33.310> so<00:01:33.460> how<00:01:33.820> do<00:01:33.880> we<00:01:34.090> do<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:45.960> we

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
this then okay so how do we do that we

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:59.850 
this then okay so how do we do that we
do<00:01:47.140> that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:09.150 

we<00:02:00.860> get<00:02:03.460> 0.65<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:05.120> four<00:02:06.160> grams<00:02:07.160> of<00:02:07.940> water

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
we get 0.65 to four grams of water

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.040 
we get 0.65 to four grams of water
should<00:02:10.160> we<00:02:10.340> be<00:02:10.520> able<00:02:10.730> to<00:02:10.940> figure<00:02:11.540> out<00:02:11.810> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
should we be able to figure out the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.220 
should we be able to figure out the
number<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.410> moles<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:13.040> water<00:02:13.250> from<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:14.230> okay

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
number of moles of water from that okay

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.620 
number of moles of water from that okay
how<00:02:15.410> do<00:02:15.470> we<00:02:15.650> do<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:17.230> use<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.590> what<00:02:19.420> which<00:02:20.420> is

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
how do we do that use the what which is

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.990 
how do we do that use the what which is
the<00:02:20.930> well<00:02:21.140> what<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.250> conversion<00:02:22.460> factor

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
the well what is the conversion factor

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.020 
the well what is the conversion factor
we're<00:02:23.120> going<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.300> use<00:02:27.220> we<00:02:28.220> just<00:02:28.250> went<00:02:28.640> over<00:02:28.730> it

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
we're going to use we just went over it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.110 
we're going to use we just went over it
for<00:02:29.270> an<00:02:29.360> hour<00:02:29.480> last<00:02:30.640> hour

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
for an hour last hour

for an hour last hour
what<00:02:32.990> is<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.230> college<00:02:33.590> guys<00:02:34.150> what<00:02:35.150> is<00:02:35.270> that

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
what is it college guys what is that

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.940 
what is it college guys what is that
called

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
called

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:46.030 
called
the<00:02:36.950> molar<00:02:37.250> mass<00:02:37.670> okay<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:45.230> what<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.830> molar

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the molar mass okay so what is the molar

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.260 
the molar mass okay so what is the molar
mass<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.580> water

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
mass of water

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.800 
mass of water
you<00:02:47.390> guys<00:02:47.570> are<00:02:47.750> called<00:02:48.940> yes<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.450> what<00:02:50.630> are<00:02:50.690> we

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
you guys are called yes so what are we

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:07.090 
you guys are called yes so what are we
going<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.020> put<00:02:51.170> on<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.380> bottom<00:02:51.560> I<00:03:05.950> think<00:03:06.950> it's

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
going to put on the bottom I think it's

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.000 
going to put on the bottom I think it's
good<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.340> keep<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.880> because<00:03:08.680> we're<00:03:09.680> going<00:03:09.890> to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
good to keep that because we're going to

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:30.930 
good to keep that because we're going to
have<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.670> figure<00:03:11.000> out<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.010> get<00:03:19.570> 0.03<00:03:28.780> okay<00:03:29.920> so

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
have to figure out so I get 0.03 okay so

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.449 
have to figure out so I get 0.03 okay so
also<00:03:31.940> in<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:33.050> case<00:03:33.380> because<00:03:33.890> I'm<00:03:34.070> trying<00:03:34.340> to

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
also in this case because I'm trying to

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.510 
also in this case because I'm trying to
get<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.880> ratio<00:03:35.330> of<00:03:35.390> mag<00:03:36.260> sulfate<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:37.070> water<00:03:37.310> I

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
get the ratio of mag sulfate to water I

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.449 
get the ratio of mag sulfate to water I
need<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.150> moles<00:03:38.360> of<00:03:38.540> zinc<00:03:38.720> sulfate<00:03:39.320> to<00:03:39.620> okay

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
need the moles of zinc sulfate to okay

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.000 
need the moles of zinc sulfate to okay
because<00:03:41.270> remember<00:03:41.480> this<00:03:41.930> gives<00:03:42.200> us<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:42.530> mole<00:03:42.739> to

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
because remember this gives us a mole to

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.150 
because remember this gives us a mole to
mole<00:03:43.040> ratio<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:44.120> we<00:03:44.150> got<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.480> figure<00:03:44.630> out<00:03:44.750> that

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
mole ratio so we got to figure out that

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.979 
mole ratio so we got to figure out that
it's<00:03:46.160> everybody<00:03:46.489> okay<00:03:46.760> with<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:48.500> here<00:03:49.220> I

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
it's everybody okay with that so here I

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.800 
it's everybody okay with that so here I
multiply<00:03:50.989> it<00:03:51.020> by<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.350> Mack<00:03:51.650> sulfate<00:03:52.330> and<00:03:53.330> I

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
multiply it by the Mack sulfate and I

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.110 
multiply it by the Mack sulfate and I
calculated

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
calculated

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:06.050 
calculated
it's<00:03:55.480> one<00:03:55.890> 2037

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:21.699 

so<00:04:06.990> that's<00:04:07.200> just

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.060 

so<00:04:22.250> when<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:22.520> do<00:04:22.580> that<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:22.970> get<00:04:23.410> zero<00:04:24.410> point<00:04:24.889> zero

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
so when I do that I get zero point zero

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:35.590 
so when I do that I get zero point zero
zero<00:04:25.430> seven<00:04:26.180> zero<00:04:28.389> before<00:04:29.530> two<00:04:32.080> moles<00:04:34.600> mag

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
zero seven zero before two moles mag

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.150 
zero seven zero before two moles mag
sulfate<00:04:36.320> magnesium<00:04:36.889> sulfate<00:04:37.850> and<00:04:38.979> how<00:04:39.979> do<00:04:40.039> I

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
sulfate magnesium sulfate and how do I

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.850 
sulfate magnesium sulfate and how do I
figure<00:04:40.490> out<00:04:40.639> what<00:04:40.970> X<00:04:41.210> is<00:04:41.479> I've<00:04:42.139> got<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.680> take

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
figure out what X is I've got to take

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.580 
figure out what X is I've got to take
the<00:04:43.759> moles<00:04:43.970> of<00:04:44.240> this<00:04:44.539> and<00:04:44.870> divided<00:04:45.380> by<00:04:45.410> the

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
the moles of this and divided by the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.520 
the moles of this and divided by the
moles<00:04:45.919> of<00:04:46.100> this<00:04:46.310> okay<00:04:47.090> so<00:04:47.690> when<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:47.870> do<00:04:47.990> that

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.610 

this<00:04:51.530> is<00:04:51.590> actually<00:04:52.130> x<00:04:52.430> over<00:04:52.940> one<00:04:53.630> right<00:04:54.380> this

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
this is actually x over one right this

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
mag sulfate is just a warm so it's going

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:05.550

like that everybody okay that's how you

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.090
