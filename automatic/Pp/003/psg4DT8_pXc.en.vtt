00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.860
 hello my name is jespen and I'm an instructor 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.690
 preventive maintenance of caterpillar 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.360
 today I would like to talk a little about the 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.640
 filters on the cables the filter on rosh 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.920
 cable we've all changed one easy 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.230
 true but many people have not given 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.090
 account that the filters cut all the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.800
 filters have a project sequence 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.180
 different so when we put a 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.279
 new filter what you need to do is 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.310
 lubricate what in fact here you can see a 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.550
 diagram I like to use the lubricant of 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.020
 Assembly of o - rings cut is 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.239
 better than sticking your finger in the filter 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.550
 dirty that I just extracted and pass it by 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.789
 the board but you have to enter the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.250
 filter and turn it until it touches 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.929
 slightly the board and in this filter in 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.489
 particular it is indicated that afterwards there is 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.559
 turn it an extra third turn 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.660
 to show her what I want to say with 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.789
 this if we look right here in this 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.949
 This filter indicates that you have to sign 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.929
 the board and introduce turning towards the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.750
 right until it touches the board and then 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.520
 turn the fifth sixth of a turn now 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.920
 Most cut filters have 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.840
 of lines some have numbers and others 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.290
 Do not you wonder what they are for? 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.510
 These lines 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.340
 help you tighten the filter this 5 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.930
 sixth lap so there are three as your 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.050
 line when it reaches the manual part 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.700
 here you have to turn five numbers so 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.700
 they will have to turn it one full turn 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.380
 until you reach the two lines that would be 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.870
 the point where it reaches five 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.970
 sixth of a round east of here in a 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.250
 third have separate lines 120 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.140
 each other so if it ends in a 2 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.530
 in this position you would have to turn 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.150
 that would indicate 3 and in each of our 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.490
 filters a sequence of 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.100
 tighten differently in this filter 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.830
 oil in the back that can not 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.050
 see yourself in this filter turns a turn 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.670
 after making contact so he has 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.530
 to read the filters and see the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.530
 indications before tightening
