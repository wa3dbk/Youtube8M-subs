00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.480 

I'm<00:00:08.380> going<00:00:08.680> to<00:00:08.830> talk<00:00:09.430> about

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
I'm going to talk about

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.180 
I'm going to talk about
and<00:00:12.059> you're<00:00:12.210> assigned

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
and you're assigned

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.510 
and you're assigned
studying<00:00:13.790> right<00:00:14.950> part<00:00:15.950> of<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.070> difficulty

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
studying right part of the difficulty

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.390 
studying right part of the difficulty
since<00:00:16.760> there's<00:00:17.119> that<00:00:17.330> there<00:00:17.539> is<00:00:17.810> a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
since there's that there is a

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.190 
since there's that there is a
proliferation<00:00:19.400> of<00:00:19.849> emotions<00:00:20.390> everything

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
proliferation of emotions everything

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.109 
proliferation of emotions everything
from<00:00:22.210> fear<00:00:23.680> disgust<00:00:24.680> evidence<00:00:25.369> right<00:00:25.699> through

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
from fear disgust evidence right through

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:35.229 
from fear disgust evidence right through
to<00:00:27.310> surprise<00:00:28.660> in<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:30.109> grass<00:00:33.070> so<00:00:34.070> what<00:00:34.850> I<00:00:34.879> think

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
to surprise in the grass so what I think

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.299 
to surprise in the grass so what I think
that<00:00:35.420> to<00:00:35.839> study<00:00:36.080> emotion<00:00:36.500> you<00:00:36.589> have<00:00:36.769> to<00:00:36.920> go<00:00:37.100> and

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
that to study emotion you have to go and

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.700 
that to study emotion you have to go and
study<00:00:37.610> each<00:00:38.000> individual<00:00:38.839> motion<00:00:39.230> that<00:00:39.589> would

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
study each individual motion that would

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.500 
study each individual motion that would
be<00:00:42.309> my<00:00:43.309> view<00:00:43.339> is<00:00:43.610> that<00:00:43.640> we<00:00:43.790> now<00:00:44.089> should<00:00:44.300> look

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
be my view is that we now should look

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.600 
be my view is that we now should look
for<00:00:44.809> common<00:00:45.530> denominators<00:00:46.190> is<00:00:46.430> there

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
for common denominators is there

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.640 
for common denominators is there
anything<00:00:46.879> that<00:00:47.290> underpanties

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
anything that underpanties

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.340 
anything that underpanties
all<00:00:48.979> emotions<00:00:49.430> that<00:00:49.850> can<00:00:50.059> unify<00:00:50.629> them<00:00:50.930> in<00:00:51.170> a

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
all emotions that can unify them in a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.859 
all emotions that can unify them in a
way<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:51.530> we<00:00:52.010> lump<00:00:52.640> them<00:00:52.850> together<00:00:52.970> has

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:53.869 
way that we lump them together has

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:56.740 
way that we lump them together has
emotions<00:00:54.409> so<00:00:55.250> I'm<00:00:55.309> going<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.519> suggest<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:56.000> in

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
emotions so I'm going to suggest that in

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.799 
emotions so I'm going to suggest that in
fact<00:00:57.369> emotions<00:00:58.369> can<00:00:58.610> be<00:00:58.640> reduced<00:00:59.119> to<00:00:59.420> some

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
fact emotions can be reduced to some

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.490 
fact emotions can be reduced to some
sort<00:01:00.110> of<00:01:00.229> representation<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:02.500> emotions

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
sort of representation of emotions

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.070 
sort of representation of emotions
reflect<00:01:03.920> whether<00:01:04.129> things<00:01:04.640> or<00:01:05.059> situations<00:01:05.810> or

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
reflect whether things or situations or

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.980 
reflect whether things or situations or
context<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.799> good<00:01:07.040> or<00:01:07.250> bad

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
context of good or bad

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.690 
context of good or bad
very<00:01:08.990> often<00:01:09.290> these<00:01:09.470> representations<00:01:10.400> are

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
very often these representations are

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.440 
very often these representations are
associated<00:01:11.420> with<00:01:11.450> a<00:01:12.250> disposition<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.450> act

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
associated with a disposition to act

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.010 
associated with a disposition to act
approach<00:01:15.290> your<00:01:16.070> case

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
approach your case
