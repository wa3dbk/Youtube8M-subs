you think you have enough room to clear
it<00:02:13.709> but<00:02:13.950> you'll<00:02:14.220> end<00:02:14.370> up<00:02:14.430> hitting<00:02:14.640> anyway<00:02:15.170> the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
cars themselves are very skittish

they're overly sensitive to any kind of

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
control input you put into them and so

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.760 
control input you put into them and so
you'll<00:02:23.160> find<00:02:23.190> yourself<00:02:23.459> sliding<00:02:24.090> over

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770

because<00:02:28.790> like<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.150> said<00:02:29.210> a<00:02:29.500> Simpsons<00:02:30.500> game<00:02:31.310> that

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
because like I said a Simpsons game that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.370 
because like I said a Simpsons game that
plays<00:02:32.090> like<00:02:32.360> crazy<00:02:32.570> taxi<00:02:32.810> would<00:02:33.170> have<00:02:33.290> been

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.930 
went to the studio to record new lines
specifically<00:02:39.500> for<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.740> game<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.550> while<00:02:40.730> many

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
seem like I'm nitpicking but when you

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.540 
seem like I'm nitpicking but when you
hear<00:03:09.110> that<00:03:09.260> four<00:03:09.680> or<00:03:09.770> five<00:03:09.920> times<00:03:10.160> in<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.460> span

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
hear that four or five times in the span

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.720 
hear that four or five times in the span
of<00:03:10.700> 60<00:03:11.060> seconds<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:12.110> can<00:03:12.320> kind<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.370> get<00:03:13.550> real

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
of 60 seconds I can kind of get real

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.250

similar situations like that the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.580 
similar situations like that the

decent<00:03:18.980> there's<00:03:19.190> no<00:03:19.790> slowdown<00:03:20.270> really<00:03:20.600> and

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
decent there's no slowdown really and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.080 
decent there's no slowdown really and
minimum<00:03:22.070> pop<00:03:22.280> up<00:03:22.900> but<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:23.960> game<00:03:24.290> seems<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.770> use

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
minimum pop up but the game seems to use

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.880 
minimum pop up but the game seems to use
a<00:03:26.090> weird<00:03:26.630> sort<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:26.960> cell<00:03:27.170> shading<00:03:27.500> it's<00:03:27.710> hard

a weird sort of cell shading it's hard

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:28.930 
a weird sort of cell shading it's hard

however<00:03:43.700> one<00:03:44.480> nice<00:03:44.660> thing<00:03:44.690> about<00:03:44.930> road<00:03:45.290> rage

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
however one nice thing about road rage

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.710 
however one nice thing about road rage
is<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.790> will<00:03:47.000> give<00:03:47.180> you<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.330> fair<00:03:47.600> amount

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
is that it will give you a fair amount

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.660 
is that it will give you a fair amount
