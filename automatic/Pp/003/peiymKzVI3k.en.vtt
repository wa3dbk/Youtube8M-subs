00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
years ago and it's still considered one

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.410 
years ago and it's still considered one
of<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> best<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.559> different<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.420> there

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
of the best and it's different and there

of the best and it's different and there
was<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> robustness<00:00:46.230> well<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.340> one

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
was a robustness well this is the one

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.970 
was a robustness well this is the one
that<00:00:48.090> has<00:00:48.360> been<00:00:48.570> had<00:00:49.110> some<00:00:49.320> compost<00:00:49.770> with

also<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.990> make<00:02:01.860> some<00:02:02.040> more<00:02:02.159> prone<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.490> blight

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
also is make some more prone to blight

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.760 
also is make some more prone to blight
so<00:02:03.299> for<00:02:03.630> these<00:02:03.719> early<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.290> hitters<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.619> going

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
so for these early but hitters I'm going

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.590 
so for these early but hitters I'm going
to<00:02:04.829> put<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> nitrogen<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.820> chicken<00:02:06.509> manure

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
to put a nitrogen in the chicken manure

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.109 
to put a nitrogen in the chicken manure
but<00:02:06.869> for<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> next<00:02:07.170> load<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.680> potatoes

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
but for the next load of potatoes

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.449 
but for the next load of potatoes
not<00:02:08.390> going<00:02:08.659> to<00:02:08.780> use<00:02:08.929> that<00:02:08.979> so<00:02:09.979> that's<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.280> I'll

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
not going to use that so that's it I'll

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.000 
not going to use that so that's it I'll
just<00:02:10.610> went<00:02:11.030> talked<00:02:11.330> about<00:02:11.569> John<00:02:11.870> John<00:02:12.709> Berry

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
just went talked about John John Berry

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.300

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
to use and organic fertilizer so I'm not

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.289 
to use and organic fertilizer so I'm not
going<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.099> use<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:25.670> time<00:02:25.940> I'm<00:02:26.090> going<00:02:26.239> to

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
going to use that this time I'm going to

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.509 
going to use that this time I'm going to
use<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.510> on<00:02:27.049> the<00:02:27.260> next<00:02:27.409> by<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.860> trial<00:02:28.190> for

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
use that on the next by the trial for

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.309 
use that on the next by the trial for
some<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:28.940> others<00:02:29.209> but<00:02:29.659> this<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.170> way<00:02:30.290> I

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
some of the others but this is the way I

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.259 
some of the others but this is the way I
did<00:02:30.769> them<00:02:30.950> last<00:02:30.980> year<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:31.760> that's<00:02:31.940> what<00:02:32.030> people

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
did them last year so that's what people

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:40.650 
did them last year so that's what people
want<00:02:32.299> to<00:02:32.540> see<00:02:36.220> if<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:39.470> your<00:02:39.620> fertilizer<00:02:40.250> bags

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
want to see if I to your fertilizer bags

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.110 
want to see if I to your fertilizer bags
just<00:02:41.660> one<00:02:42.319> inside<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.739> other<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.489> for

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
just one inside the other and for

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
drainage drainage is a very complicated

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.869 
drainage drainage is a very complicated
issue<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.569> this<00:02:47.569> is<00:02:47.720> how<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:47.959> sort<00:02:48.319> of<00:02:48.410> night

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
issue and this is how you sort of night

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.430 
issue and this is how you sort of night
give<00:02:49.879> your<00:02:50.060> night<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.840> bag<00:02:54.019> is<00:02:54.049> going<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.379> be

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
give your night the bag is going to be

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.080 
give your night the bag is going to be
sitting<00:02:54.620> on<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.859> ground<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.340> there<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.060> I

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
sitting on the ground of it there so I

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:04.750 
sitting on the ground of it there so I
just<00:03:02.319> that's<00:03:03.319> it<00:03:03.470> done<00:03:03.680> all<00:03:04.129> you<00:03:04.430> want<00:03:04.609> to<00:03:04.670> do

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
just that's it done all you want to do

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.520 
just that's it done all you want to do
is<00:03:04.849> the<00:03:04.970> excess<00:03:05.480> water<00:03:05.659> right<00:03:05.930> potatoes<00:03:06.379> are

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
is the excess water right potatoes are

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.470 
is the excess water right potatoes are
very<00:03:06.769> thirsty<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.519> you<00:03:07.819> would<00:03:07.940> probably<00:03:08.090> not

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
very thirsty and you would probably not

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.059 
very thirsty and you would probably not
be<00:03:08.510> able<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.900> give<00:03:09.049> your<00:03:09.170> potatoes<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.799> amount

on i'm going to try again with
supermarket<00:05:07.440> potatoes<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:08.130> then<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.789> final

supermarket potatoes so then the final
part<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.389> this<00:05:09.510> nature<00:05:09.750> is<00:05:13.099> another<00:05:14.099> three<00:05:14.430> or

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
part of this nature is another three or

I<00:05:22.860> don't<00:05:23.860> be<00:05:23.979> too<00:05:24.490> critical<00:05:24.699> about<00:05:25.060> this<00:05:25.240> just

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
I don't be too critical about this just

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.420 
I don't be too critical about this just
whatever's<00:05:25.720> left<00:05:25.960> and<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.169> tray<00:05:26.410> goes<00:05:26.680> in<00:05:26.860> and

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
whatever's left and the tray goes in and

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.890 
whatever's left and the tray goes in and
then<00:05:27.639> whenever<00:05:27.849> this<00:05:28.060> shoots<00:05:28.300> start<00:05:28.569> coming

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
then whenever this shoots start coming

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.249 
then whenever this shoots start coming
up<00:05:29.220> that's<00:05:30.220> am<00:05:30.430> gone<00:05:33.900> so<00:05:34.900> there's<00:05:35.020> about

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
up that's am gone so there's about

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.379 
up that's am gone so there's about
another<00:05:35.349> about<00:05:35.800> four<00:05:36.370> inches<00:05:36.699> is<00:05:36.849> posing<00:05:37.060> top

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
another about four inches is posing top

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.330 
another about four inches is posing top
of<00:05:37.509> those<00:05:37.569> potatoes<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.530> then<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.800> final<00:05:38.979> bit

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
of those potatoes and then the final bit

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.990 
of those potatoes and then the final bit
is<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:40.330> most<00:05:40.509> important<00:05:40.990> i<00:05:41.080> think<00:05:41.639> the<00:05:42.639> label

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
is the most important i think the label
