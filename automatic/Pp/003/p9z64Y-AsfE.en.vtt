00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.009
 a 10 friends of youtube subscribers 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.660
 As you know, I have done many 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.300
 speed comparisons in fact 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.690
 too many in truth but this is one of 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.839
 the most important ones we will compare the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.810
 new ipod with the previous ipod and 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.000
 also with iphone 6 and each one of 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.949
 these devices are here for a 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.550
 reason we go to a logo and start with 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.550
 the video 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.080
 I told him we have two ipads of fifth 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.390
 You will ask me generation 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.120
 what is it that we have one in six and 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.059
 another in ios seven we have the new ipad 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.400
 I'm not going to discuss what it's called 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.120
 ipod sixth generation out the new 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.580
 ipod of 2015 and we have iphone 6 the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.000
 As I told you, everyone is here for a 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.830
 reason that I would like to explain to you in 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.900
 this video after we see the 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.699
 results as you can see the two of the 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.589
 right they have a gigabyte of memory 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:03.440
 ram with 8 both but iphone 6 the 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.049
 it has 1.4 gigabytes 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.040
 while the new iphone the iphone of 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.590
 sixth generation has 1.13 gigabytes 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.680
 both run at 8.4 while the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.720
 two on the left have 500 mb of 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.659
 ram memory about 5 to 800 mb in this case 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.930
 as I told you one running at 18.4 and 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.480
 another taking ios 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.640
 so you can see the 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.250
 difference yes that already here I ran the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.770
 exam and let's see which one ends 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.780
 first I'm going to advance it a little bit 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.670
 but I'm going to tell you that after 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.979
 finish the iphone 6 block you can see 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.620
 that ended and the ipod touch ended 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.470
 quickly there almost at the same time that 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.710
 iphone 6 plus the other 2 took 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.660
 more than two minutes to finish and there 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.780
 you can see the score guys 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.520
 it is really impressive the change that 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:03.550
 have done since 1600 1300 and the others 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.140
 two are in the 200 see and that's why 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.149
 I said it is important that we have 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.020
 these devices see how to generate with 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:15.150
 tots that are in ios 6 have a slight 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.280
 higher score than the ipod that has 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.070
 ios 8.4 I'll explain why more 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.959
 ahead here runs another exam is a 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.100
 exam where we are going to see the photographs 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.140
 per second 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.370
 the videos as a network are reproduced in 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.020
 each device 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.650
 I liked it here because here we come 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.560
 to see the importance 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.049
 because the ipod touch where the ipod touch 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.129
 it looks because we have an expo toys a 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:44.099
 screen that is 640 and iphone 6 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:47.220
 plus is a 1080 screen there and 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.010
 you can see that the ipod although the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.049
 iphone is more powerful the ipod has a 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.230
 greater photography per second has almost 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.480
 60 photographs per second while 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.629
 The iPhone 6 is kept in 30 work 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.040
 per second is not bad but it is not so 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:07.530
 high as we can see in the ipod the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.540
 new ipod while on the ipod of 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.940
 fifth generation Three years ago 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.099
 it's in 13 pictures per second and 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.099
 you can see that the video is not seen 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.230
 same and we have a score on the 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:24.810
 ipod touch we see the score that is of 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:28.230
 4 thousand 633 twice what we're going to see 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.659
 on the iphone 6 plus that is 2 thousand 88 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.209
 while in the fifth ipod 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.699
 generation we have 855 you can 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.069
 see the difference really there in the 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:41.909
 numbers on the ipod touch 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.859
 We could not see because it never came out 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.739
 I think it's an older version 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.599
 guys but there we can see the 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.310
 results from here now next 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.969
 exam all exams are going to be 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.950
 down here is an ex and I put it for that 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:58.709
 same because I wanted to see again the 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.099
 photography per second as it is 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.139
 difference how this ipod touch is a lot 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.989
 better for the games because it has a 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:09.389
 smaller screen and the processor that 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.540
 it has is the same processor of the iphone 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:14.280
 or iphone 6 and the speed although not 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.769
 is the same but good is for the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.239
 screen here run of exam that 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.340
 called the 'tie-break' I'm going to give 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.750
 all the exams here below 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.460
 select one only and there you 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.449
 can see the quality as it looks 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.949
 unfortunately I have a problem with the 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.070
 reflection of the lights I was using 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.259
 but you can see how fluid it is 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.389
 go on the two devices on the right 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.270
 while in the fifth ipod 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.800
 generation is paused it looks like five 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.070
 foreigners per second already when we see 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:49.260
 the results we see 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:51.480
 the new ipod ran to 52 photos 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.210
 per second while the iphone 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.430
 ran to 42 and that's why he has a 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.570
 higher score than the portos 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.390
 new and the old ipod touch has 327 and 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.640
 ran at 5 photographs per second per 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.760
 that was that it looked like that guys 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.580
 and that's the most important thing here 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.820
 comparison between these two types ok is 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.580
 something super logical that is too much 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.090
 years are three years that have passed and by 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.680
 that is that we see a comparison like that 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.150
 as very exaggerated is a true 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.940
 weening and finally we're going to run from 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.700
 exam that is like that of the program but 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.390
 you already know it is to see which 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.310
 browser is faster and in this one the 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.630
 ends first although I do not say it 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.120
 all together because you are going to see 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.210
 that the two slower I said 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.680
 first and do not finish first in the 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.410
 score we will also notice 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.700
 see how the iphone was going much more 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.180
 up and that goes 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.620
 now in the score I have to 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.660
 Give it a little to the front camera 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.120
 fast because if we are not going to last 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.590
 too much here you can see that the 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.900
 iphone has 360 milli-milliseconds 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.600
 much faster the one that has less 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.110
 points is the winner in this case because 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:18.780
 it's time 431 for the ipod toch 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:21.510
 new and 1807 look here again where 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.570
 we see that the ipod touch that is in ios 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.010
 6 is a little faster because that is a 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.510
 message also want to give 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:33.210
 ios 6 was made for this device 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:36.120
 then when we upload an ipod of 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:39.630
 fifth generation we raised it to 28.4 there 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.670
 is going to see what is not very very 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.320
 optimized and we can already see the 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.480
 difference between the two ipod that we 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.180
 interesting that is the fifth iphone 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:52.950
 Nation and the new iPad is a difference 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:56.580
 of almost triple three years 84 if more 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.560
 of the triple of each year is like 400 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.379
 guys, I'm going to let you write until 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.080
 here only giving a demonstration of 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:06.599
 something that we all already knew how 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.389
 evolved the ipod touch from the 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:10.560
 fifth generation to the sixth generation 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:12.240
 although it is not called like that and I do not want 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.650
 get into discussions guys and now I'm going 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.419
 to reveal up here opens up like 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.770
 always a little hand up Martian phone 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.770
 close section 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.939
 yes
