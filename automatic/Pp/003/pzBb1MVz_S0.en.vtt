00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
well whatever white of it is still left

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.310 
well whatever white of it is still left
when<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.680> turn<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.490> change<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.180> dial<00:01:21.659> you'll

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
when you turn and change the dial you'll

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.190 
when you turn and change the dial you'll
change<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> different<00:01:23.310> setting<00:01:23.700> M<00:01:24.200> stands

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
change to a different setting M stands

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.039 
change to a different setting M stands
for<00:01:25.320> manual<00:01:25.830> mode<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.280> for<00:01:26.909> aperture<00:01:27.390> value<00:01:27.780> s

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
for manual mode a for aperture value s

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.700 
for manual mode a for aperture value s
for<00:01:28.650> shutter<00:01:28.860> speed<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.430> P<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:30.030> program<00:01:30.420> mode

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
for shutter speed and P for program mode

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.960 
for shutter speed and P for program mode
for<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> most<00:01:31.979> part<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.310> want<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> stick

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
for the most part I want you to stick

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.590 
for the most part I want you to stick
with<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.470> four<00:01:34.470> aperture<00:01:34.890> value<00:01:35.189> s<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:36.390> shutter

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
with a four aperture value s for shutter

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.530 
with a four aperture value s for shutter
speed<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.110> M<00:01:37.680> now<00:01:38.460> M<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> be<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> lot

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
speed or M now M is going to be a lot

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.319 
speed or M now M is going to be a lot
harder<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.990> learn<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.700> more<00:01:41.700> likely<00:01:42.090> will<00:01:42.210> be

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
harder to learn so more likely will be

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.270 
harder to learn so more likely will be
only<00:01:42.540> modifying<00:01:43.140> shutter<00:01:43.409> speed<00:01:43.710> or<00:01:43.920> aperture

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
only modifying shutter speed or aperture

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.030 
only modifying shutter speed or aperture
value<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> let's<00:01:48.180> go<00:01:48.329> over<00:01:48.479> an<00:01:48.540> example<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:49.229> you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
value so let's go over an example if you

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.410 
value so let's go over an example if you
are<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:51.829> s<00:01:52.829> mode<00:01:53.520> which<00:01:53.729> stands<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.060> shutter

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
are in s mode which stands for shutter

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.590 
are in s mode which stands for shutter
speed<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.399> activate<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.820> dial<00:01:57.270> right<00:01:57.540> here

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
speed you activate this dial right here

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.990 
speed you activate this dial right here
okay<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.219> move<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.790> dial<00:02:01.159> if<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.369> if<00:02:02.729> I

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
okay if you move this dial if I if I

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.350 
okay if you move this dial if I if I
move<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.509> dial<00:02:03.780> right<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:05.030> you'll<00:02:06.030> notice

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
move that dial right here you'll notice

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.979 
move that dial right here you'll notice
this<00:02:06.990> number<00:02:07.350> here<00:02:07.829> continues<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.700> grow<00:02:08.989> when

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
this number here continues to grow when

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.220 
this number here continues to grow when
I<00:02:10.020> change<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.830> right<00:02:10.970> okay<00:02:11.970> if<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.989> move

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
I change it to the right okay if I move

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.709 
I change it to the right okay if I move
it<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.500> left

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:14.719 
it to the left

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:19.130 
it to the left
it<00:02:15.719> actually<00:02:15.959> decreases<00:02:17.269> so<00:02:18.269> I'm<00:02:18.510> controlling

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
it actually decreases so I'm controlling

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.780 
it actually decreases so I'm controlling
the<00:02:19.230> shutter<00:02:19.469> speed<00:02:19.739> which<00:02:19.859> is<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.250> left

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the shutter speed which is this left

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.229 
the shutter speed which is this left
number<00:02:21.030> here<00:02:22.549> now<00:02:23.549> what<00:02:23.760> if<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.000> want<00:02:24.180> to

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
number here now what if you want to

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.179 
number here now what if you want to
control<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.659> aperture<00:02:24.959> value<00:02:25.140> instead<00:02:25.859> well

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
control the aperture value instead well

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.729 
control the aperture value instead well
in<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:27.450> case<00:02:27.510> you're<00:02:28.170> going<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.349> turn<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
in that case you're going to turn the

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.240 
in that case you're going to turn the
dial<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:29.219> the<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.750> once<00:02:30.750> it's<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.250> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
dial to the a once it's on the a the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.660 
dial to the a once it's on the a the
camera<00:02:32.730> has<00:02:33.140> activated<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.530> dial<00:02:35.040> here<00:02:35.370> to

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
camera has activated this dial here to

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.879 
camera has activated this dial here to
change<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.269> aperture<00:02:36.720> value<00:02:36.750> only<00:02:39.409> so<00:02:40.409> you

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
change the aperture value only so you

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.800 
change the aperture value only so you
can<00:02:41.069> change<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.549> aperture<00:02:41.939> value<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.569> you'll

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
can change the aperture value and you'll

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.330 
can change the aperture value and you'll
notice<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.230> shutter<00:02:43.439> speed<00:02:43.620> change<00:02:44.010> as<00:02:44.159> well

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
notice the shutter speed change as well

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.429 
notice the shutter speed change as well
so<00:02:44.879> pay<00:02:45.120> attention<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.870> F<00:02:45.989> number<00:02:46.319> here<00:02:46.650> so

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
so pay attention to the F number here so

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.660 
so pay attention to the F number here so
I'm<00:02:49.439> moving<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.859> the<00:02:49.889> right<00:02:49.980> five<00:02:50.400> point

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
I'm moving it to the right five point

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.059 
I'm moving it to the right five point
six<00:02:50.909> six<00:02:51.480> point<00:02:51.780> three<00:02:51.840> seven<00:02:52.709> point<00:02:53.010> one

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
six six point three seven point one

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.429 
six six point three seven point one
while<00:02:53.849> you're<00:02:54.060> changing<00:02:54.359> that<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.049> shutter

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
while you're changing that the shutter

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.520 
while you're changing that the shutter
speed<00:02:55.829> is<00:02:56.010> changing<00:02:57.139> dependent<00:02:58.139> on<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
speed is changing dependent on the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.789 
speed is changing dependent on the
actual<00:02:58.889> f-stop<00:02:59.639> number<00:02:59.930> okay<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.590> can<00:03:01.709> see

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
actual f-stop number okay so you can see

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.960 
actual f-stop number okay so you can see
you<00:03:01.859> can<00:03:01.950> see<00:03:02.129> that<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.459> allows<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.939> to

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
you can see that so that allows you to

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.300 
you can see that so that allows you to
adjust<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.480> shutter<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.560> aperture<00:03:07.980> value

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
adjust the shutter the aperture value

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.759 
adjust the shutter the aperture value
why<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:09.359> might<00:03:09.720> want<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:10.019> be<00:03:10.139> able<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.349> control

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
why you might want to be able to control

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.190 
why you might want to be able to control
the<00:03:10.950> aperture<00:03:11.250> or<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.909> shutter<00:03:12.060> speed<00:03:12.329> at<00:03:13.139> any

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
the aperture or the shutter speed at any

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.409 
the aperture or the shutter speed at any
given<00:03:13.590> time<00:03:13.889> I'll<00:03:14.310> go<00:03:14.609> into<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.939> more<00:03:15.180> in

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
given time I'll go into that more in

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.990 
given time I'll go into that more in
detail<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:16.980> want<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.459> know<00:03:17.700> that

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
remember the value of ISO the way to

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.199 
remember the value of ISO the way to
adjust<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.650> ISO<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.489> you'll<00:03:26.699> notice<00:03:26.940> it

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
adjust the ISO and you'll notice it

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.500 
adjust the ISO and you'll notice it
that's<00:03:27.419> 1600<00:03:28.349> right<00:03:28.500> there<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.970> number<00:03:30.329> is

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
that's 1600 right there that number is

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.189 
that's 1600 right there that number is
your<00:03:30.659> max<00:03:30.900> ISO<00:03:31.409> to<00:03:31.470> change<00:03:31.949> the<00:03:32.220> ISO<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:33.840> have

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
you actually have to hold it down so

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.319 
you actually have to hold it down so
you're<00:03:41.159> going<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.310> push<00:03:41.609> that<00:03:41.819> function

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
you're going to push that function

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.289 
you're going to push that function
button<00:03:42.629> in<00:03:42.810> word<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.799> while<00:03:44.790> you're<00:03:44.970> pushing

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
button in word and while you're pushing

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.110 
button in word and while you're pushing
it<00:03:45.599> you'll<00:03:46.109> notice<00:03:46.409> that<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.979> 1600<00:03:47.909> here

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
it you'll notice that the 1600 here

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.670 
it you'll notice that the 1600 here
turns<00:03:48.870> yellow<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:50.069> see<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.280> value<00:03:50.579> here

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
turns yellow and you see a value here

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.409 
turns yellow and you see a value here
okay<00:03:52.680> actually<00:03:53.459> that's<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.940> different<00:03:54.269> value

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
okay actually that's a different value

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.110 
okay actually that's a different value
dealing<00:03:54.989> with<00:03:55.109> but<00:03:55.290> that's<00:03:55.440> 1600<00:03:56.190> shows<00:03:56.430> up<00:03:56.669> so

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
dealing with but that's 1600 shows up so

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.089 
dealing with but that's 1600 shows up so
we<00:03:57.239> turn<00:03:57.419> to<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.599> left<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.859> value<00:03:59.099> decreases

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
we turn to the left the value decreases

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.439 
we turn to the left the value decreases
zoom<00:04:02.099> in<00:04:02.250> here<00:04:03.620> okay<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:05.579> as<00:04:05.729> I<00:04:05.849> turn<00:04:05.909> the<00:04:06.239> left

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
zoom in here okay so as I turn the left

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.179 
zoom in here okay so as I turn the left
it<00:04:06.599> decreases<00:04:07.199> I<00:04:07.409> turn<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.799> right<00:04:07.949> it

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
it decreases I turn to the right it

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.990 
it decreases I turn to the right it
increases<00:04:08.790> very<00:04:09.750> simple<00:04:10.259> and<00:04:10.829> I<00:04:10.889> said<00:04:11.099> 1600<00:04:11.909> is

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
increases very simple and I said 1600 is

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.059 
increases very simple and I said 1600 is
native<00:04:12.829> hi1

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
native hi1

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.729 
native hi1
is<00:04:14.370> an<00:04:15.109> additional<00:04:16.109> setting<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.560> don't

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
is an additional setting you don't

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.860 
is an additional setting you don't
really<00:04:16.889> want<00:04:17.159> to<00:04:17.280> go<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.669> one<00:04:17.849> so<00:04:18.780> that's

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
really want to go to that one so that's

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.469 
really want to go to that one so that's
how<00:04:19.079> you<00:04:19.139> adjust<00:04:19.320> shutter<00:04:20.250> speed<00:04:20.549> aperture

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
how you adjust shutter speed aperture

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.920 
how you adjust shutter speed aperture
value<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:23.510> ISO<00:04:24.510> on<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:25.110> camera
