00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
inspired me to dance it was a

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.960 
inspired me to dance it was a
realization<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.439> childhood<00:01:07.439> dream<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.460> join

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
realization of a childhood dream to join

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.300 
realization of a childhood dream to join
abt<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> company<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:11.220> was

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
abt and that was the company there was

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.340 
abt and that was the company there was
never<00:01:11.520> any<00:01:11.820> other<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.540> me<00:01:12.659> yeah<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> think

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
never any other for me yeah I think

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.109 
never any other for me yeah I think
that's<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.740> might<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.850> greatest

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that's that might be the the greatest

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.210 
that's that might be the the greatest
takeaway<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.689> me<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.860> friendships

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
