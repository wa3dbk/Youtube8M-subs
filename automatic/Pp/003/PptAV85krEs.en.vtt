00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.320
 I was laid out 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.320
 phone times in the coming 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:10.949
 now is my liquid 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.609
 very good after a summer close 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:16.470
 I have to go all the way 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.159
 Getting the green light 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.159
 and those are injections 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.759
 what i use 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.660
 this is my life again 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.710
 reza khatami has the worst form of cluster headache all day long 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.190
 he has 18 attacks 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.620
 chorus about that had day in day out rhenen year 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.560
 he fights against the enormous chain of headache attacks for up to two hours 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.830
 medicines don't work 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.830
 he has even been about to commit suicide 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.650
 I had tried twice 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.680
 to end 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.080
 because I don't have that anymore 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.399
 such a house is for sale 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.810
 He has become unemployed and troubled by the cluster headache 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.780
 the debt restructuring ended up 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.840
 during the short interview we have with him, he can do another one 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.670
 attack on the day knew just halfway it is a tenth already 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.980
 yes sorry i have to and 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.409
 to counter the attacker used somewhat can not be hundreds of liters 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.580
 oxygen and two hundred syringes per week 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.430
 my life is already a sister that is punctually indexed 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.200
 that is my life 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.450
 I don't look outside 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.190
 I can't go anywhere 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.549
 but through the day 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.780
 the brewers whatever 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.480
 I always have to go home 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.590
 always 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.560
 suits 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.870
 9 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.750
 the images of the cluster headache already past the 25-year-old andre from arnhem 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.630
 she already receives a reimbursement for the experimental treatments 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.670
 Belgium 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.670
 this cabin is, just like andrÃ©, with health insurer menzis 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.829
 he has a severe headache from cluster headache but gets the 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.489
 treatment still not reimbursed yes I think it's cool rude 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.950
 i think i'm rude i'm so rude 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:23.819
 if you really are 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.219
 it must belong to everyone 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.400
 don't do the only one and just let the other 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.569
 with everything 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.649
 or you simply must not reimburse 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:40.609
 if you have a good time for everyone just a lot of good ones 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.609
 you can make a performance between people 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.339
 I always pay my premium neatly 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.419
 I can never fall behind with my premium 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:54.399
 and if I needed anything 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.399
 for masters they say 9 sorry 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.539
 we don't do that 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:03.559
 this includes treatment at the university medical center in Leiden 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.479
 however, they agree with him 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.169
 I think I all 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:08.379
 that it is not fair 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.540
 to give me a patient a reimbursement and a whole group of others 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.089
 patients who are in the same 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:19.919
 yes the physics positions are and do not and even give the compensation in 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.819
 lead they are still apart from the apparent arbitrariness with the dumbfounded 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.120
 the decision of people to take the experimental treatment for andrea 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.940
 to reimburse in Belgium it is an experimental treatment of which there is still 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.159
 insufficient all know that works 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.699
 NB whether it is safe to lead is a special investigation team to it 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:40.150
 investigate whether the operation, as is already taking place in Belgium, makes sense 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.809
 the fact is that the red ones are immediately implanted to ensure that the 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.679
 pain did not reach the brain 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.219
 but whether it works is also unclear 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.649
 the Leiden scientists would rather have seen people decide to 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:55.090
 no to pay to the dutch research if 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.469
 would do that in the Netherlands 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.469
 then you must 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.289
 an investigation 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:04.439
 and 3 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.580
 you will then receive a judgment 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.650
 afterwards it works or I am not and that already has a lot of influence on a lot 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.130
 other patients yes this is the only reason why we do this naturally in 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.540
 son 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.669
 to help the other patients 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.169
 so that much later it can be easier to say hope for this group 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.069
 patients 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:25.949
 can we prescribe this operation i think that can make money free 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.610
 for experimental treatment in Belgium 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.390
 should also be possible to 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.260
 to be able to free up money for all patients who are based in Amsterdam 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.419
 just as affected 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.340
 who also likes to be at such a moment 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.860
 in a response says people on board for andrea exception has been made 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.900
 and that it is not intended, among other things, to reimburse treatments 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.770
 they do want to look at the situation of kari again, it means for 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.550
 I can say that there is still no end in sight for his hopeless situation 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.550
 Monday just had it day after day 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.560
 it is very difficult to sustain
