00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.880
 LEGO - ELV 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.500
 Elvi has talent 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.480
 Now that we have a full abdomen, what about dancing? 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.840
 Perhaps you're ashamed. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.300
 Watch. 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.600
 Look, your feet are angry with your feet? Or head to your neck? It's ... 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.400
 I thought you might have burned and writhed with pain. 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.520
 Oh yeah. 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.580
 What? Are you saying I looked like I'm writhing? 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.320
 Well ... a little? 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.220
 Step back. I'll show you how to do it. 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.200
 Ladies, will you be so kind? 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.300
 Naido, are you going to show up? 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.700
 I, um ... I think it's important to stay here and be your best viewer. 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.000
 I also have work to supervise the water level of this stream. 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.200
 What? Do you want to have fun too? 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.420
 When I dance, it's not fun at all. It's a total disaster! 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.800
 A few starfish laughed all week. 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 So forget them. It's about having fun. 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.860
 But you will see me. And you are all teased, Emily. 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.420
 Oh, they were just jokes. We are friends, we always like you. 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.000
 Yeah, even if you accidentally fall into the ocean. 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.180
 You can't worry about what you think. Just do what you can. 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.360
 Emilie is right. No dance is bad. Just try, Naido. No one will laugh. 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.100
 Ms. I think we just invented a brand new super cool set, 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.200
 when we combined the best of Emilia's world from Elvandal. 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:46.280
 'Earth controls the air, and the wind feeds the fire. Spells are here when you dare to believe. ' 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.480
 'Go to the sea in the ocean of mystery ...' 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.500
 So what? What was it? You look amazing. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.120
 Well, I have to say ... 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.500
 it was the total rock! 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.600
 You did it, Naido! 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.200
 Well ... especially its background. 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.420
 But you can do it, girl. 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.420
 Good enough.
