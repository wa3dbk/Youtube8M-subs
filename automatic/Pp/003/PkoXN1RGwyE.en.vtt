00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:12.690
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.580
 topic today I then just an hour 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.950
 back all the witches improved on the second 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.960
 level and of course we need them right away 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:24.240
 experience but since as Galimov I'm too lazy 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.080
 was doing i did just standard 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.080
 such a kit for pharma stupid 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.269
 giant took but to them I took just 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.620
 yet our witches which will 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:41.449
 experience well and plus them for help 7 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.219
 Mages of the sixth level from the clan's fortress 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:49.409
 Silka, too, I have been purely for pharma 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:54.059
 This treatment but I think that 9 tx we 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.949
 take but think not so much 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.699
 pumping as if 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.719
 Silke although there were other there may well 2 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.739
 rage 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.890
 two forces somewhere like that but with four forces 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.600
 I don't think that with the witches I pulled him 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.960
 well, and I don't have it right now 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.880
 the queen she is improving so will 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 a little more difficult, but what I found 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.359
 Here is such a base 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.329
 Well pumping as I said, and they 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.880
 max i am here with one tower sorcerer 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.770
 anapa 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.679
 the king and far we will go with the other 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.079
 side queen on pi and clan fortress 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:37.259
 easily lure out 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.630
 try but 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.210
 his empty clan fortress is good 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.880
 Now we need to neutralize traps 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.030
 and here they will be 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.420
 no, therefore, we can throw 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.479
 steel giants 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.659
 so after students that they are among 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.700
 a little territory and then a witch to 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.299
 didn't go somewhere 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.939
 so I have not released on the giant all now 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.439
 our giant and not die but we can safely 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.439
 release the rest 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:19.480
 then of course these came running 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:24.370
 critics but the king is alive and well in principle 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.570
 while you can still not worry so kinema 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.310
 here to all 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:33.250
 stuck together and were healthy here and so but I 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.770
 I think have something interesting, we 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.069
 still left with one health potion but 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:46.720
 it would be very useful to me easily 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:50.140
 furious of course but of which there is none but in 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.880
 principle how giants are still almost all alive 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.470
 but not all but most 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:02.860
 King slightly and probably later 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:04.630
 use yes now I think it 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.230
 can use as much here 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.890
 now skeletons have been blown up but ours 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:16.440
 eight witch quickly return everything to 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.269
 the place is again blown up a bunch of skeletons 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.310
 yes of course with giants witches 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:29.350
 attacking is not an option 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:32.410
 you need to attack with golems only 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.110
 although still a good result 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.410
 It turned out to the same the first time with 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.220
 the tass witches basically attacked but there was 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:46.079
 when I took a couple but nothing 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.380
 good did not work normally but here 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:54.100
 80 percent I think I'll stuff yes if 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.790
 In principle, not the time I can be combat 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:01.320
 and pulled at C grade 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.320
 well, plus if only the queen was still alive 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:11.680
 so i still have 2 44 witches two 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:14.410
 the magician is no longer three witches and a king given 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.590
 if it were not for the time I would be his 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.290
 and still managed 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.980
 although hardly at all 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:28.330
 oh well here are these three witches nothing 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.110
 did in although no I would take it to 3 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.500
 if not for the time 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.390
 well, so I think a good fight 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:41.200
 I turned out the son himself with this did not expect 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:45.670
 Well, on the prey to me, it does not matter to me 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.500
 it was purely necessary to check that 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.660
 of themselves in general are these witches 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.450
