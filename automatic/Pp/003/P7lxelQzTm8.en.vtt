00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.090
 as always before making money 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.379

 security code on your device

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.100
 before beginning the process to make the

 day break connects your device to the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.969
 computer software and down and see the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.879
 official site 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.339
 there are versions for linux mac and windows and the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.189
 procedure is the same in all of them. 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.290
 after downloading open the program and he 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.869
 will identify your device 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.869
 now just click and the break and wait 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.140
 After a few minutes you will have to 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.810
 unlock the display and open the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.909
 and look at the start screen 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.860
 now just wait a little longer 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.229
 device will reboot with cid is 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.630
 installed if something goes wrong in this 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.270
 last step and the device is locked 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.550
 on some screen try restarting by holding 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.280
 the home epal buttons together for 10 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.740
 seconds on the break day of our iphone 5 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.540
 we had to restart twice and 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.270
 apparently it happens to who 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.280
 updated to 6.1 on own 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.130
 device and if you do not know 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.649

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.820
 watch the first unlocked edition 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.820

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.090
 This was one of the most anticipated 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.459
 history of the day break in history in this 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.410
 exact moment are thousands of people 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.690
 trying to download stuff in cydia so 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.519
 It is normal to find mistakes that are calmer than 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.380
