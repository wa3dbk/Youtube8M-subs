00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.289 

here<00:01:07.979> we're<00:01:08.159> trying<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.429> figure<00:01:08.609> out<00:01:08.759> how

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
here we're trying to figure out how

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.230 
here we're trying to figure out how
we're<00:01:09.539> going<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.810> hang<00:01:10.200> our<00:01:10.909> runners<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.179> a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
we're going to hang our runners on a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.080 
we're going to hang our runners on a
single<00:01:13.020> two<00:01:13.170> by<00:01:13.320> six<00:01:13.670> since<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.789> don't<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
single two by six since we don't have a

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.950 
single two by six since we don't have a
platform<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.659> attach<00:01:15.899> them<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.490> in<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:18.689> end<00:01:18.840> we

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
platform to attach them to in the end we

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.770 
platform to attach them to in the end we
use<00:01:19.110> our<00:01:19.319> skewed<00:01:19.710> hangers<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.819> attach<00:01:21.539> them

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
use our skewed hangers and attach them

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.999 
use our skewed hangers and attach them
loosely<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.429> later<00:01:23.990> attach<00:01:24.990> them<00:01:25.259> firmly

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
loosely and we later attach them firmly

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:35.280 
loosely and we later attach them firmly
once<00:01:26.429> we<00:01:26.579> had<00:01:26.789> several<00:01:27.509> stairs<00:01:27.899> attached

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.110 

putting<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.530> couple<00:01:35.710> nails<00:01:36.010> and<00:01:36.310> slots<00:01:36.850> in<00:01:37.030> the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
putting a couple nails and slots in the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.240 
putting a couple nails and slots in the
top<00:01:37.330> of<00:01:37.480> each<00:01:37.600> hanger<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:38.860> they<00:01:39.010> can<00:01:39.160> be

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
top of each hanger so that they can be

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.860 
top of each hanger so that they can be
adjusted<00:01:39.640> up<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.060> down

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.960 

and<00:01:46.870> we're<00:01:47.050> figuring<00:01:47.170> out<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.470> spacing

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and we're figuring out the spacing

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.580 
and we're figuring out the spacing
evenly<00:01:48.970> spacing<00:01:49.210> our<00:01:49.480> stringers<00:01:50.170> there<00:01:50.530> are

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
evenly spacing our stringers there are

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.770 
evenly spacing our stringers there are
less<00:01:50.740> than<00:01:50.890> 16<00:01:51.280> inches<00:01:51.370> on<00:01:51.610> center<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.420> think

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
less than 16 inches on center so I think

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.530 
less than 16 inches on center so I think
we're<00:01:53.050> good

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.650 

discuss<00:02:04.700> figuring<00:02:05.700> out<00:02:05.820> our<00:02:05.970> spacing<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
discuss figuring out our spacing and

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:16.820 
discuss figuring out our spacing and
placement<00:02:07.260> of<00:02:07.410> our<00:02:07.530> treads<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.490> risers

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.090 

here<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.630> put<00:02:18.630> one<00:02:18.840> step<00:02:19.080> on<00:02:19.230> permanently<00:02:19.770> the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
here we put one step on permanently the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.220 
here we put one step on permanently the
other<00:02:20.220> just<00:02:20.520> laying<00:02:20.760> there<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.750> we've<00:02:21.990> put

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
other just laying there and we've put

here<00:03:06.900> we're<00:03:07.050> figuring<00:03:07.170> out<00:03:07.410> our<00:03:07.440> handrails

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
here we're figuring out our handrails

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.370 
here we're figuring out our handrails
this<00:03:08.640> was<00:03:08.880> probably<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.810> most<00:03:09.930> difficult

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
this was probably the most difficult

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.320 
this was probably the most difficult
part<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.770> whole<00:03:10.950> process<00:03:11.240> figuring<00:03:12.240> out

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
part of the whole process figuring out

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.850 
part of the whole process figuring out
the<00:03:12.450> angle<00:03:12.780> laying<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.470> board's<00:03:13.709> down

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
the angle laying the board's down

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.510 
the angle laying the board's down
marking<00:03:14.580> them<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:16.070> then<00:03:17.070> cutting<00:03:17.280> them<00:03:17.490> to

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
marking them and then cutting them to

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.449 
marking them and then cutting them to
the<00:03:17.700> right<00:03:17.850> angle<00:03:19.040> see<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.190> guy<00:03:20.310> in<00:03:20.370> the

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
the right angle see the guy in the

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.530 
the right angle see the guy in the
background<00:03:20.640> he's<00:03:21.510> cooking<00:03:21.930> steak

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.610 

so<00:03:27.540> after<00:03:27.719> we've<00:03:27.810> got<00:03:27.930> our<00:03:28.019> top<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.379> bottom

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
so after we've got our top and bottom

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.530 
so after we've got our top and bottom
rails<00:03:28.769> cut<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.549> length<00:03:29.700> in<00:03:29.969> the<00:03:30.090> right<00:03:30.209> angle

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
rails cut to length in the right angle

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.619 
rails cut to length in the right angle
then<00:03:31.349> we<00:03:31.379> pre-drilled<00:03:32.249> and<00:03:32.489> attached<00:03:33.299> a

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
then we pre-drilled and attached a

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.920 
then we pre-drilled and attached a
balusters<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.739> each<00:03:34.889> post<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:36.540> we<00:03:36.629> made<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.810> to

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
balusters to each post and we made it to

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.229 
balusters to each post and we made it to
the<00:03:37.109> top<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.530> rail<00:03:37.680> with<00:03:38.489> six<00:03:38.730> inches<00:03:38.909> from

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
the top of the rail with six inches from

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:47.250 
the top of the rail with six inches from
the<00:03:39.329> top<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.749> post

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.080 

and<00:03:48.260> here<00:03:48.500> we're<00:03:48.650> figuring<00:03:48.830> out<00:03:49.190> exactly

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
and here we're figuring out exactly

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.910 
and here we're figuring out exactly
where<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:50.660> top<00:03:50.810> of<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.020> rail<00:03:51.200> will<00:03:51.440> be<00:03:51.650> and

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
where the top of the rail will be and

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.949 
where the top of the rail will be and
where<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:52.970> top<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.330> balusters<00:03:53.690> would<00:03:53.810> be

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
where the top of the balusters would be

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.320 
where the top of the balusters would be
the<00:03:54.770> top<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.100> balusters<00:03:55.520> are<00:03:55.670> square<00:03:56.030> so

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
the top of the balusters are square so

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.530 
the top of the balusters are square so
we<00:03:56.450> had<00:03:56.600> to<00:03:57.400> adjust<00:03:58.400> them<00:03:58.610> so<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.330> they<00:03:59.450> would

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
we had to adjust them so that they would

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.210 
we had to adjust them so that they would
match<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.959> top<00:04:00.140> of<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.380> rail

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.320 

finally<00:04:08.220> attaching<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.670> balusters<00:04:09.090> tooth

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
finally attaching the balusters tooth

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.940 
finally attaching the balusters tooth
