00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.899 
inserts in it so best level of
protection<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.009> hips<00:01:38.219> as<00:01:38.490> we

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
protection you can get in the hips as we

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.050 
protection you can get in the hips as we
go<00:01:39.090> down<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.539> kind<00:01:39.719> of<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.319> the<00:01:41.060> nylons

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
go down we kind of see that the nylons

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.669 
go down we kind of see that the nylons
changed<00:01:42.539> a<00:01:42.600> little<00:01:42.869> bit<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.350> going<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.530> be

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
changed a little bit so it's going to be

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.559 
changed a little bit so it's going to be
not<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.979> 800<00:01:44.579> denier<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.389> not

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
not that 800 denier because it's not

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.419 
not that 800 denier because it's not
that<00:01:45.719> high<00:01:45.899> word<00:01:46.109> area<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.889> then<00:01:47.039> you<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
that high word area but then you see it

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.340 
that high word area but then you see it
pop<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:47.700> again<00:01:48.179> in<00:01:48.359> the<00:01:48.450> bottom<00:01:48.840> because<00:01:49.139> this

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
pop up again in the bottom because this

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.260 
pop up again in the bottom because this
is<00:01:49.439> where<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.710> see<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> lot<00:01:50.249> of<00:01:50.310> abrasion

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
is where you see a lot of abrasion

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.080 
is where you see a lot of abrasion
sticks<00:01:52.049> pucks<00:01:52.499> you<00:01:52.770> know<00:01:52.880> rubbing<00:01:53.880> against

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
sticks pucks you know rubbing against

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.940 
sticks pucks you know rubbing against

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
protection this is great construction

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.940 
protection this is great construction
because<00:02:30.300> they<00:02:30.420> use<00:02:30.600> EPP<00:02:31.170> foam<00:02:31.470> as<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.800> could

lower spine protection but even in the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.340 
lower spine protection but even in the
kidney<00:02:44.850> protection<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.570> rear<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:46.230> can

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
kidney protection in the rear you can

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.020 
kidney protection in the rear you can
see<00:02:46.470> I'll<00:02:46.710> have<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:47.070> really<00:02:47.280> nice<00:02:47.520> wrap<00:02:47.850> with

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
that EPP foam again kind of almost

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.190 
that EPP foam again kind of almost
creating<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.550> layering<00:02:50.910> effect<00:02:51.300> here<00:02:51.540> then<00:02:52.110> we

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
creating a layering effect here then we

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.290 
creating a layering effect here then we
have<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.470> pelleted<00:02:52.910> padded<00:02:53.910> belt<00:02:54.120> line

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
have that pelleted padded belt line

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.940 
have that pelleted padded belt line

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
embroidered bow or logos we can see the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.130 
embroidered bow or logos we can see the
suspender<00:02:59.040> loops<00:02:59.340> here<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.540> then<00:03:00.780> as<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:01.020> go

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
suspender loops here and then as we go

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.510 
suspender loops here and then as we go
down<00:03:01.320> we're<00:03:01.440> gonna<00:03:01.530> see<00:03:01.740> that<00:03:01.830> same<00:03:02.100> similar

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
down we're gonna see that same similar

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.250 
down we're gonna see that same similar
construction<00:03:03.120> materials<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.870> we<00:03:03.990> saw<00:03:04.140> on

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
construction materials that we saw on

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.860 
construction materials that we saw on
the<00:03:04.290> front<00:03:04.500> really<00:03:05.400> heavy-duty<00:03:05.880> nylon

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870

materials really nice and breathable and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.030 
materials really nice and breathable and
then<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.660> have<00:03:09.810> some<00:03:09.990> stretch<00:03:10.350> zones<00:03:10.650> here

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
then you have some stretch zones here

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.070 
then you have some stretch zones here
