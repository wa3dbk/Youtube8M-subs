all right look chickpeas are really

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.100 
all right look chickpeas are really
really<00:00:29.760> good<00:00:29.850> for<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.210> there<00:00:30.480> are<00:00:30.630> super<00:00:30.990> high

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
really good for you there are super high

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.590 
really good for you there are super high
in<00:00:31.170> protein<00:00:31.740> fiber<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> low<00:00:33.000> GI<00:00:33.239> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
in protein fiber and a low GI and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.660 
in protein fiber and a low GI and
they're<00:00:33.720> really<00:00:33.960> easy<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.350> cook<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.370> first

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
they're really easy to cook so the first

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.040 
they're really easy to cook so the first
step<00:00:35.970> and<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.270> think<00:00:36.600> probably<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.960> most

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
step and I think probably the most

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
step and I think probably the most
important<00:00:37.530> step<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.980> soak<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.460> water

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
important step is to soak them in water

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.210 
important step is to soak them in water
for<00:00:38.900> at<00:00:39.900> least<00:00:40.110> 12<00:00:40.440> hours<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.100> does

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
for at least 12 hours and what that does

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.220 
for at least 12 hours and what that does
it<00:00:41.489> sort<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.790> activates<00:00:42.390> them<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.989> sort<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
it sort of activates them and it sort of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.360 
it sort of activates them and it sort of
takes<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.590> moisture<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.010> means<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.309> you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
takes in the moisture it means that you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.670 
takes in the moisture it means that you
get<00:00:44.430> nice<00:00:44.640> light<00:00:45.059> fluffy<00:00:45.420> fluffy<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> hope

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
get nice light fluffy fluffy in the hope

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.380 
get nice light fluffy fluffy in the hope
