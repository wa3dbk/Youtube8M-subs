00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 at sport friends I'm simon maier 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.400
 muscle maker in this video is about 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.500
 the difference between the front 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.960
 squat and classic squats 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.519
 where you have the barbell in your neck 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.889
 it's actually from the inside 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.000
 Two pretty similar versions I 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.010
 would not say identical now 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 Exercises but similar exercises where the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.460
 burden is still something different 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.750
 I mean that is not now 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.490
 Explaining that you with the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.470
 of course squats mainly legs 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.420
 trained and trained the butt 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.189
 but it is also about that one 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.769
 personal exercise course, also in total 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.660
 the stability of the hull so the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.120
 core stability core 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.620
 improved stability and of course one 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.510
 she must first form a certain shape 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.489
 until you have them over just such 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.690
 can also improve exercises so I show 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.309
 Just give them a quick look 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.020
 Attitude to the classic squat 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.149
 don't be surprised zarate grad trained 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 now the camera woman on why 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.300
 a thread trade at once this 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.760
 jumps are on it 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.170
 I'll show you the short ones 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.000
 starting situation you are of course in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.100
 the classical attitude as follows 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.719
 and the weight that is actually 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.030
 the only thing to look for now 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.090
 the weight falls in the lot of course 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.010
 following gravitational force in the lot 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.040
 below, of course, is just when I am 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.470
 now start me in the bend 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.630
 go 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.960
 The weight is always the gravity 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.640
 Follow the whole now at the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.439
 there is also a front squat there 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.850
 various options are best for you 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.250
 come from there you see that the best 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.439
 because of the attitude is yes 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.670
 Again, here's how about that 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.400
 I can now because the microphones at 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.280
 That's why I try it 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.689
 Just like that, you see, of course 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.640
 again the weight follows the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.530
 gravitational force and the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.700
 gravitational force pulls the weight so 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.340
 in the lot down in front of me 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.590
 that is the core stability the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.110
 Stability of the upper body is now 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.320
 again in a slightly different way and 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.649
 as claimed the upper body becomes 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.880
 So as far as his stability is concerned 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.259
 demanded differently 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.270
 I'll make you the difference now 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.320
 In a nutshell, of course, you train 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.210
 his legs 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.399
 But you also train your stomach 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.710
 and the lower back so what the core 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.830
 I find stability at the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.020
 classic squat with the long 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.670
 At the neck, I tend to be more stable 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.770
 In the back, of course, is claimed 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.260
 also works with my abdominal muscles 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.480
 but the front squat is really good 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.880
 to train the abdomen around these 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.310
 overall stability in the trunk area so 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.500
 to improve this choir stability as well 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.450
 just as abdominal exercises are the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.520
 actually one of the front squats 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.320
 hottest exercises because you just about one 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.720
 Composite exercise creates the abdomen 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.650
 I can only integrate extremely well with 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.720
 recommend to everyone 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.920
 you will not notice how intense 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.450
 her stomach may be exercising on 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.490
 next day or the day after next 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.350
 while you just notice the front 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.730
 Squats are such an exercise 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.440
 just got out of fashion 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.510
 actually a pity a super exercise 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.040
 Just try it as I said 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.430
 vary slightly for heavy knees 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.470
 bend 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.880
 best the whole in the neck and if 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.350
 it will all be a little easier 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.060
 Maybe it should be at the end of the training 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.410
 Just the front squats again 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.600
 I can recommend it to anyone 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.220
 for the belly or the wampe we see 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.450
 In the next video , it makes a lot of good 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.450
 greet your room
