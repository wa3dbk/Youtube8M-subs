underneath<00:04:41.100> here<00:04:41.430> on<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.700> throttle<00:04:42.630> body

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
underneath here on the throttle body

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.430 
underneath here on the throttle body
clamp<00:04:43.800> on<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.100> airbox<00:04:44.660> you<00:04:45.660> got<00:04:45.810> this<00:04:46.020> fresh

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
clamp on the airbox you got this fresh

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.460 
clamp on the airbox you got this fresh
air<00:04:46.680> hose<00:04:47.280> right<00:04:48.120> here<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.780> you<00:04:49.020> can<00:04:49.140> remove

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
air hose right here and you can remove

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:57.710

this<00:04:49.650> unit<00:04:51.650> this<00:04:52.650> is<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:54.740> 2004<00:04:56.120> Saturn<00:04:57.120> Ion<00:04:57.300> and

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
this unit this is a 2004 Saturn Ion and

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.200 
this unit this is a 2004 Saturn Ion and
you<00:04:58.470> can<00:04:58.620> see<00:04:58.770> that<00:04:58.920> the<00:04:59.010> TPS<00:04:59.520> is<00:04:59.760> a<00:04:59.790> little<00:05:00.120> bit

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
you can see that the TPS is a little bit

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.930 
you can see that the TPS is a little bit
different<00:05:00.630> on<00:05:00.690> this<00:05:00.840> 2.2<00:05:01.650> so<00:05:02.430> we'll<00:05:02.700> remove

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
different on this 2.2 so we'll remove

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.510 
different on this 2.2 so we'll remove
the<00:05:04.040> electrical<00:05:05.040> connector<00:05:05.520> like<00:05:05.730> that<00:05:06.060> and

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
the electrical connector like that and

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.900 
the electrical connector like that and
once<00:05:08.520> we<00:05:08.730> do<00:05:08.910> that<00:05:08.940> we<00:05:09.720> can<00:05:09.930> see<00:05:10.410> that<00:05:10.670> there<00:05:11.670> is

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
once we do that we can see that there is

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:34.600 
once we do that we can see that there is
a<00:05:13.190> t20<00:05:16.160> screw<00:05:17.160> underneath<00:05:17.730> there

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:43.340 

there's<00:05:35.610> a<00:05:35.940> screw

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.640 

and<00:05:43.920> there's<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.960> TPS<00:05:45.960> I<00:05:48.020> like<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.170> idea<00:05:49.590> of

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
and there's the TPS I like the idea of

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.960 
and there's the TPS I like the idea of
only<00:05:50.340> having<00:05:50.700> one<00:05:51.080> mounting<00:05:52.080> screw<00:05:52.730> why<00:05:53.730> not

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
only having one mounting screw why not

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.390 
only having one mounting screw why not
right<00:05:55.250> see<00:05:56.250> how<00:05:56.430> they<00:05:56.580> use<00:05:56.760> the<00:05:56.970> screw<00:05:57.360> as<00:05:57.600> a

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
right see how they use the screw as a

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.989 
right see how they use the screw as a
locator

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:04.999 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:16.350 

so<00:06:05.809> you<00:06:05.869> want<00:06:06.139> to<00:06:06.319> put<00:06:06.979> your<00:06:07.099> new<00:06:07.219> one<00:06:07.369> on<00:06:09.129> just

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:26.810 

line<00:06:17.199> it<00:06:17.409> up<00:06:17.500> just<00:06:20.430> like<00:06:21.430> that

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:33.700 

put<00:06:27.360> the<00:06:27.510> screwing

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.320 

tighten<00:06:34.370> it<00:06:34.400> up<00:06:34.490> put<00:06:34.669> your<00:06:34.790> connector<00:06:35.180> on

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
tighten it up put your connector on

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.760 
tighten it up put your connector on
that's<00:06:35.540> it<00:06:36.280> all<00:06:37.280> done<00:06:38.290> so<00:06:39.290> that's<00:06:39.470> all<00:06:39.680> there

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
that's it all done so that's all there

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.230 
that's it all done so that's all there
is<00:06:39.860> to<00:06:39.979> replacing<00:06:40.310> a<00:06:40.729> throttle<00:06:41.120> position

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
is to replacing a throttle position

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.800 
is to replacing a throttle position
