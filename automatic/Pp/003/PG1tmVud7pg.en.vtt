can just take it out and then the corner

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.029 
can just take it out and then the corner
is<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:47.149> come<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.590> line

this back up and then you're kind of
like<00:00:52.050> loose<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> line<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.699> layer<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.180> this

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
like loose the line this layer like this

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.490 
like loose the line this layer like this
now<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.829> pretty<00:00:56.370> much<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:57.289> turn<00:00:58.289> the

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.220 
that in like that then you'll find the
piece<00:02:31.739> that<00:02:31.920> goes<00:02:32.040> between<00:02:32.250> these<00:02:32.549> two<00:02:33.230> my

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
piece that goes between these two my

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.270 
piece that goes between these two my
case<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:36.170> orange<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.410> blue<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:41.099> you'll

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
case is orange and blue and so you'll

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.699 
case is orange and blue and so you'll
keep<00:02:41.430> doing<00:02:41.489> this<00:02:41.910> until<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:43.200> have<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.530> first

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
keep doing this until you have the first

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.789 
keep doing this until you have the first
two<00:02:43.860> layers<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:45.120> by<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.959> way<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.620> reason

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
two layers and by the way the reason

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.500 
two layers and by the way the reason
that<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.370> am<00:02:47.640> NOT<00:02:47.879> putting<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.329> together

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
that I am NOT putting this together

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.789 
that I am NOT putting this together
scrambled<00:02:49.379> is<00:02:50.780> because<00:02:51.780> then<00:02:52.170> you'll<00:02:52.650> get

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
scrambled is because then you'll get

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.270 
scrambled is because then you'll get
some<00:02:53.160> weird<00:02:53.670> cases<00:02:54.060> which<00:02:55.160> will<00:02:56.160> be

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
some weird cases which will be

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.039 
some weird cases which will be
unsolvable<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.389> won't<00:02:57.540> be<00:02:57.630> able<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.840> solve

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
unsolvable so you won't be able to solve

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.490 
unsolvable so you won't be able to solve
it<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.639> so<00:02:59.639> because<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.750> cube<00:03:01.019> is<00:03:01.139> so<00:03:01.260> small

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
it and so because this cube is so small

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.289 
it and so because this cube is so small
it's<00:03:01.889> pretty<00:03:02.130> easy<00:03:02.310> just<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:03.680> put<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.769> together

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
it's pretty easy just to put it together

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:12.740 
it's pretty easy just to put it together
solve<00:03:06.299> this<00:03:08.000> okay<00:03:09.349> so<00:03:10.349> just<00:03:11.000> put<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.329> these

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
solve this okay so just put in these

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:21.890 
solve this okay so just put in these
last<00:03:13.220> pieces<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:18.410> then<00:03:20.510> once<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.720> have

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
last pieces in and then once you have

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.089 
last pieces in and then once you have
the<00:03:22.620> first<00:03:22.859> two<00:03:23.430> layers<00:03:23.730> done<00:03:25.130> cube<00:03:27.049> look<00:03:28.099> like

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
the first two layers done cube look like

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.589 
the first two layers done cube look like
this<00:03:29.280> with<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.700> exception<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.180> this<00:03:30.359> piece

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
this with the exception of this piece

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.940 
this with the exception of this piece
that<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:30.930> cannot<00:03:31.169> find<00:03:33.019> okay<00:03:34.019> actually<00:03:34.290> figured

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
that I cannot find okay actually figured

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.300 
that I cannot find okay actually figured
out<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.370> put<00:03:36.060> this<00:03:36.180> Chi<00:03:36.389> thing<00:03:36.540> wrong

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
out I put this Chi thing wrong

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.770 
out I put this Chi thing wrong
so<00:03:38.310> yeah<00:03:38.519> be<00:03:39.450> sure<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:40.380> look<00:03:40.470> out<00:03:40.680> for<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:40.919> and

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
so yeah be sure to look out for that and

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.920 
so yeah be sure to look out for that and
so<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.840> have<00:03:43.230> first<00:03:43.889> few<00:03:44.130> layers<00:03:44.220> soft<00:03:44.609> or<00:03:45.120> put

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
so you have first few layers soft or put

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.930 
so you have first few layers soft or put
together<00:03:46.079> and<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:47.310> just<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.669> when<00:03:47.819> you're

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
together and so just like when you're

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.909 
together and so just like when you're
taking<00:03:48.299> apart<00:03:48.540> you're<00:03:48.989> gonna<00:03:49.079> rotate<00:03:49.620> that

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
taking apart you're gonna rotate that

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.930 
taking apart you're gonna rotate that
layer<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.190> little<00:03:50.459> bit<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:51.859> then<00:03:52.859> let's<00:03:53.700> just

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
layer a little bit and then let's just

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.940 
layer a little bit and then let's just
do<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.269> back<00:03:54.450> one<00:03:54.480> just<00:03:54.959> make<00:03:55.139> it<00:03:55.260> easiest<00:03:55.590> so

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
do the back one just make it easiest so

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.740 
do the back one just make it easiest so
it<00:03:56.040> would<00:03:56.129> do<00:03:56.280> blue<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.819> yellow

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
it would do blue and yellow

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.540 
it would do blue and yellow
find<00:03:58.990> the<00:03:59.230> blue<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.560> yellow<00:03:59.650> piece<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.310> just

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
find the blue and yellow piece and just

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.430 
find the blue and yellow piece and just
slide<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.690> in<00:04:01.750> like<00:04:01.780> that

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
slide it in like that

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.340 
slide it in like that
and<00:04:02.670> then<00:04:03.670> slide<00:04:04.360> that<00:04:04.510> back<00:04:04.720> in<00:04:04.900> find<00:04:05.230> the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
and then slide that back in find the

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.790 
and then slide that back in find the
pieces<00:04:05.560> I'll<00:04:05.740> go<00:04:05.950> there<00:04:07.230> okay<00:04:08.230> so<00:04:08.290> it'd<00:04:08.620> be

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
pieces I'll go there okay so it'd be

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.770 
pieces I'll go there okay so it'd be
this<00:04:09.070> piece<00:04:10.350> put<00:04:11.350> that<00:04:11.560> in<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:13.300> this<00:04:13.480> piece

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
this piece put that in and this piece

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.479 
this piece put that in and this piece
you'll<00:04:14.320> just<00:04:15.090> slide<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.239> layer<00:04:16.450> around<00:04:17.489> and

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
you'll just slide that layer around and

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.260 
you'll just slide that layer around and
put<00:04:19.060> that<00:04:19.750> in<00:04:21.210> and<00:04:22.210> then<00:04:22.480> keep<00:04:22.840> doing<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:24.270> and

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
put that in and then keep doing that and

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.880 
put that in and then keep doing that and
you<00:04:25.810> will<00:04:26.110> have<00:04:26.220> all<00:04:27.220> but<00:04:27.970> these<00:04:28.330> three<00:04:28.600> pieces

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
you will have all but these three pieces

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.080 
you will have all but these three pieces
and<00:04:29.890> so<00:04:30.250> you<00:04:30.340> could<00:04:30.460> imagine<00:04:30.550> with<00:04:30.910> the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
and so you could imagine with the

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.270 
and so you could imagine with the
corners<00:04:31.480> you<00:04:31.810> just<00:04:32.970> put<00:04:33.970> these<00:04:34.150> in<00:04:34.480> and<00:04:34.780> then

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
corners you just put these in and then

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.090 
corners you just put these in and then
rotate<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.370> top<00:04:36.520> layer<00:04:36.730> 45<00:04:37.180> degrees<00:04:37.510> again

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
rotate the top layer 45 degrees again

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.630 
rotate the top layer 45 degrees again
and<00:04:39.100> then<00:04:39.280> just<00:04:40.230> like<00:04:41.230> hook<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:41.620> in<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.370> it's<00:04:42.520> at

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
and then just like hook it in so it's at

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.290 
and then just like hook it in so it's at
the<00:04:42.730> top<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.870> then<00:04:43.990> just<00:04:44.020> push<00:04:45.010> down<00:04:45.310> in<00:04:46.150> it

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
the top and then just push down in it

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.530 
the top and then just push down in it
and<00:04:47.200> it<00:04:47.620> will<00:04:47.860> go<00:04:48.310> into<00:04:48.460> place<00:04:48.700> sometimes<00:04:49.419> I

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
and it will go into place sometimes I

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.350 
and it will go into place sometimes I
don't<00:04:49.600> think<00:04:49.690> a<00:04:49.840> bit<00:04:49.990> more<00:04:50.020> force<00:04:50.410> if<00:04:50.950> it's<00:04:51.190> a

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
don't think a bit more force if it's a

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.659 
don't think a bit more force if it's a
stiff<00:04:52.360> cube<00:04:52.800> but<00:04:53.800> then<00:04:54.190> you<00:04:54.460> have<00:04:55.980> took<00:04:56.980> apart

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
stiff cube but then you have took apart

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.650 
stiff cube but then you have took apart
any<00:04:57.910> assembled<00:04:58.570> your<00:04:58.780> rivets<00:04:59.350> cube<00:04:59.560> and<00:05:00.660> just

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
any assembled your rivets cube and just

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.920 
any assembled your rivets cube and just
are<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.140> reminder<00:05:02.590> again<00:05:03.210> this<00:05:04.210> is<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.720> same

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
are the reminder again this is the same

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.310 
are the reminder again this is the same
basically<00:05:05.590> on<00:05:05.740> every<00:05:06.070> good<00:05:06.780> it's<00:05:07.780> just<00:05:08.050> some

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
basically on every good it's just some

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.020 
basically on every good it's just some
cubes<00:05:08.740> they'll<00:05:09.010> be<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.190> bit<00:05:09.400> easier<00:05:09.580> or<00:05:10.000> harder

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
cubes they'll be a bit easier or harder

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.010 
cubes they'll be a bit easier or harder
to<00:05:10.680> put<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.770> pieces<00:05:11.979> in<00:05:12.630> but<00:05:13.630> for<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.870> most
