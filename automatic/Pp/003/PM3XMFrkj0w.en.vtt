all<00:00:00.420> right<00:00:00.810> now<00:00:01.050> we're<00:00:01.319> ready<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.860> do<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.159> video

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
all right now we're ready to do a video

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.940 
all right now we're ready to do a video
on<00:00:03.830> changing<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.950> spark<00:00:05.220> plugs<00:00:05.609> on<00:00:05.850> your<00:00:06.000> car

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
on changing the spark plugs on your car

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:15.259 
on changing the spark plugs on your car
for<00:00:08.780> a<00:00:10.160> 2007<00:00:11.160> Honda<00:00:11.670> CRV<00:00:13.549> the<00:00:14.549> process<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.089> very

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
for a 2007 Honda CRV the process is very

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.830 
for a 2007 Honda CRV the process is very
simple<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:16.730> gotta<00:00:17.730> do<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.000> remove<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.600> cover

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
simple I gotta do is remove the cover

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.980 
simple I gotta do is remove the cover
which<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.380> already<00:00:19.980> did<00:00:20.250> where<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.210> exposes<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
which I already did where it exposes the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.929 
which I already did where it exposes the
spark<00:00:22.350> plug<00:00:22.740> cables<00:00:23.340> or<00:00:24.269> harness<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.939> there's

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
spark plug cables or harness and there's

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.870 
spark plug cables or harness and there's
a<00:00:27.029> clip<00:00:27.390> right<00:00:27.689> here<00:00:28.279> you<00:00:29.279> might<00:00:29.550> want<00:00:29.789> to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
a clip right here you might want to

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.590 
a clip right here you might want to
disconnect<00:00:30.769> before<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:32.070> lift<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.600> spark

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
disconnect before you lift this spark

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:43.000 
disconnect before you lift this spark
plug<00:00:33.870> boot<00:00:34.110> off<00:00:35.480> which<00:00:36.480> I've<00:00:36.630> already<00:00:36.840> done

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.029 

okay<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.879> recommend<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.690> gap<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
okay I recommend a gap for this for the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.319 
okay I recommend a gap for this for the
Honda<00:00:47.489> CRV<00:00:47.899> according<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:50.149> manual<00:00:51.149> I

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
Honda CRV according to the manual I

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.740 
Honda CRV according to the manual I
guess<00:00:51.600> there<00:00:51.930> should<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.039> one<00:00:53.340> point<00:00:53.670> zero<00:00:54.300> to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
guess there should be one point zero to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.970 
guess there should be one point zero to
one<00:00:55.050> point<00:00:55.440> two<00:00:56.149> millimeters<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.410> believe<00:00:58.410> in

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
one point two millimeters I believe in

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.110 
one point two millimeters I believe in
the<00:00:59.250> standard<00:01:00.079> version<00:01:01.550> it's<00:01:02.550> probably<00:01:02.969> gonna

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the standard version it's probably gonna

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:17.630 
the standard version it's probably gonna
be<00:01:09.110> 4.0<00:01:10.310> or<00:01:11.310> 4.3<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:15.770> success<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.009> little<00:01:17.400> too

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
be 4.0 or 4.3 and success is little too

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.260 
be 4.0 or 4.3 and success is little too
close<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:19.670> you're<00:01:20.670> gonna<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.119> open<00:01:21.479> it

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
close so you're gonna have to open it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.120 
close so you're gonna have to open it
the<00:01:24.270> process<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.960> opening<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.590> thing<00:01:25.950> I

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the process of opening this thing I

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.770 
the process of opening this thing I
would<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.549> not<00:01:26.700> recommend<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:29.509> do<00:01:30.509> this

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
would I do not recommend to do this

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.499 
would I do not recommend to do this
otherwise<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.439> could<00:01:31.740> damage<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.509> probe

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
otherwise you could damage the probe

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.940 
otherwise you could damage the probe
right<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.509> will<00:01:36.780> use<00:01:37.020> some<00:01:37.590> sort<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
right here so we will use some sort of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.360 
right here so we will use some sort of
other<00:01:38.189> method

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
other method

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.870 
other method
correction<00:01:41.370> I'm<00:01:41.550> gone<00:01:42.800> that<00:01:43.800> spark<00:01:44.190> plug<00:01:44.460> gap

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
correction I'm gone that spark plug gap

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.310 
correction I'm gone that spark plug gap
it's<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.860> 1.0<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.130> 1.1<00:01:48.120> millimeters<00:01:49.760> that

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
it's a 1.0 to 1.1 millimeters that

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.010 
it's a 1.0 to 1.1 millimeters that
interprets<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.740> roughly<00:01:53.400> about<00:01:53.550> four<00:01:54.479> point

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
interprets to roughly about four point

Standard<00:02:00.300> Version<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:02.210> this<00:02:03.210> obviously<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.810> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
Standard Version and this obviously is a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.260 
Standard Version and this obviously is a
little<00:02:04.320> too<00:02:04.500> closed<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.729> I'm<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> open

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
little too closed so I'm going to open

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.699 
little too closed so I'm going to open
it<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.690> little<00:02:08.030> not<00:02:09.030> much<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:12.050> then<00:02:13.050> we'll<00:02:13.380> try

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
it a little not much and then we'll try

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:27.080 
it a little not much and then we'll try
it<00:02:13.739> again

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.650 

okay<00:02:28.020> here<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.560> are<00:02:28.670> right<00:02:29.670> around

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.120 

4.60<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.750> little<00:02:34.260> too<00:02:34.410> high

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
4.60 a little too high

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:50.910 
4.60 a little too high
I<00:02:35.540> want<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.660> DAP<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.380> little<00:02:37.849> close<00:02:38.849> it

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.380 

it's<00:02:51.460> about<00:02:51.730> right<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.950> we'll<00:02:54.130> go<00:02:54.280> by<00:02:54.490> that<00:02:54.760> and

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
it's about right so we'll go by that and

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.140 
it's about right so we'll go by that and
the<00:02:55.690> process<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.770> same<00:02:56.800> on<00:02:57.280> all<00:02:57.490> spark

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
the process is the same on all spark

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.490 
the process is the same on all spark
plugs<00:02:58.569> a<00:02:59.490> little<00:03:00.490> trick<00:03:00.819> you<00:03:01.090> don't<00:03:01.870> happen<00:03:02.470> to

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
plugs a little trick you don't happen to

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.550 
plugs a little trick you don't happen to
have<00:03:02.680> those<00:03:03.190> an<00:03:03.520> extension<00:03:04.360> or<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.600> rubber<00:03:05.200> or

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
some kind of a gadget I made up this

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.630 
some kind of a gadget I made up this
little<00:03:09.280> rubber<00:03:09.630> thing<00:03:10.630> boot<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:12.160> slip<00:03:12.459> over

little rubber thing boot to slip over
the<00:03:12.940> tip<00:03:13.780> of<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.080> spark<00:03:14.560> plug<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:18.300> just

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
the tip of the spark plug and just

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.900 
the tip of the spark plug and just
carefully<00:03:19.570> drop<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.350> in<00:03:20.530> there<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.760> don't

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
carefully drop it in there you don't

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.310 
carefully drop it in there you don't
want<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.150> force<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.600> in<00:03:25.780> there<00:03:25.959> if<00:03:26.050> it's<00:03:26.170> not

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
want to force it in there if it's not

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.690 
want to force it in there if it's not
going<00:03:26.680> in<00:03:26.860> there<00:03:27.730> pretty<00:03:28.510> easy<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:30.100> don't

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
going in there pretty easy you don't

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.810 
going in there pretty easy you don't
want<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.030> force<00:03:31.269> it<00:03:31.450> in<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:31.959> try<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.730> put<00:03:33.730> it

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
want to force it in and try and put it

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.240 
want to force it in and try and put it
back<00:03:33.970> on<00:03:34.239> there<00:03:34.540> otherwise<00:03:34.980> you'll<00:03:35.980> probably

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
back on there otherwise you'll probably

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.670 
back on there otherwise you'll probably
strip<00:03:36.760> threats<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.720> don't<00:03:38.290> want<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.470> do

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
strip threats and you don't want to do

for risking a breaking the tip off it so
I<00:04:52.180> will<00:04:53.180> show<00:04:53.420> you<00:04:53.480> all<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.780> spark<00:04:54.290> plugs<00:04:54.650> that

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
I will show you all the spark plugs that

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.880 
I will show you all the spark plugs that
I<00:04:55.220> have<00:04:55.550> removed<00:04:56.230> just<00:04:57.230> so<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:57.920> can<00:04:58.960> see<00:04:59.960> more

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
I have removed just so you can see more

or less what goes on with your car if

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.350 
or less what goes on with your car if
anything<00:05:05.980> and<00:05:06.980> determine<00:05:07.760> what<00:05:07.910> you<00:05:08.060> need<00:05:08.210> to

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
anything and determine what you need to

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:16.360 
anything and determine what you need to
do<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:13.460> here<00:05:13.700> we<00:05:13.850> are<00:05:13.990> let's<00:05:14.990> power<00:05:15.470> plug<00:05:15.770> to<00:05:15.800> be

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
do so here we are let's power plug to be

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.210 
do so here we are let's power plug to be
removed<00:05:16.870> as<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:18.110> can<00:05:18.290> see<00:05:18.530> it<00:05:18.740> looks<00:05:18.890> fairly

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
removed as you can see it looks fairly

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.200 
removed as you can see it looks fairly
good<00:05:19.370> as<00:05:20.090> it<00:05:20.390> does<00:05:20.840> not<00:05:21.110> look<00:05:21.350> like<00:05:21.410> any<00:05:22.210> burned

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
good as it does not look like any burned

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.240 
good as it does not look like any burned
out<00:05:23.510> or<00:05:23.780> anything<00:05:24.020> you<00:05:24.380> would<00:05:24.500> see<00:05:24.740> more<00:05:25.010> off

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
out or anything you would see more off

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.060 
out or anything you would see more off
real<00:05:25.760> good<00:05:26.060> actually<00:05:26.330> and<00:05:26.870> this<00:05:27.530> is<00:05:27.710> how<00:05:27.860> most

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
real good actually and this is how most

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.340 
real good actually and this is how most
of<00:05:28.340> them<00:05:28.460> look<00:05:28.790> thing<00:05:29.330> you<00:05:29.479> look<00:05:29.780> for<00:05:29.840> is

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
of them look thing you look for is

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.790 
of them look thing you look for is
deterioration<00:05:31.160> of<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.669> probes<00:05:32.060> and<00:05:32.500> this<00:05:33.500> is

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
deterioration of the probes and this is

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.540 
deterioration of the probes and this is
some<00:05:34.310> rest<00:05:34.640> or<00:05:34.850> water<00:05:35.150> or<00:05:36.340> contaminants<00:05:37.340> of

some rest or water or contaminants of

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.969 
some rest or water or contaminants of
any<00:05:37.700> sort<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.300> mean<00:05:39.080> you<00:05:39.200> got<00:05:39.380> trouble

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
any sort I mean you got trouble

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.190 
any sort I mean you got trouble
but<00:05:40.160> this<00:05:40.400> one<00:05:40.610> looks<00:05:40.640> good<00:05:41.180> they<00:05:41.720> all<00:05:41.900> look

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
but this one looks good they all look

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.110 
but this one looks good they all look
good<00:05:42.440> they<00:05:42.620> all<00:05:42.800> look<00:05:43.040> basically<00:05:43.280> the<00:05:43.700> same<00:05:43.970> I

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
good they all look basically the same I

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:53.360 
good they all look basically the same I
show<00:05:44.390> you<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:44.690> rest<00:05:44.930> of<00:05:45.140> them

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.950 

as<00:05:54.370> you<00:05:54.700> can<00:05:54.880> see<00:05:55.090> they're<00:05:55.300> all<00:05:55.450> burning

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
as you can see they're all burning

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.730 
as you can see they're all burning
running<00:05:56.620> up<00:05:56.830> pretty<00:05:57.520> evenly<00:05:57.970> and<00:05:58.180> pretty<00:05:58.420> good

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
running up pretty evenly and pretty good

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.020 
running up pretty evenly and pretty good
the<00:05:59.740> strobes<00:06:00.160> everything<00:06:00.790> looks<00:06:01.270> good<00:06:02.970> how<00:06:03.970> to

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
the strobes everything looks good how to

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.600 
the strobes everything looks good how to
mix<00:06:04.360> good<00:06:04.720> cars<00:06:05.080> they<00:06:05.470> just<00:06:05.980> take<00:06:06.190> care<00:06:06.490> of

installing the last spark plug it should
be<00:06:34.150> good<00:06:34.420> right<00:06:34.780> about<00:06:35.080> now

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.670 

long<00:06:40.910> sparkplug<00:06:41.750> to<00:06:42.110> make<00:06:43.100> it<00:06:43.280> easy<00:06:43.490> to

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
long sparkplug to make it easy to

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.930 
long sparkplug to make it easy to
tighten<00:06:45.680> it<00:06:45.770> up<00:06:45.800> you<00:06:46.190> don't<00:06:46.400> want<00:06:46.610> to<00:06:46.730> over

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
tighten it up you don't want to over

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.000 
tighten it up you don't want to over
tighten<00:06:47.090> again<00:06:47.930> I<00:06:48.200> don't<00:06:49.390> mean<00:06:50.390> to<00:06:51.380> emphasize

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010

tighten again I don't mean to emphasize
so<00:06:52.250> much<00:06:52.430> but<00:06:52.670> you<00:06:53.180> don't<00:06:53.450> want<00:06:53.660> our<00:06:53.750> overtime

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
so much but you don't want our overtime

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
you over time you could break the spark

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.490 
you over time you could break the spark
light<00:06:58.790> off<00:06:59.030> and<00:06:59.830> then<00:07:00.830> you<00:07:01.040> got<00:07:01.190> problems<00:07:02.500> so

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 
you're good to go your spark plugs have

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.620 
you're good to go your spark plugs have
been<00:07:42.050> changed
