00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370 

I<00:00:01.850> decided<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:03.030> get<00:00:03.149> my<00:00:03.270> pilot's<00:00:03.510> license<00:00:04.170> just

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
I decided to get my pilot's license just

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.570 
I decided to get my pilot's license just
because<00:00:04.620> it's<00:00:04.799> something<00:00:04.920> I've<00:00:05.190> always<00:00:05.370> been

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
because it's something I've always been

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.820 
because it's something I've always been
interested<00:00:05.819> in<00:00:06.210> probably<00:00:07.140> since<00:00:07.379> ten<00:00:07.799> years

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
interested in probably since ten years

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.759 
interested in probably since ten years
old<00:00:08.220> always<00:00:08.910> been<00:00:09.090> interested<00:00:09.630> in<00:00:09.769> planes

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
old always been interested in planes

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.890 
old always been interested in planes
flying<00:00:11.219> over<00:00:11.519> my<00:00:11.550> head<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.179> how<00:00:12.420> they<00:00:12.630> work

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
flying over my head and how they work

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.709 
flying over my head and how they work
and<00:00:13.230> what<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.559> must<00:00:13.799> be<00:00:14.009> like<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.509> go<00:00:15.509> through

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
and what it must be like to go through

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.230 
and what it must be like to go through
the<00:00:15.839> air<00:00:15.990> like<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.400> so<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.699> next<00:00:17.910> logical

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
the air like that so the next logical

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.920 
the air like that so the next logical
step<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.529> do<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:20.730> real<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.119> get<00:00:21.779> that

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
step was to do it for real and get that

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.460 
step was to do it for real and get that
experience<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.560> what<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.830> really<00:00:22.980> like

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.400 

what<00:00:27.039> I<00:00:27.070> love<00:00:28.029> about<00:00:28.060> flying<00:00:28.630> I<00:00:28.869> guess<00:00:29.050> is<00:00:29.230> that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
what I love about flying I guess is that

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.119 
what I love about flying I guess is that
just<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:29.859> freedom<00:00:30.130> and<00:00:30.429> the<00:00:30.939> adventure<00:00:31.390> of<00:00:31.419> it

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
just the freedom and the adventure of it

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.680 
just the freedom and the adventure of it
it's<00:00:33.129> an<00:00:33.250> escape<00:00:33.489> from<00:00:34.000> reality<00:00:35.970> my<00:00:36.970> target

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
it's an escape from reality my target

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.710 
it's an escape from reality my target
for<00:00:37.720> in<00:00:37.989> flight<00:00:38.290> is<00:00:38.590> to<00:00:38.980> just<00:00:39.160> spread<00:00:39.720> aviation

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
for in flight is to just spread aviation

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.200 
for in flight is to just spread aviation
to<00:00:41.079> the<00:00:41.290> masses<00:00:41.800> you<00:00:42.070> never<00:00:42.340> see<00:00:42.699> anything

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
to the masses you never see anything

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.990 
to the masses you never see anything
about<00:00:43.809> how<00:00:44.140> simple<00:00:44.800> it<00:00:44.890> actually<00:00:45.250> is<00:00:45.460> to<00:00:45.820> get<00:00:45.970> a

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
about how simple it actually is to get a

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.610 
about how simple it actually is to get a
viable<00:00:46.300> sentence<00:00:46.900> of<00:00:47.050> use<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.409> to<00:00:47.559> your

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
viable sentence of use it to your

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.890 
viable sentence of use it to your
advantage<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:48.670> goal<00:00:48.850> is<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.180> spread<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.720> word

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
advantage the goal is to spread the word

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.930 
advantage the goal is to spread the word
so<00:00:50.260> that<00:00:50.440> people<00:00:50.920> are<00:00:51.010> aware<00:00:51.040> that<00:00:51.309> hey<00:00:51.730> this

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
so that people are aware that hey this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
enjoy will teach in aviation is just

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.570 
enjoy will teach in aviation is just
sharing<00:01:10.780> that<00:01:10.990> passion<00:01:11.229> with<00:01:11.560> others<00:01:11.890> not

method<00:01:20.259> of<00:01:20.439> learning<00:01:21.040> how<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.159> fly

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
method of learning how to fly

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.789 
method of learning how to fly
is<00:01:21.729> tailored<00:01:22.420> on<00:01:22.540> how<00:01:22.840> they're<00:01:23.110> learning<00:01:23.320> and

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
is tailored on how they're learning and

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.530 
is tailored on how they're learning and
the<00:01:23.950> best<00:01:24.130> way<00:01:24.280> that<00:01:24.400> they<00:01:24.549> can<00:01:24.759> learn<00:01:24.790> that's

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
the best way that they can learn that's

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.969 
the best way that they can learn that's
what's<00:01:25.720> different<00:01:25.930> about<00:01:26.170> us<00:01:26.530> is<00:01:26.680> we<00:01:26.799> don't

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
what's different about us is we don't

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.249 
what's different about us is we don't
have<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.340> have<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.930> systematic<00:01:28.930> approach<00:01:29.049> to

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
have to have a systematic approach to

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.899 
have to have a systematic approach to
getting<00:01:29.710> this<00:01:29.799> training<00:01:29.979> done<00:01:30.310> I<00:01:30.610> think

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
getting this training done I think

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.000 
getting this training done I think
there's<00:01:31.330> a<00:01:31.390> nice<00:01:31.630> mix<00:01:31.659> of<00:01:32.170> instructors<00:01:32.710> of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
there's a nice mix of instructors of

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.920 
there's a nice mix of instructors of
different<00:01:33.460> age<00:01:33.580> groups<00:01:33.909> I<00:01:34.180> have<00:01:34.480> flown<00:01:34.690> with

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
different age groups I have flown with

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.899 
different age groups I have flown with
quite<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.170> few<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.620> them<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:35.950> have<00:01:36.040> had<00:01:36.250> very

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
quite a few of them and have had very

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.730 
there's good people behind it what makes
in<00:01:48.880> flight<00:01:49.090> unique<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.659> that<00:01:49.690> culture<00:01:50.590> that

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
in flight unique is that culture that
