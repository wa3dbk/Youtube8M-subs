00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.250
 if it is the affirmation of the human being is a 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.680
 political statement in this regard. 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.480
 see politician here does not identify with 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.930
 the stamp as the concept of common sense 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.190
 political party politics of us 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.010
 against others but we're talking 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.920
 policy in the sense of coexistence between 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.109
 subject to this coexistence between 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.360
 subject can be in a way 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.640
 authoritarian authoritarianism and she 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.920
 can be in a democratic way that the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.690
 democracy to democracy is very 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.000
 more than simply having elections 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.210
 much more than just grandfather's voice 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.050
 of the people is all this but she in essence 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.510
 principle as the basis for 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.670
 democracy involves the coexistence between 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.850
 the subjects who affirm themselves as such 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.250
 Maybe this base already allows us to 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.500
 to examine rigorously everything that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.810
 concerns the functioning of bodies 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.680
 collecting of collective instances 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.600
 because education is only done if it is 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.030
 democratic 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.400
 if the child only arrests if you want 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.990
 there is first thing you have to do is 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.159
 provide conditions for her to want to 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.299
 no good can not afford to 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.740
 she wants is an action of logic 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.479
 Democrat so risky 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.970
 You're not sure she'll want to. 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.990
 You have to take the risk of not 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.330
 want to get this this is the condition of 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.420
 democracy that people sometimes do not 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.070
 time so it's a non- school role. 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.350
 is to bring knowledge 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.320
 simply take the same culture the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.590
 The main role of the school is to 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.890
 conditions for the student to learn and 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.960
 of course presenting the culture prefer 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.079
 if it is appropriate, then see if it is 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.750
 the foundation of the school as can be the 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.060
 basis of class actions at school 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.779
 first they can not go and never forget 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.950
 the most important of democracy in 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:16.349
 school 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.300
 and makes these boards is not made of 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.430
 relationship between the teacher and 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.709
 teacher with the most 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.120
 important that which should guide everything 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.629
 otherwise it is no use 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.630
 none is a relationship between the educator 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.080
 of the pupil who necessarily needs 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.690
 be a relation of respect to the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.880
 subjectivity of the student with the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.049
 respect for the subjectivity of the 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.599
 teacher 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.489
 this is fundamental for this to be 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.019
 we need a series 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.790
 activities in the series of measures 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.760
 a series of normal disputes 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.700
 exhibitions inside the school 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.260
 one of them is the participation of 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.310
 all involved 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.709
 what we are talking about democracy 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.450
 I'm not talking about the right to 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.319
 appropriation of culture 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:09.090
 then the school board 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:11.610
 the class council is to his name of peace 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.370
 the parents ' and teachers' associations where 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.470
 it exists it exists it always 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.959
 for relationships that are not 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.170
 compatible with those then you can not 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.389
 think you're in an institution 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.100
 whose paradigm is democracy 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.690
 for the child to appropriate 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.750
 freely of the knowledge 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.510
 you can not, for example, miss the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.180
 other activities are of the 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.130
 teachers of staff and peace 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.709
 for example in addition to organizations or 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.690
 technicians themselves that have to 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:48.440
 think the first action in the first factor 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.609
 which determines the good malfunction 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.410
 two collegiate 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:59.010
 is the best of the instances 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.019
 and there I am talking about the 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.030
 from school to school board 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.769
 I'm talking about the parents' association and 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.150
 teachers of the parents' association and 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.079
 teachers as it is called in some 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.169
 places 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.630
 I'm talking about class council. 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:17.130
 I'm talking about the meetings themselves. 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.200
 assemblies that are made at school is 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.440
 when he speaks of collective participation 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.139
 must always be a participation 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.999
 institutionalized is 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.599
 the situation of, for example, parents in 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:34.770
 meetings they have at school and with 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:37.740
 teachers to return is a note I'm for 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.860
 pass are evaluations of certain are 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:46.680
 also in this list of collective instances 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:51.150
 of participation is the tank is the most 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:54.139
 important in this case is knowing what the 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.139
 school goal
