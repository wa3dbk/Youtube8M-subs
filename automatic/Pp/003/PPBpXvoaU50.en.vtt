mat all day long and then when you go
out<00:00:08.460> with<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.670> knee<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.420> cannot<00:00:09.690> hack<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.230> then

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
out with a knee you cannot hack it then

out with a knee you cannot hack it then
that's<00:00:11.429> what<00:00:11.730> happening<00:00:12.230> when<00:00:13.230> we<00:00:13.380> train<00:00:13.679> we

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
that's what happening when we train we

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.259 
that's what happening when we train we
will<00:00:14.040> keep<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.549> understanding<00:00:15.059> get

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.570 
to go in the V too far I will go in here
to<00:01:21.210> linen<00:01:21.540> if<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.650> close<00:01:22.979> i<00:01:23.130> move<00:01:23.340> my<00:01:23.369> body

happened here i move my body back now
from<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.560> kick<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.340> could<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.790> harder<00:01:30.119> not

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
from here to kick it could be harder not

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.460 
from here to kick it could be harder not
this<00:01:31.020> harder<00:01:31.579> okay<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.820> not<00:01:32.939> easy<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:34.110> here

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
this harder okay it's not easy but here

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.109 
this harder okay it's not easy but here
to<00:01:34.619> kick<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.979> more<00:01:35.220> easier<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.909> got

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
to kick is more easier because you got

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.060 
to kick is more easier because you got
more<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.630> moment<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.710> got

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
more of the moment so you got

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.490 
more of the moment so you got
understanding<00:01:38.820> where<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.570> are<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.350> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
understanding where you are this is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.830 
understanding where you are this is
learn<00:01:40.740> about<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> distance<00:01:41.400> ok<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.600> slowly

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
learn about the distance ok so go slowly

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.030 
learn about the distance ok so go slowly
so<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.110> consider<00:01:43.409> idea<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.860> ways<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:44.850> two

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
so you consider idea of ways go one two

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.420 
so you consider idea of ways go one two
hand<00:01:47.040> another<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.540> coming<00:01:48.960> here<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.860> da<00:01:50.130> it's

hand another like coming here in da it's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.460 
hand another like coming here in da it's
a<00:01:50.549> right<00:01:50.729> line<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.329> depend<00:01:51.960> where<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.290> are

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
a right line so you depend where you are

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.620 
a right line so you depend where you are
then<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.009> raise<00:01:53.220> or<00:01:53.579> you'll<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.939> here
