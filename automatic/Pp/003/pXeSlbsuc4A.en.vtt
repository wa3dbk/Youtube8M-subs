00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
glitch so this glitch will duplicate

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.150

and<00:00:43.010> I'm<00:00:43.610> just<00:00:43.820> gonna<00:00:43.910> show<00:00:44.210> you<00:00:44.270> how<00:00:44.420> this

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
and I'm just gonna show you how this

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.869 
and I'm just gonna show you how this
works<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:45.050> start<00:00:45.320> off<00:00:45.500> with<00:00:45.770> flip<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.670> lever

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
works to start off with flip the lever

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.750 
works to start off with flip the lever
turns<00:00:47.629> it<00:00:47.839> on<00:00:47.989> let's<00:00:48.440> start<00:00:48.800> with<00:00:49.129> activator

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
turns it on let's start with activator

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.560 
turns it on let's start with activator
rails<00:00:50.089> do<00:00:50.809> that<00:00:51.109> makes<00:00:51.949> two<00:00:52.339> and<00:00:53.149> then<00:00:53.269> you<00:00:53.420> can

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
rails do that makes two and then you can

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.069 
rails do that makes two and then you can
just<00:00:53.719> keep<00:00:53.929> doing<00:00:54.320> that<00:00:54.499> now<00:00:55.070> I'll<00:00:55.249> have<00:00:55.460> four

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
just keep doing that now I'll have four

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.579 
just keep doing that now I'll have four
works<00:00:57.079> in<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.440> detector<00:00:58.219> rails<00:00:58.519> and<00:00:59.589> the

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
works in the detector rails and the

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.450 
works in the detector rails and the
power<00:01:00.800> grills<00:01:01.780> yes<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.050> that<00:01:03.230> is<00:01:03.530> how<00:01:03.800> it<00:01:04.040> works

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
power grills yes so that is how it works

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.580 
power grills yes so that is how it works
so<00:01:04.580> everything<00:01:05.089> you'll<00:01:05.300> need<00:01:05.420> is<00:01:06.020> in<00:01:06.380> my

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
inventory here you'll need one piece of

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.490 
inventory here you'll need one piece of
glass<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:10.340> lover<00:01:10.700> eight<00:01:11.120> redstone<00:01:11.960> three

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
redstone torches 11 blocks of your

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.560 
redstone torches 11 blocks of your
choice<00:01:15.409> I'm<00:01:15.770> just<00:01:16.070> using<00:01:16.580> blocks<00:01:17.030> of<00:01:17.270> onion

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
choice I'm just using blocks of onion

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.830 
choice I'm just using blocks of onion
cuz<00:01:17.840> it's<00:01:17.990> easy<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.560> see<00:01:18.830> two<00:01:19.700> sticky<00:01:20.240> pistons

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
cuz it's easy to see two sticky pistons

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.469 
cuz it's easy to see two sticky pistons
up<00:01:21.290> you<00:01:22.070> know<00:01:22.219> whatever<00:01:22.430> rail<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:23.119> want<00:01:23.329> to

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
up you know whatever rail you want to

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.840 
up you know whatever rail you want to
duplicate<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:24.649> you<00:01:24.710> know<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:25.610> can<00:01:25.700> do

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
duplicate so you know you can do

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.940 
duplicate so you know you can do
whatever<00:01:26.119> really<00:01:27.110> want<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.409> duplicate<00:01:27.890> I

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
whatever really want to duplicate I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.480 
whatever really want to duplicate I
guess<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.610> three<00:01:29.509> regular<00:01:30.049> rails<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:30.770> start

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
guess and three regular rails so start

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.050 
guess and three regular rails so start
off<00:01:31.640> building<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:32.390> do<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:32.899> block<00:01:33.549> glass<00:01:34.549> and

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
off building this do a block glass and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.779 
off building this do a block glass and
then<00:01:35.420> another<00:01:35.750> block<00:01:36.110> coming<00:01:36.649> out<00:01:36.799> of<00:01:37.130> the

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
then another block coming out of the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.980 
then another block coming out of the
left<00:01:38.060> from<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:38.630> block<00:01:38.960> here<00:01:39.380> go<00:01:39.590> one<00:01:39.920> two

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
left from this block here go one two

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.370 
left from this block here go one two
three<00:01:42.250> then<00:01:43.250> back<00:01:43.759> here<00:01:44.240> place<00:01:44.600> your<00:01:44.840> sticky

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
three then back here place your sticky

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.569 
three then back here place your sticky
piston<00:01:46.060> place<00:01:47.060> three<00:01:47.780> rails<00:01:48.079> on<00:01:48.409> top<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.950> this

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
piston place three rails on top of this

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.420 
piston place three rails on top of this
alright<00:01:50.539> place<00:01:50.840> three<00:01:51.289> rails<00:01:51.560> on<00:01:51.829> top<00:01:52.159> of

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
alright place three rails on top of

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.050 
alright place three rails on top of
there<00:01:52.789> so<00:01:53.750> that's<00:01:54.259> where<00:01:54.590> your<00:01:55.189> duplication

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
there so that's where your duplication

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.169 
there so that's where your duplication
will<00:01:56.270> be<00:01:56.420> going<00:01:56.810> on<00:01:56.990> place<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:57.920> block<00:01:58.340> here

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
will be going on place a block here

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.709 
will be going on place a block here
block<00:02:00.020> in<00:02:00.229> between<00:02:00.619> three<00:02:01.609> redstone<00:02:02.210> torches

block in between three redstone torches

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.680 
block in between three redstone torches
like<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:04.179> block<00:02:05.179> above<00:02:05.570> each<00:02:05.899> one<00:02:06.170> of<00:02:06.320> them

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
like that block above each one of them

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.410 
like that block above each one of them
place<00:02:08.690> your<00:02:08.929> lever<00:02:09.200> right<00:02:09.560> here<00:02:10.090> go<00:02:11.090> around

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
place your lever right here go around

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.250 
place your lever right here go around
back<00:02:11.960> place<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.770> redstone<00:02:13.520> dust<00:02:14.150> block<00:02:14.930> right

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
back place a redstone dust block right

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.670 
back place a redstone dust block right
there<00:02:15.320> on<00:02:15.800> top<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.100> these<00:02:16.490> to<00:02:17.360> do<00:02:17.960> it<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.530> like

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
there on top of these to do it just like

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.640 
there on top of these to do it just like
that<00:02:18.970> piston<00:02:19.970> right<00:02:20.180> there<00:02:20.540> block<00:02:21.380> here

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
that piston right there block here

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.570 
that piston right there block here
and<00:02:23.159> placed<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.819> rail<00:02:24.150> back<00:02:24.480> if<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.280> did<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
and placed a rail back if you did the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.759 
and placed a rail back if you did the
same<00:02:26.790> stake<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.390> did<00:02:27.720> take<00:02:28.379> your<00:02:28.560> redstone

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
same stake I did take your redstone

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.460 
same stake I did take your redstone
under<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.849> piston<00:02:30.299> one<00:02:30.599> two<00:02:31.110> three<00:02:31.650> one<00:02:32.430> two

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
under the piston one two three one two

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.199 
under the piston one two three one two
now<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:34.830> start<00:02:35.099> doing<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.580> glitch<00:02:35.730> so

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
now you can start doing the glitch so

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:45.649 
now you can start doing the glitch so
let<00:02:36.420> me<00:02:36.569> just<00:02:36.750> grab<00:02:37.110> these<00:02:44.269> now<00:02:45.269> when<00:02:45.510> you're

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
let me just grab these now when you're

let me just grab these now when you're
done<00:02:45.900> cuz<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.349> gets<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.739> little<00:02:46.890> bit<00:02:47.099> annoying

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
done cuz this gets a little bit annoying

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.640 
done cuz this gets a little bit annoying
with<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.760> sounds<00:02:48.420> just<00:02:48.720> flick<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.019> off<00:02:49.260> and

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
with the sounds just flick it off and
