00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
carboys can sit in it then here's the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.490 
carboys can sit in it then here's the
bucket<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.149> I've<00:00:39.300> cut<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.780> notch<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
bucket and I've cut out a notch on the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.810 
bucket and I've cut out a notch on the
side<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.070> power<00:00:41.280> cord<00:00:41.579> from<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.940> pump

side for the power cord from the pump

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.580 
side for the power cord from the pump
this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> spout<00:00:45.539> where<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.230> cross

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
this is the spout where the cross

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.310 
this is the spout where the cross
section<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.309> made<00:00:47.550> out<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.730> 3/4<00:00:48.360> inch<00:00:48.390> PVC<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
section is made out of 3/4 inch PVC and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.979 
section is made out of 3/4 inch PVC and
then<00:00:49.440> there's<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> reducer<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.550> goes<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.570> 1/2

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
then there's a reducer that goes to 1/2

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.490 
then there's a reducer that goes to 1/2
inch<00:00:52.230> PVC<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.550> then<00:00:54.420> over<00:00:54.750> here<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
inch PVC and then over here is the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.990 
inch PVC and then over here is the
connector<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.520> allows<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.210> attach<00:00:57.899> your

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
connector that allows you to attach your

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:24.190 
connector that allows you to attach your
kegs<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.300> wash<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.750> posts

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.100 

so<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.009> benefit<00:01:25.430> of<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.970> cross<00:01:26.420> section<00:01:26.659> near

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
so the benefit of the cross section near

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.320 
so the benefit of the cross section near
the<00:01:27.140> bottom<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.650> pump<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:29.210> the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
the bottom of the pump is so that the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.240 
the bottom of the pump is so that the
pump<00:01:29.570> stays<00:01:29.900> Center<00:01:30.439> when<00:01:30.830> it's<00:01:31.009> in<00:01:31.159> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
pump stays Center when it's in the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.929 
pump stays Center when it's in the
bucket<00:01:31.430> but<00:01:32.210> also<00:01:32.330> when<00:01:32.720> you're<00:01:32.840> washing<00:01:33.049> kegs

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
bucket but also when you're washing kegs

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.749 
bucket but also when you're washing kegs
it<00:01:34.939> also<00:01:35.149> helps<00:01:35.780> keep<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.350> keg<00:01:36.649> off<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.520> the

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
it also helps keep the keg off of the

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.030 
it also helps keep the keg off of the
pump<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.240> helps<00:01:39.110> everything<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.619> function

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
pump and helps everything to function

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:53.240 
pump and helps everything to function
properly

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.200 

you

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.900 

when<00:01:56.810> washing<00:01:57.320> carboys<00:01:57.980> I'll<00:01:58.280> actually<00:01:58.460> take

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
when washing carboys I'll actually take

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.750 
when washing carboys I'll actually take
the<00:01:59.330> keg<00:01:59.840> washing<00:02:00.380> component<00:02:01.010> out<00:02:01.160> because<00:02:01.640> I

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
the keg washing component out because I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.720 
the keg washing component out because I
find<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.290> it'll<00:02:03.290> raise<00:02:03.530> this<00:02:04.070> spout<00:02:04.430> a

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
find that it'll raise this spout a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.790 
find that it'll raise this spout a
little<00:02:05.030> too<00:02:05.270> high<00:02:05.510> and<00:02:05.870> then<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.320> reducer

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
little too high and then the reducer

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.430 
little too high and then the reducer
will<00:02:06.980> get<00:02:07.160> in<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.340> way<00:02:07.370> of<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:08.330> opening<00:02:09.200> of

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
will get in the way of the opening of

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.120 
will get in the way of the opening of
the<00:02:09.649> carboys<00:02:10.450> but<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.810> can<00:02:11.990> see<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:12.530> the
