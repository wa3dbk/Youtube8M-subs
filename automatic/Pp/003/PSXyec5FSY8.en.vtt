00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.660
 at apple samsung or huawei the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.849
 launch of a new smartphone 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.080
 flagship flagship 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.080
 in general it is rather that 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.860
 but at sony's in this spring of 2015 and 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.650
 well we have to settle for a launch 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.970
 much more sober almost on the sly 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.590
 in the form of a press release 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.070
 some pictures on the brand website 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.610
 Japanese 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.320
 so it must be said that this xperia z4 does 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.200
 not shine by its innovations 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.450
 it remains very similar to the three aids 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.040
 outputs ago 6 months away side 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.720
 design no big changes on 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.080
 continues the momentum we resume the 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.670
 lure even the z4 tablet looks racy 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.760
 who now has the trademark 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.980
 products sony ultra finesse edge because 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.059
 and the z4 loses some 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.640
 millimeters in relation to his 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.739
 predecessor in terms of thickness he 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.940
 also weighs a few grams less in 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.100
 revenge these are really the same 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.409
 proportions the same dimensions the screen 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.409
 of 5.2 inches full hd is also 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.780
 identical for the rest this glass z4 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.760
 and aluminum will also be anti 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.080
 dust and even waterproof like his 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.790
 predecessors we can plunge him into 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.890
 water this is not the case of a certain 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.930
 galaxy ace 6 who can not swim anymore 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.520
 having abandoned the waterproof side at 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.979
 profit of a new design brief in all 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.630
 not much new but the 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.979
 true novelty there is one all of 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.460
 even she's inside it's the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.250
 processor the famous dragon stadium 810's 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.899
 qualcomm that will equip sony z cap 2 810 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.119
 it's the rolls of mobile processors 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.240
 or rather the ferrari with a power 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.770
 unmatched but but there is one but he 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.420
 heated it has been found in many 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.189
 01net lab tests 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.899
 then we'll see if sony manages to do 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.329
 better in terms of optimization for 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.710
 fix this overheating problem better 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.200
 that htc or lg 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.359
 a word of the photo the z4 does in the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.060
 20 mega pixels with hold well one 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.009
 cooking mode supposed to make pictures of 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.670
 food more beautiful than what we 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.249
 done today 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.200
 short fans of sony in trouble effects 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:07.359
 whaou will remain on their hunger with this 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.080
 smartphone that has to come out this summer on 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.210
 the Japanese market 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.520
 unless they feel 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.440
 reassured by this new toy that 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.700
 less will not make you want to pass 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.450
