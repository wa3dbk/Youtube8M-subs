00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.290
 hello guys welcome to a new video 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.910
 of cross and blogs and well then today what 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.190
 let's do it's going to be play a little bit 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.480
 a game that I downloaded and that the 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.930
 truth is that I have seen that I was 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.880
 pretty cool and I wanted to try it and see 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.440
 how about a video playing this 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.260
 game 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.880
 I'm going to do a new series for that 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.220
 say it my videos are now going to be a 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.550
 little more focused on what it is to record 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:35.530
 some games throwing mobile games 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:38.650
 or things like that and see if you like it and good 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.290
 then you can tell me the logos in the 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.790
 comments and well then here we see that 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.120
 we are like in 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.170
 a highway 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.170
 in a landscape 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.700
 and what we have to do is is 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.110
 gorgeous what we have to do is 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.030
 get to the end the most 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.670
 We can, as I've seen, I 've just been 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.789
 an eagle 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.770
 and what we have to do is avoid the 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.850
 obstacles and get as far as you 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.920
 We can be pretty crappy because 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.130
 at the beginning it's easy but then it goes 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.130
 putting up 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.150
 fuck 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.280
 let's see if we can do something 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.280
 and get a little bit further 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:41.180
 the game is like that in 8 bits but the truth 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.180
 is that they come to the graphics that has 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.540
 that is impossible 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.340
 Let's see 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.340
 Let's go there 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.010
 fuck but if there is no room to jump 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.580
 in a single space 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.580
 Let's see 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.590
 come now now now we have it 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.590
 guys we have it no no 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.780
 Let's see 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.660
 Now we wait for the bundle 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.010
 no no no no 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.370
 for boys this is very complicated 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.080
 Let's see 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.230
 is that 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.230
 it's luck more than anything 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.510
 the game now I will leave you the name in the 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.599
 description if you want to what 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.819
 download and if you want me to do more 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:57.060

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.770
 I'm trying that shit 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.200
 what I'm trying more or less is 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.400
 make one 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.989
 a game of each game if any in 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.629
 you want me to do it 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.480
 you say in the comments and more or less 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:14.050
 so that you know fuck so that 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.810

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.030
 and see if you like the new theme 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.209
 of the Chanel 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.390
 if you are impossible I swear to you that when 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.140
 I've tried it alone 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.940
 it was much easier 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.819
 It is also true that as I am 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.540
 recording the screen as it goes a little bit 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.540
 slow but 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.769
 it can not be day 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.840

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.810

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.060
 but please 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.060
 that is not so difficult 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.130
 but you have you are telling me 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.280
 Let's see 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.840
 for the two cars and behind us 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.230

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.230
 car 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.160
 let's wait for the train to arrive 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.300
 we crossed to shit uncle see that car no 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.300
 I should have gone through there 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.800
 at the beginning it was a I think it was a 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.040
 chicken what they gave you 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.930

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.240

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:17.740
 impossible gave the impossible 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.740
 to see the last time we tried 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.480

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.390

 I think we're going to leave it here I'm going to 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:52.969
 give it a little without recording them because of 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:55.550
 true that when I do not record I get everything 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.599
 great but when I record well you know 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.399
