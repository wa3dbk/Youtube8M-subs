00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
what I decided to do is use a little

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.529 
what I decided to do is use a little
pump<00:06:00.110> it<00:06:00.229> up<00:06:00.349> and<00:06:00.620> I<00:06:01.460> just<00:06:01.699> kind<00:06:01.940> of<00:06:02.000> spiked<00:06:02.360> it

up a little bit and freestyled it just
to<00:06:06.289> give<00:06:06.470> it<00:06:06.500> a<00:06:06.830> little<00:06:07.400> bit<00:06:07.580> more<00:06:07.820> personality

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
to give it a little bit more personality

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.020 
to give it a little bit more personality
