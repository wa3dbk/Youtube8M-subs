you can use any any kind of everything
I'll<00:00:16.110> do<00:00:16.230> as<00:00:16.439> long<00:00:16.560> as<00:00:16.619> there's<00:00:16.890> no<00:00:17.040> seeds<00:00:17.430> in

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
I'll do as long as there's no seeds in

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.220 
I'll do as long as there's no seeds in
the<00:00:17.820> aubergine<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.390> they<00:00:18.720> were<00:00:18.810> telling<00:00:19.050> that

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the aubergine and they were telling that

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.929 
the aubergine and they were telling that
it's<00:00:19.410> by<00:00:19.560> if<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> everything<00:00:20.550> feels<00:00:20.759> quite

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
it's by if the everything feels quite

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.940 
it's by if the everything feels quite
light<00:00:21.270> generally<00:00:21.960> means<00:00:22.110> there's<00:00:22.290> no<00:00:22.439> seed<00:00:22.770> in

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
light generally means there's no seed in

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.979 
light generally means there's no seed in
them<00:00:23.180> if<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.419> the<00:00:24.509> seats<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.869> there

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:24.989 
them if you have the seats in there

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:25.909 
them if you have the seats in there
tends<00:00:25.169> be<00:00:25.259> much<00:00:25.439> fitter

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
tends be much fitter

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.069 
tends be much fitter
so<00:00:26.759> what<00:00:26.849> we're<00:00:26.939> gonna<00:00:27.000> do<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.450> we're<00:00:27.899> going<00:00:28.020> to

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
so what we're gonna do is we're going to

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.019 
so what we're gonna do is we're going to
boil<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:29.220> aubergine<00:00:29.489> I'm<00:00:29.669> gonna<00:00:29.820> cut<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
boil the aubergine I'm gonna cut the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.580 
boil the aubergine I'm gonna cut the
opening<00:00:30.119> up<00:00:30.450> and<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.140> we're<00:00:31.230> gonna<00:00:31.320> boil<00:00:31.559> it

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
opening up and then we're gonna boil it

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.500 
opening up and then we're gonna boil it
in<00:00:31.739> boiling<00:00:32.040> salted<00:00:32.070> water<00:00:32.450> we're<00:00:33.450> gonna

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
in boiling salted water we're gonna

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.970 
in boiling salted water we're gonna
cover<00:00:33.719> over<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.930> lid<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.380> then<00:00:34.770> we're<00:00:34.890> gonna

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
cover over the lid and then we're gonna

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.860 
cover over the lid and then we're gonna
fry<00:00:35.310> it<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.640> by<00:00:35.760> boiling<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.360> completely

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
fry it so by boiling it you completely

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.780 
fry it so by boiling it you completely
take<00:00:37.320> away<00:00:37.470> all<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> kind<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> nasty<00:00:38.340> bits<00:00:38.700> of

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
take away all the kind of nasty bits of

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.880 
take away all the kind of nasty bits of
its<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.210> then<00:00:40.110> make<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> very<00:00:40.680> very

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
its and you then make it very very

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.710 
its and you then make it very very
tender<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.730> then<00:00:42.060> when<00:00:42.150> you<00:00:42.240> fry<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.510> don't

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
tender and then when you fry you don't

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.060 
tender and then when you fry you don't
get<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> horrible<00:00:43.170> uncooked<00:00:43.590> aubergine

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
get a horrible uncooked aubergine

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.340 
get a horrible uncooked aubergine
texture<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.910> I've<00:00:45.480> got<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> sharp<00:00:45.870> knife<00:00:45.930> cut

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
texture so I've got a sharp knife cut

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.280 
texture so I've got a sharp knife cut
the<00:00:46.650> top<00:00:46.830> off<00:00:47.360> cut<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.510> aubergine<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.500> half

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
the top off cut the aubergine in half

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.040 
the top off cut the aubergine in half
half<00:00:52.290> again<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.790> basically<00:00:53.880> into<00:00:54.300> eighths<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
half again so basically into eighths and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.180 
half again so basically into eighths and
then<00:00:55.800> nice<00:00:56.010> sort<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.460> two<00:00:57.000> centimeter<00:00:58.190> pieces

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
then nice sort of two centimeter pieces

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:08.550 
then nice sort of two centimeter pieces
it'd<00:00:59.700> be<00:00:59.760> perfect<00:01:01.399> okay<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:03.559> okay<00:01:05.180> so

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.100 

put<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.190> emissions<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.720> they<00:01:10.840> just<00:01:10.960> get<00:01:11.049> a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
put the emissions in and they just get a

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.820 
put the emissions in and they just get a
plate<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.460> put<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.700> plate<00:01:12.909> on<00:01:12.940> top<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.680> what

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
plate and put the plate on top and what

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.170 
plate and put the plate on top and what
that<00:01:14.950> will<00:01:15.040> do<00:01:15.159> they'll<00:01:15.340> push<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.850> aubergine

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
that will do they'll push the aubergine

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.280 
that will do they'll push the aubergine
down<00:01:16.360> so<00:01:16.570> it's<00:01:16.659> actually<00:01:16.869> sitting<00:01:17.049> in<00:01:17.229> the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
down so it's actually sitting in the

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.050 
down so it's actually sitting in the
water<00:01:17.440> just<00:01:18.190> put<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.340> lid<00:01:18.549> on<00:01:18.580> they'll<00:01:18.850> just

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
water just put a lid on they'll just

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.760 
water just put a lid on they'll just
rise<00:01:19.270> because<00:01:19.630> there's<00:01:19.840> this<00:01:20.380> basically

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
rise because there's this basically

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.289 
rise because there's this basically
there's<00:01:21.430> not<00:01:21.549> much<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.790> an<00:01:21.880> aubergine<00:01:22.090> it's

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
there's not much to an aubergine it's

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.340 
there's not much to an aubergine it's
not<00:01:22.390> gonna<00:01:22.479> sink<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.790> push<00:01:24.790> that<00:01:24.820> down<00:01:25.119> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
not gonna sink so push that down and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.840 
not gonna sink so push that down and
then<00:01:26.350> just<00:01:26.500> let<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:26.680> boil<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:28.950> roughly<00:01:29.950> five

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
then just let that boil for roughly five

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.620 
then just let that boil for roughly five
minutes

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
minutes

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.780 
minutes
it's<00:01:32.110> a<00:01:32.170> boil<00:01:32.470> for<00:01:32.649> five<00:01:32.830> minutes<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.399> then

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
it's a boil for five minutes and then

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.090 
it's a boil for five minutes and then
we're<00:01:33.880> gonna<00:01:33.970> drain<00:01:34.240> it<00:01:34.920> okay<00:01:35.920> so<00:01:35.979> the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
we're gonna drain it okay so the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.560 
we're gonna drain it okay so the
libertines<00:01:36.399> been<00:01:36.549> cooking<00:01:36.790> about<00:01:36.880> 5-6

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
out of the water and they can see they

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.930 
out of the water and they can see they
have<00:01:41.110> slightly<00:01:41.229> changed<00:01:41.380> color<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.070> the
