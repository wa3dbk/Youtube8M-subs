these<00:01:28.200> are<00:01:28.409> playmakers<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.670> not

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
these are playmakers that I know are not

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.569

at<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> upper<00:01:31.140> echelon<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.860> league<00:01:32.100> but

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
at the upper echelon of the league but

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.800 
at the upper echelon of the league but
they're<00:01:32.790> certainly<00:01:33.060> better<00:01:33.509> than<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
they're certainly better than the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.660 
they're certainly better than the
playmakers<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> Jets<00:01:34.740> had<00:01:34.890> last<00:01:35.189> year<00:01:35.369> and

playmakers the Jets had last year and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.490 
playmakers the Jets had last year and
they're<00:01:36.119> headed<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> right<00:01:36.750> direction<00:01:36.810> as

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
they're headed in the right direction as

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.380 
they're headed in the right direction as
far<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.009> standpoint<00:01:38.430> goes<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.299> they

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
far as that standpoint goes but they

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
far as that standpoint goes but they
still<00:01:39.630> need<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> add<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:41.009> know<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> Jets

still need to add and you know the Jets

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.130 
still need to add and you know the Jets

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
to go over a thousand yards every year

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.870 
to go over a thousand yards every year
there's<00:01:49.740> something<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.220> said<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
there's something to be said for that I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.910 
there's something to be said for that I
know<00:01:50.970> his<00:01:51.299> yards<00:01:51.659> per<00:01:51.869> carry<00:01:52.049> has<00:01:52.380> dipped<00:01:52.649> here

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
know his yards per carry has dipped here

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.069 
know his yards per carry has dipped here
to<00:01:53.310> under<00:01:53.610> four<00:01:53.909> last<00:01:54.240> year<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> member<00:01:54.930> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
to under four last year as a member of

to under four last year as a member of
the<00:01:55.170> titans<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.159> again<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.759> 1a<00:01:57.360> or<00:01:57.600> 1b<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:58.439> a

the titans but again as a 1a or 1b in a
running<00:01:59.460> back<00:01:59.640> tandem<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.329> think<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.140> could

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
running back tandem I think you could

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.139 
running back tandem I think you could
certainly<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.770> much<00:02:01.979> worse<00:02:02.250> than<00:02:02.820> Chris

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
certainly do much worse than Chris

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.850 
certainly do much worse than Chris
Johnson<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.659> he<00:02:03.780> also<00:02:04.020> gives<00:02:04.350> them<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.590> big

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
Johnson and he also gives them that big

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.800 
Johnson and he also gives them that big
play<00:02:05.100> ability<00:02:05.219> something<00:02:06.180> they've<00:02:06.329> sorely

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
play ability something they've sorely

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.930 
play ability something they've sorely
lacked<00:02:07.079> here<00:02:07.439> especially<00:02:07.920> last<00:02:08.459> year<00:02:08.759> if<00:02:08.849> you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
lacked here especially last year if you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.729 
lacked here especially last year if you
want<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.479> how<00:02:09.599> Geno<00:02:09.929> Smith<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.379> develop

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
want to see how Geno Smith can develop

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.559 
want to see how Geno Smith can develop
you<00:02:11.160> need<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.400> at<00:02:11.489> least<00:02:11.520> give<00:02:11.849> him<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.030> shot<00:02:12.209> and

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
you need to at least give him a shot and

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.120 
you need to at least give him a shot and
I<00:02:12.840> think<00:02:13.080> Chris<00:02:13.230> weapon<00:02:13.590> Chris

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
I think Chris weapon Chris

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.670 
I think Chris weapon Chris
Johnson<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.850> another<00:02:15.390> weapon<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:16.200> sort<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.500> add

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
Johnson is another weapon to sort of add

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.040 
Johnson is another weapon to sort of add
to<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.890> arsenal<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.790> also<00:02:18.390> help<00:02:18.750> Michael

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
to that arsenal and also help Michael

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.720 
to that arsenal and also help Michael
Vick<00:02:19.200> if<00:02:19.380> Michael<00:02:19.680> Vick<00:02:19.800> ends<00:02:19.980> up<00:02:20.160> being<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
Vick if Michael Vick ends up being the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.550 
Vick if Michael Vick ends up being the
starting<00:02:21.060> quarterback<00:02:21.210> there<00:02:22.020> in<00:02:22.170> New<00:02:22.260> York

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
starting quarterback there in New York

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.920 
starting quarterback there in New York
so<00:02:22.860> from<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.370> jet<00:02:23.580> standpoint<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.360> really<00:02:24.810> don't

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
so from a jet standpoint I really don't

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.560 
so from a jet standpoint I really don't
see<00:02:25.050> at<00:02:25.260> two<00:02:25.470> years<00:02:25.800> minimal<00:02:26.700> money<00:02:26.910> for<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> guy

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
see at two years minimal money for a guy

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.450 
see at two years minimal money for a guy
of<00:02:27.720> his<00:02:27.810> stature<00:02:28.110> how<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.070> could<00:02:29.250> turn<00:02:29.340> out

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
of his stature how this could turn out

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.190 
of his stature how this could turn out
to<00:02:29.550> be<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> bad<00:02:29.910> move<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.810> course<00:02:30.870> from

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
to be a bad move and of course from

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.720 
to be a bad move and of course from
Chris<00:02:31.380> Johnson<00:02:31.860> standpoint<00:02:32.400> obviously

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
Chris Johnson standpoint obviously

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.940 
Chris Johnson standpoint obviously
surveying<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.600> landscape<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.290> realizing

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
surveying the landscape and realizing

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.140 
surveying the landscape and realizing
this<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.160> probably<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.460> best<00:02:35.670> healer<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.030> can

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
this is probably the best healer you can

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.180 
this is probably the best healer you can
get<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.540> think<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.050> Jets<00:02:37.290> need<00:02:37.470> Chris<00:02:37.710> Johnson

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
get I think the Jets need Chris Johnson

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.040 
get I think the Jets need Chris Johnson
and<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.640> think<00:02:38.880> Chris<00:02:39.060> Johnson<00:02:39.480> needs<00:02:39.600> two<00:02:39.780> jets

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
and I think Chris Johnson needs two jets

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.290 
and I think Chris Johnson needs two jets
to<00:02:40.260> sort<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.590> prove<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.340> 28<00:02:41.790> years<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.150> age

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
to sort of prove that a 28 years of age

to sort of prove that a 28 years of age
he<00:02:42.510> can<00:02:42.660> still<00:02:42.900> do<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.350> maybe<00:02:43.770> who<00:02:43.950> knows

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
he can still do it and maybe who knows

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.430 
he can still do it and maybe who knows
on<00:02:44.400> get<00:02:44.940> another<00:02:45.210> contract<00:02:45.780> similar<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.320> this
