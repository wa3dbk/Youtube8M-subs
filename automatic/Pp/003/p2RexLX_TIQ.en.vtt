00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.720
 let's begin 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 like a chain 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.010

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.410
 a row of long chains 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.310
 how it is left 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.110
 in this case 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.450

 a multiple g3 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.930

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 second 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.170

 The stick 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.350
 we keep it as if it were a wool blanket 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.340
