00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
right and I bet that's how we thought

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.320 
right and I bet that's how we thought
about<00:04:47.870> one<00:04:48.200> of<00:04:48.230> those<00:04:48.380> Tragon<00:04:48.770> punches<00:04:49.070> and

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
about one of those Tragon punches and

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.820 
about one of those Tragon punches and
footsies<00:04:50.330> right<00:04:50.540> there<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:51.290> one<00:04:51.560> of<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.710> cool

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
footsies right there and one of the cool

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.080 
footsies right there and one of the cool
things<00:04:51.860> about<00:04:52.160> alex<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:52.700> that<00:04:52.820> he'll<00:04:52.940> bring

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
things about alex is that he'll bring

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.520 
things about alex is that he'll bring
that<00:04:53.270> stuff<00:04:53.390> out<00:04:53.630> and<00:04:53.870> when<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:54.200> when<00:04:54.380> he's

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
that stuff out and when you when he's

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.410 
that stuff out and when you when he's
doing<00:04:54.860> that<00:04:54.890> and<00:04:55.160> then<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:55.490> hits<00:04:55.640> you<00:04:56.180> know

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
doing that and then it hits you know

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.150

he's<00:04:56.600> on<00:04:56.720> his<00:04:56.870> game<00:04:56.930> so<00:04:57.620> he's<00:04:57.770> probably

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
he's on his game so he's probably
