00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.020
 m 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.230
 only to everyone and welcome to 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:33.040
 this gym you I promised you 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.420
 for my return from living ivc so I 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.449
 briefly recalls what it was 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.649
 the living room ivc it was the living room 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.440
 international broadcasting 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.640
 was going to amsterdam 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.040
 amsterdam the country of cheese 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.040
 what did you think in any case 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.829
 it was a gigantic magnificent living room 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.760
 and there was really a lot of people 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.890
 now what interests us is 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.729
 is especially what was announced 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.650
 on our gopro stand then already for 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.770
 stop the rumors right away with 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.689
 this video there is no go pro hero 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.259
 iii that was announced on this booth 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.640
 that's it, we can do it 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.770
 which has been announced 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.750
 what were we saying to people who 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.159
 came to visit us on our 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.630
 stand and well two things have been 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.729
 officially announced at least 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.850
 formalized 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.109
 so I'll start with the first 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.689
 the application we all expect is going away 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:35.829
 say since well the output of the wifi 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:39.460
 backpack i named proteams pro tunes a 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:42.069
 been formalized and announced for the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.729
 date of September 28 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.590
 yes this month so will go out produce 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.509
 so we really waited for him 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.249
 so they told us to say if everything is 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.909
 okay so I'm telling you if 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:56.380
 everything is going well 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.999
 produce comes out September 28th when we have 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.350
 not even waited for nothing because I 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:01.179
 can you say that even I was 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.939
 turned when I saw a little bit the 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.579
 beast tour there are a lot of things 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.590
 that we reserve pro tunes and I am 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.390
 sure you will be amazed at all 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.810
 the things that this app is going to us 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.690
 to offer 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.950
 So here I go I'll also two 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.990
 three things we could say 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.180
 the first thing knew for you the 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.230
 broadcast professionals for those 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.380
 who work in the cinema 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.770
 it will be able to film in 24 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.200
 second images so that's not trivial 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.610
 but there are also predefined filters 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.030
 we will be able to apply directly 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.709
 so via our iphone or our tablet 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.900
 on the video that is being 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.350
 recorded so that's part of it 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.010
 we will say the big engine that is going 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.780
 enable pro tools 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.959
 but I'll keep you a little bit 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.900
 after that while she was the second 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.060
 announcement that we made on our stand 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.010
 gopro is the second thing that has 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.190
 been announced it is going to say a big 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.709
 software update sign form 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.780
 studio so why do I say a big 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.459
 updated because we already had to 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.519
 sign form studio but not like 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.160
 that because now at least when 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.290
 this update will be done sign 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.459
 studio form will turn into a 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.470
 editing software 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.860
 yeah there are a lot of people who 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.230
 were waiting for that to sign form so yes 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.870
 it's going to become an editing software that 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.880
 will nevertheless remain basic in his 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.519
 free version so sign form goes 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.620
 have the options well to be able to ride 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.890
 our videos there add music 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.360
 even transitions as you 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.910
 can see it on these pictures there that I 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.130
 am trying to apply to you 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.989
 predefined filters so you go 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.970
 can add filters really 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.310
 nice about the videos you shot 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.579
 but also retouched the speed of the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.750
 accelerate video slow down add some 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:58.000
 blur effects and so on 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.549
 because I count well you keep 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.470
 some surprises for the tutorials that I 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.010
 will you publish at the exit of his 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.400
 software 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.109
 so now so the big bet 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.540
 day to sign form studio counted this 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.230
 case will come out it was announced for the 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.510
 october 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.049
 that's still pretty global 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.780
 a global forgiveness but this update 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.850
 is supposed to be so for the month 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.780
 of October so still a little bit of 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:28.780
 patience but beautiful things are going 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.550
 to arrive for gopro software here at 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.470
 note also for professionals so 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:39.070
 who can possibly watch me 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:41.849
 I hope a version of products 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:46.110
 dopants in a version of sign form 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.110
 which was announced so a version 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.230
 superior and a version 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.540
 professional so the version 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:56.410
 professional who has been announced 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:00.610

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.630
