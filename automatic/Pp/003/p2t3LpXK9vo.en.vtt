pump<00:02:14.340> seven<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.240> eight<00:02:15.990> nice<00:02:16.770> moving<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:17.790> now

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
pump seven and eight nice moving on now

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.970 
pump seven and eight nice moving on now
we're<00:02:18.569> gonna<00:02:18.660> put<00:02:18.959> our<00:02:19.050> right<00:02:19.319> hand<00:02:19.590> out<00:02:19.770> and

we're gonna put our right hand out and

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.000 
we're gonna put our right hand out and
slap<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.370> with<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.670> left<00:02:20.880> one<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:24.110> two<00:02:25.110> now<00:02:25.950> we

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
slap it with the left one and two now we

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.130 
slap it with the left one and two now we
raise<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.400> up<00:02:26.490> again<00:02:26.670> for<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.090> lock<00:02:27.530> three<00:02:28.530> and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
raise it up again for a lock three and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.990 
raise it up again for a lock three and
four<00:02:31.140> that's<00:02:31.650> why<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.890> term<00:02:32.280> locking<00:02:32.880> is

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
four that's why the term locking is

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.550 
four that's why the term locking is
locking<00:02:33.390> because<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.750> lock<00:02:34.200> into<00:02:34.440> your

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
locking because you lock into your

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.690 
locking because you lock into your
muscle<00:02:34.890> position<00:02:35.280> okay<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.240> then<00:02:36.660> we<00:02:36.780> move<00:02:36.959> on

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
muscle position okay and then we move on

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.470 
muscle position okay and then we move on
five<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.320> six<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:41.300> seven<00:02:42.300> eight<00:02:44.330> point<00:02:45.330> on

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
five and six and seven eight point on

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.690 
five and six and seven eight point on
one<00:02:45.830> so<00:02:46.830> we're<00:02:46.950> gonna<00:02:47.040> do<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.340> one<00:02:47.489> more<00:02:47.670> time

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
