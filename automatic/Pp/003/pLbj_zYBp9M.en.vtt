them and we want them to know there is a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.260 
them and we want them to know there is a
ton<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.609> hope<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.989> when<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:05.270> deal

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
ton of hope and I know that when I deal

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.510 
ton of hope and I know that when I deal
with<00:01:06.360> my<00:01:06.689> young<00:01:06.930> son<00:01:07.200> Jackson<00:01:07.830> I'm<00:01:08.250> always

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
with my young son Jackson I'm always

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.179 
with my young son Jackson I'm always
thinking<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.270> would<00:01:09.390> my<00:01:09.540> parents<00:01:09.920> have<00:01:10.920> done

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
thinking what would my parents have done

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.460 
thinking what would my parents have done
and<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.270> think<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.570> that's<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.900> good<00:01:13.140> sign

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and I think that that's a good sign

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.380 
and I think that that's a good sign
because<00:01:13.950> they<00:01:14.100> were<00:01:14.159> good<00:01:14.430> parents<00:01:14.670> did<00:01:15.270> they

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
because they were good parents did they

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.120 
because they were good parents did they
make<00:01:15.570> mistakes<00:01:15.979> absolutely<00:01:17.630> but<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.659> use<00:01:19.130> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
make mistakes absolutely but I use the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.780 
make mistakes absolutely but I use the
methods<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:21.689> teachings<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.530> they<00:01:22.740> gave<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
methods the teachings that they gave to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.399
