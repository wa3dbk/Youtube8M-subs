00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
have these big displays set up in summer

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.340

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
going on so so you guys that have

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
going on so so you guys that have
different<00:00:59.729> bugs<00:01:00.180> might<00:01:00.539> find<00:01:00.780> some<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.049> these

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
different bugs might find some of these

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.310 
different bugs might find some of these
interesting<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.979> for<00:01:02.190> example<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:03.690> powder<00:01:03.989> it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
interesting so for example the powder it

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.490 
interesting so for example the powder it
stops<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.339> deadly<00:01:05.789> centipedes<00:01:06.479> from<00:01:07.080> getting

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
stops the deadly centipedes from getting

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.969 
stops the deadly centipedes from getting
in<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> house<00:01:08.840> they're<00:01:09.840> not<00:01:09.990> usually<00:01:10.229> deadly

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
in the house they're not usually deadly

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.800 
in the house they're not usually deadly
but<00:01:11.159> they<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.610> hurt<00:01:11.789> the<00:01:12.060> mukari<00:01:12.509> we've

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
but they really hurt the mukari we've

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.200 
but they really hurt the mukari we've
showed<00:01:13.050> you<00:01:13.170> those<00:01:13.319> things<00:01:13.530> before<00:01:14.210> another

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
showed you those things before another

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.029 
showed you those things before another
you<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.259> bit<00:01:16.409> more<00:01:16.590> unique<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
you think it's a bit more unique to

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.330 
you think it's a bit more unique to
Japan<00:01:17.069> is<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.270> tatami<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.770> made<00:01:19.979> of

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
Japan is the tatami because it's made of

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.570 
Japan is the tatami because it's made of
a<00:01:20.819> living<00:01:21.149> material<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.780> course<00:01:22.050> or<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.580> natural

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
a living material of course or a natural

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.059 
a living material of course or a natural
10<00:01:23.819> percent<00:01:24.360> natural<00:01:24.539> material<00:01:25.289> plant

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:26.069 
10 percent natural material plant

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.969 
10 percent natural material plant
material<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.200> because<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.530> thick

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
material and because it's so thick

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.430 
material and because it's so thick
insects<00:01:29.940> can<00:01:30.119> actually<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.600> inside<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
insects can actually get inside the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.289 
insects can actually get inside the
tatami<00:01:31.830> and<00:01:32.130> they<00:01:32.250> quite<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.000> inside

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
tatami and they quite like to get inside

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.880 
tatami and they quite like to get inside
the<00:01:33.450> tatami<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:35.929> so<00:01:36.929> that<00:01:36.959> can<00:01:37.649> be<00:01:37.679> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the tatami if they can so that can be a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.620 
the tatami if they can so that can be a
bit<00:01:38.100> tricky<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.549> deal<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.240> Tommies

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
bit tricky to deal with the Tommies

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.480 
bit tricky to deal with the Tommies
tricky<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.649> it's<00:01:40.830> tricky<00:01:41.069> to<00:01:41.130> clean

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
tricky it really is it's tricky to clean

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.169 
tricky it really is it's tricky to clean
it's<00:01:41.789> triggered<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:43.130> trigger<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.190> get<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.880> there

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
it's triggered a trigger to get if there

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.609 
it's triggered a trigger to get if there
is<00:01:45.300> bugs<00:01:45.539> in<00:01:45.720> their<00:01:45.869> trick<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> get<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:46.440> but

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
is bugs in their trick to get the but

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.800 
is bugs in their trick to get the but
get<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> bugs<00:01:47.160> out<00:01:47.429> so<00:01:48.330> there's<00:01:48.539> a<00:01:48.569> few

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
get the bugs out so there's a few

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.150 
get the bugs out so there's a few
different<00:01:48.899> ways<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.319> handle<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.739> one's<00:01:49.920> to

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
different ways we handle that one's to

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.270 
different ways we handle that one's to
fog<00:01:50.429> the<00:01:50.459> rooms<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.300> other<00:01:51.450> one<00:01:51.660> is<00:01:52.099> they<00:01:53.099> have

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
fog the rooms the other one is they have

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.710 
fog the rooms the other one is they have
these<00:01:53.840> cans<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:56.220> a<00:01:56.580> little<00:01:56.940> nozzle<00:01:57.360> on

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
these cans that have a little nozzle on

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.740 
these cans that have a little nozzle on
the<00:01:57.929> little<00:01:58.140> hose<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.940> goes<00:02:00.000> down<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the little hose that goes down to a

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.790 
the little hose that goes down to a
little<00:02:01.649> pin<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.569> actually<00:02:03.750> push<00:02:04.530> into

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
little pin that you actually push into

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.100 
little pin that you actually push into
the<00:02:04.979> tatami<00:02:05.489> so<00:02:05.849> it<00:02:05.910> gets<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.330> nozzle<00:02:06.720> down

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the tatami so it gets the nozzle down

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.259 
the tatami so it gets the nozzle down
inside<00:02:07.769> the<00:02:08.009> tatami<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.729> then<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.970> squeeze

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
inside the tatami and then you squeeze

inside the tatami and then you squeeze
the<00:02:09.479> pressure<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.259> actually<00:02:10.709> blows<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
the pressure can it actually blows the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.339 
the pressure can it actually blows the

insecticide into the middle of the

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.250 
insecticide into the middle of the
tatami<00:02:14.629> so<00:02:15.629> that's<00:02:15.780> something<00:02:16.019> a<00:02:16.170> bit

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
tatami so that's something a bit

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.660 
tatami so that's something a bit
