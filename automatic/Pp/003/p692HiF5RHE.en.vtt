00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.839
 that's what I forgot about you 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.280
 to say is that still especially 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.250
 important is when you do 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.400
 the airless you are going to have the tendency 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.710
 before life be it first time 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.480
 so it's not necessary because you 're going 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.420
 load the walls in paint sent there 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.730
 we always see the bands they are 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.230
 it must be homogeneous but 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.740
 for that you have to behave as I do 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.540
 said gun away and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.230
 pass is a day at the same speed 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.180
 others came across it changes 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.480
 nothing contrary to 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.340
 will focus on his video so always 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.590
 the same distance like that there is no 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.489
 sweat and pc do not try to charge 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.460
 and at one time because if you do 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.800
 that the painting is not going the time to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.449
 to dry too much paint that will make you 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.640
 drips and drips once 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.190
 they are made in thickness 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.899
 it means you have to rethink you have to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.720
 Iron paint running behind 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.860
 Finally, the result sounds rather makes 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.619
 on one you make a voice the impression does not 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.509
 so does the impression it serves to block 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.540
 the flows it will avoid once that 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.950
 it's done it's done but we see 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.200
 still a little bit the bench but that's 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.619
 do not mind that once we're going to do 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.409
 pass 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.810
 we will not see them a fake and steve have to 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.710
 pay attention to your hose when you 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.790
 move in the rooms only there 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.329
 it's a bit like the karcher 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.329
 bad to maneuver 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.689
 it happens sometimes you'll stick 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.729
 on the walls so that's paris it's 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.250
 not very funny and it's like they do 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.370
 you do not scrub to do well 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.890
 watch out for that otherwise age response etc etc 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:59.080
 well here is pias is almost completely 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.090
 weak remains so the placement the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.260
 last word I'm doing ceiling I'm going out ten 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.930
 minutes and after I can return 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.960
 quiet in the room to walk again 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.140
 easily and it's also more breathing 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.490
 that's good luck if you do that 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.490
 bravo m good day
