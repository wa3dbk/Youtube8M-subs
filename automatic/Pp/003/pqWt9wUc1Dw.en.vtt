00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.830 
different tripod mounting holes here so
I'm<00:03:07.000> going<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.150> use<00:03:07.300> this<00:03:07.420> one<00:03:07.540> because<00:03:07.720> it

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
I'm going to use this one because it

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.310 
I'm going to use this one because it
centers<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.350> audio<00:03:09.070> mixer<00:03:10.080> right<00:03:11.080> on<00:03:11.200> the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
bottom of the camera okay here we go

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.520 
bottom of the camera okay here we go
and<00:03:14.459> so<00:03:15.459> I'm<00:03:16.150> going<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.420> mount<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.959> with<00:03:17.110> the

to<00:05:12.150> do<00:05:12.330> now<00:05:12.509> is<00:05:12.539> to<00:05:12.870> make<00:05:12.990> some<00:05:13.289> cable

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
to do now is to make some cable

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.950 
to do now is to make some cable
connections<00:05:14.490> so<00:05:15.150> we're<00:05:15.449> going<00:05:15.599> to<00:05:15.660> put<00:05:15.870> the

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
connections so we're going to put the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.930 
connections so we're going to put the
XLR<00:05:16.349> cable<00:05:16.740> into<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.009> rode<00:05:17.220> videomic<00:05:17.550> right

here<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:22.860> other<00:05:22.949> end<00:05:23.190> of<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.340> cable<00:05:23.520> goes

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
here and the other end of the cable goes

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.969 
here and the other end of the cable goes
into<00:05:24.449> channel<00:05:24.870> 1<00:05:25.020> of<00:05:25.199> the<00:05:25.349> juice<00:05:25.560> link<00:05:25.770> box

into channel 1 of the juice link box
right<00:05:26.220> here<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:27.320> then<00:05:28.320> we<00:05:28.470> got<00:05:28.590> one<00:05:28.620> more

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
right here and then we got one more

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.640 
right here and then we got one more
cable<00:05:29.280> connection<00:05:30.260> this<00:05:31.260> will<00:05:31.409> be<00:05:31.500> the
