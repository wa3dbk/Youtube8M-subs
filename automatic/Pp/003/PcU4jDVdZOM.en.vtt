why have they deceived while racing it's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.389 
why have they deceived while racing it's
cheaper<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.960> mass-produce<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.770> stuff<00:00:44.070> which

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
cheaper to mass-produce this stuff which

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.510 
cheaper to mass-produce this stuff which
is<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.750> horseradish<00:00:45.750> mustard<00:00:46.260> seed<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
is just horseradish mustard seed and a

numbers<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:50.010> make<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.309> green<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
numbers that make it green that it is to

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.600 
numbers that make it green that it is to
actually<00:00:52.170> make<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.829> real<00:00:52.980> stuff<00:00:53.250> which<00:00:53.430> is

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
actually make the real stuff which is

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.600 
actually make the real stuff which is
this<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:54.120> what's<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.960> B<00:00:55.020> wood<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:56.190> takes<00:00:56.460> about

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
this here what's a B wood it takes about

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.750 
this here what's a B wood it takes about
2<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.239> 3<00:00:57.570> years<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> grow<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.039> it's

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
2 to 3 years to grow like this and it's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.549 
2 to 3 years to grow like this and it's
very<00:00:59.879> very<00:01:00.180> specific<00:01:00.480> growing<00:01:00.960> conditions<00:01:01.440> it

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
very very specific growing conditions it

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.770 
very very specific growing conditions it
needs<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.609> riverbed<00:01:02.969> basically<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
needs to be in a riverbed basically and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.350 
needs to be in a riverbed basically and
with<00:01:04.769> an<00:01:04.860> overhead<00:01:05.189> canopy<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.850> trees<00:01:05.880> which

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
with an overhead canopy of trees which

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.550 
with an overhead canopy of trees which
you<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.689> make<00:01:07.640> but<00:01:09.049> essentially<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.229> very

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
you can make but essentially it's very

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.620 
you can make but essentially it's very
difficult<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.369> long<00:01:11.729> time<00:01:12.030> period<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> grow

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
difficult at a long time period to grow

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
difficult at a long time period to grow
so<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.260> costs<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.340> lot<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.610> money<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:15.030> many

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
so it costs a lot of money not many

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.969 
so it costs a lot of money not many
people<00:01:15.360> do<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.140> rare<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.770> get

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
people do it so it's very rare to get

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.320 
people do it so it's very rare to get
large<00:01:17.850> quantities<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.689> stuff<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:20.119> thus<00:01:21.119> it's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
large quantities of stuff and thus it's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.859 
large quantities of stuff and thus it's
expensive<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.770> cheap<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:24.030> when

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
expensive and this is cheap so when

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:25.969 
expensive and this is cheap so when
you're<00:01:24.960> talking<00:01:25.140> about<00:01:25.229> proper<00:01:25.470> margins

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
you're talking about proper margins

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
you're talking about proper margins
they'll<00:01:26.189> give<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> cheap<00:01:26.700> stuff<00:01:27.140> instead

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
they'll give you the cheap stuff instead

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
they'll give you the cheap stuff instead
of<00:01:28.200> giving<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> expensive<00:01:28.920> stuff<00:01:29.180> ok<00:01:30.180> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
of giving you the expensive stuff ok so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
of giving you the expensive stuff ok so
what's<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> difference<00:01:30.960> between<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
what's the difference between this the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.429 
what's the difference between this the
fake<00:01:32.729> wasabi<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.689> real<00:01:33.869> wasabi

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
fake wasabi and the real wasabi

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.200 
fake wasabi and the real wasabi
well<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.250> fake<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> don't<00:01:35.850> need<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> tell

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
well the fake one I don't need to tell

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.520 
well the fake one I don't need to tell
you<00:01:36.270> when<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.720> take<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> bit<00:01:37.259> too<00:01:37.380> much

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
you when you take a bit too much

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.230 
you when you take a bit too much
suddenly<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.189> feel<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.610> your<00:01:38.790> nose<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.150> on

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
suddenly you feel like your nose is on

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.840 
suddenly you feel like your nose is on
fire<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.960> your<00:01:40.409> mouth<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.890> burning<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
fire and your mouth is burning up and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
you get cold sweats from the heat that's

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.929 
you get cold sweats from the heat that's
not<00:01:44.880> meant<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> happen<00:01:46.189> real<00:01:47.189> wasabi<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.909> a

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
not meant to happen real wasabi is a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.750 
not meant to happen real wasabi is a
much<00:01:48.149> more<00:01:48.329> delicate

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
much more delicate

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.820 
much more delicate
it's<00:01:50.150> made<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.479> go<00:01:50.810> with<00:01:50.990> fish<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:51.320> feels<00:01:51.590> like

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
it's made to go with fish it feels like

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.500 
it's made to go with fish it feels like
it's<00:01:52.010> natural<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.490> compare<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.180> two<00:01:53.210> together

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
it's natural to compare the two together

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.670 
it's natural to compare the two together
and<00:01:54.040> it's<00:01:55.040> got<00:01:55.330> slight<00:01:56.330> Palomas<00:01:57.080> over<00:01:57.470> this

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
and it's got slight Palomas over this

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.899 
and it's got slight Palomas over this
undescribable<00:01:58.220> bit<00:01:58.460> earthy<00:01:58.990> wasabi<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.909> can't

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
undescribable bit earthy wasabi I can't

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.090 
undescribable bit earthy wasabi I can't
say<00:02:02.240> exactly<00:02:02.450> how<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.290> is<00:02:03.409> you've<00:02:03.619> got<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:03.890> try

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
say exactly how it is you've got to try

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.570 
say exactly how it is you've got to try
it<00:02:04.130> but<00:02:04.490> it's<00:02:05.180> great<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:06.890> highly<00:02:07.100> recommend

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
it but it's great and I highly recommend

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.699 
it but it's great and I highly recommend
it<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:09.200> how<00:02:09.739> do<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:10.190> make<00:02:10.789> wasabi<00:02:11.350> have<00:02:12.350> root

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
it so how do you make wasabi have root

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.100 
it so how do you make wasabi have root
well<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.340> use<00:02:13.489> one<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.670> these<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:14.110> sharkskin

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
well you use one of these a sharkskin

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.680 
well you use one of these a sharkskin
grater<00:02:15.250> now<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.310> can't<00:02:16.580> use<00:02:16.670> ceramic<00:02:17.090> raters

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
grater now you can't use ceramic raters

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.229 
grater now you can't use ceramic raters
or<00:02:17.959> metal<00:02:18.350> graders<00:02:18.739> but<00:02:19.040> if<00:02:19.700> you're<00:02:19.850> going<00:02:20.030> out

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
or metal graders but if you're going out

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.580 
or metal graders but if you're going out
and<00:02:20.420> getting<00:02:20.600> this<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.140> going<00:02:21.350> through<00:02:21.530> all

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
and getting this and going through all

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.740 
and getting this and going through all
your<00:02:21.650> effort<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.340> finding<00:02:22.790> this<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.330> applying

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
your effort of finding this and applying

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.140 
your effort of finding this and applying
it<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.200> getting<00:02:25.070> it<00:02:25.220> shipped<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.670> you

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
it and getting it shipped to you you

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.780 
it and getting it shipped to you you
might<00:02:26.330> have<00:02:26.450> also<00:02:26.600> ship<00:02:26.930> one<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.140> these<00:02:27.260> and

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
might have also ship one of these and

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.370 
might have also ship one of these and
then<00:02:28.790> these<00:02:29.000> do<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.239> traditional<00:02:29.720> way<00:02:29.810> all

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380
