do is operate it by simply opening and
closing<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> valve<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> switch<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.610> we

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
closing the valve with a switch and we

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.430 
closing the valve with a switch and we
can<00:00:56.910> locate<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.420> switch<00:00:57.660> anywhere<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.230> want

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
can locate that switch anywhere we want

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
can locate that switch anywhere we want
to<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.680> code<00:00:58.859> anywhere<00:00:59.250> that's

campground<00:01:32.159> right<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.030> with<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.540> place

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
campground right so with that in place

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.060 
campground right so with that in place
I'm<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.200> remove<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> make<00:01:34.979> it

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
I'm going to remove this to make it

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.640 
I'm going to remove this to make it
easier<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.700> hole<00:01:35.850> develop<00:01:36.500> what<00:01:37.500> you

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
easier to the hole develop what you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.230 
easier to the hole develop what you
normally<00:01:38.070> would<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.460> would<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.090> install

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
normally would do would be to install

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.450 
normally would do would be to install
this<00:01:39.689> valve<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:40.259> close<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.740> possible<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
this valve as close as possible to the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.609 
this valve as close as possible to the
tank<00:01:41.729> itself<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.840> permanently<00:01:43.290> mounted

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
tank itself it's a permanently mounted

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.590 
tank itself it's a permanently mounted
device<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.280> basically<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.060> want<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.270> try<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
device and basically you want to try and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.510 
device and basically you want to try and
mount<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.020> close<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.530> tank<00:01:46.799> outlet<00:01:47.310> as

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
mount it as close to the tank outlet as

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.700 
mount it as close to the tank outlet as
possible<00:01:48.119> yeah<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.780> real<00:01:48.990> installation<00:01:49.560> we

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
possible yeah in a real installation we

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
possible yeah in a real installation we
would<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.950> course<00:01:49.979> put<00:01:50.430> sealant<00:01:50.939> around<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
would of course put sealant around the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.170 
would of course put sealant around the
termination<00:01:52.770> outlet<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.640> valve<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.030> keep

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
termination outlet of the valve to keep

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.760 
termination outlet of the valve to keep
it<00:01:54.299> from<00:01:54.450> dripping<00:01:54.630> water<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.560> use<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
it from dripping water you just use a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.859 
it from dripping water you just use a
simple<00:01:55.979> hose<00:01:56.280> clamp<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.790> clamp<00:01:57.119> clamp<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.719> down

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
simple hose clamp to clamp clamp it down

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.660 
simple hose clamp to clamp clamp it down
in<00:01:58.020> place<00:01:58.049> yeah<00:01:58.860> now<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.219> nice<00:01:59.430> thing<00:01:59.640> about

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
in place yeah now the nice thing about

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.100 
in place yeah now the nice thing about
this<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.149> once<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.509> hose<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.930> connected

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
this is once the hose is connected

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.080 
this is once the hose is connected
you're<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> campground<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.490> you're

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
you're in the campground and you're

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.270 
you're in the campground and you're
monitoring<00:02:03.630> your<00:02:03.689> fluid<00:02:04.409> level<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> waste

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
monitoring your fluid level of the waste

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.700 
monitoring your fluid level of the waste
tank<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.909> when<00:02:06.689> it's<00:02:06.810> time<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.200> dump<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.530> tank

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
tank and when it's time to dump the tank

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.139 
tank and when it's time to dump the tank
