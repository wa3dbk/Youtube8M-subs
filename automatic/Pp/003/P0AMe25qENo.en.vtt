00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the case to the motherboard then place

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
the case to the motherboard then place
it<00:01:06.180> back<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> computer<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.320> slide<00:01:07.860> it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
it back on the computer and slide it

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.380 
it back on the computer and slide it
back<00:01:13.010> now<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.340> plug<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> power<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
back now you can plug in the power and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.870 
back now you can plug in the power and
the<00:01:15.689> SATA<00:01:15.930> cable<00:01:16.350> into<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.710> DVD<00:01:16.979> drive<00:01:17.490> and

the SATA cable into the DVD drive and
the<00:01:18.180> hard<00:01:18.390> drive<00:01:19.310> then<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.670> put<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> front

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the hard drive then we can put the front

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.260 
the hard drive then we can put the front
basil<00:01:21.689> back<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> case
