salbo<00:00:00.570> will<00:00:00.840> be<00:00:00.930> wondering<00:00:01.199> what's<00:00:01.560> going<00:00:01.829> on

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
salbo will be wondering what's going on

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.340 
salbo will be wondering what's going on
with<00:00:02.220> Kamui<00:00:02.520> Kobayashi<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:03.330> good<00:00:03.810> step<00:00:04.080> forward

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
with Kamui Kobayashi a good step forward

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.140 
with Kamui Kobayashi a good step forward
for<00:00:04.560> them<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.310> last<00:00:05.490> race<00:00:05.700> but<00:00:05.940> he<00:00:06.000> looked

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
for them in the last race but he looked

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.249 
for them in the last race but he looked
like<00:00:06.180> he<00:00:06.330> really<00:00:06.480> struggled<00:00:06.899> out<00:00:06.930> there<00:00:07.109> today

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
like he really struggled out there today

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.169 
like he really struggled out there today
yeah<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.040> think<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:08.580> we're<00:00:08.730> seeing<00:00:08.940> as

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
yeah I think that what we're seeing as

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.730 
yeah I think that what we're seeing as
just<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.840> natural<00:00:10.290> ebb<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.559> flow<00:00:10.710> of

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
just that the natural ebb and flow of

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.490 
just that the natural ebb and flow of
racing<00:00:11.639> as<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:11.849> join<00:00:12.000> him<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.210> board<00:00:12.389> here<00:00:12.630> down

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
racing as we join him on board here down

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.049 
racing as we join him on board here down
into<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.889> break<00:00:14.070> ins<00:00:14.219> went<00:00:14.370> into<00:00:14.519> turn<00:00:14.639> one<00:00:14.880> he

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
into the break ins went into turn one he

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.670 
into the break ins went into turn one he
could<00:00:15.210> get<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> front<00:00:15.929> wheel<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.199> Carib

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
could get a front wheel on that Carib

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.290 
could get a front wheel on that Carib
and<00:00:16.770> he<00:00:16.830> was<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> little<00:00:17.310> bit<00:00:17.550> wider<00:00:17.880> than<00:00:18.210> you

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and he was a little bit wider than you

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.000 
and he was a little bit wider than you
should<00:00:18.359> really<00:00:18.660> be<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:18.810> again<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.260> ton<00:00:19.470> -<00:00:19.650> you've

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
should really be in again a ton - you've

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.859 
should really be in again a ton - you've
got<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.220> get<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> lot<00:00:20.640> closer<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.270> care<00:00:21.480> so

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
got to get a lot closer to that care so

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.689 
got to get a lot closer to that care so
whether<00:00:22.380> that's<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.680> inexperience<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
whether that's just inexperience on the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.700 
whether that's just inexperience on the
track<00:00:23.910> or<00:00:24.210> something<00:00:24.960> -<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.199> characteristic

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
of the car again is going to be a bit of

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.640 
of the car again is going to be a bit of

mean that takes you down to the hairpin
looks<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.289> who's<00:00:55.440> struggling<00:00:55.800> with

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
the reality is you know it wasn't a bad

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.350 
the reality is you know it wasn't a bad
luck<00:01:46.830> David<00:01:47.130> really<00:01:47.520> was<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.060> shows<00:01:48.330> you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
luck David really was it just shows you

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.240 
luck David really was it just shows you
that<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:49.170> these<00:01:49.500> guys<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.980> pushing

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
that you know these guys are pushing

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.310 
that you know these guys are pushing
really<00:01:50.610> hard<00:01:50.760> all<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.480> way<00:01:51.510> through<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.140> yes

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
really hard all the way through and yes

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.500 
really hard all the way through and yes
he<00:01:52.440> didn't<00:01:52.710> make<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:54.000> not<00:01:54.150> just<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
he didn't make it so it's not just a

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.450 
he didn't make it so it's not just a
given<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.960> future<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:56.070> going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.369> be

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
given in future that is just going to be

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.190 
given in future that is just going to be
the<00:01:56.610> three<00:01:56.850> new<00:01:57.300> teams<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.780> are<00:01:57.900> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.080> be

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the three new teams that are going to be

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.840 
the three new teams that are going to be
propping<00:01:58.530> up<00:01:58.650> the<00:01:58.770> rear<00:01:59.010> I<00:01:59.190> think<00:01:59.700> they're

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
propping up the rear I think they're

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.060 
propping up the rear I think they're
going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.090> slowly<00:02:00.990> emerge<00:02:01.440> into<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> back<00:02:02.040> of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
going to slowly emerge into the back of

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.370 
going to slowly emerge into the back of
these<00:02:02.310> other<00:02:02.550> cars<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.510> so<00:02:03.840> everyone<00:02:04.229> has<00:02:04.350> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
these other cars and so everyone has to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.200 
these other cars and so everyone has to
watch<00:02:04.650> their<00:02:04.860> mirror<00:02:05.130> well<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.880> think<00:02:05.940> what's

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
watch their mirror well I think what's

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.460 
watch their mirror well I think what's
interesting<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.810> they're<00:02:07.170> obviously

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
interesting is that they're obviously

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.109 
interesting is that they're obviously
this<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.740> high-speed<00:02:08.220> track<00:02:08.520> they<00:02:08.790> do<00:02:08.910> have

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
this is a high-speed track they do have

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.669 
this is a high-speed track they do have
to<00:02:09.240> change<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.600> arrow<00:02:09.750> performance<00:02:10.320> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
to change the arrow performance the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.170 
to change the arrow performance the
probably<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:10.979> bigger<00:02:11.250> brake<00:02:11.580> ducts<00:02:11.820> as<00:02:12.030> well

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
probably one bigger brake ducts as well

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.580 
probably one bigger brake ducts as well
because<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.630> all<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.840> extra<00:02:13.050> energy<00:02:13.260> that's

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
because of all that extra energy that's

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.110 
because of all that extra energy that's
going<00:02:13.860> into<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.190> car<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.060> this

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
going into the car and all of this

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.940 
going into the car and all of this
affects<00:02:15.450> your<00:02:15.540> aerodynamics<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.350> what<00:02:16.709> we<00:02:16.830> saw

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
affects your aerodynamics so what we saw

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.590 
affects your aerodynamics so what we saw
in<00:02:17.070> Turkey<00:02:17.370> two<00:02:17.520> weeks<00:02:17.700> ago<00:02:17.910> they<00:02:18.150> put<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.510> a

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
in Turkey two weeks ago they put in a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.060 
in Turkey two weeks ago they put in a
great<00:02:18.810> performance<00:02:18.840> he<00:02:19.380> was<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.680> top<00:02:19.860> ten

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
great performance he was in the top ten

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.130 
great performance he was in the top ten
here<00:02:21.060> they're<00:02:21.450> back<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.750> where<00:02:21.840> they've<00:02:22.020> been

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
here they're back to where they've been

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.020 
here they're back to where they've been
in<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.410> previous<00:02:22.590> six<00:02:23.190> races<00:02:23.400> before<00:02:23.850> that

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
in the previous six races before that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.460 
in the previous six races before that
and<00:02:24.300> that's<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.660> not<00:02:24.750> good<00:02:24.930> enough<00:02:24.959> or<00:02:25.200> sober

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
and that's just not good enough or sober

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.700 
and that's just not good enough or sober
if<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:26.040> look<00:02:26.190> at<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> end<00:02:26.550> of
