and<00:00:08.570> today<00:00:09.570> we're<00:00:09.870> going<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.170> be<00:00:10.320> drawing<00:00:10.680> a

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
and today we're going to be drawing a

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.070 
and today we're going to be drawing a
Spinosaurus

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
Spinosaurus

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.840 
Spinosaurus
they<00:00:13.469> can't<00:00:13.740> know<00:00:13.800> do<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.010> few<00:00:14.250> versions<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.760> the

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
they can't know do a few versions of the

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.370 
they can't know do a few versions of the
Spinosaurus<00:00:15.510> first<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.900> all<00:00:15.990> we're<00:00:16.110> going<00:00:16.230> to

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.380 
Spinosaurus first of all we're going to

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.960 
Spinosaurus first of all we're going to
do<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:17.040> fairly<00:00:17.520> easy<00:00:17.880> basic<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.849> here<00:00:20.849> we

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
do a fairly easy basic one and here we

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.290 
do a fairly easy basic one and here we
go<00:00:21.210> what<00:00:21.480> we're<00:00:21.599> going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.930> do<00:00:22.200> is<00:00:23.270> we're<00:00:24.270> going

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
go what we're going to do is we're going

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.170 
go what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:00:24.720> very<00:00:25.410> very<00:00:25.680> lightly<00:00:25.950> just<00:00:26.310> barely<00:00:26.640> touch

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
to very very lightly just barely touch

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.249 
to very very lightly just barely touch
the<00:00:27.210> paper<00:00:27.630> oh<00:00:29.270> no<00:00:30.270> do<00:00:30.419> it<00:00:30.540> bit<00:00:30.689> harder<00:00:31.079> so<00:00:31.230> you

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
the paper oh no do it bit harder so you

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.920 
the paper oh no do it bit harder so you
can<00:00:31.439> sort<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.680> see<00:00:32.000> round<00:00:33.000> circle<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:33.720> is

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
can sort of see round circle here is

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.610 
can sort of see round circle here is
where<00:00:34.200> e-zine<00:00:35.149> ridges<00:00:36.149> are<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> be

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
where e-zine ridges are going to be

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.790 
where e-zine ridges are going to be
we're<00:00:37.620> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.920> put<00:00:38.610> out<00:00:38.880> a<00:00:41.360> bit<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.510> this

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
we're going to put out a bit like this

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.580 
we're going to put out a bit like this
we're<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.070> do<00:00:45.170> like<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> half<00:00:46.560> circle

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
we're going to do like a half circle

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.690 
we're going to do like a half circle
here

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
here

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.180 
here
I<00:00:49.010> do<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.280> another<00:00:50.430> half<00:00:50.850> circle<00:00:51.390> there<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:52.190> go

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
I do like another half circle there I go

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.470 
I do like another half circle there I go
from<00:00:53.370> there<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.580> there

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
from there to there

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.640 
from there to there

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
lot at that angle well at that angle and

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.620 
lot at that angle well at that angle and
we're<00:01:03.630> going<00:01:03.810> to<00:01:03.900> do<00:01:04.700> ever<00:01:05.700> good<00:01:06.060> they're<00:01:06.479> like

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.069 
we're going to do ever good they're like
a<00:01:06.750> bracket<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> same<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.810> I've<00:01:09.900> done

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
a bracket and the same here so I've done

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:11.990 
a bracket and the same here so I've done
it's<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.530> lot<00:01:10.950> darker<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.850> to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it's a lot darker then you have to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.959 
it's a lot darker then you have to
evened<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.390> very<00:01:12.780> very<00:01:12.840> gentle<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.819> now<00:01:14.819> we're

evened up very very gentle and now we're

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:17.660 
evened up very very gentle and now we're
gonna<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> few<00:01:15.479> modifications<00:01:16.579> sort<00:01:17.579> of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
gonna do a few modifications sort of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.130 
gonna do a few modifications sort of
like<00:01:17.850> carving<00:01:18.719> away<00:01:18.840> something<00:01:19.409> here<00:01:20.119> now

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
like carving away something here now

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.849 
like carving away something here now
we're<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:23.689> just<00:01:24.689> emphasize<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.409> bit

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
we're going to just emphasize that bit

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.179 
we're going to just emphasize that bit
there<00:01:26.749> here<00:01:27.749> we're<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.139> to<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.469> like<00:01:29.069> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
there here we're going to do like a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.719 
there here we're going to do like a
curved<00:01:29.460> line<00:01:29.490> here<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.869> bracket<00:01:31.549> if<00:01:32.549> you

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
curved line here like a bracket if you

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.480 
curved line here like a bracket if you
need<00:01:32.880> brackets<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.389> can<00:01:33.539> do<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:34.369> there<00:01:35.369> we

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
need brackets you can do this there we

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.239 
need brackets you can do this there we
are<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.359> the<00:01:36.569> other<00:01:36.600> way<00:01:37.069> so<00:01:38.069> the<00:01:38.130> way

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
are do it going the other way so the way

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:39.980 
are do it going the other way so the way
this<00:01:38.459> comes<00:01:38.759> around<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.389> it's<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.749> to<00:01:39.810> go

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
this comes around here it's going to go

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.800 
this comes around here it's going to go
up<00:01:40.139> here<00:01:40.469> and<00:01:42.920> do<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.280> gonna<00:01:44.520> -<00:01:44.789> it's<00:01:45.600> got<00:01:45.780> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
up here and do that's gonna - it's got a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.149 
up here and do that's gonna - it's got a
bit<00:01:45.959> there<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:48.630> was<00:01:48.749> starting<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.319> get<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.039> bit

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
bit there that was starting to get a bit

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.969 
bit there that was starting to get a bit
more<00:01:50.310> shapes<00:01:50.789> for<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.959> so<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> letter

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
more shapes for here so like a letter

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.289 
more shapes for here so like a letter
use<00:01:53.249> of<00:01:53.670> upside<00:01:54.299> down<00:01:54.569> lean<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.990> one<00:01:55.020> side<00:01:56.299> but

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
use of upside down lean to one side but

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.629 
use of upside down lean to one side but
that<00:01:57.479> Ridge<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:58.100> we're<00:01:59.100> gonna<00:01:59.279> do<00:01:59.369> another

00:01:59.629 --> 00:01:59.639 
that Ridge there we're gonna do another

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:03.580 
that Ridge there we're gonna do another
upside<00:02:00.600> down<00:02:00.810> later<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.259> there

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
upside down later you there

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.020 
upside down later you there
going<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:04.009> do<00:02:04.159> bracket<00:02:04.729> here<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.450> we<00:02:06.289> start<00:02:06.560> to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
going to do bracket here and we start to

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:16.210 
going to do bracket here and we start to
make<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.209> shape<00:02:08.420> of<00:02:08.450> him<00:02:13.599> big<00:02:15.010> curvy<00:02:16.010> line

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
make the shape of him big curvy line

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.820 
make the shape of him big curvy line
here<00:02:18.370> yeah<00:02:19.370> here<00:02:20.120> let's<00:02:20.629> just<00:02:20.720> do<00:02:21.319> that<00:02:21.379> right

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
here yeah here let's just do that right

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.339 
here yeah here let's just do that right
here<00:02:22.450> that's<00:02:23.450> where<00:02:23.599> he's<00:02:23.780> always<00:02:23.989> going<00:02:24.290> to

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
here that's where he's always going to

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.820 
here that's where he's always going to
be<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.860> we're<00:02:24.980> going<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:26.379> shape<00:02:27.379> that<00:02:27.680> in

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
be and we're going to shape that in

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.729 
be and we're going to shape that in
there<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.069> bit<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:29.200> make<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.349> guy<00:02:30.530> like

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
there a bit and make that guy like

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:38.589 
there a bit and make that guy like
therapies<00:02:36.519> here<00:02:37.519> we've<00:02:37.760> got<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:38.000> bunch<00:02:38.390> of

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
therapies here we've got a bunch of

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:45.990 
therapies here we've got a bunch of
upside<00:02:39.230> down<00:02:39.260> letter<00:02:39.739> use<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:44.420> sort<00:02:45.019> of

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
upside down letter use and sort of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.220 
upside down letter use and sort of
smaller<00:02:47.000> half<00:02:47.840> circles<00:02:52.720> here<00:02:53.720> we're<00:02:54.110> gonna

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
smaller half circles here we're gonna

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.670 
smaller half circles here we're gonna
have<00:02:54.319> an<00:02:54.650> eye<00:02:54.769> so<00:02:55.370> let's<00:02:55.579> just<00:02:55.760> do<00:02:56.470> like<00:02:57.470> a

letter<00:02:58.310> O<00:02:58.400> squash<00:02:58.849> down<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.150> bit<00:02:59.450> okay<00:03:01.480> we'll

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
letter O squash down a bit okay we'll

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.030 
letter O squash down a bit okay we'll
have<00:03:02.690> me<00:03:02.840> in<00:03:02.930> there<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.900> I'm<00:03:06.079> just<00:03:06.110> go<00:03:06.379> around

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
have me in there and I'm just go around

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.390 
have me in there and I'm just go around
so<00:03:07.430> coloring<00:03:07.970> lightly<00:03:09.190> around<00:03:10.190> there<00:03:10.370> like

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
so coloring lightly around there like

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.690 
so coloring lightly around there like
that<00:03:13.750> I'm<00:03:14.750> getting<00:03:14.959> carried<00:03:15.260> away<00:03:15.350> now<00:03:15.700> under

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
that I'm getting carried away now under

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.140 
that I'm getting carried away now under
here<00:03:16.940> more<00:03:17.120> brackets<00:03:17.980> up<00:03:18.980> there<00:03:19.430> ball

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
here more brackets up there ball

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.860 
here more brackets up there ball
brackets<00:03:21.459> this<00:03:22.459> put<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.000> little<00:03:23.030> slit<00:03:23.480> there

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.670 

here<00:03:27.609> so<00:03:28.609> a<00:03:28.639> flattened<00:03:29.269> oval<00:03:29.389> there<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.260> there

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
here so a flattened oval there and there

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.190 
here so a flattened oval there and there
where<00:03:31.099> the<00:03:31.190> nose<00:03:31.459> is<00:03:31.489> going<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.090> be<00:03:34.540> hell<00:03:35.540> I'll

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
where the nose is going to be hell I'll

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.699 
where the nose is going to be hell I'll
put<00:03:36.410> some<00:03:36.560> details<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.340> here<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:37.989> think<00:03:38.989> we<00:03:39.530> can

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
put some details in here I think we can

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:46.760 
put some details in here I think we can
make<00:03:39.919> this<00:03:40.329> hair<00:03:41.329> stronger

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.430 

so<00:03:47.770> always<00:03:47.980> with<00:03:48.970> these<00:03:49.210> don't<00:03:50.020> wanna<00:03:50.200> sit

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
so always with these don't wanna sit

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.470 
so always with these don't wanna sit
down<00:03:50.590> underneath<00:03:50.920> like<00:03:51.280> this<00:03:51.520> line<00:03:51.760> here<00:03:52.180> can

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
down underneath like this line here can

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.260 
down underneath like this line here can
make<00:03:52.600> that<00:03:52.840> stronger<00:03:54.540> vodka<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.090> lot<00:03:58.240> of

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
make that stronger vodka and a lot of

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.420 
make that stronger vodka and a lot of
