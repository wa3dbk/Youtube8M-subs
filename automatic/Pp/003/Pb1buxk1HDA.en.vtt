 oh yeah it makes montages like that 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.670
 now you have to be like that 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.219
 thought to have understood what a 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.490
 cruise but you did not guess so 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.259
 the reiterated semoy that first needs to be 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.660
 know that there are two types of 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:15.400
 cruises that of lopez and that of 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.810
 big companies I imagine you 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.130
 have surely understood what kind of 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.340
 cruise I was going to talk in this 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.340
 video 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:35.260
 hello me I said the mouth for his 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.670
 from the boat a thousand faux Latin 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.930
 home vista he is often associated with 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.579
 some clichÃ©s apparently the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.440
 cruises would be appreciated by more 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.370
 especially old ones so I'm going 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.370
 tell you the truth 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.170
 here 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.890
 m 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.330
 no no no too after a very 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.340
 different companies you have more or 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.190
 less spirit family mind 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.209
 meet the spirit excursions it's 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.830
 a lot of the mice that still 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.830
 and hold on speaking of mind 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.400
 Yes 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.840
 hi charlie ayobi 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.840
 hey hey 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.150
 oh damn obviously the purpose of a 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.370
 cruise is to have fun help and 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.780
 enjoy life without forgetting 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.750
 spend a maximum of money 20 euros 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.130
 ooh there and it's three months I want 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.200
 that the file then huh because 20 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.860
 euros the picture is that these orders 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.720
 30 euros in currency files 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.180
 and I'm just exaggerating 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.290
 especially if you buy ten pictures on 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.520
 will say that you are waiting for 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.840
 price of the camera itself 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.600
 the worst is that they come to take you 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.590
 every night in photo do not type a 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.940
 only moment of respite 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.940
 there are you gave me you just want to 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:10.350
 to release books and that's enough I'm 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.980
 am going to 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.890
 a baby 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.990
 and m 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.459
 otherwise it's obviously waou in a 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.140
 cruise am also the excursions 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.250
 so apart from that you have to get up to 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.510
 6 o'clock in the morning to be able to do 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.290
 one you can do it in two ways 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.490
 different 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.110
 you did it at the warner games where you 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.220
 chose to leave with the company so 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.510
 if you want is to leave with the 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.170
 company he'll have to go out again 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.250
 wallet 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.419
 me what I advise you if you 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.960
 have better you do not find and abuse 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.010
 attack if an airplane 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.510
 oh yes it's true I just got it from you 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.510
 tell the boat if they want to respect 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.400
 not the schedules and ben he gets rid of 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.870
 1 go start is that you believe the boat 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.590
 it's going to have fallen down or you're going to 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.160
 find and so on but in fact not the 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.180
 all good besides at the beginning of the stay 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.490
 I had made myself Spanish poets 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.730
 were very nice I never 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.020
 reviewed 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.270
 there was also respect at the beginning of the 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.620
 stay a bridge but unfortunately I 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.060
 nothing else either and besides in 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.680
 this video either 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.000
 Sincerely it's cool I have more 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.410
 of things to tell you as much as you 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.060
 say that the video lasts and as many 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.620
 time that amount of listening to the album 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.570
 of big flo and oli that goes out so 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.040
 that of fire so if you ever 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.870
 have the opportunity to go on a cruise 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.810
