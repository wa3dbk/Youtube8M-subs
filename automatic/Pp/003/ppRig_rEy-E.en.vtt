00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello welcome to tata cat the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.350
 first course will be a very basic pure 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.660
 since we had just learned 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.580
 to mount stitches for this if you 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.710
 need a needle and a pallet 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.599
 from the aisne choose the one that you 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.779
 please anyway it's exactly the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.460
 method for all the wool takes a 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.010
 needle because we will go up on one 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.750
 and big and more and then with the wool 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.349
 we give ourselves a small margin 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.660
 that's the tail of the job we be 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.700
 long enough to climb 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.559
 some steps 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.500
 so we will start by making a knot 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.480
 sliding this will be our first mesh 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.870
 is too big to make it easy 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.610
 you turn your son that makes a 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.079
 loop you go get the thread in 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 face and you've created a loop 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.710
 I start this knowledge 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.980
 if you do not understand we turn the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.980
 wire 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.480
 we go inside the fingers to 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.750
 go get the finance and that's a 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.430
 sliding loop was created this 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.470
 loop this is your first mesh 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.910
 so you can put it on vegetables 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.860
 and tightened not too strong for her 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.220
 does not fall so by chance she had to 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.950
 fall 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.680
 no worries do not worry there 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.360
 Simply swell on vegetables with 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.950
 guts it's often like that and not 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.630
 need to worry just be 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.650
 patient 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.930
 here we will now be able to taste 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.119
 the meshs strictly speaking so there 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.780
 that work have soul and versoix and 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.509
 pelota 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.280
 we put it in the bottom with the thumb and 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.080
 the index we will pass between the two 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.229
 nets with the remaining three fingers 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.560
 we take the defines but there of one of the 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.110
 their 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:51.380
 and so we have the thumb that will create 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:54.710
 a son under tension here we go 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.690
 like that and we lift both fingers the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.789
 live wire it's there in crisis the 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.310
 inch we will look in the face the son who 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:05.509
 is on the index finger and the thumb loop 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.360
 pass over the eel tightens 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.440
 and that's a knit start 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.959
 caress the thumb 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.810
 we sell in the face looking for the son of 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:19.010
 the index finger and the thumb loop passes over 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:23.540
 the ego we insert and it created 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:29.659
 here I let you slowly study 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.849
 the gesture of the compounds the idea is 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.879
 always to do something 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.280
 similar to the voltage level 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:41.750
 do not worry if the readily 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.200
 bus it just comes in 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.200
 practicing 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.930
 so that's it if we lose his sons have 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.230
 redo their little thing to spend between 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.890
 the two sons catch all and we put the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.720
 palm up to see the girls 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.550
 put themselves in the population a 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.940
 carriage drives them to seek a net 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.650
 the loop goes over the 8th of July 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.060
 that after a while you go 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.060
 find it very easy 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.180
 that's what is done we've been for 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.200
 my you can now start 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.200
 your work
