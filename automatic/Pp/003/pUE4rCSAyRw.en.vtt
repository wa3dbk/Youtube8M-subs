00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hey and is welcome here too 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.580
 another video today we look 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.390
 us a special server workstation 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.069
 cdu on 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.790
 in this case it is the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.590
 intercity 526 30 whether this cpu really 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.240
 to the server and workstation area counts 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.130
 let's take a look at this video 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.900
 Also, of course, some test to this 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.699
 cpu but i would say before it 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.699
 go on there is the first intro 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.560
 at first glance we will have clear 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.060
 here an intel lga 2011 cpu im 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.860
 compared to classic desktop cpu 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.470
 here, too, clearly recognize it 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.320
 the form factor of the packaging is this 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.390
 at intel the 2011 cdu really much 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.670
 narrow relatively small in the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.180
 compared to classic desktop cpu of 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.559
 intel 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.170
 because of that we also have here 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.450
 no integrated solution included in the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.809
 Included in the scope of delivery is called us 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.640
 always need one at rtl 2011 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.960
 separate cooling in this case is 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.420
 so that not the intel boxed cooler 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.040
 Nonetheless we also have meant 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.449
 again classical information on the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.930
 packaging such as the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.080
 product names e5 26 30 of course the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.340
 matching socket lga2011 on the other 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.650
 side we see that this 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.990
 Packaging only the CPU internet 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.640
 including a three-year warranty 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.490
 and of course it will be here again 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.580
 marked that this cpu for the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.380
 lga 2011 socket is on the back 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.240
 Let's take another look 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.490
 small view window where we already the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.680
 single cpu can look into this 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.619
 case really relatively large in comparison 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.509
 to classic desktop cpu s such as ivy 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.670
 bridge or sandy bridge or has made 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.140
 cpu s if we have it all now 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.109
 we have unpacked here completely 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.259
 clear the minimalist cpu 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.700
 delivery 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.159
 as I said, it is one 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.810
 intelligent 2011 cpu and based on the 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.820
 packaging will be very clear we can 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.229
 not really much here 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.909
 or mitliefern accessories 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.890
 this is meanwhile the case with a cpu 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.469
 actually not that dramatic anymore 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.359
 means here is a ccp clock offered 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.609
 in this club instruction guide how 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.740
 we installed this cpu and of course 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.000
 more guarantees wise on the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.979
 Back of these little booklets 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.770
 is another intention sticker 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.960
 for your case for example though we 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.790
 have a relatively new cpu socket 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.740
 slumbers under the cdu still have 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.720
 a well-known the sandy bridge 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.420
 architecture in this case sandy bridge 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.400
 ep stands as well as a 32 here 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.050
 nanometer production at a maximum 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.910
 tdp of 95 watts 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.160
 typical of intel processor we have 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.110
 a high number of cpu core in this 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.970
 case are six of us came to the disposal 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.550
 and through the intel hyper threading 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.990
 technology is a total of twelve 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.540
 advised 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.689
 at a basic rate of 2.3 ghz 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.730
 and a maximum toko clocking of 2 8 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.920
 ghz that is really a very nice one 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.650
 and good combination which is also here 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.989
 means this cpu is faster than 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.799
 a classic desktop cpu like for 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.799
 example 39 70 iks in together stand us 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.329
 with this cpu 15 megabyte l3 cache to 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.700
 disposal and we have the here 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.739
 possibility several cpu it from this 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.969
 To combine art means we can 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.280
 For example, operate 25 26 30 in parallel 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:16.069
 which is otherwise not feasible with 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.439
 classic desktop cpu svi i7 i5 or i 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.150
 3, for example, the big advantage 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.489
 opposite a classic desktop cpu 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.930
 this is clearly the maximum 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.180
 Support of memory 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.000
 classic desktop cpu s support 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.579
 for example, a maximum of 32 gb 1 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.090
 interested in five processor 26 30 in 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.889
 this case 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.579
 he offers us the support for 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:40.220
 incredible 384 gb of course here too 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:44.180
 ddr3 at clearly a maximum stroke 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.310
 order of 1333 mhz with four memory channels 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.400
 and thus comes a maximum 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.540
 Memory bandwidth of 42 6 gigabit pro 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.400
 second 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.989
 nevertheless we have one 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.790
 classical indian processor have 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.040
 we also have the support for pci here 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.840
 express 3.0 cards or 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.000
 expansion cards so we have to too 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.280
 here no compromising over 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.229
 classic desktop cbs an important 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.780
 point here, too, with interest and cbs 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:10.760
 Here is the relatively high in this case 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.069
 heat development despite the sandy bridge 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.870
 architecture becomes relative through the whole 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.900
 was a very good cooling so here 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.570
 a prerequisite for the optimal 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.889
 functionality of this cpu last but not 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.669
 Let's have a look at what 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.229
 two of those 10 526 30 what's this cpu it 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.389
 in the end with benchmarks for 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.130
 results tell as always I test 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.840
 the whole thing by means of behind ben switzerland 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.909
 super pi I wanted the whole thing too 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.039
 soft of his taste went to this 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:38.900
 Unfortunately, do not put it sorry for that 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.889
 that I give you these results unfortunately 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.150
 can not deliver 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.620
 but before we start we look 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.330
 first again in the rest 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.610
 configuration looks the whole thing out 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.320
 So here we read with cpu-z 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.160
 See classic information here 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.790
 this cpu 10 526 30 twice 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.690
 is therefore a total of twelve nuclei and 24 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.250
 I had more information for you 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.320
 already given in the course of the video 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.970
 but still very interesting here 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.710
 see that we are here too 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.020
 count cpu again diverse 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.030
 have energy saving mode so if 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.950
 This cdu is not charged is clocked 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.900
 these are automatically down and thus 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.350
 In the end, we can also get some electricity 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.510
 save up 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.120
 by the way, both cdu so want one 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.670
 part of it 70 50 mainboard installed one 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.380
 mainboard with two cpu sockets and also 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.480
 bring much more RAM 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.740
 as a normal mainboard is called 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.170
 Again, we can get together in here 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.080
 access 128 GB of RAM 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.760
 which is now generally not for the test 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.690
 but it is really crucial to me 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.060
 it just would 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.060
 to mention for the sake of completeness 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.840
 and that was considered to be one 

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:27.080
 further issue in this case the test 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.580
 of the cee and i 526 30 more vehicles 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.470
 Of course, as always in the 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.840
 infobox so just take a look 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.730
 because more questions and ideas about 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.830
 the contact form on my website 

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.420
 link to it in the video description 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.760
 otherwise I would like feedback 

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.990
 positive as well as negative are there 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.640
 negative rather less 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.920
 if it has to be as said 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.360
 feedback trees will go otherwise too 

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.100
 comments I answer 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.690
 usually all times when 

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.370
 I have time until the next one 

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.110
 times subscribe in any case not 

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.000
 forget and and then we'll see it 

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.890
 next time as long as you stop that 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.890
 work pressure otherwise pure skin
