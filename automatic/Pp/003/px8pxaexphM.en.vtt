00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.869
 Detective game da mama by making falls 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.810
 what is clear is a detective 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.750
 game 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.880
 a questioned person and drives from one 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.360
 place to the other to face the enemy 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.770
 a little bit of shooting shots too 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.780
 bayer but not so much you can 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.640
 Side missions make like criminals 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.110

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.259

 here is a dead corpse 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.110
 we turn on david 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:18.980
 then come a booklet right away 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:21.140
 Storing the come and there hamburger 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.239
 Of course , spotlight is the money here 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.239
 he is also on top of the market 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:36.200
 Now I even have pictures and videos 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:38.060
 I never explained the controls 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.130
 So if one does not have a booklet and 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:03:06.799
 this has illegally brought somehow 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:03:15.709
 Here's how to control this plays 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:17.570
 So do not come here 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.519
 because the cases one is always in twos 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:26.000
 On the way you still have a partner 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:28.340
 here so you still have a partner 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.690
 Therefore, a top must be actually 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.600

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.489
