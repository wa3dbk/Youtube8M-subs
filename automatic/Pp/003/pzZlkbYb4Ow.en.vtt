know everyone really well we take a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.690 
know everyone really well we take a
diversity<00:01:09.799> of<00:01:09.859> students<00:01:10.280> with<00:01:10.460> different

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
backgrounds we take people with a levels

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.039 
backgrounds we take people with a levels
but<00:01:13.640> with<00:01:13.820> non-traditional<00:01:14.090> qualifications

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
but with non-traditional qualifications

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.870 
but with non-traditional qualifications
as<00:01:15.170> well

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
as well

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.120 
as well
it<00:01:17.840> has<00:01:18.049> been<00:01:18.200> really<00:01:18.439> tough<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:18.950> really

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
it has been really tough and really

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.440 
it has been really tough and really
challenging<00:01:19.610> but<00:01:19.850> that's<00:01:20.030> one<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.390> the

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
challenging but that's one of the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.330 
challenging but that's one of the
reasons<00:01:20.750> I<00:01:21.049> want<00:01:21.409> to<00:01:21.500> do<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.649> chemistry<00:01:22.130> course

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
reasons I want to do a chemistry course

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.270 
reasons I want to do a chemistry course
to<00:01:23.329> extend<00:01:23.630> myself<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:24.469> course<00:01:24.530> our<00:01:24.829> staff<00:01:25.100> are

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
to extend myself of course our staff are

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.889 
to extend myself of course our staff are
also<00:01:25.399> involved<00:01:25.789> not<00:01:26.060> only<00:01:26.119> in<00:01:26.390> teaching<00:01:26.780> but

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
also involved not only in teaching but

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.260 
also involved not only in teaching but
in<00:01:27.049> research<00:01:27.430> so<00:01:28.430> their<00:01:28.579> teachings<00:01:28.970> up<00:01:29.149> to

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
in research so their teachings up to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.840 
in research so their teachings up to
date<00:01:29.479> for<00:01:30.009> example<00:01:31.009> two<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.310> our<00:01:31.429> staff<00:01:31.700> have

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
date for example two of our staff have

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.490 
date for example two of our staff have
just<00:01:32.060> returned<00:01:32.420> from<00:01:32.509> avoiding<00:01:32.840> polar<00:01:33.229> bears

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
just returned from avoiding polar bears

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.990 
just returned from avoiding polar bears
in<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.740> Arctic<00:01:33.820> where<00:01:34.820> they've<00:01:34.939> been

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
in the Arctic where they've been

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.300 
in the Arctic where they've been
studying<00:01:35.420> chemical<00:01:35.780> fossils<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.100> sea

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
studying chemical fossils and the sea

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.819 
studying chemical fossils and the sea
ice<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.759> cover<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.030> Arctic<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:39.409> work<00:01:39.649> is

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
ice that cover the Arctic this work is

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.429 
ice that cover the Arctic this work is
really<00:01:40.130> related<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.789> climate<00:01:41.119> change<00:01:41.439> so

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
really related to climate change so

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.679 
really related to climate change so
chemistry<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.039> modern<00:01:43.340> subject<00:01:43.819> not

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
chemistry is a modern subject not

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.440 
chemistry is a modern subject not
concerned<00:01:45.110> solely<00:01:45.409> with<00:01:45.590> as<00:01:46.270> has<00:01:47.270> been

today's planets problems I've really

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.339 
today's planets problems I've really
