00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.299
 Superstition is that but today there was an exception because the Grafschafter will 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.350
 which are called Norton size hobby cracks have the championship round 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.119
 reaches the round of the best 18 of the Bundesliga 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.359
 so really are 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.570
 and the little miracle possible made this man Anton Weißgerber 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.240
 German-Russian 48 years old when he took over the team in October 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.300
 the Nordhorn weather 36 points in 16 games 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.830
 only the crew of the hour two to the waters single of super rich 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.770
 is also surprising for you 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.050
 she does not 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.540
 it is 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.540
 Process 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.090
 it is a fallacy it is these exercises TuS Strempt Action Alliance out 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.050
 By train 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.460
 Today's last game without Mike Müller, it's a big handicap in itself 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.340
 7 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.650
 visits 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.600
 currently 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.830
 but it is very special, but that's the way it blesses him 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.570
 now of course the reception would prefer to leave 2500 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.509
 also at the end of the round 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.509
 here in the ice rink of Ort 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.880
 if you like a small North German Erfurt ddp 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.770
 because also Braunlage qualified for the playoffs 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.770
 after their 5 to 2 win against Neuwied on Friday 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.790
 table Sixth 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.390
 against seventh Norton Contra Braunlage 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.390
 and the Nordhorn people from left to right 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.820
 Sven Gerike is that 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.219
 Knut told the defense of Corrado 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.219
 the tenant the design of Braunlage 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.470
 good mood to the beginning 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.060
 Cora Domagala last song best goalkeeper of the Regionalliga Nord 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.060
 is almost 40 years old 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.310
 and how he would have liked to be a top scorer Mike Müller 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.410
 he is suspended for four games 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.110
 Four of them are playing the silver medal 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.830
 Win 1 against Dortmund 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.210
 remember that 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.429
 Ronaldo plays the first good chance the man alright about five o'clock 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.209
 minutes 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.559
 then, contrary to their nervousness, they had to give up 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.090
 open exchange of blows 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.090
 with Nordhorn superiority 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.909
 and then it went to the point 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:26.769
 North German Punch 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.199
 the jury worthy opponents 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:34.019
 the 50-year-old is the two-minute penalty for racketeering 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.129
 Steffen Ziesche 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.099
 the son of the legendary ddr national player too 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.950
 Braunlage 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.719
 so inferior but that had no consequences on the contrary 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.059
 Robert Brezina 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:53.639
 and that will certainly surprise you after eleven minutes 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.049
 previous game history 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.049
 Robert Brezina a just holy national sport 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:00.319
 Braunlage 1 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.319
 Nordhorn through 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:07.389
 a beautiful individual achievement short deception 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.619
 of murder and death begins to get caught on the wrong foot 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.169
 only two minutes later the Nordhorn 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.349
 Liberation from the own third 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.519
 Mica lets strike back exactly on the stick of Kasperczyk 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:25.259
 more concretely on it the 1 1 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.259
 Colleagues out being coach Anton Wais Berlin 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.120
 Slaven enthusiasm among the 2500 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.369
 over the place and the first storm row 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:40.519
 That's how it goes 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.939
 virtually pressure just needs to stop 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.400
 very nicely played out 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.879
 the one to one 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.069
 Braunlage outnumbered Norton enters the Storm on the ice 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.620
 and the weizer 1 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.540
 Markus Kempf 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.929
 the acclaimed scorer 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:59.939
 superpower play excellent used look for yourself 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.750
 the extra margin from Markus Fehlmann 2 to 1 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.750
 that also the result after the first third 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:13.189
 tactical instruction for the second section 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.290
 Anton Weißgerber without Mike Miller and without Schubert and study place 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.519
 Since he had to give again and again to explanation 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.580
 look left at the top of the gate 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.580
 because it rules that sees the fists 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.709
 With that, the OMV fell close to Morici's hair again 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:35.029
 needed three minutes and partiparty to provide peace again 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.659
 For both players got the two-minute penalty for exaggerated 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:40.250
 Hardness and the ten minutes 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.580
 for unsporting behavior 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.479
 but then the heated emotions calmed down again 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.309
 although the atmosphere goes down the knees 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:51.309
 Nordhorn's first row of storms on the ice 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.440
 that already 1 5 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.460
 Minutes played in this second third 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.460
 Scorer of ec-kac Herzog 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.280
 Goalkeeper Michael f 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.820
 Train without chance 13 1 It looked good for the Nordhorn but they do get theirs 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.180
 Star Mike Müller played 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.219
 sometimes I sting, I believe or equivalent 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:13.999
 that the connection hit 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.609
 because Ober says it does not play well for half an hour and only 

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:20.059
 three more to two 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:23.059
 Anton Krinner the scorer 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.889
 Norton had one player less on the ice and Braunlage took advantage of that as well 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.059
 payoff consistently 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:35.769
 and then they started again the referees had good volley 

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:36.319
 do 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.920
 in this second third alone, there were 46 penalty minutes 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.000
 well distributed 22 for Norton 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.150
 24 for Braunlage 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.960
 Meanwhile, coach Anton Weißgerber took to Annette Hünting again 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.550
 large 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.009
 13 2 everything was still in this game the last third 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:57.789
 that means who 10 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.439
 and again Devil's Mountain Corado Mika all partner blow-job now Veron there 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:05.439
 before the best at Braunlage 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:10.409
 and there Pilates wants the two goalkeepers or Peter Geiger the trader 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.139
 Braunlage is one of the few German courts but he is in the house 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:14.650
 stay 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.990
 Bully in the third of Nordhorn 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.970
 about three minutes before the end of the match the equalizer 13 3 goalscorer 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.639
 Report Mori Seiki 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.509
 Goalkeeper hurt the shocked the hits durable 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:30.009
 just between the schooners 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.210
 13 3 The victory so close and dandies 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.020
 13 3 that means extra time 5 minutes coach Anton Weißgerber 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.849
 upset 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:40.889
 understandable 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:42.180
 Coeur d 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.449
 too heavy on the number 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.830
 and unbelievable 13 4 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.919
 Anton Krinner his second goal 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.830
 Braunlage Prayer of Norton surprisingly 4 to 3 with a little luck 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:56.889
 anyway Norton before the start of the championship round 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:58.760
 one point better than Braunlage 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.250
 but that was the only big class on this hectic day 

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:06.969
 and those are the results the Commanders Hamburg to strong under the 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.169
 Wheels in Dusseldorf 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:12.689
 Neuwied beats the front runner from Essen 4 to 3 cliffwalk Iserlohn 4 to 3 

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:17.310
 Nordhorn but seen Freiburg he is the 15 0 Heilbronn among the Grazer them 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.770
 3 to 4 is currently Bad Nauheim the second 13 2 and white water is subject 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.899
 Ingolstadt 2 to 3 in the table front Essen Bad Nauheim and the the criticism 

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:30.749
 best club from the north sixth place Nordhorn behind Braunlage both 

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:34.169
 qualified for the championship round of the best 8 and nothing to order 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:38.159
 have the Coco partly from Hamburg will see the Rath then down to the 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:39.319
 then there they are up
