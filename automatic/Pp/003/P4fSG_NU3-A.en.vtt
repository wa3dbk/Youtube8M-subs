is<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.000> paint<00:01:33.210> job<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.720> make<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.900> look

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
is just a paint job just to make it look

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
is just a paint job just to make it look
like<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.470> little<00:01:34.680> stronger<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.579> they're

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
like it's a little stronger that they're

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.130 
like it's a little stronger that they're
putting<00:01:35.939> graphite<00:01:36.360> lines<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:36.900> which

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
putting graphite lines in here which

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.679

obviously<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.950> or<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.270> this<00:01:39.270> comes<00:01:39.540> in

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
obviously it or not this comes in

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240

the<00:02:10.229> heel<00:02:10.379> area<00:02:10.590> there

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
the heel area there

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.280 
the heel area there
I've<00:02:11.640> used<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.120> sure<00:02:12.329> with<00:02:12.510> for<00:02:12.689> many<00:02:13.019> many

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
I've used to you sure with for many many

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.319 
I've used to you sure with for many many
years<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.829> that's<00:02:14.489> one<00:02:14.730> place<00:02:14.939> that<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.150> always

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
years and that's one place that I always

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:16.789 
years and that's one place that I always
found<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.599> no<00:02:15.750> we've<00:02:15.930> always<00:02:16.290> broken<00:02:16.739> a

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
found that no we've always broken a

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.319 
found that no we've always broken a
blade<00:02:17.010> right<00:02:17.159> here<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.489> heel<00:02:17.640> even<00:02:17.819> if<00:02:18.239> you

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
blade right here in the heel even if you

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.750 
blade right here in the heel even if you
took<00:02:18.480> off<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.659> tape<00:02:19.159> you<00:02:20.159> know<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.459> not<00:02:20.700> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
took off the tape you know and not to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.039 
took off the tape you know and not to
let<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> lot<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.299> moisture<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.629> everything<00:02:21.959> in

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
let a lot of moisture and everything in

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.170 
let a lot of moisture and everything in
there<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.980> adorability<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.549> guess<00:02:23.849> we'll<00:02:24.030> give

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
there so adorability I guess we'll give

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.259 
there so adorability I guess we'll give
it<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.480> four<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:26.459> know<00:02:26.519> as<00:02:26.579> far<00:02:26.730> as<00:02:26.819> wood<00:02:27.030> sticks

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
it a four you know as far as wood sticks

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.720 
it a four you know as far as wood sticks
are<00:02:27.359> concerned<00:02:27.799> flexibility<00:02:28.799> will<00:02:29.459> give<00:02:29.579> it<00:02:29.670> a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
are concerned flexibility will give it a

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.429 
are concerned flexibility will give it a
five<00:02:29.909> because<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.299> does<00:02:30.450> come<00:02:30.659> in<00:02:30.719> a<00:02:31.019> lot<00:02:31.409> of

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
five because it does come in a lot of

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.929 
five because it does come in a lot of
different<00:02:31.859> curves<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.219> guys<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.700> been

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
different curves that guys have been

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.039 
different curves that guys have been
accustomed<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.359> used<00:02:33.569> for<00:02:33.750> over<00:02:33.870> two<00:02:33.959> year

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
accustomed to used for over two year

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.080 
accustomed to used for over two year
before<00:02:34.200> over<00:02:34.859> years<00:02:35.040> before<00:02:35.370> graphite<00:02:35.939> was

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
before over years before graphite was

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.270 
before over years before graphite was
even<00:02:36.389> thought<00:02:37.230> about<00:02:38.269> flexibility<00:02:39.980> again<00:02:40.980> we

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
even thought about flexibility again we

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.099 
even thought about flexibility again we
give<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.519> five<00:02:41.760> let's<00:02:42.510> see<00:02:42.629> stick<00:02:42.900> feel

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
give it a five let's see stick feel

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.780 
give it a five let's see stick feel
stick<00:02:43.769> field<00:02:43.950> we'll<00:02:44.099> have<00:02:44.189> to<00:02:44.310> give<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.639> a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
stick field we'll have to give it a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.030 
stick field we'll have to give it a
three<00:02:45.389> and<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.989> know<00:02:46.109> it's<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> wooden<00:02:46.530> stick<00:02:46.739> a

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
three and you know it's a wooden stick a

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.920 
three and you know it's a wooden stick a
lot<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.549> us<00:02:47.669> have<00:02:47.819> been<00:02:47.849> accustomed<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.450> using

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
lot of us have been accustomed to using

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.509 
lot of us have been accustomed to using
graphite<00:02:49.379> sticks<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:49.799> when<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.040> put<00:02:50.189> a<00:02:50.220> wooden

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
graphite sticks so when you put a wooden

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.490 
graphite sticks so when you put a wooden
stick<00:02:50.669> in<00:02:50.790> your<00:02:50.879> hand<00:02:51.030> man<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.109> almost<00:02:52.290> like

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
stick in your hand man it's almost like

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.949 
stick in your hand man it's almost like
sometimes<00:02:52.889> you<00:02:53.010> can't<00:02:53.189> even<00:02:53.220> go<00:02:53.430> back<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.639> that

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
sometimes you can't even go back to that

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.890 
sometimes you can't even go back to that
stick<00:02:54.959> handling<00:02:55.319> I'll<00:02:55.919> have<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.219> give<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.519> a

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
stick handling I'll have to give it a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.720 
stick handling I'll have to give it a
three<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.109> know<00:02:58.230> sure<00:02:58.469> what<00:02:58.680> sometimes<00:02:59.159> does

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
three you know sure what sometimes does

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.550 
three you know sure what sometimes does
have<00:02:59.909> a<00:02:59.969> tendency<00:03:00.389> to<00:03:00.419> have<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:00.659> real<00:03:01.139> good<00:03:01.169> feel

have a tendency to have a real good feel
nothing<00:03:02.189> feels<00:03:02.430> like<00:03:02.639> a<00:03:02.669> nice<00:03:02.909> wood<00:03:03.180> stick

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
nothing feels like a nice wood stick

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.559 
nothing feels like a nice wood stick
itself<00:03:03.799> visual<00:03:04.799> looks<00:03:05.010> again<00:03:05.849> don't<00:03:06.419> mess

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
itself visual looks again don't mess

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.720
