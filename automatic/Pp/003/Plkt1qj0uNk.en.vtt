00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.960
 yes you have to google 2000 starts with the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:16.440
 country game what are your expectations 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:20.430
 for the year 2007 the qualification the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.810
 There are, of course, to create that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.730
 more, of course, the individual 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.500
 improvement of single players we have 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.960
 made it our task that we just 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.210
 especially for us, above all 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.460
 the young players do it again 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.230
 try hard to try 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.989
 accompany and easily in the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.020
 then end a progress 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.320
 find that it develops positively 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.629
 Has 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.040
 we have a country game right away 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.440
 against Switzerland after that there is that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.000
 super important qualifier against 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.860
 the Czech Republic around 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.390
 important right now as a first game 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.850
 how it looks with the squad there 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.750
 but good surprises 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.829
 I think that I nominate the rubbers 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.050
 play against switzerland because he completely 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.430
 just over months now in the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.930
 Bundesliga really excellent 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.760
 has shown many achievements 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.710
 scored and there but has the good 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.090
 development behind and beyond 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.890
 let's assume that we kevin 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.140
 Just nominate kuranyi because yes 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.549
 now in the game against switzerland Lukas 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.979
 Podolski is locked against the Czech Republic 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.150
 miroslav klose oliver neuvilles injured 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.979
 That's why we need that too 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.930
 alternative to also kuranyi has now 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.180
 again the last few weeks, too 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.950
 shown a greatly improved performance 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.790
 Kevin was a bit of a question 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.380
 ever at the football 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.329
 then world championship, they are happy 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.180
 for him personally that he is his now 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.890
 Chance reuses in any case rejoices 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.299
 I am in 2006 above all things 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.130
 For the first six months he does not have the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.909
 shown the power he can bring 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.770
 Schalke has easy 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.619
 habituation difficulties after the wm 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.750
 his form was not necessarily very 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.520
 good but the last weeks before 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.740
 winter break and now after the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.299
 winterpause possible to the attached ties 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.840
 what he can he was very much again 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.640
 more mobile was Spielstärker has gates 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.820
 prepared on own goals and achieved 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.140
 in this form, I think 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.030
 Qatar is also deserved to return to the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.200
 national team called how it looks 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.750
 there's one with the applause 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.390
 Surprise with Christoph Metzelder 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.759
 He leaps on the back Christoph with 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.500
 yourself will always be there for you 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.240
 the focus mertesacker and metzelder 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.590
 both of them at the wm so great 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.760
 internal defenses have formed that 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.620
 they are back 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.060
 that both are injury free both 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.750
 had to fight after the wm too 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.580
 with injuries 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.990
 Butcher has a very good one 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.730
 preparation has been completed with 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.450
 jürgen röber said and that's why 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.790
 to be there 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.360
 otherwise there are no surprises 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.820
 marcell jansen philipp lahm and arne 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.870
 friedrich and manuel friedrich are 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.940
 the players just for the apple 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.880
 The Bundesliga is in 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.820
 moment very turbulent three coaches away 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.890
 this has been dismissed today 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.120
 does that affect his 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.200
 national team out watching you like this 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.760
 what or how did you judge that? 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.220
 was already in one or the other 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.010
 case is also a surprise what 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.470
 now in the continue to respond so quickly 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.670
 or in the tak bach I hope I 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.070
 This is not going to be out for the players 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.660
 sometimes changes and new situation 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.580
 if then a new coach comes 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.890
 but you always have it 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.150
 the players managed to get what they are up to 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.890
 the games at the national team 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.450
 has been properly focused too 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.920
 players who were out of shape 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.010
 Good performance with the national team 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.570
 shown and we all know something with the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.940
 are people the fans and you owe 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.120
 one likes the national team too 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.799
 for a few months and that's why 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.840
 we in the obligation there as well 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.549
 even if it only 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.970
 a friendly match is all clear 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.970
 Thank you very much
