labels on products like I said just

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.339

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
doesn't make it safe because there's a

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
thinking I used this is a session a

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.089 
thinking I used this is a session a
product<00:02:24.159> -<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:24.640> called<00:02:24.909> rebuild<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.890> it's

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
product - it's called rebuild and it's

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.890

to strengthen weak thin nails so I

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.940
