00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
so let's take a look and see what that

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.960 
so let's take a look and see what that
looks<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> DualShock<00:01:38.670> 4

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
looks like and here is the DualShock 4

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
looks like and here is the DualShock 4
with<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> mono<00:01:39.509> headset<00:01:39.810> hooked<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.740> it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
with the mono headset hooked up to it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.550 
with the mono headset hooked up to it
looks<00:01:41.490> pretty<00:01:41.909> cool<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.780> something<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
looks pretty cool it's something that I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.499 
looks pretty cool it's something that I
think<00:01:43.649> could<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.189> interchangeable<00:01:44.909> with

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
think could be interchangeable with

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.410 
think could be interchangeable with
maybe<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.810> nicer<00:01:46.439> headset<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> that's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
maybe a nicer headset so that's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.910 
maybe a nicer headset so that's
something<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.840> now<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.320> guys<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.770> look

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
something that I now you guys can look

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980 
something that I now you guys can look
into<00:01:50.280> when<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.000> get<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> console<00:01:51.689> itself
