00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.520
 autocosm friends as they are good morning 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.520
 how can you tell 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.769
 suffering a bit in Cancun the weather 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.110
 it is although they are not a bit cold 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.970
 by the standards of this this 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.920
 beautiful city ​​of the Mexican Caribbean and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.640
 why what the reason is the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.960
 presentation of the mazda2 as you 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.640
 can see is a car completely 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.460
 new is a very important car for the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.529
 brand and for mexico because because it's a 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.070
 car made in mexico in the plant 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.989
 salamanca de mazda and let's meet 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.530
 specifically things we did not know 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.180
 of the model things that characterize this 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.730
 mark how can you see the lines 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.260
 front this kodo design that does not have 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.140
 nothing to do with this co2 and it's not a 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.330
 Japanese design language that gives more 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.100
 taxes on all vehicles from 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.579
 the flagship that is the mazda6 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.380
 going through the clouds passing through the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.600
 mazda3 which is the most successful product and 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.180
 the flagship product in Mexico and with 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.420
 this new mazda2 that also comes to give 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.630
 a new concept to this to this 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.810
 subcompact segment equipped the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.110
 car starts at 188 thousand pesos read 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.909
 well 188 thousand pesos for the versions of 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.850
 tickets that all have brakes 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.250
 abs and let's know little details to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.450
 little because you have to take into account 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.360
 all these details that it has 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.830
 interesting come well then how 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.750
 they can give an account we are on the side 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.430
 of the vehicle and you can realize it is 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.429
 stylistically very similar to mazda 3 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.069
 has all these cuts that make it 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:44.130
 be very from the house even this pair of 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.259
 very characteristic lines on the side 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.600
 which tells us the brand already in a way 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.030
 a bit dramatic that is like a chip 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.619
 is about to attack the force of 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.709
 Character of the design is in the part 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.509
 back and this makes it very very 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.759
 characteristic for example this that is 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.770
 the top-of- range version this is a 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.470
 version that will be around 240 thousand 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.120
 weights has 16 wheels as well with this design 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.880
 and tobey polished and painted tone 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.060
 and tires of very good profile and 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.120
 emphasizing these these design lines 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.340
 that finish in the part of the chest and in 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.320
 this part of the spoiler of the lid of the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.240
 well, now we are in the 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.010
 back of this subcompact in 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.290
 march that as you can give 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.480
 account is five doors 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.920
 the fifth door that is rather the lid 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.020
 from the trunk I do not know why they call him 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.730
 door because nobody comes in there but 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.010
 good gives us access a cargo area a 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.870
 Luggage area of good size for your 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.790
 segment I think you can position yourself 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.130
 quickly as a leader the leader of 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.000
 this segment is the honda fit 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.890
 I hardly believe that someone wins 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.740
 because it is a very well thought-out vehicle 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.210
 we return to Mazda 2 has a very 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.510
 good the trunk the seats are 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.360
 folding and space is allows us 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.510
 enter and put things of good volume 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.790
 big things and it's very very good 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.280
 achieved and very well integrated in the part 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.200
 from behind this design kodo phases 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.240
 envelopes with this black part that 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.130
 help in the case of then the 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.990
 parking the blows and the 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.400
 small details that they give in the painting 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.780
 of fascia because others thought 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.850
 in that putting it in a 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.260
 they are in a dark tone continuing with 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.170
 the interiors of this new mazda2 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.209
 I want to highlight this is the version 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.120
 most equipped is the version that goes around the 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.010
 240 thousand pesos and that this payment is 240 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.470
 thousand pesos mechanically all have the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.959
 engine is that there is active 1.5 liters of 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.950
 106 horses but between these what is 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.640
 has is an air conditioner 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.239
 programmable ones that have parts 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.940
 sensitive to the touch on the on the board 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.709
 soft parts this part is fine 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.350
 integrated with a red dot so that 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.790
 does combination with the vestments and 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.640
 an interesting part that you have is the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.220
 head up display that is also very very 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.590
 new this kind of this kind of gadgets 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.019
 in this segment that this axis of 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.030
 display tells us the speed in the 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.769
 that we are circulating and in the event that 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.890
 one pays extra to the system 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.450
 navigation tells us the next 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.590
 instruction to follow be return to 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.480
 right turn to the left and we 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.400
 mark with with the icon that needs to be done 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.440
 and what we need to get there and 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.150
 let's focus a little on the in the box 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.320
 instruments that is very similar to that of 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.290
 mazda3 the design language is 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.140
 is basically identical to the center of 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.000
 tachometer that stands out highlights is the 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.800
 only analog instrument that we're going to 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.280
 find in the vehicle sideways 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.580
 we have the issue of the level of 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.230
 gasoline on the left side we have the 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.060
 total and partial mileage and the 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.620
 status selector lever 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.960
 changes in this case an automatic of 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.020
 six speeds there is a manual option 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.480
 of six speeds and we have like 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.160
 I mention them very good level of 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.340
 audio controls equipment in the 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.050
 steering wheel and cruise control that was 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.970
 one of the criticisms we had at 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.130
 mazda 32 liters that we drive up 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.560
 canada you should remember this 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.290
 already has the highest version equipped 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.950
 cruise control we do not know yet if 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.900
 the basic 188 thousand pesos will have 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.490
 cruise control I think not but 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.260
 we did not try it here we tried the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.300
 high-end versions see the 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.880
 vestments' see the level they have and 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.860
 we will continue with the engine as well 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.020
 As you can see, we are already facing the 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.360
 heart of this vehicle as I have 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.569
 come commenting on a skyactiv engine 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.090
 what the hell is this good is this 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.770
 environmental and ecological solution that 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.750
 has found mass without spending 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.180
 exorbitant amounts of money in 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.770
 hybrid or hydrogen developments of 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.930
 electric vehicles simple and 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.460
 simply skyactiv means that 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.949
 subjected all its components 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.280
 mechanical to a diet these are engines 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.740
 tiny but very high compression 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.000
 how could it be the ferrari engines or 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.400
 the lamborghini engines that are 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.849
 engines designed to have this torque 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.289
 and this poncho gotten from very 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.330
 high compression are very engines 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.580
 efficient as I've told you several 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.979
 times it's a 1,500 cubic centimeters of 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.169
 106 horses maybe on paper not 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.879
 a great power will sound 106 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.529
 horses but we do balance the 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:13.099
 Weight / power ratio is a car 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:15.449
 lightweight and this is a car thought 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.129
 precisely it seems to perform with a lot 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:20.039
 aluminum with many high plastics 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:22.080
 resistance and this powertrain that 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.150
 llama skyactiv I repeat the 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.520
 specifications 106 horses four 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.919
 cylinders 1.5 liters and with two options 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.630
 Six-speed transmission with 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.270
 traditional manual drive 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.840
 or automatic also with this 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.820
 six speed skyactiv treatment 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.940
 worth it in the pussy is an option 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.440
 very interesting give the opportunity 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.600
 handle it and maybe if you are looking 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.820
 something this size then give it the 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.070
 opportunity more to obviously not 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.500
 intends to sell large quantities of 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.120
 cars your top you see is the mazda3 but 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.740
 this one has to be given the opportunity already 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.200
 We will drive in Mexico and we will tell you 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.330
 but while you enjoy it, it's worth it 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.980
 option b and they realized 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.980
 alejandro with santones goodbye 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.740
 cox
