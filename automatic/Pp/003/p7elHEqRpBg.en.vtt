years we've added more and more food and
a<00:03:52.879> few<00:03:53.120> years<00:03:53.239> ago<00:03:53.359> we<00:03:53.569> had<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.690> produce<00:03:54.169> then<00:03:54.440> we

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
a few years ago we had a produce then we

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.619 
a few years ago we had a produce then we
added<00:03:54.680> meat<00:03:54.949> items<00:03:55.609> that<00:03:55.699> people<00:03:55.730> want<00:03:56.150> every

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
day that turned very very quickly we

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.339 
day that turned very very quickly we
want<00:03:59.000> people<00:03:59.359> on<00:03:59.389> our<00:03:59.540> stores<00:03:59.810> more<00:04:00.169> and<00:04:00.260> more

often shopping us more and more and so
the<00:04:03.169> answer<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.500> you'll<00:04:03.739> see<00:04:03.949> now<00:04:04.129> more<00:04:04.489> and

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
the answer is you'll see now more and

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.939 
the answer is you'll see now more and
more<00:04:04.609> food<00:04:04.910> in<00:04:05.060> our<00:04:05.120> store<00:04:05.449> and<00:04:05.750> we<00:04:06.379> sell<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.620> lot

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
of food it's very hard for me to think

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.509 
of food it's very hard for me to think
about<00:04:09.139> what<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.889> store<00:04:10.099> is<00:04:10.190> going<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.400> look

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
about what the store is going to look

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.960 
about what the store is going to look
like<00:04:10.549> in<00:04:10.879> five<00:04:11.120> years<00:04:11.150> I<00:04:11.569> really<00:04:11.989> don't<00:04:12.139> know

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
like in five years I really don't know

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.030 
like in five years I really don't know
as<00:04:14.060> things<00:04:14.780> change<00:04:15.200> we're<00:04:15.560> going<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.770> change

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
as things change we're going to change

we really have no loyalty to one item or
one<00:04:19.250> category<00:04:19.880> we<00:04:20.420> don't<00:04:20.750> take<00:04:20.959> most<00:04:21.170> credit

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530

the concept is do whatever you can to

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.410 
the concept is do whatever you can to
keep<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.140> prices<00:04:30.350> down<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:31.150> we<00:04:32.150> do<00:04:32.270> that

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
keep the prices down and we do that

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.510 
keep the prices down and we do that
