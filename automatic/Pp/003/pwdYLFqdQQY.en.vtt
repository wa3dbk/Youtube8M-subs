00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
today and this is how it could look and

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.779 
today and this is how it could look and
I<00:00:31.539> just<00:00:31.750> pin<00:00:32.109> it<00:00:32.140> up<00:00:32.379> on<00:00:32.559> the<00:00:32.649> side<00:00:35.519> and<00:00:36.519> that's

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
I just pin it up on the side and that's

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.430 
I just pin it up on the side and that's
how<00:00:37.030> it<00:00:37.149> looks<00:00:37.329> in<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.629> back<00:00:37.809> and<00:00:38.170> that's<00:00:38.289> on

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
how it looks in the back and that's on

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.410 
how it looks in the back and that's on
the<00:00:38.530> side<00:00:38.769> I<00:00:38.800> don't<00:00:39.069> have<00:00:39.399> one<00:00:39.579> right<00:00:39.760> here<00:00:40.179> I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
the side I don't have one right here I

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.309 
the side I don't have one right here I
actually<00:00:41.109> like<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:41.890> look<00:00:42.539> that<00:00:43.539> this<00:00:43.809> twirls

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:44.319 
actually like the look that this twirls

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:48.389 
actually like the look that this twirls
it<00:00:44.469> right<00:00:44.649> there<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.780> just<00:00:47.199> just<00:00:47.829> did<00:00:48.280> have

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
it right there but I just just did have

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.610 
it right there but I just just did have
you<00:00:48.760> know<00:00:48.909> the<00:00:49.030> old<00:00:49.239> fashioned<00:00:49.780> roll<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.409> just

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
you know the old fashioned roll and just

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.389 
you know the old fashioned roll and just
tucked<00:00:50.979> it<00:00:51.219> on<00:00:51.999> the<00:00:52.269> side<00:00:52.569> right<00:00:52.870> here<00:00:52.929> and<00:00:53.440> I

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
tucked it on the side right here and I

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.189 
tucked it on the side right here and I
made<00:00:54.729> sure<00:00:54.999> that<00:00:55.239> they<00:00:55.449> didn't<00:00:55.690> mess<00:00:55.809> with<00:00:55.929> my

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
made sure that they didn't mess with my

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.849 
made sure that they didn't mess with my
arm<00:00:56.469> a<00:00:56.909> little<00:00:57.909> baby<00:00:58.209> here<00:00:58.600> right<00:00:58.809> here<00:00:59.109> so<00:00:59.589> I

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
arm a little baby here right here so I

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.699 
arm a little baby here right here so I
told<00:01:00.339> him<00:01:00.459> don't<00:01:00.670> grab<00:01:00.969> it<00:01:00.999> don't<00:01:01.449> don't<00:01:02.229> mess

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:02.709 
told him don't grab it don't don't mess

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:04.950 
told him don't grab it don't don't mess
with<00:01:02.739> it<00:01:03.069> I'd<00:01:03.190> rather<00:01:03.370> it<00:01:04.210> looked<00:01:04.479> like<00:01:04.659> this

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
with it I'd rather it looked like this

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.649 
with it I'd rather it looked like this
instead<00:01:05.439> of<00:01:05.560> looking<00:01:06.219> all<00:01:06.369> extra<00:01:06.729> tight<00:01:06.939> so

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
instead of looking all extra tight so

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.230 
instead of looking all extra tight so
you<00:01:07.810> can<00:01:08.079> freak<00:01:08.289> it<00:01:08.409> like<00:01:08.560> this<00:01:08.829> or<00:01:09.729> you<00:01:09.759> could

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
you can freak it like this or you could

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.999 
you can freak it like this or you could
be<00:01:10.329> a<00:01:10.360> little<00:01:10.539> bit<00:01:10.780> more<00:01:10.960> conservative<00:01:11.380> and

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
be a little bit more conservative and

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.749 
be a little bit more conservative and
just<00:01:12.729> throw<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.360> side<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.369> go<00:01:15.579> like

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
just throw it to the side and go like

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.020 
just throw it to the side and go like
that<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.320> I'm<00:01:17.680> a<00:01:17.799> all<00:01:18.039> day<00:01:18.280> at<00:01:18.369> work<00:01:18.430> I<00:01:18.880> was

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
that so I'm a all day at work I was

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.730 
that so I'm a all day at work I was
pulling<00:01:19.570> it<00:01:19.659> back<00:01:19.899> doing<00:01:20.350> one<00:01:20.500> of<00:01:20.530> these

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
pulling it back doing one of these

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.139 
pulling it back doing one of these
numbers<00:01:21.219> because<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:21.579> was<00:01:21.700> getting<00:01:21.969> on<00:01:22.030> my

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
numbers because it was getting on my

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.660 
numbers because it was getting on my
nerves<00:01:22.390> but<00:01:23.259> if<00:01:23.350> I<00:01:23.439> wanted<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.770> be<00:01:23.890> funky<00:01:24.460> I

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
nerves but if I wanted to be funky I

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.880 
nerves but if I wanted to be funky I
think<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.600> would<00:01:25.750> freak<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.170> like<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:26.619> and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
think I would freak it like this and

think I would freak it like this and
like<00:01:27.240> make<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.420> stand<00:01:28.689> up<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:28.990> little<00:01:29.170> bit
