00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.220
 damien will make a terrine of liver not 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.300
 so very simple we can not miss 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.090
 see cooking with the eye 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.320
 it's going very fast classically 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.000
 terrine of foie gras it's lobes of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.740
 foie gras they are cooked whole the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.810
 christophe's method it's going to be from 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.090
 make slices of precook them and 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.080
 after irena radio is not finished 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.400
 very very well that in technical 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.410
 first thing we go to these areas of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.060
 coxyde we put a movie cleat in a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.590
 dish that needs to oven okay and I 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.320
 put a little step in the living room we go we are 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.400
 quite serious at the pivot a little bit 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.970
 hold a little bit of yours 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.710
 national nutmeg I am seasoning 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.840
 copiously that's still the little one 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.829
 reminder to catch nutmeg as a 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.390
 little nutmeg 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:55.739
 agree progress and come to agreement 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.690
 you could have made strangely from 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.530
 close to cm I did not want that so that there 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.280
 the mode and does what she is a lot 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.139
 finer 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:11.249
 ok we put them flat he savored everything 

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:12.780
 simply was close the advantage with 

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:15.719
 the terrine is that we will master 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.119
 more losses we will succeed a fund 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.579
 drac and half cooked and well mastered in 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.649
 cooking faculty cooked in layers and 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.439
 after you did not seem too much but we 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.899
 season little salt again and re 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.880
 mill pepper and nutmeg 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.060
 slightly do not say it's over 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.709
 still not flap the film paper there 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.329
 we can fold milla fussy for 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:41.219
 set up a little guy later 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.049
 the oven is warmed to 90 ° future on 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.319
 stuffs and we're going to monitor the melting of 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.009
 ice 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.419
 straw his part in saïda that's it then 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.889
 loose a bit here are some traces 

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:52.289
 were out it's not very serious 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:53.490
 it's not too bad you have to do 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.620
 attention of course the election is for 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.140
 that we have one day at 80 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.970
 then as in the film extend 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.350
 delicately like you, you're going 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:10.660
 in the marble and she wanted everything 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.660
 just your shots on goal after all that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.670
 we put it cleanly like that 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.780
 that they find on the side to leave 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.120
 go out tac 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.010
 on both sides we pro b it is a 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.319
 little bit of fat is not there 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.890
 lot and is quite like that in 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.379
 maximum 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.180
 just to remove the light exists 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.950
 in the example now we're going to 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.420
 leave two hours in a corner of the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.739
 cooking before putting it to the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.150
 refrigerator it's important to not 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.890
 too quickly put it in the refrigerator 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.510
 because they have to give them the fake 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.640
 fat and absorbs a little bit of grain 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.790
 for a very very average program ok 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.109
 you two hours refrigerator and after 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.109
 we will see the demoulding to have these 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:57.890
 beautiful little foie gras method 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:03:01.040
 christophe game there he has good smear 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.220
 all alone magical because behind last 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.079
 the melting very little background you finish 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.030
 we're on a very cute thing 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.810
 little gourmand sweets to langon 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.760
 against I hope that with this method we 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.290
 made you want to achieve this liver 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.410
 fat it's very simple you think about it 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.410
 you
