00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.559
 Hello there it is always in my nature to be where what happens when im 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.629
 Moment you can hear only train strike here railroad boss there and strangely enough that 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.090
 Of course, without me and that is of course not why I am here in Dortmund 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.570
 in the legal process of the largest trade fair for the railway industry and there at the moment 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.269
 all over the boy's favorite profession train drivers speak there I have 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.290
 simply thought because it simply engine driver she belongs to the German 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.199
 train 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.649
 sees everything means 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.010
 I say but one works on the sign more I would be allowed for it 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.969
 Would you know a little bit with the band hopes that they are with us exactly 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.700
 Both teams in the Petrikirche Ballack go back and forth right this way 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.620
 this provision is - but that was not possible or not 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.910
 but it will also be 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.660
 the mood is unique 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.860
 all in a good mood 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.840
 and because it just did better 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.729
 so far you went 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.230
 and so were reached in 2003 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.950
 for us here at the moment I do not get it he said the 1 1 0 and salary 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.390
 no idea what she does 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.680
 here are responsible for the field of training and further education 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.340
 in the field of transport and logistics 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.640
 So transport logistics Peter Diesch we can not just do it all 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
 what we expand projects 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.020
 December delivered goods to the holiday or Marvin of his covenant young 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.580
 Familys 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.490
 you have to be there 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.030
 or about how strong Bertels enough but I can talk about the dispute 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.570
 speak why 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.200
 no idea Stuttgart dpa 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.460
 yes own website 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.420
 in Internet forums 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.500
 The winners except that one day three men do not have to be like that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.360
 Law 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.770
 Bruns to 30 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.070
 that they in Baden-Baden Kehl and Strasbourg I wonder and the whole 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.390
 History the GDL no more today 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.400
 the Dr 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.040
 and where is the GDL never have to be present today that should actually 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.060
 Bush here in the GDL is you too somewhere 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.790
 since we have not seen it is funny or 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.960
 almost certainly they are rarely allowed to do so here he is the right way 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.660
 prepare me really well more 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.660
 I do not really want to do any training 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.889
 I'm still fit enough too 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:19.099
 which is not necessary is the dispute because up here in the 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.029
 Superbike listened to the topic of male guests 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:23.550
 So I can not say the field yet 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.889
 Ben 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:30.049
 11 Grant Smith all allowed brand is developed since the 11 Lima 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:32.840
 how loyal this one 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.199
 the mood is very good 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:39.119
 the strange celebrations opened Transneft participants but point to 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:40.439
 Waldemar consumer 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.660
 Thomsen loves us as much as everyone else 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.470
 so here's the fire to make it in time, he says 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.590
 Leverkusen stronger faster than the chapel, but above all it is 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.130
 So it makes sense and this saves the winner garden should it really over 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.190
 he says and if they do something we can talk not only the argument 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.819
 or 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.089
 99 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:03.569
 that would spoil one for the whole day if only pity have to run 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.789
 or food 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:08.289
 the concern that soon some nice lady of the German course differently run 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:10.469
 as in the previous year 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.999
 So I would not have locomotive that we had, we did not have it that way either 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.569
 easily get the coal that stands in the stars I'll 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.229
 now Bahnchef Inc because this Mehdorn pointed in a conversation and that's it 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.650
 something for me
