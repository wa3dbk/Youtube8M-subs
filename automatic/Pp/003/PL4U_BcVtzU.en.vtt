00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.730
 it's really plausible that electronic 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.900
 arts is always able to take advantage 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.020
 correctly the possibilities of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.240
 new consoles with your fifa license with 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.910
 ps vita has achieved it and with will you 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.500
 also visually we are facing a 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.170
 product that looks at the same level as 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.800
 seen on pc ps3 or xbox 360 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.220
 yes the game is somewhat less smooth 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.400
 engulfed players stadiums environments 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.110
 look great in this version the 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.360
 players move fluently 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.850
 doing the watermarks in the same way 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.489
 that in the other consoles as for 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.530
 offer of game this is identical in everything 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.440
 being able to perform from quick matches 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.079
 to full seasons disputing a 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.250
 huge list of tournaments and championships 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.760
 and creating our own player 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.140
 taking it to the top there is no game 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.659
 stability in this version 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.360
 before jumping into the field we can choose 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.940
 if we want to control the team or be the 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.220
 coach is on the same console or 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.979
 online can play up to 5 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.659
 players although it allows to use all the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.479
 possible wii and willow controls 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.520
 We will analyze this version based on 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.340
 the possibilities offered by the control 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.380
 with game pact on the screen of this 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.670
 command we will also see the match such and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.250
 as we see it on the screen of 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.340
 television that yes with quality not so 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.390
 good that allows the touch screen 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.240
 around what is offered to us 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.729
 Party find a few tabs 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.369
 shortcuts that lead us to statistics 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.340
 formations strategies selection of 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.929
 players and plays rehearsed 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.030
 allowing us a faster management 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.729
 the match live rather than 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.229
 for the menu causing the game the 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.259
 command screen allows us to play 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.270
 as with ps vita is to say if we touch the 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.729
 screen we will throw the ball to the point 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.220
 He touched it to make passes or 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.860
 shoot at the door for example in the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.200
 plays stopped if we move the gamepad a 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.510
 little up we have almost vision 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.849
 subjective 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.819
 being able to point the door of form 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.310
 much more accurate is a pity that the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.930
 game present some bugs characters 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.459
 that they stay still players that 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.890
 follow the play for a few seconds 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.110
 although the ball has left the band 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.819
 Goalkeepers who leave so much that they leave 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.760
 even to the other field to finish leaving the 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.530
 totally uncovered goal we indicate 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.269
 also that in wii to change 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.799
 fast strategy we are forced to give 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.750
 two touches to the different directions 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.900
 of the crosshead according to which we want 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.750
 apply adding one more touch of what 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.159
 usual the narrative is reproduced so much 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.890
 on the television as through the 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.989
 gamepad sometimes one of the two is 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.299
 produces seconds or thousandths of a second 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.180
 before in one place than in another what 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.849
 it produces a strange echo a lack of 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.379
 synchronism the phrases used are the 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.780
 same as those heard in the other 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.280
 platforms there's ambient sound with 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.609
 megaphone that warns of cars for 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.950
 parked alignment and other changes without 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.750
 be maybe as rotten as the rest 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.780
 of platforms and with some functions 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.239
 they vary fifa 13 in will you is a 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.260
 great match not only because it stands 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.540
 like the soccer game 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.360
 new from nintendo without having any rival 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.920
 in this console but also because it takes out 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.349
 match the functions that allow 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.780
 play with the gamepad what sets 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.780
 this experience of the other consoles
