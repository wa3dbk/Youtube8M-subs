hottest thing out there this industry is
pretty<00:03:47.780> explosive<00:03:48.199> I<00:03:48.739> actually<00:03:49.459> thought<00:03:49.760> it

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
pretty explosive I actually thought it

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.689 
pretty explosive I actually thought it
was<00:03:50.000> going<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.150> be<00:03:50.269> better<00:03:50.829> if<00:03:51.829> you<00:03:52.400> really

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
was going to be better if you really

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.699 
was going to be better if you really
look<00:03:52.879> at<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.480> gross<00:03:53.780> numbers<00:03:54.290> there's

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
only about 15 million people the support

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.470 
only about 15 million people the support
virtually<00:03:57.650> all<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.829> the<00:03:58.519> casual<00:03:58.940> game<00:03:59.090> market

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
virtually all the the casual game market

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.039 
virtually all the the casual game market
and<00:03:59.919> during<00:04:00.919> the<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.609> height<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.030> pong<00:04:02.660> and

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
and during the the height of pong and

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.240 
and during the the height of pong and
pac-man<00:04:03.349> and

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
pac-man and

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.210 
pac-man and
and<00:04:04.370> space<00:04:05.030> invaders<00:04:05.480> he<00:04:05.810> got<00:04:05.990> up<00:04:06.140> to<00:04:06.380> about<00:04:06.410> 80

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
and space invaders he got up to about 80

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.500 
and space invaders he got up to about 80
to<00:04:07.370> 100<00:04:08.120> million<00:04:08.450> players<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:11.480> I

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
to 100 million players and and so I

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.420 
to 100 million players and and so I
believe<00:04:11.870> we're<00:04:12.170> just<00:04:12.200> getting<00:04:12.650> back<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:13.250> some

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
believe we're just getting back to some

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.120 
believe we're just getting back to some
of<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.790> height<00:04:14.270> that<00:04:14.510> we<00:04:14.630> received<00:04:15.170> before<00:04:15.380> do

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
of the height that we received before do

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.680 
of the height that we received before do
you<00:04:16.220> think<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.519> Nintendo<00:04:17.060> Wii<00:04:17.090> is<00:04:17.510> that

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
you think the Nintendo Wii is that

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.410 
you think the Nintendo Wii is that
revolution<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:18.680> may<00:04:19.040> get<00:04:19.340> more<00:04:19.760> women<00:04:20.000> and

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
revolution that may get more women and

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.390 
revolution that may get more women and
more<00:04:20.720> kids<00:04:21.019> involved<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.799> think<00:04:22.310> the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
more kids involved I think the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.240 
more kids involved I think the
combination<00:04:22.700> of<00:04:23.680> restaurants<00:04:24.680> like<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:25.010> wink

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
combination of restaurants like you wink

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.940 
combination of restaurants like you wink
as<00:04:25.460> we<00:04:25.640> grow<00:04:25.880> these<00:04:26.120> things<00:04:26.480> out<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:27.050> think<00:04:27.650> the

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
as we grow these things out I think the

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.060 
as we grow these things out I think the
fix<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.300> economic<00:04:29.630> model<00:04:30.440> like<00:04:30.620> I'm<00:04:30.920> on

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
fix of the economic model like I'm on

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.590 
fix of the economic model like I'm on
the<00:04:31.160> board<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.550> company<00:04:31.910> called<00:04:32.120> neo<00:04:32.330> edge

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
the board of the company called neo edge

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.410 
the board of the company called neo edge
that's<00:04:33.290> putting<00:04:33.790> advertising<00:04:34.790> with<00:04:34.940> in<00:04:35.120> video

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
that's putting advertising with in video

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.470 
that's putting advertising with in video
games<00:04:35.750> online<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.620> I<00:04:37.460> believe<00:04:37.880> that<00:04:37.910> some<00:04:38.330> of

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
games online and I believe that some of

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.310 
games online and I believe that some of
those<00:04:38.600> things<00:04:39.080> will<00:04:40.450> actually<00:04:41.450> create<00:04:41.780> a

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
those things will actually create a

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.159 
those things will actually create a
bigger<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:43.040> better<00:04:43.130> market<00:04:43.700> and<00:04:44.169> because

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
bigger and better market and because

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.720 
bigger and better market and because
once<00:04:45.380> you<00:04:45.500> get<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.770> economics<00:04:46.310> right<00:04:46.520> then

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
once you get the economics right then

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.250 
once you get the economics right then
you<00:04:46.850> get<00:04:47.000> more<00:04:47.120> money<00:04:47.300> pouring<00:04:47.690> into<00:04:47.930> it<00:04:48.169> and

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
you get more money pouring into it and

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.230 
you get more money pouring into it and
all<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.560> sort<00:04:48.740> of<00:04:48.860> thing<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:49.220> then<00:04:49.760> you<00:04:50.000> ink

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
all that sort of thing and then you ink

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.090 
all that sort of thing and then you ink
is<00:04:50.419> going<00:04:50.690> to<00:04:50.810> get<00:04:51.020> social<00:04:51.500> games<00:04:51.740> which

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
is going to get social games which

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.940 
is going to get social games which
brings<00:04:52.430> back<00:04:52.820> a<00:04:53.180> lot<00:04:53.419> of<00:04:53.690> mothers<00:04:54.530> and<00:04:54.890> young

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
brings back a lot of mothers and young

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.580 
brings back a lot of mothers and young
adults<00:04:55.520> and<00:04:55.940> things<00:04:56.180> like<00:04:56.390> that<00:04:56.450> that<00:04:57.230> haven't

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
adults and things like that that haven't

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.500
