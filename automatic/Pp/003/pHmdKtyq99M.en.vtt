00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
massive amount of water pretty cool over

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930 
massive amount of water pretty cool over
here<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.899> flatlands<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:44.040> not<00:00:44.309> much<00:00:44.550> but

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
here is the flatlands it's not much but

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.700 
here is the flatlands it's not much but
it's<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.750> pretty<00:00:46.050> big<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.410> could<00:00:46.590> build

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
it's it's pretty big you could build

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.950 
it's it's pretty big you could build
like<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> mansion<00:00:47.309> or<00:00:47.760> something<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.420> there's

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
like a mansion or something here there's

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.130 
like a mansion or something here there's
like<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> i<00:00:49.800> guess<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.700> connects<00:00:51.090> here<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.570> well

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
like a i guess it connects here as well

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
like a i guess it connects here as well
so<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.500> could<00:00:52.680> build<00:00:52.829> something<00:00:53.460> else<00:00:53.789> here

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
so you could build something else here

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.869 
so you could build something else here
whatever<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.899> want<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> good<00:00:56.550> seed

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
whatever you want so this is a good seed

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.299 
whatever you want so this is a good seed
for<00:00:57.180> survival<00:00:57.809> or<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.739> want<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.010> make<00:00:59.160> like

an adventure map so both creative and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.850 
an adventure map so both creative and
survival<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> pretty<00:01:03.390> good<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.860> I

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
survival this is a pretty good of I

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.399 
survival this is a pretty good of I
guess<00:01:05.250> seed<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.479> here's<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> mini<00:01:07.049> island
