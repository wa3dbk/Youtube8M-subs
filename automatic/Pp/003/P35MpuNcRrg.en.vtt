okay<00:00:00.329> in<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:01.020> port<00:00:01.410> here<00:00:01.860> we<00:00:02.190> got<00:00:02.460> two

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
okay in this port here we got two

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.990 
okay in this port here we got two
reference<00:00:03.449> points<00:00:03.540> that<00:00:04.110> we<00:00:04.259> can<00:00:04.470> play<00:00:04.680> with

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
reference points that we can play with

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.120 
reference points that we can play with
one<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.210> them<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.899> great<00:00:07.200> pillar<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.770> power

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
one of them is the great pillar of power

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.430 
one of them is the great pillar of power
and<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.639> other<00:00:08.849> one<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.540> bow<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.809> God<00:00:10.139> we

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
and the other one is the bow of God we

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.770 
and the other one is the bow of God we
were<00:00:10.650> moved<00:00:10.920> first<00:00:11.580> thing<00:00:11.940> look<00:00:12.240> how<00:00:12.509> much

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
were moved first thing look how much

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.950 
were moved first thing look how much
that<00:00:12.809> guy<00:00:13.440> right<00:00:13.950> here<00:00:14.309> look<00:00:14.610> at<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.719> can

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
that guy right here look at that you can

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.019 
that guy right here look at that you can
see<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.410> overhang<00:00:19.220> just<00:00:20.220> plain<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.760> day

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
see the overhang just plain is day

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.630 
see the overhang just plain is day
that's<00:00:21.840> come<00:00:22.289> now<00:00:22.590> I'm<00:00:22.650> also<00:00:22.980> going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> bring

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
that's come now I'm also going to bring

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.519 
that's come now I'm also going to bring
that<00:00:23.910> aluminum<00:00:24.449> down<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> little<00:00:24.990> bit<00:00:25.260> and

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that aluminum down a little bit and

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.310 
that aluminum down a little bit and
curtail<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.400> bleed<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.269> look<00:00:27.539> how<00:00:27.750> much<00:00:27.990> air

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
curtail and bleed so look how much air

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.529 
curtail and bleed so look how much air
the<00:00:29.010> only<00:00:29.250> thing<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.179> there<00:00:30.420> is

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the only thing it's going to be there is

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.459 
the only thing it's going to be there is
that<00:00:30.570> little<00:00:30.960> 11<00:00:31.529> 30<00:00:31.800> second<00:00:32.369> stem<00:00:32.610> which<00:00:33.239> is

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
that little 11 30 second stem which is

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:40.010 
that little 11 30 second stem which is
0.34<00:00:34.469> 3<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.760> God<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.570> 0.5<00:00:37.469> volt<00:00:37.890> -<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.090> this

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
0.34 3 that God is 0.5 volt - and this

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.900 
0.34 3 that God is 0.5 volt - and this
right<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.620> course<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.129> thick<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.460> we're

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
right here of course is thick so we're

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.060 
right here of course is thick so we're
dramatically<00:00:42.719> reducing<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:45.320> solid<00:00:46.320> stacks

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
dramatically reducing the solid stacks

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.180 
dramatically reducing the solid stacks
you<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.789> will<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.559> machine<00:00:49.559> metal<00:00:50.039> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
you if you will of machine metal that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.819 
you if you will of machine metal that
the<00:00:50.280> air<00:00:50.489> has<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:51.000> go<00:00:51.149> around<00:00:51.539> probably<00:00:51.930> 20

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the air has to go around probably 20

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.160 
the air has to go around probably 20
percent<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.420> math<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.899> from

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
percent I have to do the math on it from

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.680 
percent I have to do the math on it from
343<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:57.329> 505<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.949> we've<00:00:59.430> eliminated<00:00:59.730> that<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
343 to 505 so we've eliminated that and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.840 
343 to 505 so we've eliminated that and
that<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> major<00:01:01.559> turning<00:01:02.039> point<00:01:02.520> where<00:01:02.730> that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
that is a major turning point where that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.520 
that is a major turning point where that
air<00:01:03.090> has<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.600> dump<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.049> look<00:01:04.320> at<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
air has to dump so look at the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.670 
air has to dump so look at the
difference<00:01:04.949> there<00:01:05.159> not<00:01:05.939> come<00:01:06.270> over<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.900> look

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
difference there not come over here look

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.179 
difference there not come over here look
at<00:01:07.860> our<00:01:08.040> deal<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.729> no<00:01:09.030> God

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
at our deal here no God

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.219 
at our deal here no God
sticking<00:01:11.189> out<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.549> unproven<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.659> right<00:01:12.900> there

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
sticking out and unproven so right there

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.260 
sticking out and unproven so right there
we<00:01:13.380> got<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.619> kick<00:01:14.010> butt<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:14.670> let's<00:01:14.970> concentrate

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
we got a kick butt now let's concentrate

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.660 
we got a kick butt now let's concentrate
on<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.170> real<00:01:16.439> culprit<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.549> is

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
on the real culprit here that is

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.310 
on the real culprit here that is
absolutely<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.840> damn<00:01:19.170> mess<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.720> they<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:22.020> did

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
absolutely a damn mess and they just did

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.630 
absolutely a damn mess and they just did
not<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
not have to do it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.320 
not have to do it
but<00:01:24.570> they<00:01:24.930> did<00:01:25.200> look<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.670> straight<00:01:27.030> line

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
but they did look at the straight line

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.980 
but they did look at the straight line
if<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.960> will<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> divider<00:01:29.420> okay<00:01:30.420> now

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
if you will this is the divider okay now

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.539 
if you will this is the divider okay now
if<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.950> come<00:01:32.220> straight<00:01:32.700> look<00:01:33.060> what<00:01:33.270> happens

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
if you come straight look what happens

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.859 
if you come straight look what happens
to<00:01:35.549> my<00:01:35.670> little<00:01:36.290> scribe<00:01:37.970> boom<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.240> starts<00:01:39.630> right

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
to my little scribe boom it starts right

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.560 
to my little scribe boom it starts right
here<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:40.650> goes<00:01:40.829> out<00:01:41.040> look<00:01:41.310> at<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.570> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
here and then goes out look at that that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.620 
here and then goes out look at that that
right<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.530> almost<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.399> half<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.180> an<00:01:45.329> inch

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
right there is almost a half of an inch

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.109 
right there is almost a half of an inch
from<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.140> straight<00:01:46.560> wall<00:01:46.860> where<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.850> put

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
from that straight wall where they put

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.830 
from that straight wall where they put
that<00:01:48.360> pillar<00:01:48.689> now<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.520> meant<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.149> somewhat

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
that pillar now it is meant is somewhat

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.630 
that pillar now it is meant is somewhat
of<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.200> support<00:01:54.170> I've<00:01:55.170> seen<00:01:55.530> situations<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.579> at

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
of a support I've seen situations and at

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
of a support I've seen situations and at
first<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.210> scared<00:01:57.600> me<00:01:57.810> when<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.049> did<00:01:58.320> my<00:01:58.500> first

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
first it scared me when I did my first

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.030 
first it scared me when I did my first
set<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.969> successfully<00:02:00.479> -<00:02:01.140> probably

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
set but I have successfully - probably

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.039 
set but I have successfully - probably
20<00:02:02.430> pairs<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.969> these<00:02:03.090> heads<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.689> have<00:02:03.750> never

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
20 pairs of these heads that have never

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.980 
20 pairs of these heads that have never
had<00:02:04.380> any<00:02:04.710> problem<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.640> support<00:02:06.090> what

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
had any problem with the support what

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.680 
had any problem with the support what
they<00:02:07.170> used<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.740> do<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> 18<00:02:08.970> degree<00:02:09.360> head

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
they used to do on the 18 degree head

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.450 
they used to do on the 18 degree head
they<00:02:09.929> were

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
they were

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.340

here then is the valve lips it starts to

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.900 
here then is the valve lips it starts to

okay<00:02:55.100> we<00:02:55.880> got<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.330> giant<00:02:56.720> hump<00:02:57.170> here<00:02:57.500> rotting

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
okay we got this giant hump here rotting

okay we got this giant hump here rotting
away<00:02:57.950> now<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.270> is<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.870> one<00:03:00.110> single<00:03:00.680> reason

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
away now this is the one single reason

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.170 
away now this is the one single reason
why<00:03:01.990> most<00:03:02.990> of<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.350> aftermarket<00:03:04.100> heads<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.940> can

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
why most of the aftermarket heads I can

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.290 
why most of the aftermarket heads I can
take<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.450> double<00:03:06.350> hump<00:03:06.560> head<00:03:06.890> or<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.370> head<00:03:08.030> like

the tube in it I'm going to have about a

because they're not going to purposely
break<00:03:28.400> through<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.120> put<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.450> tube<00:03:29.810> because

break through and put a tube because

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.400 
break through and put a tube because

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
these companies are all about getting it

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.540 
these companies are all about getting it
in<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:36.050> getting<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.440> out<00:03:36.590> as<00:03:36.830> fast<00:03:37.100> as<00:03:37.370> they

in and getting it out as fast as they

in and getting it out as fast as they
can<00:03:37.610> that<00:03:38.450> also<00:03:38.690> means<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.500> human<00:03:39.920> hands

can that also means the human hands

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.680 
can that also means the human hands
would<00:03:40.520> have<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.880> be<00:03:41.030> involved

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
would have to be involved

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.740 
would have to be involved
they<00:03:42.110> can't<00:03:42.410> automatically<00:03:43.250> put<00:03:43.940> epoxy<00:03:44.270> in
