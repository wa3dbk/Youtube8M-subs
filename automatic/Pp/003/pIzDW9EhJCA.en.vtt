pieces i think because there's three
objects<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.220> 25<00:01:26.850> pieces<00:01:27.150> per<00:01:27.509> object<00:01:27.689> so

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
objects it just 25 pieces per object so

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.710 
objects it just 25 pieces per object so
the<00:01:28.619> odds<00:01:28.740> gonna<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.100> 25<00:01:29.700> pieces<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.479> is

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
don't want to have it smashed but you

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.150 
don't want to have it smashed but you
want<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.280> put<00:02:16.550> like<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.760> kind<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.180> texture<00:02:17.600> on<00:02:17.780> it

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
want to put like a kind of texture on it

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.840 
want to put like a kind of texture on it
but<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:20.480> yeah<00:02:20.660> that<00:02:20.870> if<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:21.500> only<00:02:21.530> want<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:22.070> nice

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
but so yeah that if you only want a nice

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.250 
but so yeah that if you only want a nice
texture<00:02:23.300> on<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.450> should<00:02:23.660> stop<00:02:23.870> watching<00:02:23.989> the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
texture on you should stop watching the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.760 
texture on you should stop watching the
tutorial<00:02:24.440> now<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.010> vendor<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.000> out<00:02:26.120> like<00:02:26.330> that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
tutorial now and vendor it out like that

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.770 
tutorial now and vendor it out like that
but<00:02:27.770> if<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.610> want<00:02:28.730> smash<00:02:29.060> then<00:02:29.510> we<00:02:29.630> can

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
but if you want smash then we can

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.620 
but if you want smash then we can
continue<00:02:30.320> right<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:32.360> can<00:02:32.480> see<00:02:32.600> the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
continue right and you can see the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.449 
continue right and you can see the
timeline<00:02:33.080> at<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.260> bottom<00:02:33.560> here<00:02:33.680> now<00:02:34.190> you've

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
timeline at the bottom here now you've

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.790 
timeline at the bottom here now you've
got<00:02:34.580> your<00:02:34.610> play<00:02:34.880> button<00:02:35.239> there<00:02:35.420> now<00:02:36.350> what

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
got your play button there now what

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.500 
got your play button there now what
happens<00:02:37.160> when<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.370> press<00:02:37.520> plate<00:02:37.790> smashes<00:02:38.360> but

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
happens when you press plate smashes but

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.030 
happens when you press plate smashes but
it<00:02:38.600> also<00:02:38.720> drops<00:02:39.170> at<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.410> same<00:02:39.560> time<00:02:39.770> so<00:02:39.950> you

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
it also drops at the same time so you

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.170 
it also drops at the same time so you
don't<00:02:40.070> want<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.370> smash<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.700> too<00:02:40.850> much<00:02:41.000> because

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
don't want to smash it too much because

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.580 
don't want to smash it too much because
otherwise<00:02:41.480> you'll<00:02:41.750> lose<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.080> effects<00:02:42.350> if<00:02:42.500> you

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
otherwise you'll lose the effects if you

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.490 
otherwise you'll lose the effects if you
light<00:02:42.739> room<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.550> if<00:02:44.269> I<00:02:44.450> was<00:02:44.600> your<00:02:44.750> press<00:02:45.050> play

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
light room so if I was your press play

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.009 
light room so if I was your press play
and<00:02:45.830> then<00:02:46.400> stop<00:02:46.670> at<00:02:46.820> one<00:02:46.970> frame<00:02:47.269> or<00:02:47.480> even<00:02:47.840> two

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
and then stop at one frame or even two

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.500 
and then stop at one frame or even two
frames<00:02:48.350> or<00:02:48.560> free<00:02:48.769> fames<00:02:49.070> depending<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:49.760> how

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
frames or free fames depending on how

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.600 
frames or free fames depending on how
smash<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.989> on<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.400> that's<00:02:52.400> free<00:02:53.150> phone<00:02:53.390> dreams

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
smash you on it that's free phone dreams

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.280 
smash you on it that's free phone dreams
yeah<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:58.450> don't<00:02:59.450> you'll<00:02:59.600> see<00:02:59.750> no<00:02:59.930> guys<00:03:00.140> who

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
yeah I don't you'll see no guys who

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.110 
yeah I don't you'll see no guys who
isn't<00:03:00.560> as<00:03:00.620> many<00:03:00.830> white<00:03:01.400> lines<00:03:01.670> in<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:01.970> isn't

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
isn't as many white lines in it isn't

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.360 
isn't as many white lines in it isn't
shown<00:03:02.450> here<00:03:02.720> usually<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.260> black<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:04.190> there

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
shown here usually the black but there

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.220 
shown here usually the black but there
are<00:03:04.459> some<00:03:04.700> white<00:03:04.940> ones<00:03:05.180> for<00:03:05.510> like<00:03:05.690> here<00:03:06.019> this

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
are some white ones for like here this

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.390 
are some white ones for like here this
will<00:03:06.350> probably<00:03:06.560> be<00:03:06.769> white<00:03:07.070> because<00:03:07.190> it's

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
will probably be white because it's

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.940 
will probably be white because it's
quite<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.820> big<00:03:08.030> one<00:03:08.209> maybe<00:03:08.959> even<00:03:09.290> there<00:03:09.620> as<00:03:09.769> well

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
quite a big one maybe even there as well

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.830 
quite a big one maybe even there as well
and<00:03:10.100> then<00:03:12.100> by<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.130> rendering<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:13.670> but<00:03:14.000> so

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
and then by the rendering that but so

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.259 
and then by the rendering that but so
yeah<00:03:15.049> I<00:03:15.079> usually<00:03:15.350> stop<00:03:15.799> up<00:03:16.570> one<00:03:18.070> if<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:20.090> don't

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
yeah I usually stop up one if you don't

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.759 
yeah I usually stop up one if you don't
like<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:20.630> though<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:21.230> want<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.500> go<00:03:21.560> back

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
like it though and you want to go back

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.370 
like it though and you want to go back
you<00:03:22.040> just<00:03:22.070> drag<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.030> backwards<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.750> zero<00:03:24.019> and

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
you just drag it backwards to zero and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.650 
you just drag it backwards to zero and
it'll<00:03:24.620> stop<00:03:25.180> all<00:03:26.180> right<00:03:26.299> there's<00:03:26.480> another

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
it'll stop all right there's another

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.360 
it'll stop all right there's another
method<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:27.140> can<00:03:27.260> do<00:03:27.410> now<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.620> stop<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.220> from

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
method you can do now to stop it from

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.030 
method you can do now to stop it from
smashing<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:29.360> much<00:03:29.600> now<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.440> take<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.799> three

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
smashing so much now you take you three

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.640 
smashing so much now you take you three
objects<00:03:31.430> when<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.420> don't<00:03:32.630> know<00:03:32.810> create<00:03:33.560> an

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
objects when you don't know create an

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.860 
objects when you don't know create an
extrude<00:03:34.040> NURBS<00:03:34.070> by<00:03:34.549> going<00:03:34.850> off<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.150> this<00:03:35.269> cube

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
extrude NURBS by going off to this cube

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.640 
extrude NURBS by going off to this cube
inside<00:03:36.400> cube<00:03:37.400> thing<00:03:37.870> hold<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:39.079> and<00:03:39.110> go<00:03:39.320> over<00:03:39.470> to

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
inside cube thing hold it and go over to

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.699 
inside cube thing hold it and go over to
extrude<00:03:40.040> NURBS<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:40.640> let<00:03:40.790> let<00:03:41.329> go<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:42.290> then<00:03:42.470> now

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
extrude NURBS and let let go so then now

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.530 
extrude NURBS and let let go so then now
you<00:03:42.769> want<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.160> you've<00:03:43.280> got<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:43.549> miss<00:03:44.030> extrude

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
you want it you've got this miss extrude

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.259 
you want it you've got this miss extrude
NURBS<00:03:44.570> so<00:03:45.260> now<00:03:45.500> you<00:03:45.560> click<00:03:46.250> your<00:03:46.430> objects<00:03:46.910> like

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
NURBS so now you click your objects like

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.060 
NURBS so now you click your objects like
you<00:03:47.390> did<00:03:47.540> before<00:03:47.600> first<00:03:48.170> one<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.560> shift<00:03:48.860> last

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
you did before first one and shift last

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.789 
you did before first one and shift last
one<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.910> then<00:03:50.420> drag<00:03:50.900> them<00:03:51.110> until<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.590> shows<00:03:51.769> a

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
one and then drag them until it shows a

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.979 
one and then drag them until it shows a
little<00:03:52.040> down<00:03:52.340> our<00:03:52.579> down<00:03:53.120> arrow<00:03:53.390> on<00:03:53.660> to<00:03:53.900> the

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
little down our down arrow on to the

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.380 
little down our down arrow on to the
extrude<00:03:54.350> NURBS<00:03:54.380> and<00:03:55.100> then<00:03:55.220> let<00:03:55.400> go

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
extrude NURBS and then let go

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.580 
extrude NURBS and then let go
can<00:03:56.510> see<00:03:56.660> now<00:03:56.810> they've<00:03:56.960> been<00:03:57.080> grouped<00:03:57.290> into

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
can see now they've been grouped into

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.640 
can see now they've been grouped into
the<00:03:57.860> extrude<00:03:58.220> NURBS<00:03:59.140> so<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.260> next<00:04:00.290> thing<00:04:00.500> you

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
the extrude NURBS so the next thing you

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.330 
the extrude NURBS so the next thing you
want<00:04:00.740> to<00:04:00.830> do<00:04:00.980> is<00:04:01.100> gone<00:04:01.250> mograph<00:04:02.170> effector

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
want to do is gone mograph effector

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.160 
want to do is gone mograph effector
random<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:05.300> that<00:04:05.480> will<00:04:05.569> create<00:04:05.690> a<00:04:05.840> random

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
random and that will create a random

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.170 
random and that will create a random
effects<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.800> drop<00:04:07.069> that<00:04:07.130> in<00:04:07.459> now<00:04:07.610> above

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
effects so you to drop that in now above

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.360 
effects so you to drop that in now above
everything<00:04:08.480> else<00:04:08.690> like<00:04:09.350> but<00:04:09.890> still<00:04:10.190> in<00:04:10.280> the

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
everything else like but still in the

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.920 
everything else like but still in the
groups<00:04:10.610> or<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.850> top<00:04:11.030> thing<00:04:11.270> in<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.510> group<00:04:11.720> and

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
groups or the top thing in the group and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.660 
groups or the top thing in the group and
then<00:04:12.530> you<00:04:12.590> want<00:04:12.740> to<00:04:12.770> go<00:04:12.860> down<00:04:13.100> here<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.520> the

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
then you want to go down here to the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.349 
then you want to go down here to the
these<00:04:14.600> settings<00:04:15.020> and<00:04:15.350> go<00:04:15.380> to<00:04:15.500> de<00:04:15.920> farmer<00:04:16.359> so

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
these settings and go to de farmer so

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.360 
these settings and go to de farmer so
now<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:17.630> want<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:17.959> change<00:04:18.169> the<00:04:18.440> deformation

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
now you want to change the deformation

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.580 
now you want to change the deformation
to<00:04:19.519> objects<00:04:20.209> as<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.870> can<00:04:20.989> see<00:04:21.140> now<00:04:21.320> it's<00:04:21.470> just

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
to objects as you can see now it's just

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.409 
to objects as you can see now it's just
drop<00:04:22.010> down<00:04:22.250> quite<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.580> bit<00:04:22.700> so<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.120> want<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.330> go

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
drop down quite a bit so you want to go

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.110 
drop down quite a bit so you want to go
to<00:04:23.480> parameter<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.410> these<00:04:25.070> three<00:04:25.520> here<00:04:25.760> that

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
to parameter and these three here that

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.550 
to parameter and these three here that
are<00:04:26.210> all<00:04:26.300> 50<00:04:26.720> you<00:04:26.780> want<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:26.960> come<00:04:27.050> back<00:04:27.230> to<00:04:27.290> zero

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
are all 50 you want to come back to zero

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.960 
are all 50 you want to come back to zero
and<00:04:30.560> girls<00:04:31.040> bats<00:04:31.250> why<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.520> originally<00:04:31.910> was

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
and girls bats why it originally was

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.300 
and girls bats why it originally was
next<00:04:32.840> you<00:04:32.900> want<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:33.080> click<00:04:33.320> this<00:04:33.590> box<00:04:33.980> it's

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
next you want to click this box it's

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.880 
next you want to click this box it's
next<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.210> word<00:04:35.360> scale<00:04:35.810> over<00:04:36.169> there<00:04:36.380> click

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
next to the word scale over there click

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.100 
next to the word scale over there click
that<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:37.430> you'll<00:04:38.000> bring<00:04:38.270> up<00:04:38.419> three<00:04:38.630> settings

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
that and you'll bring up three settings

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.810 
that and you'll bring up three settings
and<00:04:39.380> now<00:04:39.500> if<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:39.950> move<00:04:40.130> those<00:04:40.310> around<00:04:40.460> it

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
and now if you move those around it

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.730 
and now if you move those around it
starts<00:04:41.150> smashing<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.630> bit<00:04:41.810> as<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:41.990> can<00:04:42.140> see<00:04:42.700> so

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
starts smashing a bit as you can see so

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.830 
starts smashing a bit as you can see so
the<00:04:45.740> settings<00:04:46.370> i<00:04:46.490> usually<00:04:46.880> use<00:04:46.910> our<00:04:47.240> minus

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
the settings i usually use our minus

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.730 
the settings i usually use our minus
point<00:04:48.230> eight<00:04:49.780> point<00:04:50.780> one<00:04:51.790> minus<00:04:52.790> point<00:04:53.660> to<00:04:54.110> and

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
point eight point one minus point to and

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.909 
point eight point one minus point to and
it<00:04:55.730> gives<00:04:55.940> you<00:04:56.030> like<00:04:56.180> this<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:57.500> smashed

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
it gives you like this the smashed

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.000 
it gives you like this the smashed
effect<00:04:58.310> but<00:04:58.820> not<00:04:59.210> like<00:04:59.450> down<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:00.440> just<00:05:00.800> bit

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
effect but not like down and just bit

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.550 
effect but not like down and just bit
smashed<00:05:01.310> it<00:05:01.610> smash<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:02.060> all<00:05:02.360> so<00:05:03.169> that<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.440> have

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
smashed it smash it all so that you have

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.640 
smashed it smash it all so that you have
like<00:05:03.740> equal<00:05:04.160> amounts<00:05:04.490> of<00:05:05.110> cracked<00:05:06.110> text

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
like equal amounts of cracked text

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:18.330 
like equal amounts of cracked text
everywhere<00:05:07.780> right<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:10.400> next

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.950 

once<00:05:19.340> it's<00:05:19.580> rendered<00:05:19.759> out<00:05:20.059> I'll<00:05:20.449> show<00:05:20.689> you<00:05:20.749> it

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
once it's rendered out I'll show you it

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:30.219 
once it's rendered out I'll show you it
rendered<00:05:27.370> I've<00:05:28.370> can't<00:05:28.639> be<00:05:28.699> bothered<00:05:28.879> I<00:05:29.240> have<00:05:29.960> a

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
rendered I've can't be bothered I have a

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.049 
rendered I've can't be bothered I have a
group<00:05:30.589> here<00:05:30.830> with<00:05:30.979> a<00:05:31.009> random<00:05:31.370> effects<00:05:31.759> are<00:05:31.879> in

00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:32.059 
group here with a random effects are in

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:35.950 
group here with a random effects are in
endure<00:05:32.629> when<00:05:33.289> I<00:05:33.349> drop<00:05:33.740> this<00:05:34.309> group<00:05:34.870> under<00:05:35.870> the

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
endure when I drop this group under the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.649 
endure when I drop this group under the
random<00:05:36.259> of<00:05:36.379> that<00:05:36.529> sir<00:05:36.710> and<00:05:36.979> then<00:05:37.849> go<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.150> random

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
random of that sir and then go to random

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:42.059 
random of that sir and then go to random
effector<00:05:39.139> effects<00:05:39.740> and<00:05:39.889> change<00:05:40.189> the<00:05:40.370> strength

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:42.069 
effector effects and change the strength

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.089 
effector effects and change the strength
all<00:05:43.069> right<00:05:43.309> now<00:05:44.259> I've<00:05:45.259> got<00:05:45.319> a<00:05:45.469> drug<00:05:45.680> everything

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
all right now I've got a drug everything

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.969 
all right now I've got a drug everything
I<00:05:46.189> think<00:05:46.370> yep<00:05:47.360> when<00:05:48.289> you<00:05:48.379> drag<00:05:48.559> everything<00:05:48.830> out

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
I think yep when you drag everything out

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.739 
I think yep when you drag everything out
with<00:05:49.039> the<00:05:49.159> extrude<00:05:49.490> NURBS<00:05:49.520> laws<00:05:50.089> in<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.539> group

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:50.749 
with the extrude NURBS laws in the group

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:52.420 
with the extrude NURBS laws in the group
so<00:05:51.139> this<00:05:51.560> stuff<00:05:51.740> was<00:05:51.889> all<00:05:52.039> in<00:05:52.159> the<00:05:52.249> group

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
so this stuff was all in the group

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.510 
so this stuff was all in the group
before<00:05:52.629> so<00:05:53.629> you<00:05:53.719> just<00:05:53.990> drag<00:05:54.740> everything<00:05:55.219> from

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
before so you just drag everything from

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.459 
before so you just drag everything from
inside<00:05:55.849> out<00:05:56.060> next<00:05:56.779> to<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:56.960> random<00:05:57.229> of<00:05:57.349> that

00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:57.469 
inside out next to the random of that

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:59.920 
inside out next to the random of that
sir<00:05:57.680> and<00:05:57.889> it<00:05:58.550> gives<00:05:58.729> you<00:05:58.939> this<00:05:59.060> amazing<00:05:59.419> effect

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
sir and it gives you this amazing effect

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.779 
sir and it gives you this amazing effect
now<00:06:00.379> if<00:06:00.620> you<00:06:00.740> go<00:06:00.860> to<00:06:00.919> the<00:06:01.069> top<00:06:01.219> random<00:06:01.550> effects

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
now if you go to the top random effects

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.809 
now if you go to the top random effects
you<00:06:01.939> got<00:06:02.089> strength<00:06:02.419> and<00:06:03.279> you<00:06:04.279> can<00:06:04.490> move<00:06:04.669> that

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:04.819 
you got strength and you can move that

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:06.730 
you got strength and you can move that
around<00:06:04.879> and<00:06:05.509> you'll<00:06:05.629> give<00:06:05.960> some<00:06:06.139> nice<00:06:06.289> ripples

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
around and you'll give some nice ripples

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.800 
around and you'll give some nice ripples
and<00:06:06.949> stuff<00:06:07.189> so<00:06:07.819> if<00:06:07.909> you<00:06:08.029> want<00:06:08.180> a<00:06:08.240> tutorial<00:06:08.599> on

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
and stuff so if you want a tutorial on

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.760 
and stuff so if you want a tutorial on
the<00:06:08.960> ripples<00:06:10.689> just<00:06:11.689> say<00:06:11.839> so<00:06:11.899> the<00:06:12.259> description

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
the ripples just say so the description

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.010 
the ripples just say so the description
might<00:06:13.159> do<00:06:13.370> a<00:06:13.399> tutorial<00:06:13.669> on<00:06:14.060> the<00:06:14.180> ripples<00:06:14.569> as

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
might do a tutorial on the ripples as

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.889

frowsy looks really nice and gives off a
really<00:06:21.139> nice<00:06:21.469> effect<00:06:21.860> which<00:06:22.189> once<00:06:22.879> you<00:06:23.029> put
