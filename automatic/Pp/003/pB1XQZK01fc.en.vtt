00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.420 
because probably the best Bundesliga
team<00:03:18.090> by<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.299> end<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.110> series<00:03:19.290> will<00:03:20.010> be<00:03:20.220> a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
team by the end of the series will be a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.360 
team by the end of the series will be a
Dortmund<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.500> Dortmund<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.680> Bayern<00:03:23.010> Munich

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
Dortmund and Dortmund and Bayern Munich

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.400 
Dortmund and Dortmund and Bayern Munich
mix<00:03:23.790> now<00:03:24.209> as<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.329> can<00:03:24.450> see<00:03:24.510> in<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.989> team<00:03:25.170> so

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
mix now as you can see in the team so

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.130 
mix now as you can see in the team so
far<00:03:25.440> we<00:03:25.829> do<00:03:25.950> have<00:03:26.220> free<00:03:26.610> Munich<00:03:27.600> players<00:03:27.870> and

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
far we do have free Munich players and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.479 
far we do have free Munich players and
that<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.380> sign<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.680> we<00:03:28.890> are<00:03:28.980> getting<00:03:29.310> to

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
that is a sign that we are getting to

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.009 
that is a sign that we are getting to
the<00:03:29.579> close<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.120> end<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.810> series

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
the close of the end of the series

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.720 
the close of the end of the series
there's<00:03:31.650> probably<00:03:31.860> number<00:03:32.070> two<00:03:32.250> weeks<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.610> it

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
there's probably number two weeks of it

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.300 
there's probably number two weeks of it
left<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.060> we<00:03:33.120> believe<00:03:33.980> before<00:03:34.980> we<00:03:35.070> start

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
left and we believe before we start

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.509 
left and we believe before we start
moving<00:03:35.489> on<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.570> expensive<00:03:37.530> players<00:03:37.829> so

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
moving on to the expensive players so

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.490 
moving on to the expensive players so

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
off the bat it bounces straight out I

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.830

think it's schweinsteiger it might be

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.750 
think it's schweinsteiger it might be
even<00:04:47.900> directly<00:04:48.320> Schweinsteiger<00:04:49.160> dribbling

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
and a brilliant shot there to make it

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.690 
and a brilliant shot there to make it
free<00:04:53.720> one<00:04:53.960> just<00:04:54.290> before<00:04:54.410> halftime<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.310> he<00:04:55.490> did

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
free one just before halftime and he did

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.629 
free one just before halftime and he did
not<00:04:55.820> come<00:04:56.090> out<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.650> blocks<00:04:57.650> firing<00:04:58.460> after

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.120 
not come out of the blocks firing after
halftime<00:04:59.150> because<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.050> found<00:05:00.560> how<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.860> take

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
halftime because I found how to take

that's a free-kick I'm going to be doing
a<00:05:15.530> hell<00:05:15.650> of<00:05:15.680> a<00:05:15.800> lot<00:05:15.919> from<00:05:16.010> now<00:05:16.190> on<00:05:16.310> because<00:05:16.460> the

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
a hell of a lot from now on because the

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.820 
a hell of a lot from now on because the
success<00:05:17.570> I've<00:05:17.840> had<00:05:17.870> with<00:05:18.289> that<00:05:18.470> style<00:05:18.680> of

free-kick has been ridiculous and

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.810

hopefully if I can stop scoring free
kicks<00:05:23.240> it's<00:05:23.389> going<00:05:23.510> to<00:05:23.570> add<00:05:23.690> extra<00:05:23.930> goals<00:05:24.320> and

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500
