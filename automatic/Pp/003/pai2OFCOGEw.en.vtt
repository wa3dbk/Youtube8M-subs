just gonna unravel the twists and I
noticed<00:02:57.260> right<00:02:57.500> away<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:58.310> my<00:02:58.880> hair<00:02:59.180> was<00:02:59.870> very

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
noticed right away that my hair was very

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.030 
noticed right away that my hair was very
defined<00:03:01.330> okay<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.690> then<00:03:02.930> also<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:03.620> had<00:03:04.010> a

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
defined okay and then also I had a

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.280 
defined okay and then also I had a
little<00:03:04.400> bit<00:03:04.610> of<00:03:04.640> oils<00:03:05.180> on<00:03:05.510> my<00:03:05.750> hand<00:03:06.050> which<00:03:06.260> is

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
little bit of oils on my hand which is

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.920 
little bit of oils on my hand which is
fine<00:03:06.739> because<00:03:07.010> there's<00:03:07.400> natural<00:03:08.030> oils<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.780> I

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
fine because there's natural oils and I

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.100 
fine because there's natural oils and I
like<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.410> because<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:10.549> a<00:03:10.730> sign<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.110> my

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
like that because it it's a sign that my

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.650 
like that because it it's a sign that my
hair<00:03:12.319> is<00:03:12.350> not<00:03:12.650> going<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:12.980> frizz<00:03:13.310> up<00:03:13.340> but<00:03:13.940> the

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
hair is not going to frizz up but the

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.080 
hair is not going to frizz up but the
real<00:03:14.900> test<00:03:15.200> is<00:03:15.560> when<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:15.920> start<00:03:16.670> separating

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
real test is when I start separating

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.600 
real test is when I start separating
these<00:03:17.780> twists<00:03:18.170> but<00:03:18.440> as<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.709> can<00:03:18.830> see<00:03:18.890> it<00:03:19.400> looks

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
these twists but as you can see it looks

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.640 
these twists but as you can see it looks
really<00:03:19.700> pretty<00:03:20.209> doesn't<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.110> it<00:03:21.260> looks<00:03:21.470> very

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
really pretty doesn't it it looks very

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.500 
really pretty doesn't it it looks very
defined<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.519> it's<00:03:22.670> shiny<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.209> it's

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
defined and it's shiny and it's

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.570 
defined and it's shiny and it's
moisturized<00:03:26.530> but<00:03:27.530> like<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:27.920> said<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.370> real

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
moisturized but like I said the real

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.490 
moisturized but like I said the real
test<00:03:28.849> is<00:03:29.000> when<00:03:29.060> I<00:03:29.209> start<00:03:29.510> separating<00:03:29.989> the

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
test is when I start separating the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.250 
test is when I start separating the
twists<00:03:30.860> um<00:03:31.519> so<00:03:32.060> these<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:32.630> ones<00:03:32.840> in<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.080> back

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
twists um so these the ones in the back

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.589 
twists um so these the ones in the back
actually<00:03:33.590> did<00:03:34.040> not<00:03:34.190> dry<00:03:34.549> all<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:34.940> way<00:03:35.090> but<00:03:35.569> I

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
actually did not dry all the way but I

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.270 
actually did not dry all the way but I
really<00:03:35.780> wanted<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.170> see<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.500> results<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:37.250> I

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
really wanted to see the results so I

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.030 
really wanted to see the results so I
decided<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.910> untwist<00:03:38.330> them<00:03:38.599> anyways<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.470> it's

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
decided to untwist them anyways and it's

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.699 
decided to untwist them anyways and it's
a<00:03:40.130> little<00:03:40.489> bit<00:03:40.940> frizzy<00:03:41.299> in<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.840> back<00:03:42.079> but<00:03:42.530> once
