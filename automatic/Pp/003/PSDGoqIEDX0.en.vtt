fifth or a fourth of a scoop of well
here<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.319> am<00:02:56.410> doing<00:02:56.709> about<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.849> fourth<00:02:58.299> total

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.850 

makes<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.180> really<00:03:03.660> really<00:03:03.840> well<00:03:04.140> make<00:03:04.830> sure

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
makes that really really well make sure

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.230 
makes that really really well make sure
to<00:03:05.100> get<00:03:05.220> all<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.460> protein<00:03:05.640> powder<00:03:06.090> that's

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
to get all the protein powder that's

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.090 
to get all the protein powder that's
sticking<00:03:06.570> on<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.930> sides<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.590> don't<00:03:07.740> want<00:03:07.890> any

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
sticking on the sides you don't want any

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.430 
sticking on the sides you don't want any
clumps<00:03:08.610> because<00:03:09.300> when<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.720> heat<00:03:09.990> it<00:03:10.020> up<00:03:10.230> it

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
clumps because when you heat it up it

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.410 
clumps because when you heat it up it
can<00:03:10.650> tend<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.040> make<00:03:11.700> those<00:03:11.880> clumps<00:03:12.120> really

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
can tend to make those clumps really

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.780 
can tend to make those clumps really
hard<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.900> also<00:03:13.170> add<00:03:13.380> 2/3<00:03:13.860> cup<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.130> water<00:03:14.430> to

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
hard and also add 2/3 cup of water to

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.330 
hard and also add 2/3 cup of water to
water<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.210> down<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.860> we're<00:03:16.980> gonna<00:03:17.070> microwave

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
water it down and we're gonna microwave

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.330 
water it down and we're gonna microwave
that<00:03:17.760> for<00:03:18.000> two<00:03:18.330> minutes<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:22.830> could<00:03:23.010> overflow

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
that for two minutes it could overflow

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.910 
that for two minutes it could overflow
so<00:03:23.820> watch<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.210> as<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.870> go<00:03:25.050> cuz<00:03:25.260> I've<00:03:25.380> had<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.560> lot

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
of explosions so since everything's

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.680 
of explosions so since everything's
gonna<00:03:29.190> be<00:03:29.340> hot<00:03:29.580> I'm<00:03:29.820> gonna<00:03:29.970> put<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.360> bunch<00:03:30.570> of

gonna be hot I'm gonna put a bunch of

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.710 
gonna be hot I'm gonna put a bunch of
ice<00:03:30.840> cubes<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.590> my<00:03:32.130> cup<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:32.790> then<00:03:33.180> I'll<00:03:33.300> pour

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
ice cubes in my cup and then I'll pour

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.670 
ice cubes in my cup and then I'll pour
my<00:03:34.170> hot<00:03:34.440> coffee<00:03:34.770> over<00:03:35.490> that<00:03:36.410> then<00:03:37.410> I'm<00:03:37.560> gonna
