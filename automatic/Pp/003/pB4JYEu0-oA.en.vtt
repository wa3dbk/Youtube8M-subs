00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 welcome to my second review on 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.629
 the season animes last time 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.389
 many of you complained that I went 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.580
 very strict I recognize that maybe I 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.670
 remove more merit from that which has parashah 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.379
 and therefore I will make some modifications like this 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.640
 that if I got carried away by his bad 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.800
 presentation but as history 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.109
 essentially still a good mood 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.449
 even so my points have not changed in what 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.260
 absolute will last had a lousy 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.300
 production 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.519
 dieter man developed by comedy 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.859
 of desperate is a fucking show in 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.719
 where nothing happens and a and kuma has a 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.090
 very simple story stuffed with straw 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.710
 symbolic insufferable and although that does not 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.809
 Mary is boring and just see what the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.910
 consell is so no I'm not being 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.520
 very strict you are the ones who have 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.110
 a very low standard and sadly not 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.910
 wait for them to say many things worthy of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.100
 this season that happened or the next 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.050
 I can not lie to you this year, surely 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.510
 it will end up being a very bad one for the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.690
 anime let's start with that abomination 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.989
 called tonioni and danae we all know 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.059
 what is otaku proxenetism the story is 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.220
 absurd the characters are a stone 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.780
 the elements are ridiculous and there's no 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.330
 true attention 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.030
 we know what is screwed but why is it 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.250
 so popular then because everyone sees it 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.020
 just to see the tits this one at a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.700
 wild shit that does not even have 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.590
 personality and I do not even know by 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.619
 what he sees as more material 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.360
 probatory is to say is a bored child 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.080
 that is not even sexy and adorable does not have 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.369
 character is bitch nor me without my boy 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.680
 if he masturbates again with drawings 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.690
 well hentai just got out of it 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.100
 jikan which is delicious because it is 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.899
 about stopping the time and waited for 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.460
 online another ridiculous concept that neither 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.200
 It's even funny because the joke 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.509
 look panties is being spent on the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.070
 anime for 50 years and the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.770
 characters do not have personality either 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.390
 so what else do I have to say has 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.750
 good technical section but has nothing 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.360
 more than an equine showman another of these 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.340
 cooking shows and morbid jokes and yes 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.830
 it's another delayed show but at least 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.990
 he tries a little bit he said he has a 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.250
 boring premise but at least he gets it 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.869
 effort to characterize the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.019
 characters and in creating situations 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.700
 funny is not enough yet everything 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.680
 is ruined with loose jokes about 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.629
 how women excite when eating 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.129
 It is not other but definitely not 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.370
 something that would never ever see 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.439
 ninja schleyer of animation a show that 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.480
 it promised a lot apparently a new kit 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.159
 the kill but that ended up being a 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.349
 mediocrity that does not even serve to 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.389
 be a joke in bad taste animation of 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.489
 power point and idiotic story is to say 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.900
 he had a hell with which he was half 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.870
 penis but what the fuck to repeat the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.250
 joke already gave grace the first time 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.290
 but we will not be seeing with 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.359
 killer poyo all life trigger do 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.689
 another kill that the djukic cat at 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.579
 counter comedy idiot generic number 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.689
 10,000 taking as a reference to a 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.519
 popular franchise to get 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.930
 easy audience but that destroys by 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.340
 complete the purpose of the franchise 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.019
 original gives a characterization 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.540
 totally different and delayed to the 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.549
 characters and that I would not even have for 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.790
 what to see with this franchise in the first 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.790
 place 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.780
 yes but as I independent follows 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.730
 being shit quay or noble air cagon 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.859
 is a generic yoyo magician that 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.079
 remember that winning is no longer pods from 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.760
 many years ago it is not even 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.379
 fun to throw crap because nobody 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.489
 saw and by the case is unanimous where 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.950
 they just take the subject 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.200
 If you have insomnia, I recommend it 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.660
 fear of boredom and vicky euphonium 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.879
 a show that everyone loves and loves 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.590
 because that's what you're going for and so 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.660
 all the time the episodes are going on 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.580
 nothing the problems are insignificant and 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.620
 if the characters have certain 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.410
 characterization and they are nice but it is 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.090
 a slice of nothing whores happens not even 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.099
 there is an evolution or a conflict but 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.769
 course is wonderful because 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.900
 colors are pretty and everyone is biting 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.290
 the bait yuri so that nobody sbs the 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.360
 final 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.280
 howard and it will not be ok from the first chapter 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.019
 It is copy of the first chapter of Chim 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.880
 equinox and the protagonist becomes 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.400
 the one chosen to stop at 22 because 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.349
 I do not know then in the second chapter 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.030
 returns a school anime because I do not know 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.410
 I guess the time to go to the 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.750
 school and focus on birthday 3 of 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.760
 side of the window if it's unanimous very 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.140
 retarded and it's not even fun 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.819
 being an animal of action held 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.010
 because all the fights are fixed two 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.209
 for convenience lost time and not 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.620
 they will see the second season the 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.260
 first was not good it was not to see 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.209
 the second with singers deals an anime 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.590
 that the lights that saw it was because 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.359
 it lasted a lot and had to do with the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.100
 planning as if that gave some 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.810
 indicative of what will be good and what 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.070
 surprise downloaded the characters are 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.670
 a stone not iphone with the assumption 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.740
 mystery 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.020
 has to start the series has a 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.300
 bunch of sprouts and nonsense stuff and 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.510
 the phishing or milord is a fucking shit 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.340
 and it's too slow many characters none 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.050
 it develops some only have one 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.410
 function on top of everything has nothing 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.180
 sense 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.440
 in short pretentious shit and one of the 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.170
 Worst anime I've seen in my life 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.910
 arslan senki unanimous with a pay without club 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.650
 and slow and a very boring narrative 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.510
 but you know that this one does not have very 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.970
 retailers doubts my gang so 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.340
 surprise this anime is good now yes 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.050
 as I said the racing is very slow and the 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.600
 boring narrative will drive away anyone 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.890
 of brno in fact if it's boring but what 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.660
 I believed because at least the story 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.160
 it makes sense does not go with stupidities 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.100
 and political conflicts are treated 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.170
 with a lot of maturity that caixa en sen or el 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.640
 best anime of the season would say a 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.380
 casual impressionable when in reality 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.820
 it's a huge disappointment coming from 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.010
 creator of try gone and having a 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.110
 technical section as majestic as 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.640
 I said the direction is great the drawing 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.290
 The color is very well taken care of 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.910
 precious the animation most of the 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.410
 time is fluid is loaded with 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.540
 special effects the soundtrack is 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.150
 wonderful but what does it all 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.350
 that if nothing happens the characters are not 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.520
 they develop and they are always doing 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.050
 rumbling antics 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.610
 of investment the narrative is 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.039
 incomprehensible there is no final goal 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.110
 apparent and this precious setting of 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.819
 futuristic city with humans living together 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.259
 with aliens is wonderful as 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:44.909
 concept but what is the use of 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.680
 concept if you're not doing anything with 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.210
 he expects a kind of action in 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.460
 dynamic but I did not have more than 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.110
 meaningless explosions wait for a guy 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.539
 of mystery mystery but everything is 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.979
 ambiguous wait at least out action 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.169
 of celebrated but that was fun 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.690
 but it's not the iphone nothing whores happens 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.699
 again so if the show is bad oren 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.409
 monogatari to a romantic comedy of the 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.210
 which did not expect anything but they know it is 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.800
 sympathetic has its problems like that 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.960
 kill time in nonsense and in plots 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.729
 nonexistent that many situations are 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.830
 convenient and generally very mellow 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:15.449
 but the same is good at the 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.919
 situations are funny the relationship 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.169
 loving develops itself unlike the 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.180
 most anime romances and also 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.060
 a topic about the 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.680
 male friendship very beautiful the truth and 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.960
 the winner of this season andrew 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.210
 is of course I stepped on them inside 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.520
 these two crossed a super blood 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.990
 male for real men yes 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.120
 on behalf of this one but you know why 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.400
 because of this I will speak in a next 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.470
 video so stay tuned 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.090
 lousy anime season in general and 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.460
 I really do not expect the next one to be 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.590
 better after all, we will not have 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.150
 yoyo still so tell me in the comments 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.150
 what do you think about this season
