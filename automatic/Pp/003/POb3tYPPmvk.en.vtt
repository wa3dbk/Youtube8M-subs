00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.870
 one of the few cities in the last castro and were built 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.519
 basin palmanova 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.519
 very close to bengasi 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.350
 according to them holaciudad tevé to make work 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.470
 useless for its inhabitants 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.369
 should have walls to protect against the attacks of armies 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.560
 enemies 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.489
 these walls 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.679
 defend the city against the times natural disasters 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.129
 this city 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.979
 It has a star shape to remind us 

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:41.639
 in the city of Zacatecas have little to do with a homer 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.280
 many times polls say 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.020
 pose a question of whether it was possible to realize this city is 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.800
 ideals 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.280
 maybe yes from the urban point of view 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.850
 and from the social point of view 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.240
 for example 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.520
 venice could make a heavenly date in the eyes of artists 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.499
 but the authentic denunciation is not as perfect as a painting 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.640
 now and then it was a city with problems 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.979
 not everything explains in its streets and its water channels can be a source of 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.979
 infectious diseases for the inhabitants 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.710
 some philosophers thought that urbanism 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.249
 It was not just a matter of aesthetics but also of politics 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.380
 to prove it they resorted to fantasy 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.310
 At the beginning of the twentieth century the English thomas moro wrote a small book 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.310
 called feet worship 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.869
 in its pages 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.909
 they carried the story of a fantastic island whose inhabitants lived in 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.740
 conditions of equality 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.720
 the island 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.680
 arias 54 societies 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.340
 all of them incidents 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.340
 but we expect tíflis 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.269
 at the time of the Renaissance 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.239
 also a pious act was something very solemn 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.989
 it was thought that if we continue with their perfect cities with our 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.169
 institution 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.879
 sooner or later we could turn them into a palpable reality 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.310
 still today we use the word utopia 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.740
 to receive critical alvarez that do not exist 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.069
 to 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.919
 concluded by asking they came true instead 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.559
 the new spain 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.559
 Basque of Quiroga the first Bishop of Michoacán 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:04.239
 follow the instructions of Thomas Moor and founded the villages of the Holy Faith of the 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.579
 mountain near the city of mexico 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.929
 and santa fe de la lago and michoacán next to the lake of patzcuaro 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.099
 Basque of Quiroga I intend that the organization of these populations that 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.379
 she loved villages hospitals 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.829
 outside like the one of the fantastic cities of utopia 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.040
 and it is interesting to compare what happened to them after 500 years 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:44.779
 holy faith of the mountain well the completely political ideas of mexico 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.300
 its intention is that of international prestige 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.570
 the holy faith of the lagoon 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.840
 still exists and if I will be Sanchez confirmed or denied the afip today 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.220
 practicing many of the customs cyclists were studied that is difficult 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.310
 in america we had more renaissance zacatecas city than in europe 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.459
 that were built on the ruins of the cities that had destroyed 

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:40.459
 the Europeans 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.570
 the Spanish conquistadors did not care that there were already large cities 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.290
 as tenochtitlan in Mexico they were destroyed to build others that 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.350
 according to them they decided to correct according to fashion the tastes of the time 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.580
 bauzá 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.449
 with these ages a statement of the who 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.330
 specifically gridded calls girls as the perfect city of the ancients 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.809
 greek 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:29.719
 puebla de los ángeles that was founded shortly after the conquest of Mexico 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:34.499
 was delayed with incidental strings to prevent the streets if they were 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:36.650
 chueca 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.199
 motorcycle toribio 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.170
 the Franciscan highway 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.170
 he was the founder of the city of puebla 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.870
 hammon we have discovered the disturbances in hastings clues in the forts that are 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.569
 as small cities that the Spaniards built on the coasts of America 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.400
 to protect yourself from pirates 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.110
 for example the fort of San Juan de Ulúa against Veracruz although it was 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.020
 built a little later reproduces in an admirable way the drawings of the 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.960
 16th century architects
