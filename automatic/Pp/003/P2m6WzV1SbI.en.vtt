 downloads that will take a while and start 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.690
 the game 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.459
 the game is pretty good and scattered 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.459
 a park and you'll have a quick game 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.430
 the classic campaign that is to play 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.430
 competitive matches 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.579
 and well, here they go from that party 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.579
 Quick 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.400
 well this way it teaches you a little play 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.130
 although first you do a tutorial 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.050
 how to see a player if you go to 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.130
 different things that the game marks me 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.130
 also together 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.640
 and then to launch 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.030
 with the suspension throws and pull towards or 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.030
 soon 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.690
 good shot inside switch 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.840
 shed 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.100
 and continue to make mattes turned more 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.400
 fun game since they are very 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.400
 exaggerated 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.380
 at least it's already a game of grace 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.380
 fire that are very exaggerated 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.700
 good to see when we finished camier of 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.200

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.200
 the mates or older 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.670

 about your exercise plugging this too 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:55.500
 it is one of my easiest in the game 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.500
 when one throws your income without a cap 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.080
 and tires soon the plug is not 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.840
 can make another one that wants to jump 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.750
 when the value is very high because 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.750
 They take a long time to pull is like here 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.249
 the equipment of a plug when the ball 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.469
 be for it to play 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:24.319

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.970
 and the third robbery following exercise 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.970

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.970
 much 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.630

 the legends you can stop content 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.640
