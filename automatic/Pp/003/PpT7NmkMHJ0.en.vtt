00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.320
 hi of the world 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.150
 these gones were therefore, if need be, we 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.070
 to find a homo rate a tutorial 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.250
 very expected since a lot of people 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.210
 asked me for a tutorial on the effects of 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.120
 colors that I did in the 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.820
 graffiti so that's so today 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.829
 is going to be this tutorial so has it all so 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.250
 first I will show you several 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.560
 two number methods that I do 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.350
 so the first is simply 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.900
 so degrade it so I will make you 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.989
 So this with three to 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:57.280
 so here is the denounced level the 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:01.809
 lime green the grace and would 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.180
 bellissime seems so I'm going to you 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.950
 so showing the degrade is enough 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.990
 simple so it's always a 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.180
 Consistency and in lighter colors 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.170
 so especially so here I'm going to start 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.310
 the darker color down so then 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:22.630
 we pass a first layer of veyron 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.030
 it's all the way down like this 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.040
 not to go back several times to go 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.840
 it's pretty wet foot 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.460
 it's very convenient at the nose 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.760
 graded to then have our fade 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.060
 so we go right away it does not 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.850
 second layer so the second glass 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.630
 from above so the first what 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.340
 clearly shows that the fade so there 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.409
 we start to see a beginning of 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:00.390
 degrade then we move quickly makes a 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:03.270
 little layer on top to limit it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:10.430
 and there we see that we are starting to have 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:15.030
 my twin graded so here we continue 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:17.760
 like these chained away with the 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.940
 third to say that I appreciate 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.940
 a lot 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:30.060
 so we always iron a thin layer 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.640
 over the previous one to give this 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.400
 degrading effect that we will get 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:41.250
 we always go back a second layer 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.590
 of glass actually by ironing the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.959
 second layer of glass the two 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.570
 imbued colors get confused 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.050
 So that's what will allow 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:55.040
 degrade it so we do not hesitate 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:59.040
 so here I want to enlarge the space 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.800
 light green we will show you the pretty 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.330
 degraded 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.970
 so here is the com you can 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.160
 observe so we have good opposing dark 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.730
 until light green so with a whole 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.600
 progression so it works for all 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.360
 the different colors 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.280
 not sure so here I am going to show you a 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.959
 second method so the one that 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.380
 I use more often in my 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:29.450
 graphs since I saw that my arm 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:31.980
 just that I rarely use the 3d so 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.290
 here 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:40.920
 so always a little to delineate 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:43.440
 what is the shave that surprises me 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.840
 so we will take another good color 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.799
 change we will learn something other than 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.799
 the good green go for example a blue 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:55.049
 these blues there so it's the signal so 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.160
 we will go through the color that goes 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:06.530
 knock down the color that we 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:06.530
 interested so here 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.880
 so here is then the part the 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.850
 more interesting 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:26.060
 it is this so takes marker has it so that 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:27.680
 there are so actually if marc collat 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.320
 that will allow us to shadow 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.620
 in 15 years we will bring the shadow of 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.610
 this side then we all go the shadow that 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.669
 will arrive here 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:45.610
 so if we apply immediately a 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:45.610
 layer makes two kills slightly 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:58.550
 like these we can iron a little bit of 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:58.550
 blue over it here 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.170
 so here we go 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.320
 so we can see that there is the shadow of 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.300
 this side there so we come from the gray goes 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.340
 allow background is the color that 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.550
 is our base actually the color of 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:26.360
 basis that we applied so go out 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.030
 with the features I really approve what 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.950
 the panel can not hurt 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.580
 number at the level of the goal graphs that get 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:37.220
 superimpose good lettering 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.470
 so here's one when I was asked 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.470
 also so how do I get to do so 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.780
 gradients but multiple colors 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.400
 so there especially I made a range of 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.960
 glasses but I manage to do the 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:55.430
 slavers of several colors in particular 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:58.930
 the one guy I was proposing to uncle carmine 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.190
 a color that would go ben what 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:05.030
 I use a lot in my graphs so 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.150
 it's the color and rape 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.590
 were the music 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.720
 so these are two colors downright 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.420
 opposite and I make you look a 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.090
 gradient of these two colors 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.810
 so it's not complicated 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:23.440
 exactly the tunic that the first 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:32.090
 so we will apply a good layer of 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:33.620
 so carmine there then we redid 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:38.630
 always the same, so we apply 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:40.810
 always a little layer at the edge of the 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.810
 first 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:49.440
 this is like this one and we do not hesitate 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.220
 to iron each time and 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:56.400
 gradually 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:59.520
 you're going to see body we're going to get a 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.910
 color squarely mix between the 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:06.690
 purple and finish it just look 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:10.800
 middle one has a kind of rose a man 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:12.599
 pretty clear that's how we go 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.990
 to make a gradient of colors 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:20.789
 So that's where you've seen us go 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.870
 from purple to so it works with 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:23.880
 any color 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:28.050
 of course we must avoid 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.789
 colors quite dark because a color 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:33.870
 darker will dominate on a colors 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:35.880
 clear that everybody knows so he 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.900
 there are several so couple of colors that 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.460
 go well together that I can you 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:45.150
 ask in particular so this is the 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:47.880
 color there are the chestnuts that go 

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:50.520
 very well with orange too and after 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.259
 good it's up to you to see what you 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.669
 want to do that test yourself it's like 

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:55.710
 I do all I always had a little 

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:57.479
 sheet next to me that serves me 

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:01.080
 palettes for me to do small tests 

00:07:57.479 --> 00:08:04.139
 and see if I like it or not and that's it 

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.969
 what is the gorilla 

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:07.380
 term a sharp early so the colors 

00:08:05.969 --> 00:08:09.060
 I hope I have answered all your 

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.409
 questions and we end up for the 

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.699
 next time for a new tutorial 

00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:13.699
 go hello
