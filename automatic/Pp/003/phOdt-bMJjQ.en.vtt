stupid that they're doing that I think

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.370 
stupid that they're doing that I think
they're<00:03:06.030> losing<00:03:06.270> out<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.540> lot<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.960> traffic<00:03:07.170> a

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
they're losing out a lot of traffic a

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.000 
they're losing out a lot of traffic a
lot<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.620> ad<00:03:07.740> revenue<00:03:09.590> but<00:03:10.590> but<00:03:10.890> they're

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
lot of ad revenue but but they're

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.990 
lot of ad revenue but but they're
blocking<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.370> for<00:03:11.490> some<00:03:11.610> reason<00:03:11.850> they<00:03:11.940> think

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
blocking it for some reason they think

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.270 
blocking it for some reason they think
that<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.600> TV<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.440> much<00:03:13.680> different<00:03:14.130> than<00:03:14.160> a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
that a TV is much different than a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.110 
that a TV is much different than a
laptop<00:03:15.050> but<00:03:16.050> when<00:03:16.320> really<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:17.310> two<00:03:17.520> forms<00:03:17.970> are

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
laptop but when really the two forms are

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.120 
laptop but when really the two forms are
merging<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.930> think<00:03:19.140> companies<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:19.920> are

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
merging and I think companies that are

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.650 
merging and I think companies that are
blocking<00:03:20.370> Google<00:03:20.730> TV<00:03:21.000> are<00:03:21.120> missing<00:03:21.390> out<00:03:21.510> on<00:03:21.540> a

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
blocking Google TV are missing out on a

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.229 
blocking Google TV are missing out on a
lot<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:21.959> opportunity<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:23.820> know<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:23.940> could<00:03:24.120> have

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
lot of opportunity you know I could have

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.940
