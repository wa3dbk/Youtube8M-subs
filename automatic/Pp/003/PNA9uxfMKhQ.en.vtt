00:00:05.187 --> 00:00:07.368
 I am late. 

00:00:07.368 --> 00:00:08.457
 Here, here! 

00:00:08.457 --> 00:00:10.080
 I'm going to work ! 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:13.912
 Why is he hurrying so much? 

00:00:20.702 --> 00:00:22.504
 Father, we are leaving. 

00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:24.740

00:00:37.286 --> 00:00:38.954

00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:17.102

00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:35.344
 As you know, the writer Kim suddenly went abroad. 

00:01:35.344 --> 00:01:38.381
 She is a great writer that we hired urgently. 

00:01:39.615 --> 00:01:44.220
 As she is not familiar with our company at the moment, 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.890
 I hope you can help her get settled and get along with her. 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.125

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:54.830
 Editor Lee. 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.935
 This person is a popular guy with Jeong Dong Jin PD girls 

00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:02.371
 Why do you say it like that? 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.008
 Nice to meet you 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:13.149
 Here is the speaker Lee Sung Jah, who will soon be a mother. 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.085
 This guy is the engineer Cha Woong Gil. 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.257
 Why am I just engineer Cha Woong Gil? 

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:23.359
 You discriminate me from the first day. 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.061
 That's what I mean. 

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:29.565
 I do not know what to say about you. 

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:34.703
 Ohhh why not the dazed engineer Cha Woong Gil. 

00:02:34.703 --> 00:02:37.639
 And why not "the deserved death of the engineer Chang Woong Gil"? 

00:02:39.074 --> 00:02:42.611
 Manager, do not you really like me? 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.215
 So do not make too many mistakes. 

00:02:55.824 --> 00:02:57.026
 Hello? 

00:02:57.026 --> 00:03:01.430
 Can I talk to Lee Min Do? I am the mother of Ho Suk. 

00:03:01.997 --> 00:03:03.131
 What? 

00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:05.568
 You know the reason for my call, right? 

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:08.874
 What do you mean ? 

00:03:08.874 --> 00:03:10.890
 You are so cheeky. 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.544
 You let someone beat my son up to hospital. How can you be so? 

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:17.664
 Hospitalized? 

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:21.700
 Young couples can break up if they do not like it anymore. 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.187
 How could you hurt him that way because he broke up? 

00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:29.358
 Let's be brief, tell me just who hurt my son. 

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:32.060
 You see ... It's ... 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.167
 If you do not tell me who it is, I report it to the police immediately. 

00:03:41.136 --> 00:03:42.304
 Aie! 

00:03:50.012 --> 00:03:51.113
 Who is here ? 

00:03:52.314 --> 00:03:54.450
 Is this Dong Jeong Shik's house? 

00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:58.520
 Yes, that's right, what is it? 

00:03:59.154 --> 00:04:00.413
 Is he here? 

00:04:01.624 --> 00:04:03.859
 Dong Shik! Dong Shik! 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.528
 I'm hungry. Give me some food. 

00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:08.898
 Dong Shik, Someone wants to see you. 

00:04:09.531 --> 00:04:10.599
 Who is it ? 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.270
 I do not know who it is. 

00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:16.205
 Are you Jeong Dong Shik? 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.807
 Yes who are you ? 

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:23.746
 Aie!
