 I welcome visitors to the site and Ukraine 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.819
 on iphone . ios 7 came to yesterday's Ipad 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.740
 beta 2 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.970
 available for apple tablets from 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.130
 second generation higher 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.650
 let's quickly run through the system 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.570
 and see what it brought in 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.220
 the first is the updated control center 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.840
 which had lost two buttons on 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.270
 compared to iphone and notification center 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.670
 just takes up the whole screen now what 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.019
 not bad updated multitasking 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.730
 looks and feels cool you can 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.769
 manage it completely without buttons 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.019
 it is called by gestures and 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.059
 manage absolutely also a preview of the country 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.920
 juicy beautiful and it really is 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.380
 big plus team for that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.000
 innovation updated photo 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.129
 it is their collage appearance by year 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.200
 deserves any praise if on the iphone 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.450
 it was some kind of designer visual 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.399
 the refinement on and it is really convenient 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.530
 convenient to navigate and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.780
 galleries and users who possesses 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.550
 not the first device and transfers 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.100
 photos carefully from one to another 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.980
 for them it will be generally manna from heaven 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.420
 because it is really very cool 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.850
 the camera is lost in contrast to the iphone 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.500
 version filters but got the notorious 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.420
 Square mode that you need rather for 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.729
 instagram users that not at all 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.130
 it is clear that he forgot to see here just 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.860
 for a tick note terrible if on 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.810
 the sixth version of ios she wasn't just not 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.700
 functional then here they are still ugly 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.710
 these yellow links and yellow elements 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.869
 interface causes rejection 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.820
 the reminder basically reminds us of 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.150
 the fact that it is better to download another horse tudu 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.009
 sheet because the functional is wretched 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.700
 view and what is now particularly good one 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.259
 background from the left safari it first 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.390
 turn touched redesign new 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.670
 functional, we will not see it at the factor 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.979
 also no due to the fact that visualization 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.290
 open tabs available as on 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.659
 desktop browsers they are in a separate 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.210
 window using this scroll like on 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.220
 iphone can stand out links 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.799
 social networks or by mail or 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.600
 messages and everything is basically the same as 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.610
 it was before but you see fonts 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.770
 crawling on each other but it's beta on 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.159
 for developers and not for those who 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.109
 surfing the net for 10 hours above it 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.179
 now let's try to move 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:08.060
 in horizontal mode to view 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.090
 how it all looks there multitasking 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.349
 support horizontal mode but 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.209
 the application does not roll themselves 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.970
 it takes you to do it 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.489
 let's get back in each of them 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.620
 in multitasking and then they too will 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.599
 in horizontal mode however 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.989
 everything works smartly no 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.599
 bugs with scrolling like 1 hit for what 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.090
 You can say thanks to the developers of 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.430
 apple in general it looks a little bit 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.190
 damp some applications crumble 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.060
 some open indecently long 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.519
 we can forgive 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.530
