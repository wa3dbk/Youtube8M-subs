00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.820 
want to write the code step-by-step then
you<00:03:44.400> can<00:03:44.580> just<00:03:44.970> come<00:03:45.390> here<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.930> copy<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.590> code

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
you can just come here and copy the code

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.400 
you can just come here and copy the code
and<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:48.900> use<00:03:49.350> as<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:53.780> second<00:03:54.780> thing<00:03:55.080> I

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
and just use as it is and second thing I

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.180 
and just use as it is and second thing I
want<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:56.040> say<00:03:56.310> is<00:03:56.840> just<00:03:57.840> join<00:03:58.380> me<00:03:58.410> here<00:03:58.920> as<00:04:01.190> more

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
want to say is just join me here as more

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.080 
want to say is just join me here as more
as<00:04:02.520> you<00:04:02.790> can<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.750> here<00:04:04.739> also<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.190> can

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
see what I am doing taking second thing

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.860 
see what I am doing taking second thing
is<00:04:10.340> there<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.520> second<00:04:11.970> page<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.660> this

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
is there is a second page to this

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.340 
is there is a second page to this
channel<00:04:13.550> which<00:04:15.109> C++<00:04:16.109> code<00:04:16.459> examples<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:18.350> in

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
channel which C++ code examples and in

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:27.230 
channel which C++ code examples and in
here<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:20.150> have<00:04:21.150> given<00:04:22.130> some<00:04:23.130> of<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:26.490> C++<00:04:27.210> code

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
here I have given some of the C++ code

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.020 
here I have given some of the C++ code
which<00:04:28.200> I<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:28.590> have<00:04:28.950> learned<00:04:29.310> when<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:29.610> was

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
which I I have learned when I was

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.430 
which I I have learned when I was
learning<00:04:31.100> C++<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.820> these<00:04:33.240> are<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:34.169> code

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
learning C++ and these are the code

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.260 
learning C++ and these are the code
which<00:04:34.740> are<00:04:34.950> made<00:04:35.220> by<00:04:35.490> me<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:38.630> that<00:04:39.630> time<00:04:40.910> so<00:04:41.910> I

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
which are made by me and that time so I

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.440 
which are made by me and that time so I
have<00:04:43.050> solved<00:04:43.620> whatever<00:04:44.090> exercises<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.300> have

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
have solved whatever exercises I have

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.409 
have solved whatever exercises I have
solved<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:46.280> just<00:04:49.280> copied<00:04:50.280> them<00:04:50.669> and<00:04:50.940> paste<00:04:51.210> it

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
solved I just copied them and paste it

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.800 
solved I just copied them and paste it
there<00:04:51.720> here<00:04:52.470> so<00:04:52.950> if<00:04:54.410> you<00:04:55.410> require<00:04:55.919> or<00:04:56.340> you

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
there here so if you require or you

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.340 
there here so if you require or you
these<00:04:57.919> exercises<00:04:59.090> need<00:05:00.090> your<00:05:00.450> requirement

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
these exercises need your requirement

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
these exercises need your requirement
all<00:05:01.650> you<00:05:02.310> need<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:03.030> kind<00:05:03.630> of<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:04.169> code<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:05.190> can

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
all you need this kind of a code you can

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:12.110 
all you need this kind of a code you can
copy<00:05:05.610> from<00:05:06.479> here<00:05:06.570> directly<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.760> use<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:11.120> these

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
copy from here directly and use it these

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.040 
copy from here directly and use it these
are<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.419> very<00:05:12.930> general<00:05:13.590> examples<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:15.050> these

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
are the very general examples so these

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.500 
are the very general examples so these
will<00:05:16.350> help<00:05:16.560> you<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:17.100> understand<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.700> concepts

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
will help you to understand the concepts

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:27.170 
will help you to understand the concepts
of<00:05:19.550> C++<00:05:20.570> also<00:05:22.190> so<00:05:23.810> this<00:05:24.810> also<00:05:25.140> you<00:05:25.440> can<00:05:26.180> see

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
of C++ also so this also you can see

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.210 
of C++ also so this also you can see
here<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:29.120> you<00:05:30.120> can<00:05:30.800> give<00:05:31.800> me<00:05:32.039> your

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
here and you can give me your

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.200 
here and you can give me your
suggestions<00:05:32.669> what<00:05:33.360> do<00:05:33.570> you<00:05:33.690> want<00:05:33.930> more<00:05:35.210> and
