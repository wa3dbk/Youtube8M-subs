where<00:00:10.679> we<00:00:10.769> had<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> create<00:00:11.400> an<00:00:11.550> educational

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
where we had a create an educational

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.439 
where we had a create an educational
game<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:14.009> rift<00:00:14.240> so<00:00:15.240> here<00:00:15.809> we<00:00:15.900> go<00:00:17.270> got<00:00:18.270> some

and the score that we end up with and we
got<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> virtual<00:00:34.350> keyboard<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.040> use

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
got a virtual keyboard that we can use

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.170 
got a virtual keyboard that we can use
to<00:00:36.090> orient<00:00:36.510> ourselves<00:00:36.660> if<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.320> lost<00:00:37.469> so

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
to orient ourselves if we get lost so

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:46.369 
to orient ourselves if we get lost so
here<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.270> go<00:00:41.420> start<00:00:43.309> yeah<00:00:44.309> M<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.239> again<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.260> can

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
here we go start yeah M so again you can

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:58.279 
here we go start yeah M so again you can
see<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> keys<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.920> you're<00:00:47.719> pressing<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:57.289> h2

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
see the keys that you're pressing on h2

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.229 
see the keys that you're pressing on h2
it's<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> bit<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.520> slow<00:00:59.760> start<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
it's a bit of a slow start in the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.830 
it's a bit of a slow start in the
beginning<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:02.070> difficulty<00:01:02.840> eventually

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
beginning but the difficulty eventually

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.890 
beginning but the difficulty eventually
ramps<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.379> quite<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> bit<00:01:05.600> eventually<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:06.689> start

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
ramps up quite a bit eventually we start

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.620 
ramps up quite a bit eventually we start
getting<00:01:07.020> full<00:01:07.409> words<00:01:07.790> they<00:01:08.790> are<00:01:08.820> longer<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
getting full words they are longer and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.350 
getting full words they are longer and
longer

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.399 

we<00:01:17.360> also<00:01:17.479> have<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.720> little<00:01:17.869> score<00:01:18.080> right<00:01:18.380> here

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
we also have a little score right here

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.870 
we also have a little score right here
that<00:01:18.619> says<00:01:18.680> how<00:01:19.040> many<00:01:19.250> layers<00:01:19.460> we've<00:01:19.700> actually

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
that says how many layers we've actually

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.850 
that says how many layers we've actually
typed<00:01:20.299> successfully<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.439> right<00:01:21.560> now<00:01:21.590> I'm<00:01:21.740> at

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
typed successfully so right now I'm at

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.990 
typed successfully so right now I'm at
12<00:01:22.810> we<00:01:23.810> go<00:01:23.960> first<00:01:24.259> words<00:01:24.530> ok<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:25.700> ok<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:28.000> hi

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
12 we go first words ok and ok and hi

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:40.410 
12 we go first words ok and ok and hi
hello<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:30.290> too

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.930 

so<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:41.570> prototype<00:01:42.160> prototype<00:01:43.160> only<00:01:43.790> took

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
so this prototype prototype only took

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.320 
so this prototype prototype only took
about<00:01:44.740> 35<00:01:45.740> hours<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.370> make<00:01:46.490> over<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.880> weekend

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
about 35 hours to make over a weekend

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.120 
about 35 hours to make over a weekend
and<00:01:49.510> it's<00:01:50.510> currently<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.440> field<00:01:51.770> we're<00:01:52.010> going

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
and it's currently the field we're going

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.670 
and it's currently the field we're going
to<00:01:52.190> use<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:53.360> submit<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.930> any<00:01:54.080> k<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.410> hopefully

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
to use the submit to any k to hopefully

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.490 
to use the submit to any k to hopefully
get<00:01:54.950> in<00:01:55.100> this<00:01:55.220> year<00:01:58.570> although<00:01:59.570> if<00:02:00.200> we<00:02:00.320> make<00:02:00.440> it

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
get in this year although if we make it

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.440 
get in this year although if we make it
into<00:02:00.680> any<00:02:00.770> cable<00:02:01.130> probably<00:02:01.430> switch<00:02:02.120> this<00:02:02.240> over

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
into any cable probably switch this over

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:11.650 
into any cable probably switch this over
to<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.780> different<00:02:03.170> engine<00:02:03.340> may<00:02:04.340> be<00:02:10.540> trying<00:02:11.540> to

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
to a different engine may be trying to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:20.080 
to a different engine may be trying to
get<00:02:11.750> intense<00:02:12.020> we're<00:02:12.470> at<00:02:12.530> 60<00:02:12.890> right<00:02:13.040> now<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:19.090> so

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
get intense we're at 60 right now and so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.080 
get intense we're at 60 right now and so
the<00:02:20.450> point<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:20.810> game<00:02:21.700> would<00:02:22.700> be<00:02:22.760> to

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the point of this game would be to

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.600 
the point of this game would be to
hopefully<00:02:23.590> teach<00:02:24.590> people<00:02:24.830> how<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.130> type

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
hopefully teach people how to type

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.680 
hopefully teach people how to type
without<00:02:25.790> actually<00:02:26.240> looking<00:02:26.330> at<00:02:26.540> their

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
without actually looking at their

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.890 
without actually looking at their
keyboard<00:02:27.550> it's<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.610> lot<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:28.790> people<00:02:29.000> oh<00:02:29.360> no

a<00:02:38.450> lot<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.870> people<00:02:39.459> seem<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.490> have<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> habit<00:02:40.910> of

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
a lot of people seem to have a habit of

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.710 
a lot of people seem to have a habit of
looking<00:02:41.240> at<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.540> keyboard<00:02:41.720> while<00:02:42.050> they<00:02:42.170> type

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
looking at the keyboard while they type

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.050 
looking at the keyboard while they type
and<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.750> one<00:02:44.989> day<00:02:45.110> tired<00:02:45.760> while<00:02:46.760> looking<00:02:46.970> at

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
and that one day tired while looking at

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.620 
and that one day tired while looking at
their<00:02:47.209> keyboard<00:02:49.150> they<00:02:50.150> actually<00:02:50.420> could<00:02:50.480> do<00:02:50.570> a

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
their keyboard they actually could do a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.740 
their keyboard they actually could do a
lot<00:02:50.930> more<00:02:50.959> fun<00:02:51.830> looking<00:02:52.130> away<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.540> kind<00:02:53.690> of

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
lot more fun looking away so it kind of

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.190 
lot more fun looking away so it kind of
