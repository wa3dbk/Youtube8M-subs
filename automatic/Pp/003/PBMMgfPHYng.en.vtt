about<00:01:13.690> our<00:01:13.840> debt<00:01:14.229> you<00:01:14.470> say<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.009> GOP

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
about our debt you say that the GOP

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.550

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
the funding out of Obamacare you're

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.050 
the funding out of Obamacare you're
saying<00:01:23.740> you'd<00:01:23.860> let<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.159> country<00:01:24.490> go<00:01:24.640> into

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
saying you'd let the country go into

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.690

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
default on this issue no I think the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.070 
default on this issue no I think the
president<00:01:28.179> would<00:01:28.270> let<00:01:28.450> this<00:01:28.600> go<00:01:28.780> into<00:01:28.960> default

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
president would let this go into default

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.660 
president would let this go into default
and<00:01:29.470> then<00:01:29.679> you<00:01:29.860> would<00:01:29.979> make<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.310> the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
and then you would make that the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.520 
and then you would make that the
condition<00:01:31.179> absolutely<00:01:31.630> not<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.840> pry<00:01:32.050> but<00:01:32.080> we

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
condition absolutely not to pry but we

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.580 
condition absolutely not to pry but we
do<00:01:32.710> not<00:01:32.830> want<00:01:33.009> to<00:01:33.130> just<00:01:33.310> have<00:01:33.580> some<00:01:34.409> naked<00:01:35.409> debt

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
do not want to just have some naked debt

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.580 
do not want to just have some naked debt
ceiling<00:01:35.920> increase<00:01:36.039> we<00:01:36.460> want<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.759> have<00:01:36.909> real

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
ceiling increase we want to have real

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.499 
ceiling increase we want to have real
fiscal<00:01:38.590> controls<00:01:39.280> real<00:01:39.759> spending<00:01:40.090> cuts<00:01:40.240> that

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
fiscal controls real spending cuts that

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.109 
fiscal controls real spending cuts that
go<00:01:40.750> with<00:01:40.899> this<00:01:41.080> so<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.500> will<00:01:41.950> take<00:01:41.979> what<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:42.970> get

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
go with this so it will take what to get

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.859 
go with this so it will take what to get
your<00:01:43.360> vote<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:44.200> raise<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.409> debt<00:01:44.590> ceiling<00:01:44.740> I

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
your vote to raise the debt ceiling I

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.690 
your vote to raise the debt ceiling I
think<00:01:46.869> an<00:01:46.990> ironclad<00:01:47.380> rule<00:01:48.070> that<00:01:48.399> we<00:01:48.549> will

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
think an ironclad rule that we will

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.940 
think an ironclad rule that we will
balance<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.119> budget<00:01:49.299> from<00:01:49.750> here<00:01:50.049> on<00:01:50.200> after<00:01:50.469> I

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
balance the budget from here on after I

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.530 
balance the budget from here on after I
will<00:01:51.250> not<00:01:51.399> vote<00:01:51.430> for<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.030> debt<00:01:52.240> ceiling

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
will not vote for the debt ceiling

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.990 
will not vote for the debt ceiling
increase<00:01:52.960> until<00:01:53.920> I<00:01:53.950> see<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.310> plan<00:01:54.670> in<00:01:54.850> place

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
increase until I see a plan in place

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.850 
increase until I see a plan in place
that<00:01:55.360> will<00:01:55.509> deal<00:01:55.719> with<00:01:56.020> our<00:01:56.049> long-term<00:01:56.590> debt
