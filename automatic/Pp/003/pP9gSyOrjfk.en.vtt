00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.710
 hello hello creative in this tutorial 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.610
 You will learn how to make this beautiful 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:13.410
 card for mothers day let's go 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.410
 to see what materials we need 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.860
 We will occupy colorful eyes or 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.020
 decorative sworn in bar willy with 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.460
 hot or cold preferably and people 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.269
 Different items to decorate your 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.070
 letter like lace cuts gas and 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.460
 some thought that you want to place 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.460
 to her 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.379
 as a first step let's take one of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.800
 our colored sheets are folded 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.160
 half and we mark the fold 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.809
 once marked we cut our sheet 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.629
 we take one half and the other one we leave 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.930
 on the side we bend it back to the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.930
 half 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.590
 and we cut 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.350
 and we will have this rectangle that will be 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.380
 the base of our flower for it we go 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.960
 to begin doubling the half the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.140
 we doubled again remembering that you have 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.560
 to mark well the folds 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.170
 since we have it like that we are going to take a 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.840
 corner of the side where they are 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.840
 all together and we take it back 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.760
 and we turn the page and do the same 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.420
 with the other corner 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.690
 then we take the sheet in this way and 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.590
 We bend this corner 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.829
 it will only serve to guide us 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.259
 since we have it like this we unfold the 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.350
 last fold we made and we took 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.929
 our scissors cutting the paper of 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.020
 the following way how far was the 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:07.299
 fold when you reach the mark of 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.489
 double you use the fold that you already 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:14.250
 we had done so that the two sides would 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:17.340
 remain symmetrical like this 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:22.180
 it will stay in cone shape 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.700
 do not bend and you will have a flower 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.290
 Now we take our scissors and 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.290
 we cut one of its petals 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.780
 and one of our lateral petals 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.030
 We put glue on the bar and 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.030
 we unite so that it has a flower shape 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.970
 A) Yes 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.230
 now we repeat all the same 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.599
 process 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.599
 you can use another sheet color or the 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.150
 same that depends on how you want each 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.000
 one of your flowers only when you get to 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.910
 this step when you cut 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.040
 do it a little further down so that you 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.440
 the flower is smaller, there is no 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.660
 exact measurement is more or less like you the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.060
 you want this flower of another color can 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.370
 be the center of the other you can not do 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.489
 several layers so they fit better 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.830
 the flowers to paste them you're going to fold them 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.690
 so the smallest one is going to put 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.030
 glue stick on both sides 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.340
 try to put enough for him 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.950
 paste well you take the big flower and the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.690
 girl you introduce her into her 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.600
 way in which the two peaks below 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.910
 agree 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.550
 you press 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.650
 and let dry you can make several types 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.740
 of cut and decoration to each one of your 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.140
 flowers that I leave to your imagination you go 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.660
 to make 7 flowers like the one we just 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.660
 to do as you have the 7 flowers 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.480
 elaborated we're going to start sticking them 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.210
 in this step you can use silicone 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.670
 cold or hot preferably we take 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.340
 our first flower and this one we are going to 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.890
 Place a drop of silicon on the petal 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.590
 side only one drop we take the other 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.560
 petal and we paste it on it we place 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.730
 a little on the left side petal and 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.730
 we put the other flower 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.650
 Y 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.060
 now let's put a little in the 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.060
 three petals of the center 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.220
 we place the other flower on top 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.120
 now we put a little in these two 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.120
 petals 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:37.150
 we paste a flower on top of it this way and 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.150
 likewise on the other side 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.879
 finally we put in the three of 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.879
 center 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.959
 and on top of the last flower 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.980
 and let it dry 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.440
 now we take a sheet of color or a 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.400
 piece of cardboard since you have it 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.790
 fold in half 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.790
 you can cover it decorate it or use a 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.419
 with pattern for decoration of the 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.910
 Exterior 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.760
 I will use the corrugated paper that 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.250
 has the cardboard in the center in the before 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.700
 I will draw a heart for later 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.639
 cut it and in the end remove the layer that 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.880
 has the cardboard on top so that the 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.770
 corrugated paper and I would stay like that but 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.180
 this needs a little color 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.180
 let's paint it 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.820
 once we finish painting we will have 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.110
 so in the part of the heart I will hit him 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.110
 decorative paper back 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.800
 for the cover will place a lace 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:54.289
 in the middle 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.289
 up of it the piece of cardboard 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:02.320
 you can set the bar 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.979
 pieces of paper thoughts sachs what 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.979
 what you want 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:12.030
 since the piece has dried we put 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.490
 a drop in the center petal will 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.000
 I remember that preferably use silicone 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:21.500
 cold or hot and then you're going to 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.500
 place it in the following way 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.570
 and you do the same thing on the other side 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.320
 so now that when you close and open the 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.320
 card does not give you problems 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.880
 and ready we finished 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.980
 I hope you liked this video if 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:54.270

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:58.150
 subscribe share it with your friends and 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:00.960
