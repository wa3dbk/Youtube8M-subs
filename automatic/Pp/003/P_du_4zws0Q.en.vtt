00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
Syd you've just written an enormous tome

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.550 
Syd you've just written an enormous tome
about<00:00:05.790> Barcelona<00:00:06.240> Real<00:00:06.810> Madrid<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.200> their

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
about Barcelona Real Madrid and their

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.680 
about Barcelona Real Madrid and their
rivalry<00:00:08.010> what<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.760> it<00:00:08.910> about<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.360> particular

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
rivalry what is it about this particular

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.110 
rivalry what is it about this particular
game<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.380> makes<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.860> more<00:00:11.219> than<00:00:11.280> just<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:12.000> big

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
game that makes it more than just a big

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.549 
game that makes it more than just a big
football<00:00:12.450> match<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.870> think<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.230> can<00:00:13.380> almost

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
football match I think you can almost

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.410 
football match I think you can almost
look<00:00:13.860> at<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.099> as<00:00:14.219> an<00:00:14.790> international<00:00:15.269> game

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
look at it as an international game

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.849 
look at it as an international game
played<00:00:15.719> between<00:00:15.870> two<00:00:16.080> club<00:00:16.440> teams<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.830> think

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
played between two club teams I think

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.560 
played between two club teams I think
that's<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.369> fundamental<00:00:17.789> thing<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.449> that

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
that's the fundamental thing is that

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.510 
that's the fundamental thing is that
this<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> game<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.170> has<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> political<00:00:20.400> and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
this is a game that has a political and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.540 
this is a game that has a political and
social<00:00:20.699> symbolism<00:00:21.560> which<00:00:22.560> ties<00:00:23.279> into

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
social symbolism which ties into

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.400 
social symbolism which ties into
questions<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.090> national<00:00:24.449> identity<00:00:24.480> ties<00:00:25.199> into

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
questions of national identity ties into

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.500 
questions of national identity ties into
questions<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.160> history<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.060> country<00:00:27.390> that's

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
questions of history in a country that's

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.839 
questions of history in a country that's
been<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> civil<00:00:28.260> war<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.560> dictatorship

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
been for a civil war in a dictatorship

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.900 
been for a civil war in a dictatorship
and<00:00:29.849> therefore<00:00:30.359> carries<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.130> huge<00:00:32.840> emotional

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
and therefore carries a huge emotional

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.150 
and therefore carries a huge emotional
ideological<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.290> kind<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.350> patriotic

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
ideological and kind of patriotic

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.430 
ideological and kind of patriotic
baggage<00:00:38.910> with<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.899> means<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.290> it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
baggage with it and that means that it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.470 
baggage with it and that means that it's
always<00:00:40.590> huge<00:00:41.460> beyond<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:42.000> football<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
always huge beyond just football and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.790 
always huge beyond just football and
then<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.780> add<00:00:42.930> into<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.500> fact<00:00:43.680> of

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
then if you add into that the fact of

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.290 
then if you add into that the fact of
course<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.129> they're<00:00:44.309> arguably<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> best

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
course that they're arguably the best

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.279 
course that they're arguably the best
two<00:00:45.390> clubs<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> world<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.110> certainly

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
two clubs in the world and certainly

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.690 
two clubs in the world and certainly
they<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.739> two<00:00:46.890> clubs<00:00:47.100> who<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> best<00:00:47.550> new

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
they the two clubs who have the best new

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.040 
they the two clubs who have the best new
players<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> world<00:00:48.360> confronting<00:00:48.930> each

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
players in the world confronting each

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.959 
players in the world confronting each
other<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.920> there<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> danger<00:00:50.340> sometimes<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
other is there a danger sometimes that

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.600 
other is there a danger sometimes that
it<00:00:51.059> gets<00:00:51.239> overtaken<00:00:52.050> by<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.920> Ronaldo<00:00:53.399> Messi

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
it gets overtaken by the Ronaldo Messi

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.549 
it gets overtaken by the Ronaldo Messi
situation<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.510> would<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.379> way

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
situation because that would be in a way

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.680 
situation because that would be in a way
to<00:00:55.620> undermine<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.940> much<00:00:57.090> more<00:00:57.360> about<00:00:57.539> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
to undermine so much more about this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.110 
to undermine so much more about this
game<00:00:57.960> yeah<00:00:58.199> Messi<00:00:59.190> or<00:00:59.309> Ronaldo<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.730> come<00:00:59.910> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
game yeah Messi or Ronaldo have come to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.330 
game yeah Messi or Ronaldo have come to
kind<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.480> represent<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.440> two<00:01:01.590> clubs<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.219> way

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
kind of represent the two clubs in a way

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.039 
kind of represent the two clubs in a way
that<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> rivalry<00:01:03.210> almost<00:01:03.480> gets<00:01:03.629> reduced

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
that the rivalry almost gets reduced

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.500 
that the rivalry almost gets reduced
down<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.320> these<00:01:04.650> two<00:01:04.830> men<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.519> there<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.180> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
down to these two men and and there is a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.120 
down to these two men and and there is a
danger<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.680> they<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:07.979> also

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
danger in that because they have also

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.350 
danger in that because they have also
got<00:01:08.310> other<00:01:08.490> brilliant<00:01:08.729> players<00:01:09.060> they're<00:01:09.240> also

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
got other brilliant players they're also

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.730 
got other brilliant players they're also
clubs<00:01:09.659> with<00:01:09.780> such<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> huge<00:01:10.229> history<00:01:10.530> that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
clubs with such a huge history that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.410 
clubs with such a huge history that
while<00:01:11.159> these<00:01:11.340> two<00:01:11.580> men<00:01:11.760> by<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.000> time<00:01:12.090> they

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
while these two men by the time they

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.660 
while these two men by the time they
retire<00:01:12.720> will<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.439> been<00:01:13.670> absolutely

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
retire will have been absolutely

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.340 
retire will have been absolutely
fundamental<00:01:15.270> players<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> history<00:01:16.320> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
fundamental players in the history of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.960 
fundamental players in the history of
the<00:01:16.439> two<00:01:16.560> clubs<00:01:16.860> there<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.430> still<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> history

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the two clubs there is still a history

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.190 
the two clubs there is still a history
there<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.270> our<00:01:18.390> Frehley<00:01:18.659> Stefan<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.140> Johan

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
there with our Frehley Stefan and Johan

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
there with our Frehley Stefan and Johan
Cruyff<00:01:19.619> Ihnen<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.070> countless<00:01:20.820> other<00:01:21.000> great

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
Cruyff Ihnen and countless other great

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.469 
Cruyff Ihnen and countless other great
players<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:22.159> then<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.490> also<00:01:23.700> works<00:01:24.210> really

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
players but then it also works really

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.880 
players but then it also works really
well<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.810> terms<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> narrative<00:01:25.350> now

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
well in terms of the narrative now

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.560 
well in terms of the narrative now
because<00:01:26.310> we've<00:01:26.460> got<00:01:26.580> two<00:01:26.759> players<00:01:27.030> who<00:01:27.240> seem

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
because we've got two players who seem

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.240 
because we've got two players who seem
to<00:01:27.600> represent<00:01:28.229> their<00:01:28.320> club<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.040> because

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
to represent their club not just because

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.530 
to represent their club not just because
they<00:01:29.400> are<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> best<00:01:29.759> player<00:01:29.970> at<00:01:30.000> each<00:01:30.150> pub<00:01:30.390> but

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
they are the best player at each pub but

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.149 
they are the best player at each pub but
they<00:01:30.720> seem<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.259> symbolic<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.829> what<00:01:32.009> those

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
they seem to be symbolic of what those

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.399 
they seem to be symbolic of what those
clubs<00:01:32.460> believe<00:01:33.090> they<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.479> certainly<00:01:34.229> from<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
clubs believe they are certainly from a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.780 
clubs believe they are certainly from a
bar<00:01:34.560> stoner<00:01:34.799> perspective<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.369> you've<00:01:35.490> got<00:01:35.610> Leo

they think look at Barcelona fans always
taking<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.799> moral<00:01:56.100> high<00:01:56.340> ground<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.880> it's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
taking the moral high ground and it's

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.789 
taking the moral high ground and it's
not<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.960> Ronaldo<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.500> actually

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
not like that that Ronaldo is actually

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.859 
not like that that Ronaldo is actually
far<00:01:59.100> more<00:01:59.130> humble<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.939> far<00:02:00.329> more<00:02:00.450> serious

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
far more humble and far more serious

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.450 
far more humble and far more serious
about<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.200> football<00:02:01.320> than<00:02:01.560> sometimes<00:02:02.009> people

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
about is football than sometimes people

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.730 
about is football than sometimes people
think<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.180> creates<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.049> really<00:02:04.079> nice<00:02:04.469> if

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
think so it creates a really nice if

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.459 
think so it creates a really nice if

extraordinary and that was one of the
things<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.340> was<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:26.610> striking<00:02:26.880> about<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
things that was so striking about the

things that was so striking about the
first<00:02:27.570> time<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.870> was<00:02:27.990> speak<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.320> went<00:02:28.470> back<00:02:28.590> it

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
was the sheer noise it was a fact that

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.480 
was the sheer noise it was a fact that
you<00:02:30.870> actually<00:02:31.050> can't<00:02:31.470> hear<00:02:31.800> anything<00:02:32.070> because

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
you actually can't hear anything because

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.100 
you actually can't hear anything because

think for by all this this will be a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.980 
think for by all this this will be a
genuinely<00:02:38.760> big<00:02:38.940> deal<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.630> will<00:02:39.780> this

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
genuinely big deal and this will this

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.330 
genuinely big deal and this will this
will<00:02:40.200> feel<00:02:40.410> different<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.950> anything<00:02:41.190> else

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
will feel different to anything else

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.370 
will feel different to anything else

things<00:02:56.490> that<00:02:56.640> go<00:02:56.730> on<00:02:56.760> like<00:02:56.940> pigs<00:02:57.240> heads<00:02:57.450> being

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
things that go on like pigs heads being

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.150 
things that go on like pigs heads being
thrown<00:02:57.810> on<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.050> pitch<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:58.350> but<00:02:58.620> also<00:02:58.770> because

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
thrown on the pitch but but also because

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.950 
thrown on the pitch but but also because
of<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.730> build-up<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.540> fact<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.780> it

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
of the build-up to it the fact that it

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.150 
of the build-up to it the fact that it
feels<00:03:01.140> like<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.410> consumes<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.130> entire

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
feels like it consumes the entire

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.400 
feels like it consumes the entire
country<00:03:02.880> for<00:03:03.030> not<00:03:03.600> just<00:03:03.810> for<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.020> game<00:03:04.140> not

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
country for not just for the game not

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.600 
country for not just for the game not
even<00:03:04.650> just<00:03:04.710> for<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.920> week<00:03:05.070> but<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.460> whole

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
even just for the week but for the whole

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.400 
even just for the week but for the whole
season<00:03:05.940> it's<00:03:06.240> about<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.570> two<00:03:06.660> clásicos<00:03:07.140> all

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
season it's about the two clásicos all

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.470 
season it's about the two clásicos all
the<00:03:07.530> four<00:03:07.770> or<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.340> six<00:03:08.580> depending<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.030> what

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
the four or the six depending on what

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.150 
the four or the six depending on what
competitions<00:03:09.960> they<00:03:10.050> meet<00:03:10.230> each<00:03:10.260> other<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.620> so

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
competitions they meet each other in so

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.040 
competitions they meet each other in so
I<00:03:11.190> think<00:03:11.430> for<00:03:11.700> both<00:03:11.850> Neymar<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.510> bio<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.930> name

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
I think for both Neymar and bio and name

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.810 
I think for both Neymar and bio and name
I<00:03:13.170> who's<00:03:13.320> come<00:03:13.470> from<00:03:13.590> Brazil<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:14.430> course<00:03:14.640> I

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
I who's come from Brazil of course I

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.310 
I who's come from Brazil of course I
think<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.330> work<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.750> will<00:03:15.990> be<00:03:16.140> different

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
think this work this will be different

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.560 
think this work this will be different
and<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.650> will<00:03:16.770> be<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:17.160> game<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.150> they'll<00:03:18.390> be

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
and it will be a game that they'll be

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.630 
and it will be a game that they'll be
absolutely<00:03:19.470> determined<00:03:19.770> to<00:03:20.040> leave<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.220> mark<00:03:20.520> on

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
absolutely determined to leave a mark on

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.400 
absolutely determined to leave a mark on
because<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.090> will<00:03:21.180> also<00:03:21.450> cause<00:03:21.930> bear<00:03:22.170> in<00:03:22.260> mind

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
because it will also cause bear in mind

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.320 
because it will also cause bear in mind
the<00:03:22.560> pressure<00:03:22.770> that's<00:03:22.920> on<00:03:23.100> BAU<00:03:23.310> generally<00:03:23.940> for

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
the pressure that's on BAU generally for

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.550 
the pressure that's on BAU generally for
being<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.600> most<00:03:24.720> expensive<00:03:24.840> player<00:03:25.320> there's

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
being the most expensive player there's

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.350 
being the most expensive player there's
been<00:03:25.710> all<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:26.640> pressure<00:03:26.880> will<00:03:27.060> be<00:03:27.150> blown

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
been all of that pressure will be blown

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.550 
been all of that pressure will be blown
away<00:03:27.540> by<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> good<00:03:28.110> performance<00:03:28.410> in<00:03:28.530> the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
away by a good performance in the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.140 
away by a good performance in the
classic<00:03:28.830> oh<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.040> will<00:03:29.130> effectively<00:03:29.430> allow<00:03:29.850> him

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
classic oh it will effectively allow him

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.630 
classic oh it will effectively allow him
to<00:03:30.600> then<00:03:30.750> have<00:03:30.990> a<00:03:31.020> soft<00:03:31.410> run<00:03:32.070> through<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.430> next

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
to then have a soft run through the next

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.710 
to then have a soft run through the next
three<00:03:32.760> or<00:03:32.790> four<00:03:33.000> games<00:03:33.150> no<00:03:33.390> matter<00:03:33.480> what

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
three or four games no matter what

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.450 
three or four games no matter what
happens<00:03:34.080> given<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.680> way<00:03:34.770> it<00:03:34.890> consumes<00:03:35.310> the

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
happens given the way it consumes the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.220 
happens given the way it consumes the
country<00:03:35.850> as<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:35.970> say<00:03:36.240> given<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.630> rivalry

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
country as you say given that rivalry

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.390 
country as you say given that rivalry
and<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.530> shared<00:03:37.800> history<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
and that shared history and the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.340 
and that shared history and the
intensity<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.150> all<00:03:39.300> could<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.020> say<00:03:40.170> in<00:03:40.290> a

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
intensity of it all could you say in a

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.770 
intensity of it all could you say in a
way<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.710> these<00:03:41.640> two<00:03:41.850> clubs<00:03:42.330> couldn't<00:03:42.630> really

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
way that these two clubs couldn't really

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.700 
way that these two clubs couldn't really
exist<00:03:43.080> without<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.470> other

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
exist without the other

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.470 
exist without the other
I<00:03:43.860> think<00:03:44.640> that's<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.880> key<00:03:45.030> point<00:03:45.300> of<00:03:45.390> the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
I think that's a key point of the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.480 
I think that's a key point of the
relationship<00:03:45.930> is<00:03:46.080> partly<00:03:46.590> symbiotic<00:03:47.190> and

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
relationship is partly symbiotic and

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.310 
relationship is partly symbiotic and
there's<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.910> quote<00:03:48.450> from<00:03:48.600> Florentino<00:03:49.020> penneth

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
there's a quote from Florentino penneth

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.300 
there's a quote from Florentino penneth
in<00:03:49.440> which<00:03:49.560> he<00:03:49.650> says<00:03:49.830> something<00:03:50.070> along<00:03:50.220> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
in which he says something along the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.890 
in which he says something along the
lines<00:03:50.460> of<00:03:50.640> if<00:03:50.760> barcelona<00:03:51.270> didn't<00:03:51.510> exist<00:03:51.750> we'd

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
lines of if barcelona didn't exist we'd

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.050 
lines of if barcelona didn't exist we'd
have<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.230> invent<00:03:52.680> them<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.430> asked<00:03:53.880> join

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
have to invent them and I asked join

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.790 
have to invent them and I asked join
Lepore<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.930> form<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.470> our<00:03:55.590> silent

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
Lepore to the the form of our silent

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.840 
Lepore to the the form of our silent
present<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.190> whether<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.400> was<00:03:56.580> true<00:03:56.610> he

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
present and whether this was true he

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.520 
present and whether this was true he
said<00:03:57.000> yeah<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.720> think<00:03:58.050> that's<00:03:58.200> probably<00:03:58.320> right

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
said yeah I think that's probably right

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.140 
said yeah I think that's probably right
and<00:03:58.890> it's<00:03:59.100> one<00:03:59.190> of<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.340> few<00:03:59.490> times<00:03:59.670> you<00:03:59.820> catch

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
and it's one of the few times you catch

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.400 
and it's one of the few times you catch
a<00:04:00.270> pass<00:04:00.390> on<00:04:00.600> a<00:04:00.660> president<00:04:00.960> and<00:04:01.020> a<00:04:01.080> round<00:04:01.260> room

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
a pass on a president and a round room

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.720 
a pass on a president and a round room
president<00:04:01.740> agreeing<00:04:02.010> with<00:04:02.130> each<00:04:02.280> other<00:04:02.490> and

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
president agreeing with each other and

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.780 
president agreeing with each other and
and<00:04:03.240> definitely<00:04:03.840> there<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.230> need<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:05.370> judge

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
and definitely there is a need to judge

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.730 
and definitely there is a need to judge
themselves<00:04:06.300> by<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.540> other<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.230> there's<00:04:07.650> a

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
themselves by the other and there's a

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.520 
themselves by the other and there's a
quote<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.220> Raul<00:04:08.610> gave<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.180> 2002<00:04:10.170> when<00:04:10.350> Browns

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
quote that Raul gave in 2002 when Browns

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.870 
quote that Raul gave in 2002 when Browns

felt<00:04:18.450> like<00:04:18.600> there<00:04:18.690> was<00:04:18.840> something<00:04:19.049> missing

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
felt like there was something missing

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.890 
felt like there was something missing
with<00:04:20.160> Barcelona<00:04:20.400> being<00:04:20.880> down<00:04:21.060> there<00:04:21.270> and<00:04:21.570> and

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
with Barcelona being down there and and

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.750 
with Barcelona being down there and and
it's<00:04:22.049> as<00:04:22.229> if<00:04:22.260> it's<00:04:22.800> as<00:04:22.919> if<00:04:23.040> you<00:04:23.130> need<00:04:23.400> them<00:04:23.640> both

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
it's as if it's as if you need them both

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.700 
it's as if it's as if you need them both
to<00:04:23.940> be<00:04:24.060> at<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.210> very<00:04:24.419> very<00:04:24.630> best<00:04:24.870> level<00:04:25.260> to

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
to be at the very very best level to

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.810 
to be at the very very best level to
really<00:04:26.010> count<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.340> that's<00:04:26.460> one<00:04:26.669> of<00:04:26.700> the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
really count and that's one of the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.440 
really count and that's one of the
reasons<00:04:27.090> I<00:04:27.180> think

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
reasons I think

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.720 
reasons I think
the<00:04:27.570> rivalry<00:04:27.960> has<00:04:28.170> become<00:04:28.320> so<00:04:28.740> huge<00:04:29.070> because

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
the rivalry has become so huge because

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.850 
the rivalry has become so huge because
although<00:04:30.360> there<00:04:30.510> was<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.630> period<00:04:30.930> in<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.440> 1950s

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860

when they were the best two teams in the

world this might be the first time since
the<00:04:35.700> 1950s<00:04:36.360> when<00:04:36.720> they<00:04:36.810> could<00:04:36.960> legitimately

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
the 1950s when they could legitimately

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.890 
the 1950s when they could legitimately
claim<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.950> be<00:04:38.040> on<00:04:38.160> such<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:38.610> high<00:04:38.880> level<00:04:39.060> both<00:04:39.660> of
