tight and the standing Arabian she
really<00:00:36.659> performed<00:00:37.229> well<00:00:37.470> then<00:00:37.739> because<00:00:38.100> her

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
really performed well then because her

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.799 
really performed well then because her
feet<00:00:38.430> were<00:00:38.580> across<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.150> beam<00:00:41.180> see<00:00:42.180> she<00:00:42.449> hits

feet were across the beam see she hits
the<00:00:42.960> split<00:00:43.409> action<00:00:43.830> so<00:00:44.129> effortless

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
the split action so effortless

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:52.250 
the split action so effortless
effortless<00:00:45.479> ly<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:47.330> moves<00:00:48.330> with<00:00:48.960> good<00:00:49.229> speed

writing a little bit now and this is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.480 
writing a little bit now and this is
important

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490

double<00:01:11.850> spin<00:01:12.090> has<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.690> step<00:01:12.930> forward<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.740> she

double spin has to step forward and she

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.300 
double spin has to step forward and she
didn't<00:01:14.900> that<00:01:15.900> she<00:01:16.410> had<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> little<00:01:16.890> error<00:01:17.100> on

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
didn't that she had a little error on

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
didn't that she had a little error on
that<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> quad<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.360> all-around<00:01:18.509> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that in the quad in the all-around and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.910 
that in the quad in the all-around and
obviously<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.710> plays<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.310> mind<00:01:20.550> a<00:01:20.700> bit

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
obviously it plays on the mind a bit

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.710 
obviously it plays on the mind a bit
very<00:01:22.920> difficult<00:01:23.580> element<00:01:24.000> right<00:01:24.270> at<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> end

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
very difficult element right at the end

of the beam routine needs to land well

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.540 
of the beam routine needs to land well
on<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.289> dismount<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.860> double<00:01:29.130> touch<00:01:29.310> she

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
on the dismount the double touch she

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.480 
on the dismount the double touch she
does<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.690> really<00:01:31.350> very<00:01:31.490> disappointing

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
does that but really very disappointing

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.109 
does that but really very disappointing
for<00:01:32.520> us

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.700 

well<00:01:37.750> well<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.869> difficulty<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:39.619> the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
well well the difficulty and the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.499 
well well the difficulty and the
execution<00:01:40.579> that<00:01:40.609> she<00:01:40.880> showed<00:01:41.149> would<00:01:41.329> be

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
execution that she showed would be

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.660 
execution that she showed would be
enough<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.990> keep<00:01:42.200> her<00:01:42.350> in<00:01:42.469> the<00:01:42.590> medals<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:43.280> don't

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
enough to keep her in the medals I don't

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.969 
enough to keep her in the medals I don't
think<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.090> no<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:44.840> would<00:01:45.170> be<00:01:45.289> very<00:01:45.469> surprised

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
think so no I would be very surprised

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.999 
think so no I would be very surprised
one<00:01:46.399> hallmark<00:01:46.700> off<00:01:47.179> when<00:01:47.899> you<00:01:48.049> fall<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:48.560> this

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
one hallmark off when you fall and this

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.399 
one hallmark off when you fall and this
the<00:01:49.460> double<00:01:49.759> spin<00:01:49.969> she<00:01:50.149> fell<00:01:50.390> on<00:01:50.569> is<00:01:50.990> quite<00:01:51.319> a

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
the double spin she fell on is quite a

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.319 
the double spin she fell on is quite a
difficult<00:01:51.709> element<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.490> she<00:01:52.610> won't<00:01:52.850> have<00:01:53.000> got

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
difficult element and she won't have got

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.100 
difficult element and she won't have got
the<00:01:53.929> difficulty<00:01:54.530> for<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:55.630> nice<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.659> chromatic

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
the difficulty for it nice a chromatic

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.130 
the difficulty for it nice a chromatic
series<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:58.030> this<00:01:59.030> standing<00:01:59.479> Arabian<00:01:59.990> is

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
series and this standing Arabian is

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.719 
series and this standing Arabian is
really<00:02:00.770> impressive<00:02:02.560> just<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.679> little<00:02:04.310> bit<00:02:04.429> in

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
really impressive just a little bit in

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.309 
really impressive just a little bit in
the<00:02:04.909> wrong<00:02:05.030> direction<00:02:05.270> with<00:02:05.659> knees<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.109> feet

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
the wrong direction with knees and feet

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.899 
the wrong direction with knees and feet
but<00:02:06.469> she<00:02:06.530> pulled<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.039> shoulders<00:02:07.459> back<00:02:07.640> but

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
but she pulled the shoulders back but

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.050 
but she pulled the shoulders back but
what<00:02:08.239> about<00:02:08.479> this<00:02:08.690> Christine<00:02:09.340> she<00:02:10.340> lost<00:02:10.489> body

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
what about this Christine she lost body

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.180 
what about this Christine she lost body
shape<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.390> have<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.750> stay<00:02:11.989> tall<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.829> she<00:02:13.010> sort

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
shape you have to stay tall and she sort

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.550 
shape you have to stay tall and she sort
of<00:02:13.340> tried<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.549> look<00:02:13.790> for<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.030> beam<00:02:14.209> too<00:02:14.450> early

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.160 

and<00:02:18.560> then<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.400> follow<00:02:19.549> it<00:02:19.790> send<00:02:20.660> up<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.870> double

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
and then to follow it send up the double

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.890 
and then to follow it send up the double
with<00:02:21.530> two<00:02:21.560> flicks<00:02:23.500> it's<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.590> pity

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.380 

it<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.830> indeed<00:02:30.220> but<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:30.580> just<00:02:30.879> shows<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.360> how

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
it is indeed but it just shows you how

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.500 
it is indeed but it just shows you how
ever<00:02:32.129> accomplished<00:02:33.129> you<00:02:33.280> are<00:02:33.310> however<00:02:33.819> much

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
ever accomplished you are however much

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.979 
ever accomplished you are however much
training<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.110> do<00:02:35.519> it's<00:02:36.519> hard<00:02:36.879> to<00:02:37.450> do<00:02:37.599> it<00:02:37.750> on

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
training you do it's hard to do it on

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.140 
training you do it's hard to do it on
the<00:02:38.110> moment<00:02:39.959> she<00:02:40.959> did<00:02:41.849> so<00:02:42.849> yeah
