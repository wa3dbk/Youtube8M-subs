00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.920
 well guys we finally have the 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.130
 matches for round 2 of the tournament 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.680
 instead there 2015 unfortunately I put it 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.210
 much more than expected to collect everyone 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.820
 the data I needed about the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.160
 round 1 because there have been many 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.410
 absences people who had registered at 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.480
 tournament and then disappeared or not 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.599
 they managed to agree and to 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.120
 consequently the maximum limit for 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.989
 getting the fights the codes had been 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.820
 totally upset me 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.440
 from the top of my mercy 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.629
 I was joking aside anyway 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.699
 generous and still wanted to offer 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.519
 a few more days to allow the 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.480
 people to organize themselves 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.879
 nonetheless guys this is it 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.579
 absolutely not very respectful of my opinion 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.280
 because if someone writes a tournament 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.800
 also gives its availability and yes 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.019
 commits to participate absolutely 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.749
 respecting the rules and respecting them 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.050
 of the timing for which I will not 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.360
 more 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.570
 from next time I will not be ad 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.640
 listen to the dynamics of the participants 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.760
 if it is exceeded for any reason 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.100
 I don't care which one I enter the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.799
 closing end date did not receive i 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.229
 fight codes would be disqualified 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.290
 both contenders because really 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.460
 you can't go on like this 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.310
 having said that I will continue to trust the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.590
 your skills despite everything 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.299
 contenders from round 2 I recommend 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.070
 don't repeat the same mistakes as they are 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.470
 been committed in round 1 concerning 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.390
 organization the timing 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.360
 said this a service information 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.909
 that many have asked me or if 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.420
 the same could be used again 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.670
 team should you change it instead 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.590
 then as in most 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.259
 tournaments in this tournament once you do 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.659
 a team is not quoted in quotes 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.350
 it can be changed until the end of 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.720
 tournament 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.729
 so I recommend you keep all the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.289
 same 7 all the same pokÃ©mon that 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.620
 you used in round 1 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.170
 having said that the new combinations are in the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.500
 description of the video 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.590
 watch them organize and let me have them 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.549
 by next Friday or on the 20th 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.489
 March the fight codes of challenges 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.930
 also indicating the winner of the challenges 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.930
 thanks a lot see you
