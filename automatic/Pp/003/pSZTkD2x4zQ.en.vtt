another thing to know just at the end
here<00:06:07.430> is<00:06:07.550> once<00:06:07.789> this<00:06:07.940> a<00:06:08.090> care<00:06:08.330> is<00:06:08.450> definitely

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
here is once this a care is definitely

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.360 
here is once this a care is definitely
clear<00:06:09.500> the<00:06:09.620> closed<00:06:09.800> area

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
clear the closed area

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.070 
clear the closed area
there's<00:06:10.580> nobody<00:06:10.790> has<00:06:11.300> a<00:06:11.330> chance<00:06:11.630> of<00:06:11.750> being<00:06:11.900> up

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
there's nobody has a chance of being up

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.590 
there's nobody has a chance of being up
here<00:06:12.490> he's<00:06:13.490> gonna<00:06:13.669> go<00:06:13.880> ahead<00:06:13.970> and<00:06:14.090> clear<00:06:14.389> back

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
here he's gonna go ahead and clear back

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.230 
here he's gonna go ahead and clear back
so<00:06:15.260> the<00:06:15.320> idea<00:06:15.410> here<00:06:15.650> is<00:06:16.130> he's<00:06:16.820> gonna<00:06:16.910> hold<00:06:17.090> the

so the idea here is he's gonna hold the

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.270 
so the idea here is he's gonna hold the
back<00:06:17.449> rather<00:06:17.750> he's<00:06:18.199> an<00:06:18.290> old<00:06:18.410> the<00:06:18.500> flank<00:06:18.770> and

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
teammates switch spawns with me if I

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.710 
teammates switch spawns with me if I
have<00:06:58.400> second<00:06:58.850> spawn<00:06:59.030> and<00:06:59.210> make<00:06:59.330> sure<00:06:59.360> that

someone<00:07:00.080> that<00:07:00.260> has<00:07:00.380> a<00:07:00.410> fourth<00:07:00.830> of<00:07:01.010> fish<00:07:01.190> spawn

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
someone that has a fourth of fish spawn

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.730 
someone that has a fourth of fish spawn
switches<00:07:01.970> with<00:07:02.120> me<00:07:02.360> so<00:07:02.870> I<00:07:02.900> can<00:07:03.380> make<00:07:03.560> sure<00:07:03.590> that

switches with me so I can make sure that

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.890 
switches with me so I can make sure that
i<00:07:03.919> can<00:07:03.979> go<00:07:04.220> ladder<00:07:04.490> room<00:07:04.760> with<00:07:04.940> the<00:07:05.060> op<00:07:05.180> because

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900 
i can go ladder room with the op because

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.450 
i can go ladder room with the op because
that's<00:07:06.110> the<00:07:06.260> exact<00:07:06.620> spot<00:07:06.889> that<00:07:06.919> you<00:07:07.100> need<00:07:07.340> to

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
that's the exact spot that you need to

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.490 
that's the exact spot that you need to
be<00:07:07.610> with<00:07:07.760> enough<00:07:08.030> ally<00:07:08.570> is<00:07:08.960> it<00:07:09.169> a<00:07:09.199> powerful

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 
be with enough ally is it a powerful

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.650 
be with enough ally is it a powerful
ally<00:07:10.100> has<00:07:10.340> really<00:07:10.699> put<00:07:11.150> yourself<00:07:11.270> at<00:07:11.630> a

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:11.660 
ally has really put yourself at a

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.180 
ally has really put yourself at a
disadvantage<00:07:11.870> going<00:07:12.530> there<00:07:12.710> if<00:07:12.830> you<00:07:12.919> have<00:07:13.070> an

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.190 
disadvantage going there if you have an

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.129 
disadvantage going there if you have an
op<00:07:13.340> and<00:07:13.550> going<00:07:14.120> middle<00:07:14.419> can<00:07:14.539> definitely<00:07:14.960> be

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:15.139 
op and going middle can definitely be

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:17.529 
op and going middle can definitely be
useful<00:07:15.560> but<00:07:15.880> normally<00:07:16.880> ladder<00:07:17.120> room<00:07:17.300> is<00:07:17.419> the

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:17.539 
useful but normally ladder room is the
