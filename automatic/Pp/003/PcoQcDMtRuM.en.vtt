00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
put my hand under the horses who which

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.060 
put my hand under the horses who which
is<00:03:49.820> very<00:03:50.000> different<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.480> how<00:03:51.070> other

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
is very different to how other

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.600 
is very different to how other
institutions<00:03:53.060> do<00:03:53.270> it<00:03:53.390> is<00:03:54.170> because<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:55.280> feels

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
institutions do it is because it feels

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.240 
institutions do it is because it feels
to<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:55.880> horse<00:03:56.180> like<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.770> it's<00:03:57.770> got<00:03:57.950> his<00:03:58.040> foot

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
to the horse like you it's got his foot

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.160 
to the horse like you it's got his foot
on<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.370> ground<00:03:58.580> well<00:03:58.970> that's<00:03:59.120> my<00:03:59.330> view<00:03:59.390> if<00:04:00.020> you

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
on the ground well that's my view if you

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.960 
on the ground well that's my view if you
hang<00:04:00.410> onto<00:04:00.710> the<00:04:00.890> horse<00:04:01.040> around<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.490> tendons

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
hang onto the horse around the tendons

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.600 
hang onto the horse around the tendons
that<00:04:02.590> could<00:04:03.590> be<00:04:03.770> where<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:03.950> horse<00:04:04.220> might<00:04:04.430> be

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
that could be where a horse might be

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.970 
that could be where a horse might be
attacked<00:04:04.970> by<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.330> predator<00:04:05.600> so<00:04:06.350> I<00:04:06.380> don't<00:04:06.770> want

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
attacked by a predator so I don't want

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.310 
attacked by a predator so I don't want
the<00:04:07.130> horse<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.400> think<00:04:07.790> that<00:04:07.970> I'm<00:04:08.200> going<00:04:09.200> to

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
the horse to think that I'm going to

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.500 
the horse to think that I'm going to
grab<00:04:09.560> an<00:04:09.920> injured<00:04:10.580> horse<00:04:10.790> so<00:04:10.940> I<00:04:10.970> hang<00:04:11.180> on<00:04:11.300> to<00:04:11.420> it

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
grab an injured horse so I hang on to it

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.480 
grab an injured horse so I hang on to it
by<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.780> hoop<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:12.410> you're<00:04:12.530> less<00:04:12.860> likely<00:04:12.890> to

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
by the hoop and you're less likely to

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.910 
by the hoop and you're less likely to
get<00:04:13.820> an<00:04:14.000> adverse<00:04:14.360> reaction<00:04:16.720> also<00:04:17.720> once<00:04:18.560> I<00:04:18.739> lift

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
get an adverse reaction also once I lift

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.410 
get an adverse reaction also once I lift
the<00:04:19.100> foot<00:04:19.250> off<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.549> ground<00:04:19.670> I<00:04:19.940> will<00:04:20.120> bring<00:04:20.330> the

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
the foot off the ground I will bring the

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.860 
the foot off the ground I will bring the
foot<00:04:20.630> out<00:04:20.950> okay<00:04:21.950> this<00:04:22.190> takes<00:04:22.520> away<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:23.540> horses

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870
