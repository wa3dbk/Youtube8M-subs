you just hit twice strong attack which
doesn't<00:03:44.080> make<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:44.200> lot<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.380> sense<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:44.680> figure

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
doesn't make a lot of sense you figure

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.710 
doesn't make a lot of sense you figure
like<00:03:45.130> if<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.340> hold<00:03:45.520> down<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:46.300> get<00:03:46.480> stronger

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
like if you hold down you get stronger

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.560 
like if you hold down you get stronger
attack<00:03:47.050> right<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:48.040> don't<00:03:48.970> know<00:03:49.030> we<00:03:49.240> were
