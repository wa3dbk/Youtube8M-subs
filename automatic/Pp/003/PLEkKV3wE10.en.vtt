00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.280
 in which you have met and how 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.460

 deep reserves of your being and discover

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.769
 big strides out once more 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.260
 to the roads that we have chosen is 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.829
 true that some have not yet been 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.590
 able to do this but the examples 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.039
 that show that things are a lot 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.950
 better than they seem there was a stretch 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:11.280
 very steep and dangerous from the trip that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.770
 had to be covered in recent years and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.700
 all of you has achieved success very 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.270
 very well now many are discovering 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.080
 when evaluating where they are they have not only 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.330
 grown enormously but have won 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.790
 some things that they never thought that what 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.920
 would do for that reason something 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.700
 they tell you that you have to always remember 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.060
 that add or something better at the end of their 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.730
 prayers there is usually something better 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.940
 when the objective is limited to what 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.760
 can imagine and many have begun to 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.530
 abandon it as part of their 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:55.680
 prayers this is wonderful too 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.200
 we create whatever you can think of 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.960
 it is only restrictive in comparison 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.110
 with all the possibilities that 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.140
 the universe disposes its conscious mind 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.860
 is finally learning to attend to the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.290
 business for which it was designed 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.870
 this is very helpful when discussing 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.990
 each other the successes you have and what 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.810
 you learn something from them that you can 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.690
 seem small, not important to 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.470
 you could well be the next great 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.890
 thing else has to think about his progress 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.650
 in effect change the whole but its 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.580
 direct participation could save 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.240
 another some effort 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.720
