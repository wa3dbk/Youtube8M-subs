00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.500
 here I have about a kilo of 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.580
 ground beef bowl with a beef 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.580
 first one that gets better 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.609
 here I have several taiÃ³ seasonings and I 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.800
 I have mine I like doing this 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.060
 because sometimes the coriander spoils a lot 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.369
 quickly 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.349
 so as not to lose how much I 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.580
 I do it puts it in the sauce. 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.499
 clean 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.630
 put the blender in the blender 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.460
 It's always that I want to have a 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.050
 Clear cluster that is not fresh 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.730
 Same flavor it loses a little taste 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.370
 But I can? 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.430
 here I have relief is that I have salt 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 And the second season, people use it. 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.450
 I put it to my dinho 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.000
 beef 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.520
 you can put here also salsa or 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.330
 chopped in the case finely chopped here 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.700
 as my body is more to give flavor 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.620
 How very strong, too, and let's go 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.550
 to know in my flesh that it is not legal 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.100
 will stick with a piece of a piece of 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.960
 50 50 too strong you can cut 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.850
 alone little ben cardin put 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.380
 inside that I have tomatoes I will not 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.060
 put all the tomato is just like 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.049
 We showed that I do not like tomato very much. 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.149
 so you cut little and 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.149
 mix your meat 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:30.289
 remembering that you will hit the oil 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:32.090
 hot because that raw pen eat 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.679
 mixed meat I'll put the two here 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.219
 games inside the eggs are to give 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.219
 to release 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.799
 I ate meat that was already seasoned by squeezing 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.560
 good care you're experiencing your 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.650
 meat to see if she's with 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:58.590
 It's a good time to jump after not 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:02:00.869
 Come on, you got boiled egg, it 's just here. 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.940
 you will have to have quite generally 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.789
 it is sold at the fair 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.690
 There you cover well decarnin sold in the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.560
 market 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:19.650
 they sell like this, you do well 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:28.620
 It 's a big meatball cookie. 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:30.540
 with boiled egg filling to sell 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.090
 for the 4 50 at least it was the price that 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.769
 I saw in the queue, what I'm going to do is fine. 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:41.780
 now I will pass and in the wheat flour 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:46.070
 first let me take the egg and 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.070
 wheat flour 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.600
 After passing my little voice again 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.600
 account too small for the size of this 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:04.920
 postal charge or what happened in the flour 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:07.650
 of that space is small and passes new 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.720
 photo my eye I put a little of 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.109
 water is not to get that much egg 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.370
 thick starts to drop very thick 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.329
 where is this when you are going to take the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.290
 salty it happens time she coast 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.769
 thick right 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.180
 When you charter it gets terrible there. 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:32.220
 here I have the face meal from 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.310
 danielle model before listening to the 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.310
 wheat 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:42.010
 with this small pass from one side to 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.010
 the other passing the flour 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.580
 it was at the very end the modern people he 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:55.720
 new that he as the flesh is raw from 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:58.430
 Ball is right and there it goes 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.760
 We're going to stay in the not so hot hot oil. 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.410
 Hot is because as I always say 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.890
 in the videos getting too hot will stay 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:11.290
 group inside the stadium outside then 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.290
 It has to be a hot one that supports
