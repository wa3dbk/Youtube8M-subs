so I'm going to make a sabayon with eggs

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.610 
so I'm going to make a sabayon with eggs
and<00:02:11.730> sugar<00:02:11.880> melt<00:02:12.660> my<00:02:12.810> chocolate<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.440> butter

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and sugar melt my chocolate and butter

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.460 
and sugar melt my chocolate and butter
fold<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.570> then<00:02:15.750> lastly<00:02:16.140> fold

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
fold that in and then lastly fold

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.860 
fold that in and then lastly fold
through<00:02:16.770> roasted<00:02:17.280> chopped<00:02:17.490> hazelnuts<00:02:17.870> flour

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
through roasted chopped hazelnuts flour

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.830 
through roasted chopped hazelnuts flour
and<00:02:19.230> cocoa<00:02:19.740> powder<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.280> spread<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.510> onto<00:02:21.810> a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
and cocoa powder and spread that onto a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.140 
and cocoa powder and spread that onto a
Silpat<00:02:22.320> mat<00:02:22.500> tray<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:22.980> bake<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.090> oven

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
Silpat mat tray and bake it in the oven

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.480 
Silpat mat tray and bake it in the oven
and<00:02:24.840> then<00:02:25.140> we<00:02:25.230> cut<00:02:25.380> small<00:02:25.680> little<00:02:25.890> disks<00:02:26.280> of

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
and then we cut small little disks of

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.550 
and then we cut small little disks of
that<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.910> fits<00:02:27.300> exactly<00:02:27.570> into<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.140> mold<00:02:28.350> I'm

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
that that fits exactly into the mold I'm

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.120 
that that fits exactly into the mold I'm
using<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:30.090> then<00:02:30.270> we're<00:02:30.420> going<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.750> make<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
using and then we're going to make the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.490 
using and then we're going to make the
chocolate<00:02:32.370> raspberry<00:02:32.670> mousse<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:34.230> we<00:02:34.320> make<00:02:34.470> a

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
chocolate raspberry mousse so we make a

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.440 
chocolate raspberry mousse so we make a
patter<00:02:34.770> bomb<00:02:35.070> patter<00:02:35.430> bomb<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.970> with<00:02:36.180> whole

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
patter bomb patter bomb is with whole

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.500 
patter bomb patter bomb is with whole
eggs<00:02:36.770> egg<00:02:37.770> yolks<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.340> then<00:02:38.550> sugar<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.450> we

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
eggs egg yolks and then sugar that we

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.440 
eggs egg yolks and then sugar that we
take<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.810> softball<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:41.100> we<00:02:41.190> cook<00:02:41.370> back<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.730> one

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
take to softball so we cook back to one

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.470 
take to softball so we cook back to one
to<00:02:42.480> one<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:44.370> make<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.820> patter<00:02:45.000> bomb<00:02:45.270> and

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
to one and we make the patter bomb and

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.990 
to one and we make the patter bomb and
then<00:02:45.840> we<00:02:46.320> melt<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.850> chocolate<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.970> chocolate

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
then we melt the chocolate the chocolate

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.840 
then we melt the chocolate the chocolate
that<00:02:48.360> I'm<00:02:48.510> using<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.959> 60%<00:02:49.470> Granada<00:02:50.370> from

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
that I'm using is a 60% Granada from

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.040 
that I'm using is a 60% Granada from
Barry<00:02:51.750> Callebaut<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:54.060> basically<00:02:54.840> take

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
Barry Callebaut and so I basically take

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.170 
Barry Callebaut and so I basically take
the<00:02:55.350> raspberry<00:02:56.130> puree<00:02:56.310> bring<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the raspberry puree bring that to the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.570 
the raspberry puree bring that to the
ball<00:02:57.360> add<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.019> gelatine<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.860> fold

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
ball add the gelatine to that fold

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.550 
ball add the gelatine to that fold
through<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.269> chocolate<00:03:00.720> fold<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.500> through

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
through the chocolate fold that through

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.250 
through the chocolate fold that through
the<00:03:02.040> patter<00:03:02.340> bomb<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.820> then<00:03:03.120> whipped<00:03:03.930> cream

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
the patter bomb and then whipped cream

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.340 
the patter bomb and then whipped cream
what<00:03:04.830> goes<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.190> last<00:03:05.540> pipe<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.720> into<00:03:06.959> my<00:03:07.110> mold

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
what goes in last pipe that into my mold

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.580 
what goes in last pipe that into my mold
and<00:03:07.680> we<00:03:08.340> put<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.549> raspberry<00:03:09.060> insert<00:03:09.570> inside<00:03:10.410> the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
and we put a raspberry insert inside the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.870 
and we put a raspberry insert inside the
mousse<00:03:10.769> so<00:03:10.950> when<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.190> cut<00:03:11.340> into<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.730> mousse

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
mousse so when you cut into the mousse

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.050 
mousse so when you cut into the mousse
is<00:03:12.060> using<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:13.769> that's<00:03:14.220> made<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.670> raspberry

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
is using and that's made of raspberry

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.110 
is using and that's made of raspberry
puree<00:03:15.390> sugar<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:15.989> ultratex<00:03:16.940> which<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.090> a

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
puree sugar and ultratex which is a

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.170 
puree sugar and ultratex which is a
stabilizer<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.780> we<00:03:18.930> use<00:03:19.080> is<00:03:19.260> natural<00:03:19.680> based

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
stabilizer that we use is natural based

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.850 
stabilizer that we use is natural based
and<00:03:21.180> then<00:03:21.390> finish<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.320> with<00:03:22.470> some<00:03:22.650> chocolate

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
and then finish that with some chocolate

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.030 
and then finish that with some chocolate
crunchy<00:03:23.370> pearls<00:03:23.850> chocolate<00:03:24.420> crack<00:03:24.600> on<00:03:24.750> and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
crunchy pearls chocolate crack on and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.850 
crunchy pearls chocolate crack on and
then<00:03:26.040> brownie<00:03:26.310> discs<00:03:27.090> on<00:03:27.330> top<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.630> that<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.230> so

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
then brownie discs on top of that and so

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.030 
then brownie discs on top of that and so
basically<00:03:29.489> we<00:03:29.670> spray<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.120> cake<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:31.470> then<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
basically we spray the cake and then the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.890 
basically we spray the cake and then the
petit<00:03:32.220> gateau<00:03:32.580> served<00:03:32.850> on<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.030> plate<00:03:33.299> serve
