00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
that this is a dual layer case because

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.970 
that this is a dual layer case because
this<00:02:32.250> black<00:02:32.570> interior<00:02:33.570> layer<00:02:33.810> absorbs<00:02:34.170> most

your<00:02:36.990> device<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.740> remove<00:02:38.010> this

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
your device and you can remove this

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.920 
your device and you can remove this
layer<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.580> well<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:39.300> by<00:02:39.420> pulling<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.810> away

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
layer as well just by pulling it away

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.250 
layer as well just by pulling it away
like<00:02:40.710> so<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.270> can<00:02:42.390> see<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.990> pretty

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
like so and as you can see it is pretty

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.460 
like so and as you can see it is pretty
flexible<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.490> it's<00:02:45.000> not<00:02:45.300> silicone<00:02:46.260> ish

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
flexible and it's not silicone ish

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.650 
flexible and it's not silicone ish
because<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.250> does<00:02:47.430> grip<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.880> device<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.420> it's

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
because it does grip the device but it's

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.080 
because it does grip the device but it's
not<00:02:49.080> got<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.350> same<00:02:49.560> silicone<00:02:50.040> feel<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.580> but

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
not got the same silicone feel to it but

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.690 
not got the same silicone feel to it but
you<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.510> see<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.410> very<00:02:52.740> flexible<00:02:53.100> indeed

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
you can see it is very flexible indeed

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.760 
you can see it is very flexible indeed

along the inside now you'll also notice

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.550 
along the inside now you'll also notice
as<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.410> took<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:59.220> out<00:02:59.550> the<00:03:00.120> lid<00:03:00.360> came<00:03:00.690> away<00:03:01.050> from

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
as I took it out the lid came away from

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.080 
as I took it out the lid came away from
the<00:03:01.770> back<00:03:01.980> here<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.520> can<00:03:02.640> simply<00:03:02.820> put

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
the back here and you can simply put

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.050 
the back here and you can simply put
that<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.300> place<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:04.380> just<00:03:05.220> clicks<00:03:05.760> into

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
that in place like so just clicks into

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.790 
that in place like so just clicks into
place<00:03:06.090> then<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.660> insert<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.530> first

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
place then you insert the first

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.670 
place then you insert the first
protection<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.700> black<00:03:09.000> layering<00:03:09.660> within<00:03:10.410> here

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
protection of black layering within here

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.430 
protection of black layering within here
and<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.270> put<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.570> Galaxy<00:03:12.959> s4<00:03:13.260> as

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
and you can put in the Galaxy s4 as

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.770 
and you can put in the Galaxy s4 as
easier<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:14.100> just<00:03:14.670> clicks<00:03:14.940> into<00:03:15.120> place<00:03:15.270> as<00:03:15.720> you

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
easier so just clicks into place as you

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.620 
easier so just clicks into place as you
can<00:03:16.650> see<00:03:16.830> there<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.250> then<00:03:17.700> close<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.300> lid

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630

let's make sure the power button
actually<00:03:19.800> works<00:03:20.100> through<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.400> case<00:03:20.640> yeah

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
actually works through the case yeah

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.360 
actually works through the case yeah
that<00:03:21.540> puts<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.840> display<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.290> asleep<00:03:22.680> let's

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
that puts that display to asleep let's

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.410 
that puts that display to asleep let's
put<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.730> sleep<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.030> see<00:03:24.120> if<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.269> home

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
put it to sleep and see if the home

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.270 
put it to sleep and see if the home
button<00:03:24.630> wakes<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.930> up<00:03:24.959> yeah<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.739> actually

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
button wakes it up yeah that actually

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.310 
button wakes it up yeah that actually
works<00:03:26.489> as<00:03:26.670> well<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.239> do<00:03:27.420> like<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.900> rugged

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
works as well so I do like this rugged

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.009 
works as well so I do like this rugged
kind<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.860> look<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.100> this<00:03:29.430> slim<00:03:29.850> armor<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.660> view

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
kind of look to this slim armor and view

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.870 
kind of look to this slim armor and view
case<00:03:31.320> itself<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.980> they<00:03:32.370> give<00:03:32.550> you<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.670> little

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
case itself and they give you a little

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.940 
case itself and they give you a little
grip<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.660> can<00:03:33.810> put<00:03:34.200> your<00:03:34.290> fingernail<00:03:34.709> in

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
grip that you can put your fingernail in

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.380 
grip that you can put your fingernail in
there<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.340> try<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:35.610> push<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.940> open<00:03:36.060> but<00:03:36.360> I

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
there and try and push it open but I

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.390 
there and try and push it open but I
find<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:36.840> better<00:03:36.989> not<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.320> use<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.800> actual

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
find it better not to use that actual

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.979 
find it better not to use that actual
grip<00:03:38.610> but<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.880> put<00:03:39.209> your<00:03:39.330> fingernail<00:03:39.660> between

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
grip but you put your fingernail between

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.289 
grip but you put your fingernail between
the<00:03:40.080> two<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:41.130> just<00:03:41.340> opens<00:03:41.730> up<00:03:41.820> like<00:03:42.090> so

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
the two and it just opens up like so

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.940 
the two and it just opens up like so
I'll<00:03:42.480> find<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.810> slightly<00:03:43.110> better<00:03:43.620> for

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
I'll find that slightly better for

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.380 
I'll find that slightly better for
myself<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.489> offers<00:03:44.730> full<00:03:45.030> rand

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
myself and it offers full rand

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.020 
myself and it offers full rand
