and this is an example of a bar you can

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.539 
and this is an example of a bar you can
see<00:03:14.019> five<00:03:14.739> different<00:03:15.160> bars<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.480> this<00:03:16.900> graph<00:03:17.549> in

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
see five different bars in this graph in

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.729 
see five different bars in this graph in
this<00:03:19.120> particular<00:03:19.450> one<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:19.810> can<00:03:20.140> also<00:03:20.380> see

this particular one you can also see
that<00:03:20.769> there<00:03:21.310> are<00:03:21.340> two<00:03:21.760> colors<00:03:22.030> in<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.450> graph

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
that there are two colors in the graph

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.190 
that there are two colors in the graph
okay<00:03:23.109> and<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:24.250> two<00:03:24.400> colors<00:03:24.760> will<00:03:25.359> explain<00:03:26.140> to

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
okay and the two colors will explain to

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.310 
okay and the two colors will explain to
you<00:03:26.440> how<00:03:27.000> two<00:03:28.000> different<00:03:28.030> things<00:03:28.900> are

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
you how two different things are

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.280 
you how two different things are
changing<00:03:30.070> okay<00:03:30.609> or<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.540> statistical

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
changing okay or the statistical

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.380 
changing okay or the statistical
information<00:03:32.410> for<00:03:33.100> two<00:03:33.280> different<00:03:33.820> things<00:03:34.150> you

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
information for two different things you

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.180 
information for two different things you
might<00:03:34.420> be<00:03:34.750> measuring<00:03:35.200> men<00:03:35.440> or<00:03:35.709> women<00:03:36.100> and

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
might be measuring men or women and

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.530 
might be measuring men or women and
changes<00:03:37.000> or<00:03:38.010> percentages<00:03:39.010> for<00:03:39.730> these<00:03:40.239> men<00:03:40.510> and

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
changes or percentages for these men and

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.680 
changes or percentages for these men and
women<00:03:40.989> in<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.230> particular<00:03:41.560> area<00:03:41.950> okay<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.570> this

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
women in a particular area okay so this

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.800 
women in a particular area okay so this
is<00:03:43.870> an<00:03:44.140> example<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:45.100> bar<00:03:45.430> graph<00:03:45.750> okay<00:03:46.750> so

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
is an example of a bar graph okay so

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.720 
is an example of a bar graph okay so
hopefully<00:03:47.290> when<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:47.950> come<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.400> write<00:03:48.579> your

hopefully when you come to write your

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.729 
hopefully when you come to write your
IELTS<00:03:49.030> or<00:03:49.269> do<00:03:49.780> your<00:03:49.930> IELTS<00:03:50.200> test<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.620> will<00:03:50.709> be

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
IELTS or do your IELTS test you will be

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.550 
IELTS or do your IELTS test you will be
familiar<00:03:51.040> with<00:03:51.459> what<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:51.790> looks<00:03:52.030> like<00:03:52.560> okay

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
familiar with what it looks like okay

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.140 
familiar with what it looks like okay
another<00:03:54.190> type<00:03:54.879> of<00:03:54.909> graph<00:03:55.480> is

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
another type of graph is

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.610 
another type of graph is
specifically<00:03:57.629> because<00:03:57.840> this<00:03:58.110> one<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.260> chart

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
specifically because this one a chart

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.759 
specifically because this one a chart
and<00:03:58.860> it's<00:03:59.189> a<00:03:59.310> pie<00:03:59.700> chart<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.450> mean<00:04:01.260> look<00:04:01.409> at<00:04:01.500> it

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
and it's a pie chart I mean look at it

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.589 
and it's a pie chart I mean look at it
it<00:04:01.829> looks<00:04:02.159> like<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.340> pie<00:04:02.579> it<00:04:02.939> looks<00:04:03.120> like<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.269> cake

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
it looks like a pie it looks like a cake

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.589 
it looks like a pie it looks like a cake
it's<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.110> round<00:04:04.409> disc<00:04:04.829> and<00:04:05.069> it's<00:04:05.700> cut<00:04:06.090> into

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
it's a round disc and it's cut into

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.860 
it's a round disc and it's cut into
different<00:04:07.170> slices<00:04:07.860> okay<00:04:08.540> each<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:09.750> these

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
different slices okay each of these

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.630 
different slices okay each of these
different<00:04:10.140> slices<00:04:10.709> are<00:04:10.920> normally<00:04:11.519> given

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
different slices are normally given

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.729 
different slices are normally given
different<00:04:12.180> colors<00:04:12.569> or<00:04:13.319> it<00:04:13.439> could<00:04:13.590> be<00:04:13.709> a

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
different colors or it could be a

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.249 
different colors or it could be a
different<00:04:14.099> pattern<00:04:14.569> in<00:04:15.569> your<00:04:15.720> aisles<00:04:16.049> is

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
different pattern in your aisles is

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.050 
different pattern in your aisles is
often<00:04:16.620> it's<00:04:16.739> black<00:04:17.009> and<00:04:17.250> white<00:04:17.519> so<00:04:17.789> you<00:04:17.820> don't

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
often it's black and white so you don't

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.960 
often it's black and white so you don't
have<00:04:18.239> colors<00:04:18.630> but<00:04:18.989> they'll<00:04:19.169> and

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
have colors but they'll and

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.300 
have colors but they'll and
differentiate<00:04:20.970> each<00:04:21.419> slice<00:04:22.079> using<00:04:22.919> different

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
differentiate each slice using different

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.969 
differentiate each slice using different
patterns<00:04:24.270> for<00:04:24.509> example<00:04:24.960> now<00:04:25.139> here<00:04:25.440> we<00:04:25.650> can<00:04:25.680> see

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
patterns for example now here we can see

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.210 
patterns for example now here we can see
they're<00:04:26.190> 1<00:04:26.370> 2<00:04:26.550> 3<00:04:26.759> 4<00:04:27.060> 5<00:04:27.479> different<00:04:28.289> parts<00:04:29.070> of

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
they're 1 2 3 4 5 different parts of

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.960 
they're 1 2 3 4 5 different parts of

of the pie chart shows different amounts
specifically<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:36.510> different<00:04:36.870> proportions

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
specifically it's different proportions

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
percentages later in this course I'm

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.890 
percentages later in this course I'm
going<00:04:44.130> to<00:04:44.250> show<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.490> how<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.880> describe<00:04:45.630> the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
going to show you how to describe the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.260 
going to show you how to describe the
different<00:04:46.229> proportions<00:04:46.860> fractions<00:04:47.850> or

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
different proportions fractions or

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.360 
different proportions fractions or
percentages<00:04:49.199> ok<00:04:50.130> but<00:04:50.849> this<00:04:51.060> is<00:04:51.300> a

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
percentages ok but this is a

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.010 
percentages ok but this is a
diagrammatical<00:04:53.370> representation<00:04:54.360> of<00:04:54.479> these

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
diagrammatical representation of these

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.939 
diagrammatical representation of these
proportions<00:04:55.440> in<00:04:55.919> what<00:04:56.430> we<00:04:56.610> call<00:04:56.880> a<00:04:57.090> pie<00:04:57.389> chart

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
proportions in what we call a pie chart

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:10.810 
proportions in what we call a pie chart
ok<00:04:58.949> so<00:04:59.550> that's<00:04:59.729> our<00:04:59.880> third<00:04:59.940> type<00:05:00.630> of<00:05:00.660> graph
