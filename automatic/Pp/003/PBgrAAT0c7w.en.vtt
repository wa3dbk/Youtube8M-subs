00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.179
 You not have to have the proportionality and 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:13.170
 basic program is any house is very 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:18.390
 simple and unique you your needs 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:21.990
 are they sleeping living eating right? 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.449
 washing your clothes do not know that right 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.869
 I have one more customer on one thing. 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.759
 totally different and I mean in 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:37.020
 who does not become you just show me 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.040
 washing well-worn clothes has the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:47.579
 program is very simple 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:50.010
 now is the organizational chart of a house with 10 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.710
 a classic shape 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.059
 this is not nearly in the curve is is as follows 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.090
 is a triangle 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:02.969
 you have to pass the housing 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.979
 services in passing a social part and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.610
 is in the rooms also with the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.070
 social social part to service and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.770
 This I learned in college has to be 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.740
 But my father does not do with his 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.350
 daughter I did not do it is not for 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.140
 I played samba on 64 one side one 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.509
 zinha ready maid passed then 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.439
 do not think there is a great prejudice in the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.909
 Brazilians are against employed in 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:34.060
 hidden set a house 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.569
 a pattern does not necessarily need 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.869
 be of a certain gender in the 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:44.560
 she has here she has to cover these 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:52.119
 functions and accommodate these functions more 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:54.520
 the lady there is a great insight 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.369
 so well defined that the organization 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.599
 in a house changes according to the city 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.039
 where so 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.489
 that is, has a Catalan city until 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.899
 recently in the wealthy article that says 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:07.179
 that there is a city that is inside 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.799
 city that is out but not the river 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.349
 January is a city that things 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.239
 happen much more outside the house in 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.370
 paulo is a city where things 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.860
 happen inside the houses of their 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.640
 housing to this changes something a 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.519
 place where taka changes mute because I 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.500
 I think this is a medium and it 's a history of 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.250
 Sao paulo nÃ© residents sÃ£o paulo 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.230
 closed on the defensive has been here for a long time. 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.250
 problem in the attack on the island I do not know 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.980
 sing all the satellite cities 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.599
 were sentry machines 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.459
 Create alert 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.510
 I think money environment a bit 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:49.090
 hostile but an insurance in January during 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.980
 Fantastic nature is very crazy 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.430
 I want to stay outside 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.819
 and here I find the opposite that it has 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.049
 a difficult environment in sÃ£o paulo 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.220
 the urban environment of sÃ£o paulo is difficult 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.920
 complicated I think one thing very 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.799
 complicated 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.069
 urban planters implant it they want 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:15.069
 eliminate the walls in the paths that we 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.680
 more and more getting more than 65 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.780
 I find it hard is one thing that right there 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.099
 certain people are segregated in the 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.430
 available but you are always welcome to 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:30.849
 citadel in fact are paulo that has 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.530
 this characteristic , but it is more 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:39.280
 closed and northeast things are more 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.010
 them to a barbecue or more closed 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.829
 when it fries better 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:48.329
 I think the weather is very influential. 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.329
 here at home the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.870
 It's our family's cabin. 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:01.569
 A person 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:04.769
 then you isolate yourself back in the 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:09.730
 taverns that were in the cave were going to hunt 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:13.530
 turned right and the house has to have is is 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.930
 Thank you for your nice sound dedetran 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.609
 environment also makes you feel safe 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.240
 that anybody even has more house 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:26.830
 January open or safe percent is the 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.990
 You work at home, you work at home today. 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.100
 a lot of people work at home much more 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.070
 somehow it is already a citadel zinha 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:42.050
 What is your purpose for protecting your family? 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:44.760
 you adopt that 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.130
 the fifth an architect make his 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.950
 So it 's a different house, it 's difficult. 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.590
 too much 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:57.890
 It's difficult when you stay in a 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:01.010
 A little bit of responsibility, right? 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:05.000
 you do not have a customer can say now 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.560
 This kitchen can not come here. 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.360
 happen in the cast can not play 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.240
 no one's fault is that there's a lot of 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.930
 ceiling people who do not design their own 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.360
 House 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.090
 buy a house at the time was godmother 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.560
 move the apartment does not have much that 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.530
 try to avoid the Mexican 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.930
 many famous that I was the sari or that 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.040
 does not have the courage to design own house 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:31.220
 who bought a house 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.700
 the internal and changed the door only 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.700
 input
