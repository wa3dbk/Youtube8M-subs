it<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:25.949> titled<00:00:26.510> my<00:00:27.510> three-point<00:00:28.500> ok<00:00:28.980> d<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
it was titled my three-point ok d is

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.370 
it was titled my three-point ok d is
legit<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.119> was<00:00:30.210> title<00:00:30.689> something<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.170> that

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
guys can copy the class setup this isn't

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.809 
guys can copy the class setup this isn't
necessarily<00:03:23.199> the<00:03:23.319> same<00:03:23.500> class<00:03:23.859> setup<00:03:24.250> as<00:03:24.400> I

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
necessarily the same class setup as I

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.599 
necessarily the same class setup as I
put<00:03:25.060> in<00:03:25.209> my<00:03:25.239> arcs<00:03:25.870> video<00:03:26.680> class<00:03:27.099> setup<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.579> I

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
put in my arcs video class setup that I

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.330 
put in my arcs video class setup that I
previously<00:03:27.879> made<00:03:28.359> like<00:03:28.629> maybe<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.379> month<00:03:30.159> ago

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340

but<00:03:30.669> the<00:03:31.090> class<00:03:31.329> setup<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.870> beast<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.609> just

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
but the class setup is beast and just

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.729 
but the class setup is beast and just
the<00:03:33.730> way<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:33.970> class<00:03:34.269> is<00:03:34.449> set<00:03:34.659> up<00:03:34.810> it's<00:03:35.049> set<00:03:35.560> up

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
the way the class is set up it's set up

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.159
