obviously is going to take two cr123

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.019 
obviously is going to take two cr123
batteries<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.800> what<00:00:25.920> we<00:00:26.039> did<00:00:26.279> actually<00:00:26.789> with

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
batteries and what we did actually with

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.640 
batteries and what we did actually with
the<00:00:27.090> flashlight<00:00:27.330> itself<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.199> brought<00:00:28.470> it

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the flashlight itself is we brought it

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.550 
the flashlight itself is we brought it
into<00:00:28.939> Photoshop<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:30.300> somebody<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.109> cpf

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
into Photoshop because somebody on cpf

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.160 
into Photoshop because somebody on cpf
form<00:00:31.890> they<00:00:32.759> are<00:00:32.820> actually<00:00:33.149> brought<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
form they are actually brought it in to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.319 
form they are actually brought it in to
photoshop<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.399> they<00:00:35.489> scaled<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.210> we

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
photoshop and they scaled it and so we

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.150 
photoshop and they scaled it and so we
did<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.510> same<00:00:36.750> thing<00:00:36.780> come<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> find<00:00:37.890> out<00:00:38.100> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
did the same thing come to find out that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.920 
did the same thing come to find out that
this<00:00:38.520> particular<00:00:38.700> flashlight<00:00:39.540> looks<00:00:39.780> like

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
this particular flashlight looks like

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.959 
this particular flashlight looks like
it's<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.469> between<00:00:40.860> five<00:00:41.640> point

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
it's going to be between five point

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.420 
it's going to be between five point
seven<00:00:42.239> five<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.930> six<00:00:43.110> inches<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.559> length<00:00:43.710> so

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
seven five and six inches in length so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.180 
seven five and six inches in length so
we're<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.420> impressed<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.379> size<00:00:46.739> we

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
we're really impressed with that size we

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.639 
we're really impressed with that size we
like<00:00:47.370> things<00:00:47.550> small<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.090> powerful<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.719> this

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
like things small and powerful and this

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.380 
like things small and powerful and this
is<00:00:49.800> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.160> more<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:52.039> spread<00:00:53.149> type<00:00:54.149> of

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
is going to be more of a spread type of

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.610 
is going to be more of a spread type of
light<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.050> give<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> good<00:00:55.350> broad

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
light it's going to give a good broad

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.060 
light it's going to give a good broad
area<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.309> more<00:00:57.300> than<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.660> distance<00:00:58.109> because

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
area and more than just distance because

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.889 
area and more than just distance because
it's<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> actually<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.180> using<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> quan

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
it's going to actually be using a quan

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.930 
it's going to actually be using a quan

right here everything is identical
there's<00:01:15.180> only<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.420> couple<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.810> things<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.170> are

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
there's only a couple of things that are

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.499 
there's only a couple of things that are
slightly<00:01:16.680> different<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> g500<00:01:18.390> as

things that I like about this flashlight
it's<00:04:14.390> going<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.570> be<00:04:14.690> powered<00:04:15.049> by<00:04:15.200> lithium

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
it's going to be powered by lithium

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.860 
it's going to be powered by lithium
phosphate<00:04:16.250> battery<00:04:16.669> as<00:04:16.880> opposed<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.810> a

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
phosphate battery as opposed to a

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.990 
phosphate battery as opposed to a
lithium<00:04:18.260> ion<00:04:18.380> battery<00:04:19.070> which<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.430> supposed<00:04:19.880> to

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
lithium ion battery which is supposed to

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.550 
lithium ion battery which is supposed to
be<00:04:20.120> much<00:04:20.330> safer<00:04:20.599> as<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.049> rechargeable<00:04:21.859> battery

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
be much safer as a rechargeable battery

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.230 
be much safer as a rechargeable battery
the<00:04:22.889> other<00:04:23.040> thing<00:04:23.280> that<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.430> like<00:04:23.639> about<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.970> is

the other thing that I like about it is
that<00:04:24.270> they're<00:04:24.510> actually<00:04:24.720> going<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.139> have<00:04:25.410> a

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
that they're actually going to have a

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.790 
that they're actually going to have a
solid<00:04:26.340> copper<00:04:27.060> core<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:27.780> it's<00:04:28.470> still<00:04:28.650> going

is going to be 900 lumens the other
thing<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.270> I'm<00:04:42.480> going<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.660> like<00:04:42.840> about<00:04:43.020> this

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
thing that I'm going to like about this

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.020 
thing that I'm going to like about this
is<00:04:43.440> that<00:04:43.620> it's<00:04:43.860> going<00:04:43.950> to<00:04:44.010> actually<00:04:44.250> have<00:04:44.790> a

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
is that it's going to actually have a

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.900 
is that it's going to actually have a
black<00:04:45.480> electric<00:04:46.260> coated<00:04:46.620> version<00:04:46.830> as<00:04:47.250> well<00:04:47.580> as

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
black electric coated version as well as

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.610 
black electric coated version as well as
a<00:04:47.940> gold<00:04:48.270> one<00:04:48.450> probably<00:04:48.930> for<00:04:49.050> your<00:04:49.139> collectors

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
a gold one probably for your collectors

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.520 
a gold one probably for your collectors
out<00:04:49.770> there<00:04:49.830> so<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:51.510> measurement<00:04:52.230> that<00:04:52.470> we

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
out there so the measurement that we

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.090 
out there so the measurement that we
were<00:04:52.770> able<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:53.160> scale<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:53.880> right<00:04:54.690> around<00:04:55.100> five

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
were able to scale is right around five

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.980 
were able to scale is right around five
to<00:04:56.310> five<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.729> a<00:04:56.760> half<00:04:56.820> inches<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.780> if<00:04:57.870> you

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
to five and a half inches and if you

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.960 
to five and a half inches and if you
actually<00:04:58.200> look<00:04:58.440> at<00:04:58.860> this<00:04:59.160> is<00:04:59.340> kind<00:04:59.550> of<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.700> dim

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
actually look at this is kind of a dim

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.340 
actually look at this is kind of a dim
picture<00:05:00.419> is<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.660> best<00:05:00.870> one<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.050> I<00:05:01.169> could

find that I could capture and brighten

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.020 
find that I could capture and brighten
up<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.710> bit<00:05:04.919> but<00:05:05.070> on<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.340> ends<00:05:05.669> this<00:05:05.760> is<00:05:05.880> going
