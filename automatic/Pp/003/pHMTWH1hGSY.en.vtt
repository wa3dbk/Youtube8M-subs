00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
preview 30 here and this is the farm

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.780 
preview 30 here and this is the farm
house<00:00:12.120> or<00:00:12.540> farm<00:00:12.990> workbench<00:00:13.799> guide<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.610> let's

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
house or farm workbench guide so let's

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.290 
house or farm workbench guide so let's
begin<00:00:14.940> there's<00:00:15.450> three<00:00:15.660> parts<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:17.300> design

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
begin there's three parts to this design

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.060 
begin there's three parts to this design
which<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> turret<00:00:19.080> first<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> lawnmower

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
which is the turret first is a lawnmower

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.980 
which is the turret first is a lawnmower
will<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:20.970> area<00:00:21.270> right<00:00:21.600> around<00:00:21.750> here

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
will be in this area right around here

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.630 
will be in this area right around here
where<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.199> am<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> world<00:00:22.920> or<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.400> that

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
where I am in the world or in that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.210 
where I am in the world or in that
corner<00:00:23.970> where<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.330> looked<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.810> house<00:00:25.260> or

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
do we got it so you go up to the work

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.490 
do we got it so you go up to the work
bench<00:00:28.019> right<00:00:28.439> here<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.340> hold<00:00:29.550> X<00:00:29.789> now<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> next

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
bench right here and hold X now the next

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.740 
bench right here and hold X now the next
piece<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> find<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.750> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
piece that I'm going to find is the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.630 
piece that I'm going to find is the
machine<00:00:34.110> gun<00:00:34.320> because<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:35.040> are<00:00:35.160> building<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
machine gun because we are building a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.639 
machine gun because we are building a
turret<00:00:36.300> okay<00:00:36.600> ignore<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.050> part<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.500> part

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
turret okay ignore that part that part

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.220 
turret okay ignore that part that part
is<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.040> later<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.940> okay<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.780> went<00:00:40.140> up

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
is for later on and okay so I went up

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.709 
is for later on and okay so I went up
here<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.860> machine<00:00:41.309> gun<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.670> leans<00:00:42.390> against

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
here the machine gun is leans against

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.000 
here the machine gun is leans against
the<00:00:42.750> wall<00:00:43.100> around<00:00:44.100> here<00:00:44.550> or<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.870> which<00:00:46.829> is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the wall around here or it's which is

we<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.450> use<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> turret<00:01:54.899> now<00:01:55.079> some<00:01:55.649> advice

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
we can use the turret now some advice

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.920 
we can use the turret now some advice
the<00:01:56.280> turret<00:01:56.610> has<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.180> used<00:01:57.390> with<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the turret has to be used with the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.510 
the turret has to be used with the
turbine<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.799> put<00:01:58.950> down<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> turret

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
turbine so if you put down the turret

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.069 
turbine so if you put down the turret
put<00:01:59.820> down<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.030> turbine<00:02:00.360> next<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.840> order<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
put down the turbine next to in order to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.440 
put down the turbine next to in order to
power<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:01.890> we'll<00:02:01.979> shoot<00:02:02.130> zombies

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
power it you know we'll shoot zombies
