00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.720
 like something like mashed potatoes from here 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.940
 this powder know that 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.610
 will prepare fast food with something 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.459
 similar to the same mash that is mashed and 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.890
 somehow not really tasty okay let's in 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.130

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.780

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:14.190
 here 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:17.850
 holiday we come well, in principle, meat 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.340
 still all right if that is ok 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.519
 do not take into account the potatoes here it is not 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.709
 tasty this meat is basically ok 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.050
 such something on everything drips there too 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.900
 a lot of water this but not water but the sauce 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.870
 Well, let's try this 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.010
 Something that someone can not just once 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.010
 tried out so well come here something 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.910

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.910
 mysql 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.330
 good meat but the only two 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.240
 minus 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.310
 it's not tasty potatoes and that's too 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.830
 a lot of sauce but where does it come from so much here 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.210
 here you can just drown in it well 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.640
 dofig of course well, so here's all in 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.930
 principle of norms 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.170
 Of course, to be honest, I'd rather take 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.060
