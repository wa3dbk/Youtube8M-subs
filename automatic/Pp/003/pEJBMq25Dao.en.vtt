00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
it looked like it was like it like it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.830 
it looked like it was like it like it
was<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.460> training<00:00:50.969> going<00:00:51.329> around<00:00:51.660> his

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
was kind of training going around his

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.810 
was kind of training going around his
back<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.920> says<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> eighty-four

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
back so I and it says that eighty-four

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.700 
back so I and it says that eighty-four
percent<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.780> people<00:00:54.989> who<00:00:55.260> go<00:00:55.440> vegan

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
percent of people who go vegan

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.700 
percent of people who go vegan
ultimately<00:00:56.489> go<00:00:56.789> back<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:58.530> their

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
ultimately go back to to what their

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
ultimately go back to to what their
lifestyle<00:00:59.190> was<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.879> believe<00:01:00.390> that

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
lifestyle was and that I believe that

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.779 
lifestyle was and that I believe that
these<00:01:01.140> are<00:01:01.320> mainly<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.800> dietary<00:01:02.340> vegans

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
these are mainly the dietary vegans

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.020 
these are mainly the dietary vegans
because<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.960> was<00:01:04.140> an<00:01:04.769> ethical<00:01:05.189> vegan<00:01:05.369> once<00:01:05.880> you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
because I was an ethical vegan once you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.370 
because I was an ethical vegan once you
understand<00:01:06.630> what's<00:01:06.810> happening<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
understand what's happening to the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.020 
understand what's happening to the
animals<00:01:07.950> into<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.280> planet<00:01:08.820> when<00:01:08.939> you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
animals into the planet when you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.609 
animals into the planet when you
contribute<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.780> kind<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.110> pain<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
contribute to that kind of pain and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.770 
contribute to that kind of pain and
suffering<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> torture<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.880> our<00:01:12.060> natural

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
suffering and the torture of our natural

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.929 
suffering and the torture of our natural
resources<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.590> planet<00:01:13.890> once<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.580> really

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
resources on this planet once you really

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.850 
resources on this planet once you really
fully<00:01:15.240> understand<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.439> can

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
fully understand that you just can

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.890 
fully understand that you just can
simply<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:17.729> back<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.299> believe<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
simply not go back and I believe that a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.070 
simply not go back and I believe that a
lot<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.380> people<00:01:19.500> arguing<00:01:20.220> um<00:01:20.659> vegan<00:01:21.659> for

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
lot of people arguing um vegan for

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.859 
lot of people arguing um vegan for
dietary<00:01:22.680> reasons<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.330> fact<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.810> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
dietary reasons and the fact is that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.980 
dietary reasons and the fact is that
diets<00:01:25.590> are<00:01:25.770> temporary<00:01:26.400> back<00:01:26.700> diet<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.810> not

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
diets are temporary back diet do not

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.440 
diets are temporary back diet do not
last<00:01:28.229> forever<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> why<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.850> consider<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
last forever this is why we consider the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.230

it for the animals in the environment it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.830 
it for the animals in the environment it
sound<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.970> switch<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:45.390> brain<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
sound like a switch in your brain it

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.660 
sound like a switch in your brain it
just<00:01:46.020> turns<00:01:46.259> over<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.189> can't<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.490> go

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
just turns over and you can't really go

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.219
