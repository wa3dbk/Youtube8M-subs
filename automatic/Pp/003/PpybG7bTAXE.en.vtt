from cover to cover and was just blown
away<00:00:56.899> every<00:00:57.899> article<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.350> there<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.620> talking

away every article in there was talking

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.099 
away every article in there was talking
about<00:00:59.390> integrative<00:01:00.390> thinking<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.870> know<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
about integrative thinking you know the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
about integrative thinking you know the
right<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> left<00:01:01.620> brain<00:01:01.980> working

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760

practices<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.500> have<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> intuition

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
practices to have the intuition

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.020 
practices to have the intuition
influencing<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.930> linear<00:01:10.860> thinking<00:01:11.369> because

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
influencing the linear thinking because

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.550 
influencing the linear thinking because
then<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> come<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.990> much<00:01:13.260> better

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
then you come up with a much better

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.770 
then you come up with a much better
resolution<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:15.049> problem-solving<00:01:17.659> there<00:01:18.659> was

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
resolution in problem-solving there was

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.230 
resolution in problem-solving there was
various<00:01:19.470> different<00:01:20.130> kinds<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.610> articles<00:01:21.060> were

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
various different kinds of articles were

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.969 
various different kinds of articles were
all<00:01:21.479> basically<00:01:21.840> saying<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> same<00:01:22.350> thing<00:01:22.770> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I was just blown away thought this is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.219 
I was just blown away thought this is

take<00:01:28.560> risks<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.400> learned<00:01:29.670> how<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.939> trust<00:01:30.420> my

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
take risks and I learned how to trust my

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.969 
take risks and I learned how to trust my
intuition<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.950> learned<00:01:32.189> how<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.520> use<00:01:33.180> my

intuition and I learned how to use my

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.219 
intuition and I learned how to use my
analytical<00:01:34.979> skills<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.880> bring<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.570> intuition

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
analytical skills to bring the intuition

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.069 
analytical skills to bring the intuition
into<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> foreground<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.640> how<00:01:39.329> my<00:01:39.509> intuition

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
into the foreground and how my intuition

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.760 
into the foreground and how my intuition
can<00:01:40.520> inform<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.240> analytical<00:01:42.930> skills<00:01:43.110> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
can inform the the analytical skills and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.649 
can inform the the analytical skills and
and<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.579> these<00:01:44.700> different<00:01:44.909> articles<00:01:45.509> were

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and all these different articles were

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.740 
and all these different articles were
saying<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.049> same<00:01:46.259> thing<00:01:46.759> so<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.000> really

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
saying the same thing so it really

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.170 
saying the same thing so it really
opened<00:01:49.110> my<00:01:49.200> mind<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.829> my<00:01:50.009> god<00:01:50.340> maybe<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.790> could

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
opened my mind that my god maybe I could

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.580 
opened my mind that my god maybe I could
use<00:01:51.869> my<00:01:52.619> techniques<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.270> painter<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.350> teach

know and sort of get in touch with
intuitive<00:04:32.240> connections<00:04:33.140> and<00:04:33.290> I<00:04:33.380> also<00:04:33.560> had<00:04:33.800> not

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
intuitive connections and I also had not

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.700 
intuitive connections and I also had not
done<00:04:34.160> much<00:04:34.370> art<00:04:34.670> and<00:04:35.480> I<00:04:35.660> really<00:04:35.990> felt<00:04:36.230> given

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
done much art and I really felt given

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.850 
done much art and I really felt given
permission<00:04:37.340> to<00:04:37.370> just<00:04:37.970> really<00:04:38.240> play<00:04:38.860> Marianne

permission to just really play Marianne

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.310 
permission to just really play Marianne
began<00:04:40.190> working<00:04:40.430> with<00:04:40.790> us<00:04:41.180> on<00:04:41.450> bringing<00:04:41.990> in

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
began working with us on bringing in

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.430 
began working with us on bringing in
knowledge<00:04:43.040> bases<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.970> analytical<00:04:44.780> tools<00:04:44.810> and

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
knowledge bases and analytical tools and

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.020 
knowledge bases and analytical tools and
being<00:04:45.650> able<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.980> really<00:04:46.220> look<00:04:46.460> at<00:04:46.670> what<00:04:46.700> was

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
being able to really look at what was

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
there and make some decisions and so

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.220 
there and make some decisions and so
that<00:04:49.610> back<00:04:49.910> and<00:04:50.150> forth<00:04:50.450> has<00:04:50.690> been<00:04:50.900> really

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
that back and forth has been really

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.190 
that back and forth has been really
terrific<00:04:51.670> her<00:04:52.670> art<00:04:52.940> lessons<00:04:53.450> involve<00:04:53.870> some

terrific her art lessons involve some

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.220 
terrific her art lessons involve some
pretty<00:04:54.410> interesting<00:04:54.770> ideas<00:04:55.660> often<00:04:56.660> she

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
pretty interesting ideas often she

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.470 
pretty interesting ideas often she
starts<00:04:57.680> out<00:04:57.890> by<00:04:58.190> having<00:04:58.400> students<00:04:58.850> draw<00:04:59.150> from

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
starts out by having students draw from

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.260 
starts out by having students draw from
a<00:04:59.630> still-life<00:05:00.140> set<00:05:00.500> up<00:05:00.680> but<00:05:01.520> they<00:05:01.700> must<00:05:02.030> not

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
a still-life set up but they must not

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.159 
a still-life set up but they must not
look<00:05:02.660> down<00:05:02.870> at<00:05:03.140> the<00:05:03.230> paper<00:05:03.410> as<00:05:03.830> they<00:05:04.400> work

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
look down at the paper as they work

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.870 
look down at the paper as they work
after<00:05:06.169> many<00:05:06.410> short<00:05:06.800> drawings<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:07.550> students

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
after many short drawings the students

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:17.359 
after many short drawings the students
grow<00:05:08.120> more<00:05:08.390> relaxed<00:05:09.110> in<00:05:09.230> the<00:05:09.260> process

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:17.369 

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:20.399 

she<00:05:18.369> often<00:05:18.759> encourages<00:05:19.449> her<00:05:19.659> students<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.169> add

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:20.409 
she often encourages her students to add

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.149 
she often encourages her students to add
color<00:05:20.949> to<00:05:21.639> these<00:05:21.819> line<00:05:22.149> drawings<00:05:22.919> the<00:05:23.919> color

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
color to these line drawings the color

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:25.139 
color to these line drawings the color
is<00:05:24.399> intuitive

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:25.149 
is intuitive

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:27.809 
is intuitive
she<00:05:25.659> dismantles<00:05:26.319> the<00:05:26.409> setup<00:05:26.889> before<00:05:27.639> they

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:27.819 
she dismantles the setup before they

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:36.319 
she dismantles the setup before they
even<00:05:28.089> begin<00:05:28.839> with<00:05:29.319> the<00:05:29.499> color<00:05:29.709> pastels

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:36.329 

00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:39.179 

Marianne<00:05:37.329> then<00:05:37.779> has<00:05:38.049> them<00:05:38.319> draw<00:05:38.559> not<00:05:38.889> from

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:39.189 
Marianne then has them draw not from

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.929 
Marianne then has them draw not from
reality<00:05:39.549> but<00:05:40.479> from<00:05:40.779> inside<00:05:41.409> themselves<00:05:41.939> this

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:42.939 
reality but from inside themselves this

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:46.609 
reality but from inside themselves this
time<00:05:42.999> you're<00:05:43.539> going<00:05:43.719> to<00:05:43.839> draw<00:05:44.669> your<00:05:45.669> mother

00:05:46.609 --> 00:05:46.619 
time you're going to draw your mother

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:50.279 
time you're going to draw your mother
you're<00:05:47.619> not<00:05:47.649> drawing<00:05:48.159> a<00:05:48.699> picture<00:05:49.360> you're

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
you're not drawing a picture you're

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:56.320 
you're not drawing a picture you're
drawing<00:05:50.649> the<00:05:51.550> essence<00:05:51.999> of<00:05:52.179> your<00:05:52.360> mother

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.409 

so<00:05:56.990> these<00:05:57.199> line<00:05:57.590> drawings<00:05:57.620> convey<00:05:58.610> meaning

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
so these line drawings convey meaning

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.499 
so these line drawings convey meaning
and<00:05:59.690> emotion<00:05:59.990> without<00:06:00.889> being<00:06:01.699> a<00:06:01.819> copy<00:06:02.120> of

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
and emotion without being a copy of

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:07.810 
and emotion without being a copy of
reality

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820

with numerous tissues around the bed

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.320 
with numerous tissues around the bed

like this sinusitis and cold everything
that<00:06:21.630> may<00:06:21.960> make<00:06:22.139> fit<00:06:22.350> for<00:06:22.530> today<00:06:24.800> started<00:06:27.470> it's

that may make fit for today started it's
a<00:06:28.590> life<00:06:28.949> tool

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
a life tool

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.450 
a life tool
that<00:06:30.830> no<00:06:31.070> matter<00:06:31.100> what<00:06:31.820> you're<00:06:32.060> doing<00:06:32.090> in<00:06:32.630> life

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
that no matter what you're doing in life

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.600 
that no matter what you're doing in life
understanding<00:06:34.460> yourself<00:06:34.640> and<00:06:35.330> how<00:06:36.200> these<00:06:37.160> two

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
understanding yourself and how these two

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.670 
understanding yourself and how these two
ways<00:06:38.120> of<00:06:38.450> thinking<00:06:38.660> work<00:06:39.260> together

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
ways of thinking work together

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.650 
ways of thinking work together
simultaneously<00:06:40.220> is<00:06:41.170> absolutely<00:06:42.170> necessary

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
simultaneously is absolutely necessary

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.010 
simultaneously is absolutely necessary
so<00:06:44.660> her<00:06:44.900> basic<00:06:45.380> idea<00:06:45.830> is<00:06:46.130> to<00:06:46.400> move<00:06:46.910> step<00:06:47.780> by

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
so her basic idea is to move step by

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.460 
so her basic idea is to move step by
step<00:06:48.410> from<00:06:49.040> the<00:06:49.280> concrete<00:06:50.000> into<00:06:50.930> the<00:06:50.960> abstract

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:51.470 
step from the concrete into the abstract

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.700 
step from the concrete into the abstract
and<00:06:52.090> encourage<00:06:53.090> her<00:06:53.270> students<00:06:53.690> to<00:06:53.750> learn<00:06:54.050> to

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
and encourage her students to learn to

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.820 
and encourage her students to learn to
trust<00:06:55.040> in<00:06:55.310> their<00:06:55.790> own<00:06:55.870> intuition<00:06:56.870> I<00:06:57.110> had<00:06:57.590> a<00:06:57.620> guy

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
trust in their own intuition I had a guy

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.030 
trust in their own intuition I had a guy
from<00:06:58.250> China<00:06:58.280> in<00:06:59.030> the<00:06:59.180> class<00:06:59.450> I'm<00:07:00.080> very<00:07:00.620> linear

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.040 
from China in the class I'm very linear

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.520 
from China in the class I'm very linear
thinker<00:07:01.520> very<00:07:01.880> linear<00:07:02.210> thinker<00:07:02.630> but<00:07:02.840> I<00:07:03.050> didn't

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
thinker very linear thinker but I didn't

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.530 
thinker very linear thinker but I didn't
know<00:07:03.710> I<00:07:03.740> could<00:07:04.190> think<00:07:04.730> this<00:07:04.910> way<00:07:05.090> I<00:07:05.120> didn't

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 
know I could think this way I didn't

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.300 
know I could think this way I didn't
know<00:07:05.660> I<00:07:05.690> could<00:07:06.020> think<00:07:06.230> intuitively<00:07:06.590> and<00:07:07.130> now<00:07:07.280> I

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
know I could think intuitively and now I

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.450 
know I could think intuitively and now I
understand<00:07:08.030> how<00:07:08.660> my<00:07:09.160> intuition<00:07:10.160> and<00:07:10.340> my

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
understand how my intuition and my

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.540 
understand how my intuition and my
linear<00:07:11.120> thinking<00:07:11.540> can<00:07:11.750> work<00:07:11.900> together<00:07:12.110> I<00:07:12.550> was

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
linear thinking can work together I was

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.650 
linear thinking can work together I was
like<00:07:13.640> wow<00:07:14.440> it<00:07:15.440> works
