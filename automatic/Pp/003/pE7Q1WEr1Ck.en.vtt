00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
is not like 2010 or 2012 it's a very

different election cycle and and one

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.319 
different election cycle and and one
that<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.500> think<00:01:43.710> people<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.250> learned<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:45.090> from

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
that I think people have learned in from

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.760 
that I think people have learned in from
the<00:01:45.450> 2006<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.259> particularly<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> two

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the 2006 in particularly the two

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
the 2006 in particularly the two
thousand<00:01:47.130> eight<00:01:47.159> election<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.700> 2008<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.570> think

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
thousand eight election in 2008 I think

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.440 
thousand eight election in 2008 I think
the<00:01:49.290> American<00:01:49.619> people<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.640> wanted<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the American people you know wanted a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.330 
the American people you know wanted a
president<00:01:51.930> who<00:01:52.140> they<00:01:52.259> could<00:01:52.320> believe<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
president who they could believe in and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
president who they could believe in and
I<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:53.790> after<00:01:53.909> two<00:01:54.180> years<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.750> what

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
I think after two years of that what

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.139 
I think after two years of that what
they've<00:01:55.320> realized<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.159> America<00:01:56.640> needs<00:01:56.880> a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
they've realized that as America needs a

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.420 
they've realized that as America needs a
president<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.140> believes<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.680> them

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
president that believes in them

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.920 
president that believes in them
and<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.150> really<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
and and I really think that's the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.120 
and and I really think that's the
fundamental<00:02:01.080> issue<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.010> have<00:02:02.040> a

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
fundamental issue here do we have a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.090 
fundamental issue here do we have a
present<00:02:02.550> who<00:02:02.610> believes<00:02:02.910> that<00:02:03.980> you<00:02:04.980> know

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
present who believes that you know

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.530 
present who believes that you know
things<00:02:05.340> should<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.520> run<00:02:05.760> out<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.910> Washington

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
things should be run out of Washington

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.719 
things should be run out of Washington
that<00:02:06.720> that<00:02:07.560> all<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.980> the<00:02:08.039> answers<00:02:08.220> reside

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that that all of the answers reside

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.760 
that that all of the answers reside
right<00:02:09.360> back<00:02:09.630> there<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:10.110> him<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.560> with<00:02:10.619> the
