so we got to make sure that the same
time<00:00:27.630> we're<00:00:27.840> not<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.349> too<00:00:28.650> long<00:00:28.680> because

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
time we're not out here too long because

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.999 
time we're not out here too long because

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
that will take its toll because as 19

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.430

guys<00:00:32.369> go<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.780> need<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.050> remember<00:00:34.079> is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
guys go out but we need to remember is

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.139 
guys go out but we need to remember is
that<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.829> increasing<00:00:35.370> everybody's<00:00:35.730> reps<00:00:36.000> when

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
that is increasing everybody's reps when

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.490 
that is increasing everybody's reps when
it<00:00:36.239> goes<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> special<00:00:36.840> teams<00:00:37.020> off<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it goes to special teams off at the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.440 
it goes to special teams off at the
defense<00:00:37.920> because<00:00:38.309> obviously<00:00:39.059> they're

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
defense because obviously they're

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.910 
defense because obviously they're
starting<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.809> lose<00:00:40.050> guys<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.649> lose<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
starting to lose guys and lose the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.030 
starting to lose guys and lose the
ability<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.489> rotate<00:00:41.640> as<00:00:42.000> much<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:43.040> still

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
ability to rotate as much so still

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.500 
ability to rotate as much so still
thought<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> good<00:00:44.550> practice<00:00:45.000> there

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
thought it was a good practice there

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.490 
thought it was a good practice there
were<00:00:45.629> some<00:00:45.840> good<00:00:46.559> things<00:00:46.620> done<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:48.500> they're

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
were some good things done and they're

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200 
were some good things done and they're
still<00:00:49.710> coming<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:50.129> if<00:00:50.670> you've<00:00:50.850> nowhere<00:00:51.059> in

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
still coming out if you've nowhere in

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.330 
still coming out if you've nowhere in

battle through injuries and playing

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.279 
battle through injuries and playing
Xavier<00:06:00.979> head<00:06:01.129> class<00:06:01.400> so<00:06:01.669> he<00:06:01.699> was<00:06:01.879> late<00:06:02.090> today
