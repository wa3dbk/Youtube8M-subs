 how about friends again here good 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.869
 Well let's continue with our series 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.800
 of tutorials to modify our 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.290
 samsung galaxy note in its gt version 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.710
 of 7000 today we will continue 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.270
 with a fairly fast process that is the 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.829
 installation of clockwork recovery mode 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.659
 s &amp; w as many know him 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.670
 good what are the requirements for 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:42.129
 start quickly 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.480
 we must have installed in our 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.060
 galaxy device no 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.150
 a stock branch of telcel sorry a branch 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.910
 samsung stock do not believe me much is 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.630
 a stock branch of samson 2.3.5 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.630
 gingerbread 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.510
 and we must have rooted our galaxy 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.729
 note if you still do not have any of the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.369
 two things or you need to root 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.440
 the phone in our channel 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.060
 look for the videotutorials where 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.970
 they will find them and they will be able to do 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.700
 the modification of your galaxy no and good 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.890
 Well let's start 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.289
 Our team is very important to have 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.270
 activated the boxes as the 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.950
 I mentioned in the previous video in 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.130
 configuration the boxes let's see 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.049
 in the applications tab have 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.799
 activated the box of origins 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:43.630
 unknown and developing having 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:45.700
 activated debug usb 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.009
 If we are already sure of this, well, 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.880
 let's start with the process this is 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:56.049
 Pretty fast, it does not take a minute 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.799
 well then let's open first that 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.799
 nothing 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:06.190
 in our computer on our computer 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.780
 the file called cf root 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.600
 and here they have it already decompressed in the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.790
 ferrol folder 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.490
 let's open the folder and well we have 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.180
 two files that says 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.100
 You ask us whether we will already be 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.450
 our phone rooted to laugh and ruth 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.100
 the ready router and notebook jet 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.530
 in this case as we already have our 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.230
 Rooted phone let's run the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.950
 first goat called and ready 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.950
 router 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.260
 let's execute it 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:47.480
 and it shows us this screen 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.550
 where are we going to start the process we are going to 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.880
 connect again our samsung galaxy 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.880
 note 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.739
 I like it already connected I did not detect it 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.739
 the team 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.670
 and good once connected we go to 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.350
 press any key any key to 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.300
 start 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.250
 asks us again to press the other 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.010
 key let's give it again any 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.060
 key and it's going to start the process 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.800
 there it is finished 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.870
 here is our galaxy is not going to 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.879
 restart 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.140
 the same program is going to restart us 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.170
 team 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.610
 she did not restart it and the program 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.650
 asks to press another key and be able 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.100
 continue and it will close 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.010
 automatically the program 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.110
 as I told you this step is pretty 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.320
 simple 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.320
 here is starting our galaxy nou 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:50.240
 and we will wait 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.240
 to enter the system 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.360
 here we are already 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.370
 well then 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.590
 when you start your system you will not see 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.440
 no installed application this is 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.290
 because it does it does it internal in the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.650
 team like to see that the 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.840
 club for very good recovery well let's go 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.010
 turn off our device 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.010
 let's turn it off 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.180
 and we're going to come in with a combination of 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.690
 keys let's wait for it to finish 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.690
 go out 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.099
 and ready let's go with the 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:39.639
 key combination that is volume 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:41.999
 up home key and power key at the same 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.999
 weather 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.990
 at this moment we are going 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.459
 here until now we are going to drop the 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.459

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:03.210

 I can not focus very well but good 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.189
 when you enter this screen , you're leaving 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.110

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:27.409
