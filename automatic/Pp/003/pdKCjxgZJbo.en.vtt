here inside the shield just kind of plug
in<00:00:43.829> right<00:00:44.040> there<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.550> might<00:00:44.789> actually<00:00:45.000> be

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
in right there I might actually be

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.229 
in right there I might actually be
putting<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:47.250> opposite<00:00:47.789> way<00:00:47.850> it's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
putting it in the opposite way it's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.330 
putting it in the opposite way it's
supposed<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> go<00:00:50.780> let's<00:00:51.780> see<00:00:55.039> well<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.190> kind

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
supposed to go let's see well it's kind

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.799 
supposed to go let's see well it's kind
of<00:00:56.370> hard<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.910> while<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.239> shield's<00:00:57.660> on

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
of hard to do it while the shield's on

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.150 
of hard to do it while the shield's on
but<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.260> get<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> idea

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
but you get the idea

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.560 
but you get the idea
beam<00:00:59.940> sabers<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:00.510> inside<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.170> shield<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
beam sabers go inside the shield and

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.670 
beam sabers go inside the shield and
inset<00:01:03.570> those<00:01:03.719> little<00:01:03.960> folders<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.559> these

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
inset those little folders and these

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.100 
inset those little folders and these
little<00:01:04.920> holders<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.970> come<00:01:06.270> off<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.930> there's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
little holders do come off so there's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.149 
little holders do come off so there's
something<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.710> want<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> pay<00:01:08.130> attention

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
something that you want to pay attention

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.240 
something that you want to pay attention
for<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.840> know<00:01:09.960> when<00:01:10.140> buying<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:10.909> used<00:01:13.250> there

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
for you know when buying one used there

we got that back on there you can see

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.870 
we got that back on there you can see
the<00:01:18.390> figure<00:01:18.750> cut<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:19.979> much<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the figure cut it's like much like the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.510 
the figure cut it's like much like the
regular<00:01:21.090> tallgeese<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:22.590> -<00:01:23.180> same<00:01:24.180> main<00:01:24.689> body

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
regular tallgeese one - same main body

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.300 
regular tallgeese one - same main body
similar<00:01:26.520> type<00:01:26.909> color<00:01:27.270> scheme<00:01:27.689> as<00:01:27.930> usual<00:01:28.439> step

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
similar type color scheme as usual step

the blue and the white and a light gray

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.960 
the blue and the white and a light gray
now<00:01:32.869> what<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.009> got<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:37.820> epyon<00:01:38.820> that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
now what it's kind of got a epyon that

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.940 
now what it's kind of got a epyon that
had<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> black<00:01:39.390> whip<00:01:39.750> now<00:01:40.229> has<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> grey<00:01:40.740> whip

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
had a black whip now has a grey whip

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.149 
had a black whip now has a grey whip
this<00:01:41.310> whip<00:01:41.490> also<00:01:41.970> has<00:01:42.659> more<00:01:43.020> flexibility<00:01:43.920> in

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
this whip also has more flexibility in

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.280 
this whip also has more flexibility in
it<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> FBI<00:01:44.729> whip<00:01:45.000> was<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.509> real<00:01:45.750> straight

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
it the FBI whip was just real straight

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.520 
it the FBI whip was just real straight
whereas<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.970> kind<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.270> curve<00:01:48.720> up

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
whereas this one can kind of curve up

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.249 
whereas this one can kind of curve up
and<00:01:49.829> down<00:01:50.119> very<00:01:51.119> cool<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:54.299> whip<00:01:54.479> also<00:01:54.960> comes

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
and down very cool the whip also comes

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.990 
and down very cool the whip also comes
out<00:01:55.590> well<00:01:56.399> let<00:01:56.820> me<00:01:56.909> note<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:58.200> part

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
out well let me note that this part

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.530 
out well let me note that this part
turns

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
turns

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.500 
turns
so<00:02:01.530> even<00:02:01.770> goes<00:02:01.950> out<00:02:02.220> of<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:05.120> has<00:02:06.120> a<00:02:06.180> little

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
so even goes out of it has a little

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.830 
so even goes out of it has a little
hollow<00:02:07.050> point<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.100> will<00:02:08.450> just<00:02:09.450> kind<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
hollow point if you will just kind of

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.830 
hollow point if you will just kind of
plugs<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.410> there<00:02:11.150> neither<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.420> used<00:02:12.630> as<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
plugs in there neither be used as a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.370 
plugs in there neither be used as a
weapon<00:02:13.110> or<00:02:14.150> just<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.570> know<00:02:15.600> because<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:16.170> looks

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
weapon or just you know because it looks

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.850 
weapon or just you know because it looks
cool

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
cool

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.370 
cool
there's<00:02:17.160> whips<00:02:17.430> not<00:02:17.670> extended<00:02:18.330> that's<00:02:19.230> one

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
there's whips not extended that's one

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.480 
there's whips not extended that's one
thing<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.590> really<00:02:19.770> like<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.010> always<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
thing I really like I always like the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.700 
thing I really like I always like the
shield<00:02:20.760> -<00:02:21.120> very<00:02:21.900> cool<00:02:22.320> shield<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:25.170> boosters

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
shield - very cool shield the boosters

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.700 
shield - very cool shield the boosters
are<00:02:26.040> not<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.730> same<00:02:26.940> as<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.330> tallgeese<00:02:27.780> one

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
are not the same as the tallgeese one

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.340 
are not the same as the tallgeese one
and<00:02:28.890> two<00:02:29.070> because<00:02:29.580> they're<00:02:30.090> designed<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:31.200> go

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
and two because they're designed to go

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.610 
and two because they're designed to go
up<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.280> as<00:02:32.880> well<00:02:33.090> as<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.230> see<00:02:34.410> all

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
up like this as well as you can see all

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:43.040 
up like this as well as you can see all
that<00:02:34.770> detail<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.550> there<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.780> they<00:02:42.870> have<00:02:43.020> a

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
that detail in there so they have a

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.800 
that detail in there so they have a
smaller<00:02:43.440> ball<00:02:43.830> joint<00:02:44.220> than<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.270> others<00:02:45.480> do<00:02:45.780> so

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
smaller ball joint than the others do so

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:56.690 
smaller ball joint than the others do so
that<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.710> be<00:02:46.800> more<00:02:46.980> flexible
