you know it was actually taken down by
Apple<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.760> obvious<00:00:54.420> Apple's<00:00:54.780> trying<00:00:54.960> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
Apple so it's obvious Apple's trying to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
put up you know you wouldn't take

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.560 
put up you know you wouldn't take
something<00:00:58.800> down<00:00:58.980> if<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.670> unless<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.390> didn't

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
something down if you unless you didn't

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.060 
something down if you unless you didn't
want<00:01:00.719> people<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.649> go<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.829> me

want people to see it if you go to me

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.640 
want people to see it if you go to me
also<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> guys<00:01:03.420> who<00:01:03.719> first<00:01:04.019> found<00:01:04.140> that

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
also on the guys who first found that

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.649 
also on the guys who first found that
they<00:01:05.070> sort<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.549> some<00:01:05.909> work<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.330> image

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
they sort of like some work on the image

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.390 
they sort of like some work on the image
and<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:07.380> figure<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.130> image<00:01:08.310> was

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and they figure that the image was

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.640 
and they figure that the image was
actually<00:01:08.790> cropped<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:09.840> figured<00:01:10.560> out

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
actually cropped but they figured out

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.550 
actually cropped but they figured out
the<00:01:10.890> original<00:01:11.640> image<00:01:11.790> was<00:01:12.240> eight<00:01:12.560> megapixels

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the original image was eight megapixels

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.830 
the original image was eight megapixels
or<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> iphone<00:01:14.460> far<00:01:14.909> where<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> iphone

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
or is the iphone far where is the iphone

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.190 
or is the iphone far where is the iphone
for<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.430> megapixels<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.750> sum<00:01:18.990> is

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
for now is for megapixels so this sum is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.859 
for now is for megapixels so this sum is
more<00:01:19.740> rumor<00:01:20.070> or<00:01:20.310> more<00:01:20.880> speculation<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
more rumor or more speculation that the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.780 
more rumor or more speculation that the
new<00:01:22.049> iphone<00:01:22.470> 5<00:01:22.770> which<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.009> Spectre<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.610> come

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
new iphone 5 which is Spectre to come

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.539 
new iphone 5 which is Spectre to come
out<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> coming<00:01:25.049> months<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.740> two<00:01:25.799> maybe

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
out in the coming months so two maybe

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.249 
out in the coming months so two maybe
two<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:26.820> three<00:01:26.970> more<00:01:27.210> months<00:01:27.360> max<00:01:27.900> three

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
two or three more months max three

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.039 
two or three more months max three
probably<00:01:28.619> who<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.729> an<00:01:29.850> 8<00:01:30.030> megapixel<00:01:30.210> camera

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
probably who have an 8 megapixel camera

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
probably who have an 8 megapixel camera
that's<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.890> pretty<00:01:32.100> cool<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.430> some
