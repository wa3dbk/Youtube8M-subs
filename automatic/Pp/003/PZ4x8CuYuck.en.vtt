00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.889
 hello sÃ©verine hello so where 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.020
 are we there then we are at a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.720
 twenty kilometers of saint roman 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.560
 so on the land of logrian I have 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.560
 found in renting 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.949
 there are two years ago when we arrived 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.320
 My job is to cultivate 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.200
 wheat harvested him to sort it at the grind 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.300
 and turn it into time so you 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.239
 are in a field of ancient varieties 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.960
 mix so there are plenty of 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.370
 varieties that's the aurora florence 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.260
 it's not very easy to differentiate 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.210
 Toulouse because it does not have 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.930
 bar 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.340
 sassi touzel lawsuit the blonde as there 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.260
 had five varieties all innocuous it's 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.739
 very complicated to differentiate bearded years 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.470
 roussillon is there there is a lot 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.540
 below get involved chunky case that had 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.030
 a pretty high production actually by 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.750
 compared to anything that does not give big 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.170
 thing so there on wheat we do not have a 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.189
 huge work in fact in the cem and then 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.189
 after we let do 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.090
 if I had a classic variety of wheat 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.579
 recent flush with daisies 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.500
 I could not do as I do there 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.970
 I'm sure of the variety it's 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.930
 robust it's been millennia since 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.790
 we feed her she's there and I mean 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.000
 reads what are we on 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.200
 old rustic varieties that 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.509
 know drought that do not have 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.729
 need a lot of nitrogen inputs that 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.899
 make very long straw but that does not 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.579
 do not go to sleep even if you feel 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.500
 there we can see that it's sunset but 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.369
 the wild boars that are not enough because 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.579
 it is necessary that everyone eats 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.810
 alfred okay here we share it's all 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.640
 the interest of old varieties is to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.840
 to say I have at home only harvesting them 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.790
 others and at the same time I have a lot 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.750
 less passage between actors not the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.330
 all of amendments 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.000
 no organic input is wonderful 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.069
 our strength announced that we are not going to wheat 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.709
 and we're not going to have flour sold 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:22.720
 full so our bread-making quality the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.660
 hold of our wheat we are nothing the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.590
 dance the earth that does it all is the 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.319
 nature that does everything and afterwards if you 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.569
 actually want no baker can 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.860
 do the same bread as we do because 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.989
 do not find old varieties 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.290
 or otherwise it's mixed we have a little 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.530
 then mixed with other stuff and 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.200
 so we value a lot our 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.180
 product and after feed people that's 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.880
 important and I do not want to go hungry I'm going 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.230
 to have wheat when it's not baby 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.030
 that you give to hens it's a 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.079
 disaster 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.079
 these debris that are of a quality 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.950
 exceptional was not found 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.989
 after there is another thing is that 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.410
 in his varieties there 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.819
 the gluten flown over it is different and 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.030
 in all the other wounded was 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.690
 crossed cross and uncrossed there has been 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.370
 a whole mixed wheat to arrive at 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.700
 varieties that gets worked in bakery 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.530
 with very very fast robots that 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.459
 get up really fast and take a lot 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.190
 of air so far from what I'm talking about 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.560
 this bread we see everywhere and suddenly 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.489
 yielded blaikie that are quite 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.709
 accepted by the people who became 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.269
 intolerant to gluten 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.459
 then we have for the moment shops 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.470
 peasants so Montpellier is where 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.720
 it's the very last one and that's where 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.489
 we start to be really happy so 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.799
 we have a public expectation precisely on 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.870
 the gluten in town a lot a lot of 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.010
 his intolerance which we discover at 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.950
 it is difficult to taste the Cevennes 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.930
 who we started with this year 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.980
 also that they are people who 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.379
 working 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.610
 very seriously and who are passing us 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.200
 no orders to network bread 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.150
 of a break really begins they know 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.390
 that they will sell it because we have 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.709
 also spent two years throw more 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.879
 finally throwing jade by never really 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.530
 because I spent a lot of time 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.690
 of times the association his men throat 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.859
 to give bread for meals finally 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.690
 always manages to not throw it 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.729
 but I mean for the company 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.030
 it's a loss humanly it's different 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.160
 thing 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.810
 good for me here are what we do in 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.240
 this moment is to set up 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.710
 food production tools 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.510
 the idea is simply to say we 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.250
 save this variety one day we will have 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.430
 need we already need it is not 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.940
 still known it is not yet recognized 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:46.389
 but here we are, we have them 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:48.789
 for tomorrow it will be useful when my 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.120
 advice that I would give and if you want 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.310
 really live and not run everywhere 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.590
 finally take the circuit is little by little 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.850
 do it if you can not do it with your 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.070
 the will vasive years but you're gonna know 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.550
 what is obliged 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:09.010
 and then the other advice would be for 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.599
 the relative to market gardening marriage 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.470
 it's a very hard job that is very 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:16.990
 taking and not reporting much 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.760
 unless you transform valorization 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.010
 product maximizes the tone 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.200
 little bit but do not fight on 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.220
 migron because it's a shame what to 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.910
 unless they make meat or 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.099
 Cevennes but otherwise it's a shame 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.870
 my dream is to grow wheat like 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.720
 we grow beans or tomatoes 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.840
 that is to say in small culture you do 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.970
 focus near the plants you 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.729
 therefore cultivates them as market gardening 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.760
 so you really take care of them 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.289
 irrigate kill the goals and you have some 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.650
 crops that are much higher 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:54.630
 that on the great great culture 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:57.460
 we are lucky to have a mayor who is 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:01.300
 very handy and who is very trendy 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.550
 on this kind of initiative too so we 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.440
 not feeling alone in our corner in 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.060
 this utopia because that's true when 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.590
 we are sure we are more on a model 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.240
 where we grow on 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.740
 wheat terraces what but there 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.919
 will come back I'm sure and in the 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.690
 Cevennes they always cultivated lorbek 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.669
 in fact for me the important thing is 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.430
 not where we are it is towards where we 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.479
 go here for now we're here and 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.600
 things at this misstep in two days 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.729
 and we only have two humans left 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.139
 have their limits 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.539
 if I win the lottery it would go very fast 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:37.150
 I think it does not all this said you 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:39.340
 cheeks not at all not at all but 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.750
 we're not there yet and then 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.199
 things that take time sometimes 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.199
 it's better
