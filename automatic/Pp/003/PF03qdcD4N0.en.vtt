trapezoidal this is how it works
obviously<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.420> already<00:00:39.719> done<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> Blue<00:00:40.469> Peter

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
obviously I already done the Blue Peter

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.440 
obviously I already done the Blue Peter
style<00:00:41.070> would<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.280> already<00:00:41.489> screwed<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:42.360> of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
style would have already screwed one of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.970 
style would have already screwed one of
the<00:00:42.540> nuts<00:00:42.780> into<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.290> housing

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the nuts into the housing

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.250 
the nuts into the housing
so<00:00:44.820> first<00:00:45.030> screw<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> second<00:00:45.780> nut<00:00:45.930> into<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
so first screw the second nut into the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.069 
so first screw the second nut into the
housing<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.579> hopefully<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.539> marks<00:00:48.870> I

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
housing and hopefully the marks I

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.260 
housing and hopefully the marks I
produced<00:00:49.500> earlier<00:00:49.890> line<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.460> should<00:00:51.000> make<00:00:51.149> my

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
produced earlier line up should make my

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:01.340 
produced earlier line up should make my
life<00:00:51.480> much<00:00:51.719> easier<00:00:57.590> if<00:00:58.590> they<00:00:58.770> line<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.160> now<00:01:00.350> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
life much easier if they line up now the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.590 
life much easier if they line up now the
thread<00:01:01.680> should<00:01:01.710> go<00:01:02.129> straight<00:01:02.520> through<00:01:03.120> both

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
thread should go straight through both

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.640 
thread should go straight through both
pieces<00:01:03.920> now<00:01:04.920> at<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> other<00:01:05.250> end<00:01:06.320> like<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.500> can

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
pieces now at the other end like you can

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.410 
pieces now at the other end like you can
see<00:01:07.860> by<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.250> I'm<00:01:08.369> rotating<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.240> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
see by the way I'm rotating it as it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.050 
see by the way I'm rotating it as it
hopefully<00:01:10.110> appear<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.729> end<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
hopefully appear is at the end of the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.390 
hopefully appear is at the end of the
spindle<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:13.049> quite<00:01:13.380> loose<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:15.000> holding<00:01:16.400> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
spindle it's quite loose so holding the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.030 
spindle it's quite loose so holding the
aluminium<00:01:17.640> housing<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.810> left-hand<00:01:19.740> nut

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
aluminium housing and the left-hand nut

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.800 
aluminium housing and the left-hand nut
we<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:20.820> unwind<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.580> hand<00:01:23.880> nut<00:01:24.090> we

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
we can now unwind the right hand nut we

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.060 
we can now unwind the right hand nut we
have<00:01:24.900> my<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.320> why<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.549> a<00:01:26.549> lot<00:01:27.470> as<00:01:28.470> tight<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:28.920> we

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
have my and why it a lot as tight as we

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.780 
have my and why it a lot as tight as we
can<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.700> will<00:01:30.000> not<00:01:30.180> move<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:31.790> extremely

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
can it will not move it's extremely

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.569 
can it will not move it's extremely
tight<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:34.619> by<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.119> refining<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.420> movement

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
tight so by just refining that movement

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.899 
tight so by just refining that movement
we<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.729> achieve<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.570> smooth<00:01:40.110> spot<00:01:40.909> which

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
we can achieve a smooth spot which

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.639 
we can achieve a smooth spot which
allows<00:01:42.240> an<00:01:42.930> almost<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.100> zero<00:01:44.130> backlash

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
allows an almost a zero backlash

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.620 
allows an almost a zero backlash
