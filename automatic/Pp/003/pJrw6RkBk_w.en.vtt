00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.600
 heel is not only an experiment 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.500
 by more 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.140
 but the passenger version passenger 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.750
 car typical example held 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.570
 Kingu second generation three cars 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.820
 just appeared in our 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.800
 country compared to its predecessors 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.660
 dimensions noticeably increased 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.360
 length for example kangoo added immediately 18 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.430
 centimeters increased and 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.510
 wheelbase is not surprising what is it 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.140
 brings now looks more 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.000
 impressive be it ordinary passenger 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.550
 car i would look into the salon 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.560
 the address shook will start the trunk passenger 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:34.270
 both measures 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.970
 swing doors 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.780
 real hiding 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.790
 in the caves the volume of the compartment is 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.620
 impressive 6 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.210
 160 liters and if you fold the rear 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.230
 seats then with a capacity of kangoo 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.429
 will be able to compete 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.619
 prices or van worth noting them 

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:52.209
 functional luggage rack 

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:54.429
 which can be fixed in one of 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.159
 two positions but not the trunk alone alive 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.309
 kangoo we estimate what the passengers live for 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.449
 he even led all the repairs to become nice 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.250
 first stock free 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.369
 space for Renault is quite possible 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.920
 go on a long journey 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.659
 but on a date on this car I would 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.270
 did not believe in disposal 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.540
 front riders have a ceiling 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.110
 shelf 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.460
 free space is not 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.600
 must be wasted in labor 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.290
 driver's position 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.660
 cars no furniture 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.080
 cargo specificity is not here to mention 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.860
 turned out to be generated for 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.960
 car transportation must be supplied 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.600
 powerful motor is not available 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.700
 kanokov modest eight 204 strong 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.229
 gasoline engine working volume one 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.419
 six decimal points 

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:43.939
 but despite being modest 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.479
 characteristics goes French heels 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.500
 Quite a show of the country where allowed 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.030
 in the city of 6 meters really 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.520
 at one o'clock he accelerates his nostrils with nostrils 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.120
 car flow but here 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.380
 age closer to hundreds of acceleration 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.460
 given the car already hard however 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.660
 utility vehicles 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.600
 and should not be impressed with their sports 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.350
 schools but the smoothness of the car 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.090
 not bad suspension copes with work 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.929
 faithful 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.519
 I remember how in gold of course with candy 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.980
 driving performance except that 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.290
 illogical drive 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.040
 brake pedal 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.900
 the car is nodding too much 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.700
 adapt to this feature we're not 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.900
 and did not succeed without touching the priest himself 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.420
 controversial and very practical can not 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.849
 understand why russia cars like 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:32.430
 kind of 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.020
