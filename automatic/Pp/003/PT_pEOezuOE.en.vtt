00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
here we'll look at the ball studs will

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.060 
here we'll look at the ball studs will
zoom<00:02:16.010> in<00:02:16.190> here<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.490> bit<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:18.650> can<00:02:18.680> see<00:02:18.920> the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
zoom in here a bit and you can see the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.450 
zoom in here a bit and you can see the
ball<00:02:19.220> studs<00:02:19.580> right<00:02:19.700> here<00:02:20.120> I'll<00:02:21.190> take<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.250> look

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
ball studs right here I'll take a look

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.280 
ball studs right here I'll take a look
at<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.700> location<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.570> amount<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.930> shims

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
at the location and the amount of shims

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.660 
at the location and the amount of shims
that<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.590> use<00:02:24.710> under<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.070> boss<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.490> well

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
that you use under the boss that well

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.270 
that you use under the boss that well
the<00:02:26.030> factory<00:02:26.450> kit<00:02:26.720> calls<00:02:27.560> for<00:02:27.800> two<00:02:27.950> shims

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280

the factory kit calls for two shims
under<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.730> ball<00:02:28.879> stud<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.989> calls<00:02:30.200> from

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
under the ball stud and it calls from

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.260 
under the ball stud and it calls from
the<00:02:30.440> boss<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:30.890> be<00:02:30.980> in<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.159> inside

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
the boss that to be in the inside

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.880 
the boss that to be in the inside
so<00:02:32.600> if<00:02:32.990> you<00:02:33.140> go<00:02:33.260> ahead<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.530> look<00:02:33.650> at<00:02:33.800> your

so if you go ahead and look at your
setup<00:02:34.340> such<00:02:34.820> as<00:02:35.000> Jarrod's<00:02:35.450> here<00:02:36.190> you'll

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
setup such as Jarrod's here you'll

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.740 
setup such as Jarrod's here you'll
notice<00:02:37.460> that<00:02:38.530> ball<00:02:39.530> studs<00:02:40.090> 0r<00:02:41.090> shims<00:02:41.480> under

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
notice that ball studs 0r shims under

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.530 
notice that ball studs 0r shims under
the<00:02:41.840> ball<00:02:41.960> studs<00:02:42.260> are<00:02:42.410> 0<00:02:42.740> now<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.580> location<00:02:44.270> is

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
the ball studs are 0 now the location is

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.150 
the ball studs are 0 now the location is
still<00:02:44.750> on<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.870> inside<00:02:45.290> which<00:02:45.590> that's<00:02:45.860> cool

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
still on the inside which that's cool

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.780 
still on the inside which that's cool
but<00:02:46.850> again<00:02:47.600> 0<00:02:47.810> ball<00:02:48.590> Sims<00:02:49.340> under<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.640> ball

you want to use that this will just
cause<00:02:59.270> double<00:02:59.750> work<00:02:59.900> if<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.230> follow<00:03:00.500> this

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
cause double work if you follow this

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.590 
cause double work if you follow this
verbatim<00:03:01.070> now<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.460> can't<00:03:01.820> follow<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.360> and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
to build the kit as instructed first and

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.630 
to build the kit as instructed first and
then<00:03:09.620> when<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.010> go<00:03:10.130> back<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.520> make<00:03:10.580> changes

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
then when I go back and make changes

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.300 
then when I go back and make changes
that's<00:03:11.390> fine<00:03:11.660> too<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.200> like<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.500> build<00:03:12.800> it<00:03:12.980> the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
that's fine too I like to build it the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.070 
that's fine too I like to build it the
first<00:03:13.550> time<00:03:13.670> as<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.240> setup<00:03:14.540> I<00:03:14.660> want<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.900> run

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
first time as the setup I want to run

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.820 
first time as the setup I want to run
and<00:03:15.350> then<00:03:15.860> tweak<00:03:16.070> it<00:03:16.220> from<00:03:16.370> there<00:03:16.580> so<00:03:17.830> I'm

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
and then tweak it from there so I'm

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.950 
and then tweak it from there so I'm
another<00:03:19.160> thing<00:03:19.400> with<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.060> kits<00:03:20.330> such<00:03:20.810> as

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
another thing with the kits such as

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.920 
another thing with the kits such as
kyosho<00:03:21.500> you'll<00:03:22.130> notice<00:03:22.430> here<00:03:22.730> with<00:03:23.540> zoom<00:03:23.720> in

forth<00:03:44.540> so<00:03:45.050> it's<00:03:45.680> good<00:03:45.830> idea<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.220> follow

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
forth so it's good idea to follow

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.330 
forth so it's good idea to follow

any ha pups you have such what I
purchased<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:57.290> may<00:03:57.440> want<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.740> put<00:03:57.860> those<00:03:58.040> on

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.430 
purchased you may want to put those on
now<00:03:58.490> instead<00:03:58.970> of<00:03:59.030> later<00:03:59.120> because<00:03:59.720> you<00:04:00.350> know

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
now instead of later because you know

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.050 
now instead of later because you know
the<00:04:00.560> front<00:04:00.770> bulkhead<00:04:01.190> that<00:04:01.490> area<00:04:01.790> could<00:04:02.000> be

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
the front bulkhead that area could be

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.270 
the front bulkhead that area could be
difficult<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.780> get<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:03.050> later<00:04:03.350> and<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.100> don't

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
difficult to get to later and you don't

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.550 
difficult to get to later and you don't
want<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.430> deal<00:04:04.610> with<00:04:04.640> that<00:04:04.760> later<00:04:05.030> on<00:04:05.560> unless

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
want to deal with that later on unless

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.690 
want to deal with that later on unless
you<00:04:06.740> want<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:06.950> wait<00:04:06.980> till<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:07.340> break<00:04:07.520> the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
you want to wait till you break the

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.870 
you want to wait till you break the
plastic<00:04:08.000> part<00:04:08.300> which<00:04:08.690> is<00:04:08.930> fine<00:04:09.500> i<00:04:09.830> usually<00:04:10.730> do

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
plastic part which is fine i usually do

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.220 
plastic part which is fine i usually do
that<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:11.420> know<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.570> wait<00:04:11.810> until<00:04:12.020> something

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
that you know I wait until something

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.140 
that you know I wait until something
breaks<00:04:12.470> before<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:12.980> replace<00:04:13.340> it<00:04:13.550> but<00:04:13.760> in<00:04:14.000> this

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
breaks before I replace it but in this

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.170 
breaks before I replace it but in this
case<00:04:14.390> you<00:04:15.380> know<00:04:15.500> I'm<00:04:15.770> just<00:04:16.010> gonna<00:04:16.190> go<00:04:16.549> all<00:04:17.150> out

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
real long either so we'll just kind of

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.790 
real long either so we'll just kind of
do<00:05:22.800> maybe<00:05:23.280> a<00:05:23.370> page<00:05:24.240> or<00:05:24.450> two<00:05:24.510> at<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.810> time<00:05:24.840> will

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
do maybe a page or two at a time will

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.450 
do maybe a page or two at a time will
show<00:05:25.980> you<00:05:26.070> what's<00:05:26.250> happened<00:05:26.640> so<00:05:26.850> stay<00:05:27.270> tuned
