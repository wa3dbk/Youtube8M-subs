00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
side of the source battery and then when

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.810 
side of the source battery and then when
it's<00:01:44.870> in<00:01:45.050> resonance<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:45.800> also<00:01:46.220> helps<00:01:46.670> to

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
it's in resonance it also helps to

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:58.210 
it's in resonance it also helps to
strengthen<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:48.820> l1<00:01:49.820> coil<00:01:56.650> both<00:01:57.650> these<00:01:57.890> coils

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
strengthen the l1 coil both these coils

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.710 
strengthen the l1 coil both these coils
are<00:01:58.520> around<00:01:58.760> a<00:01:58.910> thousand<00:01:59.330> turns<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.940> l1<00:02:02.300> coils

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
are around a thousand turns the l1 coils

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.350 
are around a thousand turns the l1 coils
a<00:02:02.870> thousand<00:02:03.320> turns<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.860> twenty<00:02:04.250> six<00:02:04.490> gauge<00:02:04.580> wire

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
a thousand turns a twenty six gauge wire

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.740 
a thousand turns a twenty six gauge wire
now<00:02:06.110> three<00:02:06.500> coils<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.979> thousand<00:02:07.430> turns<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.940> 23

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
now three coils a thousand turns a 23

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.740 
now three coils a thousand turns a 23
gauge<00:02:08.959> wire<00:02:09.700> they<00:02:10.700> could<00:02:10.940> both<00:02:11.090> be<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.510> same

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
gauge wire they could both be the same

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.420 
gauge wire they could both be the same
I'm<00:02:12.230> just<00:02:12.650> using<00:02:12.860> what<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.190> already<00:02:13.700> had

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
I'm just using what I already had

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.050 
I'm just using what I already had
and<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.550> held<00:02:16.730> two<00:02:16.940> coils<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.510> pancake<00:02:17.990> well

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
and the held two coils a pancake well

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.920 
and the held two coils a pancake well
kind<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.120> like<00:02:20.270> this<00:02:20.420> one<00:02:22.660> it's<00:02:23.660> plastic

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
kind of like this one it's plastic

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.010 
kind of like this one it's plastic
