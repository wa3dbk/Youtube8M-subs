00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:09.260
 Hello Sports Hochie 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:15.910
 It 's called Juju. It's sports self-coaching. 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:21.040
 The qualities, the physical skills , the good balance of the four balances 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:25.900
 It 's not like the camera's scattered oneself, 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.890
 I want you to know what you need and motivate yourself 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.890
 I'm helping you. 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:40.000
 I'll talk about the press lecture today. 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.200
 The incidence of each of the following track the club head hits the ball when written 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.480
 I'm talking. 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.809
 The angle depends on the point of the circle where the circle is drawn. 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.809
 Will 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:04.530
 Shopping often where to squeeze the maximum four points of the swing, I called Ah vary 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.530
 That's it. 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.180
 I'll call it Shazam. 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.190
 To the scoring according to certain non-fire unit as well with the next well as the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.000
 The particles are determined by crabs. 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.070
 It's very easy to simply 9 minutes. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.980
 Should be 0 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:38.400
 When an object is created at the bottom of a relatively deeply Aza it'll be back next 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.400
 I have. 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.760
 Choi Sun-point 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.870
 If then geolro 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.650
 Also, if the ground just before the dream and the weak point are created 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.650
 Pride Home oh 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:20.580
 This predicate hit and I hit him and he took finally come right back 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.580
 If we make our teeth slightly under the bottom 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.500
 It will be the upper roll . 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.560
 Look back and look at the next Bloody Sidewinder to understand the differences easily 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.890
 You have. 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.590
 So what does this tooth point affect? 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.590
 There are three big things. One 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.470
 Center of gravity 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.299
 And the shape of the body 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.130
 And finally, clubs. 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.540
 Agil . 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.980
 Tae things that I see as a representative, and the whole thing 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.980
 It's determined just before the impact . 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.290
 Laughing 4 finally 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.819
