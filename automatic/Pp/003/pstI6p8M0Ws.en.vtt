00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.279
 Top 5 

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:11.099
 in fifth place 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.099
 first game Son Mist manages 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.289
 a great play I have a lot for minarets gives the leaching 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.429
 I had already played through 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:27.310
 Percent but that's just stupid all i had to format my ipod yes and 

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:29.399
 I have to do everything from scratch 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.539
 not least because he is the first time a surfboard can stand 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.750
 both will be pardoned later on behalf of it 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.900
 he decided 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.979
 STA 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:44.510
 There is a great demand and too great a game it's about that one 

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:45.600
 Zombies 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.400
 around 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.400
 not all of them with the finger to flee 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.020
 and then percent collect stars when they die over 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.870
 with the later course but these bunnies zones like that is a little one 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.030
 step 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.690
 it does not really exist 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.850
 Telekom played a big zombies quite fast for there is a lot to remember 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.350
 You can not just open the zombies locally 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.110
 kill 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.160
 but percent of you get weapons you can be house percent until now 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.520
 must be protected 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.130
 Percent you can then by witnesses Ellefeld mime percent later you can 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.140
 something like the cup on too 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.700
 in his place here 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.750
 Recreate percent 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.750
 and that by killing the miss 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.190
 But it 's a very great etc 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.410
 Percent which is a lot of fun because it does not get boring of that 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.820
 Basle it looks like 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.820
 I would recommend it, I can only recommend it 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.210
 my fourth AP 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.360
 Percent if AP is around 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.870

 around 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.710
 by EA Sports m how much it costs now I do not know exactly but poor 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:16.379
 not only because Abrell is one in the first leg 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.799
 "Burn Notice" man walking so she has to play again 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.610
 I just want and have won one thing that you are so proud that you 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.869
 and of course that one does not really come from the game East 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:27.629
 but this is 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.749
 I do not think it's negative 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.059
 60 with yourself in expensive players 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:35.500
 for those at risk for the players that they already have 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 because from the beginning 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.510
 It would be very good quality case if the new iPhone 4gs or a one 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.529
 Portal turns off Regina

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.489
 and even in the 40th 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.269
 and clarify 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.459
 that's how it looks like 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.459
 could be realized in practice 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.459
 To have maps 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.699

 become 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.329
 to spray conflicts like the old classics 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.139
 around with Rudi Völler and Franz Beckenbauer 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.059
 of three percent 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:46.109
 There's also a bunch of mini-games like hit the goal wall 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.849
 or achieve certain points 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.849
 Percent market share a lot of fun 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.619
 that is not granted around 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.619
 through from skin probably all 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:04.289

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.759
 Whatever I love, I just love the space world 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.299
 it's about these devices Google have here 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.509
 to carry up all the time 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.509
 should the black com can not complete it 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.139
 And he manages to get on speedy man naturally by these springs

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:15.189
 I think he's up to six percent off so now it's going to be 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:16.669
 constantly renewed 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.719

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.779
 I can just show it to myself, it's about the right one 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.339

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:31.899
 where you have all these different ability with these films 

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:35.299

 Screen type 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:41.009

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.420
 Horstmar is about to be a soloist and there are a lot of them on the Vils

 you have to complete with already standing 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:10.960
 for example her 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.960
 The idea for these people is about many features 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:18.240
 Percent and the game is a lot of fun 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.240

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:25.550
 and 77 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.800
 So my last game also means playing 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.059
 that is why Dark Nebula have episode 1 episode 2 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.299
 I think that's why we're coming out for it 

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:37.400
 responsible 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.529
 he sees it from Dark Nebula 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.729
 I can just get a percent 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.830
 in NRW show for example the 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:55.309

 with the inverter of the iPod 7 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:07.819
 tries to handle and not always works that 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.680
 and percent 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.680
 you must not get caught by these things in any case 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:16.930
 Zaman play very great 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.979
 each one offers a lot of innovations and percentages 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:27.259
 is different than test winner and percent is very very exciting and power 

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:28.749
 also super fun 

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:32.429
 conversely, but I can not treat you after the game 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.710

 closely connected 

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:41.319
 okay for France 

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:44.369
 on rock music that's just that Keller made sure there's no account 

00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:46.569
 Percent of them play 

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:49.240
 percent 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.999
 we both have no shelf 

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:55.249
 but really guests out of percent also cost 79 cents 

00:07:55.249 --> 00:08:00.159
 that's great and percent due just to everyone's fun with his 

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:02.219
