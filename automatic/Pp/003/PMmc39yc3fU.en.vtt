00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
higher there's bars that are higher that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.650 
higher there's bars that are higher that
you<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.400> catch<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.880> so<00:00:38.970> you<00:00:39.060> can<00:00:39.240> hold<00:00:39.450> this

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
you can catch this so you can hold this

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.420

when<00:00:39.960> you're<00:00:40.080> racing<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.620> then<00:00:41.130> you're<00:00:41.280> going

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
when you're racing and then you're going

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.830

that something like that or you can

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.070 
that something like that or you can
completely<00:00:44.730> change<00:00:44.850> these<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.690> something

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
completely change these to something

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.570 
completely change these to something
that's<00:00:46.170> more<00:00:46.320> comfortable<00:00:46.710> or<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.430> don't

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
that's more comfortable or just don't

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.650

instead<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.400> rubber<00:02:33.640> most<00:02:33.910> bikes<00:02:34.120> have<00:02:34.270> rubber

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
instead of rubber most bikes have rubber

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.690 
instead of rubber most bikes have rubber
even<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.870> popular<00:02:35.650> Super<00:02:36.010> Sport<00:02:36.220> Japanese

bikes<00:02:36.880> come<00:02:37.420> with<00:02:37.510> rubber<00:02:37.720> which<00:02:38.320> flexes<00:02:38.620> so

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
bikes come with rubber which flexes so

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.980 
bikes come with rubber which flexes so
not<00:02:39.790> all<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:39.970> force<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.510> apply<00:02:40.630> here

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
not all the force that you apply here

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.320 
not all the force that you apply here
goes<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:42.100> braking<00:02:42.550> system<00:02:42.700> because<00:02:43.120> you

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
goes to the braking system because you

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.880 
goes to the braking system because you
know<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.570> poses<00:02:44.050> flex<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.590> some<00:02:44.740> of<00:02:44.830> that

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
know the poses flex and some of that

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.770 
know the poses flex and some of that
energy<00:02:45.340> goes<00:02:45.970> into<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.330> flexing<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.750> the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
energy goes into the flexing of the

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.170 
what you want to do is how was I able to
break<00:04:17.830> without<00:04:18.220> even<00:04:18.670> really<00:04:18.790> holding<00:04:19.120> the

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
break without even really holding the

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.820 
break without even really holding the
handlebar<00:04:19.540> because<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.260> way<00:04:20.410> you're<00:04:20.560> break

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
handlebar because the way you're break

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.110 
handlebar because the way you're break
it's<00:04:21.370> one<00:04:21.460> of<00:04:21.550> those<00:04:21.670> things<00:04:21.850> you<00:04:21.940> watch

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
it's one of those things you watch

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.760 
it's one of those things you watch
MotoGP<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.140> don't<00:04:23.290> realize<00:04:23.590> what's

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
MotoGP and you don't realize what's

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.320 
MotoGP and you don't realize what's
happening<00:04:24.160> you<00:04:24.670> see<00:04:24.820> these<00:04:24.940> guys<00:04:25.120> going

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
happening you see these guys going

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.060 
happening you see these guys going
around<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.540> corner<00:04:25.840> so<00:04:25.990> fast<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.650> you<00:04:26.920> don't

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
around the corner so fast and you don't

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.050 
around the corner so fast and you don't
realize<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.550> techniques<00:04:27.880> they're<00:04:28.030> using

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
realize the techniques they're using

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.990 
realize the techniques they're using
well<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.740> lot<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:29.920> what<00:04:30.070> they<00:04:30.160> do<00:04:30.220> is<00:04:30.580> all<00:04:30.760> about

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
well a lot of what they do is all about

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.050 
well a lot of what they do is all about
the<00:04:31.150> legs<00:04:31.420> and<00:04:31.750> all<00:04:32.170> about<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.830> knees<00:04:33.610> and

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
the legs and all about the knees and

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.580 
the legs and all about the knees and
things<00:04:34.210> like<00:04:34.330> that<00:04:34.390> so<00:04:34.780> basically<00:04:35.200> what<00:04:35.500> you

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
things like that so basically what you

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.300 
things like that so basically what you
do<00:04:35.740> is<00:04:36.060> transfer<00:04:37.060> all<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.830> momentum<00:04:38.830> like

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
do is transfer all that momentum like

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.010 
do is transfer all that momentum like
you<00:04:39.490> want<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.060> go<00:04:40.180> forward<00:04:40.660> because<00:04:40.930> you're

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
you want to go forward because you're

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.140 
you want to go forward because you're
breaking<00:04:41.470> you<00:04:41.830> transfer<00:04:42.250> out<00:04:42.280> into<00:04:42.670> the<00:04:42.820> bike

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
breaking you transfer out into the bike

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.390 
breaking you transfer out into the bike
not<00:04:44.020> into<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.410> handlebars<00:04:44.980> because<00:04:45.340> the

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
not into the handlebars because the

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.520 
not into the handlebars because the
handlebars<00:04:45.820> that's<00:04:46.000> for<00:04:46.150> steering<00:04:46.360> input<00:04:46.780> so

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
handlebars that's for steering input so

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.140 
handlebars that's for steering input so
you're<00:04:47.710> not<00:04:47.800> only<00:04:47.950> fatiguing<00:04:48.730> yourself

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
you're not only fatiguing yourself

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.880 
you're not only fatiguing yourself
you're<00:04:49.390> potentially<00:04:49.900> messing<00:04:50.350> up<00:04:50.590> with<00:04:50.740> your

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
you're potentially messing up with your

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.740 
you're potentially messing up with your
steering<00:04:51.280> this<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.520> for<00:04:51.670> steering<00:04:51.910> only<00:04:52.360> so

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
steering this is for steering only so

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.330 
steering this is for steering only so
you<00:04:52.810> don't<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.080> be<00:04:53.110> applying<00:04:53.680> force<00:04:53.980> to<00:04:54.070> the

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
you don't to be applying force to the

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.710 
you don't to be applying force to the
handlebars<00:04:54.820> when<00:04:55.000> you're<00:04:55.120> not<00:04:55.240> trying<00:04:55.390> to<00:04:55.600> do

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
a turn or anything that way you end up

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.610
