00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.330

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.700
 I love what is your favorite model 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.670
 so I will say what I already had 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.310
 thought about that various authors 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.959
 for me it's the mess even if it 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.310
 not always feel very very good either 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.410
 but it's nice 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.420
 hot chocolate with a tsonga nut 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.239
 I love this smell for me it's 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.350
 really winter and then cinnamon 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.900
 laurange the mulled wine this is really 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.579
 and then the Burgundy all these meats 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.519
 in sauce that looks very good in a 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.410
 home and that's not the dishes like 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.750

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.730
 hot wine 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.470
 I think it's very beautiful except 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.750
 that we should not abuse it but I do not 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.060
 not abuse either so there I can 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.579
 really cracked on a cold day 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.769
 it would be a hot chocolate but with a 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.959
 little bit of tonga nuts I you 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.049

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.890
 locked up at home see a question 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.919
 before well I would eat more in

 favorite nail polish so here I 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.330
 would say that me as an esthetician 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:28.460

 local ongs massages that oblige 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.870
 then it was a varnish when we made a 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.880
 hair removal does not take long 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.590
 so that's a habit I took 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.199
 opus game men hyper fragile 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.599
 so I invite a little varnish on the 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.220
 nails but when I ever go out and I 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:45.590
 go over on bordeaux on
