00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello everyone, today we will look at you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.690
 how to tie a tie with a knot 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.330
 Aldridge knot difficult not get 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.980
 immediately need more workout and so 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.920
 let's start the wide part of the tie on the right 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:20.029
 narrow left wide part raise 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.720
 about a belt level 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:28.460
 comment I will not say only 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.460
 watch carefully and remember 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.310
 but the remaining tip is just refilled 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.600
 that's all 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.729
 at first it will be difficult to tie him but 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.990
 if you train for a long time then you 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.990
 good luck to all
