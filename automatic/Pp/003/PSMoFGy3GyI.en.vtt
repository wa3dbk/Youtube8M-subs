00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 then all to zero 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.730
 hi to all these changes of 1988 and 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.220
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.230
 report of the empty granaries of May 29 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.250
 so basically we had planned to 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.240
 perfect stained glass is only my little 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.520
 hungry because we wanted to rest 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.199
 today and finally around 11 o'clock 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.180
 we decided to leave to make one 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.610
 which was right next to us and 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.050
 finally we did well we did 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.370
 some pretty little finds 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.870
 friendly good there is not much 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.800
 to present you today but finally 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.879
 I said to myself I'm going to make you a 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.460
 little report since I know that 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.870
 you like that and so I show you 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.320
 right now so we start with a 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.739
 small batch of three gamegear games in 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.030
 loose 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:00.580
 so we had physically you do not know 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:06.369
 absolutely not if you know how to tell me 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:11.290
 more do not hesitate we did sonic and we 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:13.030
 had deadly fight 2 so see there are 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.530
 very good condition there was every time the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.990
 big plastic box like these 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.640
 row of teeth and so he was 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.200
 really hike on a stand and so 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.689
 I ask the woman how much you 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.980
 sell she tells me it's a euro at 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.710
 early I thought it was a euro 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.810
 piece for the e3 2010 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.290
 I did not negotiate them hitting them I 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.670
 took a euro for three games gamegear 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.930
 bond to mali are rented obviously but 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.850
 gamegear interlocking jean games 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.420
 troop whose people found me jeans 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.280
 is not incidentally 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.260
 So that was really happy 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.840
 find that a little bit further 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:50.409
 found this so it's the ps2 adapter 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.850
 to play 4 so I'm super 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.620
 very happy to have it because 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.950
 george chief among one each for the 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.270
 peace is a kind of her too so that 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.500
 it's great fun so for the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.880
 little story stopped me on this 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.310
 stand there because there was the whole 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.720
 series of dragon ball z in dvd and he 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.220
 sells 25 euros so I almost 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.860
 to take he missed a few in 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.330
 so finally did not take them and so 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.110
 the very nice gentleman I him 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.430
 wonder if they had games there 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.480
 would answer from where he says he has mega 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.709
 drive in the beginning I tell myself yeah the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.409
 owls does that it sells them from 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.000
 parts he did not separate and everything so 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.940
 he did not want to part with it but they 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.090
 so were selling 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.520
 this is frozen at 1 euro 50 so that's 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.960
 is super fun 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.430
 a little further I found in the game 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.440
 ps2 that looked for a lot of 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.020
 time 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.810
 gun on ps2 so that I am super super 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:41.020
 glad to have see he's really in 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.610
 excellent condition complete with a record 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.990
 the table even 3 euros she had 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.580
 full of ps2 games I have better than I am 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.470
 there and the wind of 3 euros and I had to 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.450
 2.50 in negotiating people did not want the 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.920
 let go r2 so 2.5 at stake prices that's 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.080
 not or clichÃ©s very very happy to 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.070
 the remark and we end with a small 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.230
 lob gameboy games 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.430
 so see we'll get to 11 when I 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.600
 even made a lot of discoveries is 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.420
 not huge but still it's still 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.210
 super so there was in order the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:10.700
 donkey kong 1 on game boy 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.350
 donkey kong built country band on 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.710
 game boy color and you see he was 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.820
 marked celine at the top so I guess 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.890
 that you keep quiet the name of the girl he 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.530
 acquired them own yes at the same time 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:28.130
 it's logical we had pokemon crystal 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.209
 and we had nice red kimono fire so 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.239
 I'm really happy to have them 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.220
 found that so she had a lot 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.770
 more at there were very little known games 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.170
 and it's the wind of 3 euros each 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.970
 so I took the four there 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.620
 interesting obviously and instead of 12 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.510
 europa I negotiated at 10 euros for the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.950
 4 so here I was really very 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.450
 happy tell me a little bit what you 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.380
 think 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.290
 I will try to make you a little one to 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.730
 little they exploit these cards for 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.810
 for you to play a little bit 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.730
 show a little bit about how I play 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.810
 on retro games and so on it can 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.400
 always be pleasant I know that 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.880
 some of you are waiting for that with 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.250
 pleasure 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.440
