00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.029
 Beautiful people, I think I died. 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.550
 right because they have three more months and 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.469
 In the post for you, I know that I was 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.509
 thinking that I was dead 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.740
 Ours did not even remember this new 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.289
 I know how I'm playing now. 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.730
 You can see this just not 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.600
 I was recording because I was not 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.330
 Playing 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.090
 are more than three months five without recording 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.560
 or more than three months without playing 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.109
 I was not playing, I was even there. 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.759
 no playstation 3 line will be long time 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.710
 I called down those games that 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.309
 he was having two weeks later 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.629
 champ 12 for free then the file that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.680
 teaches you to download the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.690
 playstation plus 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.600
 anyway I downloaded the game from 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.120
 playstation plus did not play over 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.250
 two weeks I played none left 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.730
 there the time was up and it was already the galley 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.360
 So that's what happened. 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.370
 My pc also did not like it, I did not like it. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.550
 play mean logical nor touch it 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.339
 other things are more to play not 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.140
 I rested on it, it cries, I'm none. 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.659
 guy is not playing anything at anything 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.530
 happened a lot of things in my 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.090
 Life and kind were good things, I can not. 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 to say that it was bad things, how many 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.900
 were very good things the way that 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.549
 I always wanted it to happen and really 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.000
 finally happened 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.689
 so that's why I know that the night was 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.350
 with one with the thought had finished 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.119
 my phase of these things to record 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.329
 to play everything more expensive and half that ended 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.780
 but I'm even trying to get back to there 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.079
 now miss even record a 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.549
 A longing miss me to play where the lot 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.340
 2 I was in the mood I am 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.439
 doing the show for you on how did you 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.170
 a very positive point, right? 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.689
 the only record of missed playing where 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.640
 two come but do not worry not 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.700
 nothing bad happened instead the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.500
 background only good things happened in this 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.530
 time that I have not recorded can be 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.420
 Calm down , do not worry about anything. 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.370
 it was just good things, thank you 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.370
 every day because it would have happened 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.940
 I'm coming back and we'll see what 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.400
 frequency back then 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.930
 usually takes a peek at the non-channel 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.580
 I'll promise video every other day. 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.890
 you can probably have video of the day 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.390
 also on the channel because if you know I can 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.260
 I'm going to have to walk to train agents. 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.540
 You can see I'm ridiculous in the 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.379
 square word has to be time arrives 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.660
 to be ridiculous is missing a lot in 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.510
 come back and with another one 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.599
 two black nÃ© advice that I am 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.980
 having many ideas and this can also 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.810
 gives me ideas and comments that I can 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.209
 bring you guys I can go buy 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.819
 gta5 also because i lost my gta5 from 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:59.640
 fish three for others until thus 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.230
 be able to bring videos online for you 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.550
 So you say that you want to see 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.620
 that not also in the channel I just want to say 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.540
 For you, I'm back, I'm back. 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.180
 Let's see how often we see 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.470
 even when, but I hope it is 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.510
 for quite a while and with the frequency 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.790
 very good because leaving always have 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.530
 Enjoyed the comeback and tomorrow's team tomorrow. 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.540
 after that day I record the other 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.720
 then probably tomorrow will already have 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.120
 then the the continuation of the election people will 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.129
 asking for water from 2 in the beauty channel then 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.590
 Well folks said I hope they have 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.379
 like August you already know how to sign up for 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.159
 channel evaluates the video and until the next 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.159
 Bad crew
