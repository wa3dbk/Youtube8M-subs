00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 not the dough anyway we do the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.790
 morning because they were in the house 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.160
 natural and is not done at the moment 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.800
 and then this was done this morning 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.450
 now we prepare our pizza and then 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:20.670
 we will come back then this is it 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:25.350
 here the laying then we go down the pizza 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:30.599
 we extend in order to knock down with the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:34.200
 fingertips on the dough, turning it 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:40.890
 several times in the flour because anyway 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:47.370
 needs flour and now the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.350
 we beat the spread and then we put it 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.620
 on the bench where we can then 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.890
 share now we put the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.890
 tomato 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.210
 here it is 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.730
 [Music] 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.460
 this one the canned peeled 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:12.110
 This box here and then tomato 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.410
 fresh or on request we are the 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.410
 mozzarella cheese 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.580
 it is minutely cut I see 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.740
 then it is cut into cubes 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.799
 small because anyway good when 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.110
 it is cooked in the oven well and homogeneous 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:39.350
 on pizza then we put on the beautiful ones 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:43.700
 basil leaves to give the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.930
 color to the pizza then we put a little 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.409
 of oil that gold on pizza is 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.950
 fundamental and then maybe behind but 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.409
 we can bake 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.630
 pizza has some ancient origins 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.759
 historians in fact assume that this 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.490
 food was already present in the kitchen 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.490
 Etruscan compliant ingredients of course
