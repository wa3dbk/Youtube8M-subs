parallel<00:05:24.020> bars<00:05:25.030> hopefully<00:05:26.030> on<00:05:26.150> other

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
parallel bars hopefully on other

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.210 
parallel bars hopefully on other
apparatus<00:05:26.570> as<00:05:26.870> well<00:05:27.080> but<00:05:27.650> definitely<00:05:28.160> only

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
apparatus as well but definitely only

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.490

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
focusing on those two I was hoping to

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.650 
focusing on those two I was hoping to
compete<00:05:30.919> back<00:05:31.280> hip<00:05:31.580> to<00:05:31.760> handstand<00:05:32.090> on<00:05:32.480> the

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.990 
compete back hip to handstand on the
Rings<00:05:32.870> as<00:05:33.200> this<00:05:33.590> is<00:05:33.740> considered<00:05:34.190> as<00:05:34.460> swing<00:05:34.880> to

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
Rings as this is considered as swing to

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.270 
Rings as this is considered as swing to
handstand<00:05:35.330> element<00:05:36.050> that's<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.890> only

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
handstand element that's the only

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.010 
handstand element that's the only
element<00:05:37.610> group<00:05:37.669> I'm<00:05:37.940> missing<00:05:38.360> in<00:05:38.600> my<00:05:38.750> rings

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
element group I'm missing in my rings

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.170 
element group I'm missing in my rings
routine<00:05:39.440> so<00:05:40.280> when<00:05:40.430> I<00:05:40.460> put<00:05:40.790> that<00:05:40.820> in<00:05:41.150> my

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
routine so when I put that in my

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.370 
routine so when I put that in my
difficulty<00:05:41.870> is<00:05:41.930> going<00:05:42.110> to<00:05:42.169> rise

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
difficulty is going to rise

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.680 
difficulty is going to rise
significantly<00:05:42.830> I've<00:05:43.730> been<00:05:43.970> building<00:05:44.240> this<00:05:44.450> up

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
significantly I've been building this up

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.060 
significantly I've been building this up
since<00:05:44.990> the<00:05:45.169> end<00:05:45.290> of<00:05:45.440> the<00:05:45.530> last<00:05:45.770> competition

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
since the end of the last competition

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.460 
since the end of the last competition
and<00:05:46.700> a<00:05:47.480> few<00:05:47.690> days<00:05:47.840> before<00:05:48.200> state

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
and a few days before state

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.830 
and a few days before state
championships<00:05:49.190> I<00:05:49.430> tried<00:05:50.060> it<00:05:50.240> in<00:05:50.419> a<00:05:50.450> routine

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
championships I tried it in a routine

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.170 
championships I tried it in a routine
but<00:05:51.590> unfortunately<00:05:52.310> it<00:05:52.550> just<00:05:52.610> wasn't<00:05:52.880> looking

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
but unfortunately it just wasn't looking

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.390 
but unfortunately it just wasn't looking
good<00:05:53.510> enough<00:05:53.750> to<00:05:53.990> put<00:05:54.169> in<00:05:54.290> my<00:05:54.410> final<00:05:54.710> routine<00:05:55.130> I

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
good enough to put in my final routine I

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.909 
good enough to put in my final routine I
was<00:05:55.760> hoping<00:05:56.060> to<00:05:56.120> debut<00:05:56.660> a<00:05:56.840> new<00:05:56.870> vault<00:05:57.290> for<00:05:57.620> me

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
was hoping to debut a new vault for me

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.490 
was hoping to debut a new vault for me
the<00:05:58.280> sugahara<00:05:58.990> this<00:05:59.990> will<00:06:00.260> significantly

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
the sugahara this will significantly

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.800 
the sugahara this will significantly
improved<00:06:01.280> my<00:06:01.490> vaulting<00:06:02.000> difficulty<00:06:02.630> and

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
improved my vaulting difficulty and

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.620 
improved my vaulting difficulty and
should<00:06:03.320> give<00:06:03.470> me<00:06:03.560> a<00:06:03.650> much<00:06:03.830> better<00:06:03.860> score<00:06:04.630> it's

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
should give me a much better score it's

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.540 
should give me a much better score it's
been<00:06:05.840> getting<00:06:06.050> better<00:06:06.350> in<00:06:06.650> training<00:06:07.130> though

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
little inconsistent the shape isn't

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.750 
little inconsistent the shape isn't
great<00:06:18.830> and<00:06:18.980> I'm<00:06:19.070> definitely<00:06:19.430> getting<00:06:19.610> a<00:06:19.640> lot

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
great and I'm definitely getting a lot

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.490 
great and I'm definitely getting a lot
of<00:06:19.790> deductions<00:06:19.970> from<00:06:20.600> it<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:21.020> main<00:06:21.200> reason

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
of deductions from it the main reason

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
of deductions from it the main reason
it's<00:06:21.620> not<00:06:21.650> consistent

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
it's not consistent

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.390 
it's not consistent
is<00:06:22.610> actually<00:06:23.510> just<00:06:24.380> because<00:06:24.650> I'm<00:06:24.770> scared

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
is actually just because I'm scared

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.100 
is actually just because I'm scared
and<00:06:25.669> I'm<00:06:26.060> not<00:06:26.210> comfortable<00:06:26.720> with<00:06:26.840> it<00:06:26.900> because

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
and I'm not comfortable with it because

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.159 
and I'm not comfortable with it because
it's<00:06:27.350> a<00:06:27.410> new<00:06:27.560> skill<00:06:27.830> for<00:06:28.130> me<00:06:28.250> now<00:06:29.210> in<00:06:29.810> today's

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:31.810 
it's a new skill for me now in today's
competition<00:06:30.590> when<00:06:31.400> I<00:06:31.430> was<00:06:31.610> in<00:06:31.669> their

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
competition when I was in their

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
dismount I was holding the handstand

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.740 
dismount I was holding the handstand
thinking<00:06:36.289> to<00:06:36.410> myself<00:06:36.560> I<00:06:37.389> won't<00:06:38.389> accept

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
thinking to myself I won't accept

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.409

another bad dismount today with a bad
shape<00:06:42.130> generally<00:06:43.130> that's<00:06:43.280> just<00:06:43.460> because<00:06:43.729> if<00:06:43.850> I

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
shape generally that's just because if I

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.060 
shape generally that's just because if I
do<00:06:44.030> a<00:06:44.150> bad<00:06:44.360> shape<00:06:44.600> I'm<00:06:44.780> more<00:06:44.930> comfortable<00:06:45.169> so<00:06:46.039> I

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
do a bad shape I'm more comfortable so I

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.090
