the some of the pieces here that number

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.950 
the some of the pieces here that number
one<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.789> big<00:01:18.060> board<00:01:18.390> right<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:18.659> is

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
one this big board right here is

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.020 
one this big board right here is
actually<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.679> really<00:01:19.890> impressive<00:01:20.280> print<00:01:20.850> in

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
actually a really impressive print in

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.959 
actually a really impressive print in
ABS<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:22.590> print<00:01:22.950> something<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.310> big<00:01:23.579> and<00:01:23.850> not

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
ABS to print something this big and not

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.639 
ABS to print something this big and not
have<00:01:24.179> it<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.329> significantly<00:01:25.079> curled<00:01:25.499> or

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
have it be significantly curled or

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.410 
have it be significantly curled or
warped<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.070> think<00:01:26.249> is<00:01:26.340> pretty<00:01:26.520> impressive<00:01:26.999> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
warped I think is pretty impressive and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.969 
warped I think is pretty impressive and
this<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.140> nice<00:01:28.319> quality<00:01:28.560> looking

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
this is a really nice quality looking

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.620 
this is a really nice quality looking
print<00:01:29.219> and<00:01:29.429> the<00:01:29.759> way<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.030> works<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
print and the way this works is the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.739 
print and the way this works is the
board<00:01:30.869> tilts<00:01:31.649> like<00:01:31.909> this<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.539> also

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
board tilts like this but then it also

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:37.609 
board tilts like this but then it also
has<00:01:34.319> a<00:01:35.390> tilt<00:01:36.390> factor<00:01:36.840> going<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.380> way<00:01:37.590> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
has a tilt factor going this way and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.499 
has a tilt factor going this way and
that<00:01:37.829> becomes<00:01:38.249> actually<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.700> pretty<00:01:38.909> important

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
that becomes actually a pretty important

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.679 
that becomes actually a pretty important
part<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.409> strategy<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.429> game<00:01:41.689> in

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
part of the strategy of the game in

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.080 
part of the strategy of the game in
addition<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.139> the<00:01:43.259> board<00:01:43.649> right<00:01:43.859> here<00:01:44.219> we<00:01:45.060> have

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
addition to the board right here we have

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.870 
addition to the board right here we have
these<00:01:45.359> gates<00:01:45.719> right<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:47.189> these<00:01:47.399> balls

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
these gates right here and these balls

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.550 
these gates right here and these balls
and<00:01:48.060> these<00:01:48.179> are<00:01:48.329> actually<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.630> 3d<00:01:49.170> printed

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and these are actually not 3d printed

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.440 
and these are actually not 3d printed
this<00:01:50.069> is<00:01:50.130> one<00:01:50.249> of<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> few<00:01:50.549> parts<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> game

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
this is one of the few parts of the game

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.209 
this is one of the few parts of the game
that<00:01:51.569> is<00:01:51.659> not<00:01:51.810> 3d<00:01:52.139> printed<00:01:52.439> along<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:52.770> daikon

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
that is not 3d printed along with daikon

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:54.529 
that is not 3d printed along with daikon
there's<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> little<00:01:53.700> liner<00:01:53.939> right<00:01:54.209> here<00:01:54.420> which

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
there's a little liner right here which

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.410 
there's a little liner right here which
is<00:01:54.659> heavy<00:01:55.560> paper<00:01:55.859> like<00:01:56.189> cardstock<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.060> then

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
is heavy paper like cardstock and then

we did spend last evening playing this

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.470 
we did spend last evening playing this
and<00:02:22.310> finally<00:02:22.640> about<00:02:22.730> how<00:02:22.940> long<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.210> you<00:02:23.240> think

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
and finally about how long do you think

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.990 
and finally about how long do you think
we<00:02:23.690> spent<00:02:24.260> on<00:02:24.560> our<00:02:24.620> looks<00:02:25.280> like<00:02:25.400> one<00:02:25.580> game<00:02:25.790> all

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
we spent on our looks like one game all

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.890 
we spent on our looks like one game all
the<00:02:26.090> way<00:02:26.120> through<00:02:26.390> about<00:02:26.480> how<00:02:26.660> long<00:02:26.810> do<00:02:26.870> you

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
the way through about how long do you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.630 
the way through about how long do you
think<00:02:26.960> we<00:02:27.140> spend<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.650> probably<00:02:28.070> a<00:02:28.280> little

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
think we spend on it probably a little

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.680 
think we spend on it probably a little
bit<00:02:28.940> over<00:02:29.420> an<00:02:29.540> hour<00:02:29.840> okay<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:31.390> do<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.420> want<00:02:32.600> to

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
bit over an hour okay and do you want to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.890 
bit over an hour okay and do you want to
tell<00:02:32.810> everybody<00:02:33.050> who<00:02:33.260> ended<00:02:33.470> up<00:02:33.560> winning<00:02:34.900> yeah

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
tell everybody who ended up winning yeah

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.350 
tell everybody who ended up winning yeah
that's<00:02:36.470> right<00:02:36.680> mind<00:02:37.010> beat<00:02:37.340> me<00:02:37.550> at<00:02:37.790> amazed

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
that's right mind beat me at amazed

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.110 
that's right mind beat me at amazed
which<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.290> thought<00:02:39.470> was<00:02:39.590> pretty<00:02:39.770> cool<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.610> what

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
which I thought was pretty cool so what

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.460 
which I thought was pretty cool so what
that<00:02:41.240> goes<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.660> tell<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.990> I<00:02:42.020> think<00:02:42.350> is<00:02:42.440> that

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
that goes to tell you I think is that

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.750 
that goes to tell you I think is that
this<00:02:42.650> really<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.070> game<00:02:43.310> for<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:45.290> lot<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.190> ages

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
this really is a game for a lot of ages

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.270 
this really is a game for a lot of ages
probably<00:02:47.330> not<00:02:47.540> every<00:02:48.380> age<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.590> Miley<00:02:49.070> what

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
probably not every age and Miley what

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.100 
probably not every age and Miley what
would<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:49.550> say<00:02:49.730> would<00:02:49.850> be<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:50.300> good<00:02:50.900> age

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
would you say would be a good age

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.660 
would you say would be a good age
recommendation<00:02:51.770> for<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.040> game<00:02:52.250> probably

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
recommendation for this game probably

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.990 
recommendation for this game probably
six<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.990> older<00:02:54.970> because<00:02:57.040> most<00:02:58.040> little<00:02:58.580> kids

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
six and older because most little kids

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.030 
six and older because most little kids
that<00:02:59.420> are<00:02:59.620> younger<00:03:00.620> than<00:03:01.010> sex<00:03:02.140> can<00:03:03.140> get<00:03:03.380> what<00:03:03.800> I

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
that are younger than sex can get what I

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.680 
that are younger than sex can get what I
think<00:03:04.220> they'll<00:03:04.340> get<00:03:04.580> really<00:03:04.910> frustrated

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
think they'll get really frustrated

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.290 
think they'll get really frustrated
because<00:03:06.910> there<00:03:07.910> are<00:03:08.900> some<00:03:09.290> tricky<00:03:09.740> parts<00:03:10.300> of

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
because there are some tricky parts of

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.870 
because there are some tricky parts of
the<00:03:11.900> game<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:15.070> it's<00:03:16.070> just<00:03:16.700> like<00:03:17.030> because<00:03:17.800> you

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
the game and it's just like because you

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.160 
the game and it's just like because you
like<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.630> other<00:03:20.840> player<00:03:21.290> kind<00:03:21.740> of<00:03:22.240> gets<00:03:23.240> it

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
like the other player kind of gets it

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.780 
like the other player kind of gets it
makes<00:03:24.380> sometimes<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.220> wouldn't<00:03:25.550> make<00:03:25.610> you

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
makes sometimes it wouldn't make you

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.550 
makes sometimes it wouldn't make you
kind<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.120> match<00:03:26.270> so<00:03:26.900> we<00:03:26.990> can<00:03:27.140> look<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.410> you're

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
kind of match so we can look like you're

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.870 
kind of match so we can look like you're
about<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:28.070> have<00:03:28.220> something<00:03:28.580> really<00:03:28.700> good

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
about to have something really good

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.760 
about to have something really good
happen<00:03:29.270> for<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:29.930> then<00:03:30.170> your<00:03:30.350> opponent

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
happen for you and then your opponent

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.140 
happen for you and then your opponent
can<00:03:30.890> just<00:03:31.040> make<00:03:31.160> one<00:03:31.340> little<00:03:31.370> change<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.060> all

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
can just make one little change and all

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.370 
can just make one little change and all
of<00:03:32.240> a<00:03:32.270> sudden<00:03:32.300> everything<00:03:32.720> turns<00:03:32.900> around<00:03:33.020> is

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
of a sudden everything turns around is

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.130 
of a sudden everything turns around is
that<00:03:33.530> okay<00:03:34.280> no<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:34.940> agree<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.600> agree<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.080> I<00:03:36.110> think

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
that okay no I agree I agree and I think

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.610 
that okay no I agree I agree and I think
that's<00:03:36.470> part<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:36.800> how<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:36.950> beat<00:03:37.370> me<00:03:38.470> Miley<00:03:39.470> was

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
that's part of how you beat me Miley was

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.530 
that's part of how you beat me Miley was
able<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:39.830> pick<00:03:40.010> up<00:03:40.160> on<00:03:40.340> what<00:03:40.850> I<00:03:40.880> see<00:03:41.270> is<00:03:41.360> being

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
able to pick up on what I see is being

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.540 
able to pick up on what I see is being
some<00:03:41.750> more<00:03:41.870> of<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.020> complicated<00:03:42.950> strategies

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
some more of the complicated strategies

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.100 
some more of the complicated strategies
that<00:03:43.700> do<00:03:43.790> come<00:03:44.000> up<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.270> little<00:03:44.390> bit<00:03:44.630> later<00:03:44.840> on<00:03:44.930> at

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
that do come up a little bit later on at

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.410 
that do come up a little bit later on at
the<00:03:45.170> game<00:03:45.320> that<00:03:45.350> I<00:03:45.560> wasn't<00:03:45.860> quite<00:03:45.980> expecting

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
the game that I wasn't quite expecting

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.370 
the game that I wasn't quite expecting
you<00:03:47.420> can<00:03:48.040> set<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.070> gradual<00:03:49.870> plan<00:03:50.870> in<00:03:51.170> motion

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
you can set a gradual plan in motion

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.920 
you can set a gradual plan in motion
that<00:03:51.860> is<00:03:52.070> not<00:03:52.490> apparent<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:53.390> doesn't<00:03:53.780> look

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
that is not apparent and doesn't look

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.449 
that is not apparent and doesn't look
like<00:03:54.110> anything<00:03:54.470> big<00:03:54.680> is<00:03:54.770> gonna<00:03:54.920> happen<00:03:55.280> until

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
like anything big is gonna happen until

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.910 
like anything big is gonna happen until
finally<00:03:55.910> you<00:03:56.000> make<00:03:56.180> one<00:03:56.390> move<00:03:56.600> several<00:03:57.560> moves

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
finally you make one move several moves

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.470 
finally you make one move several moves
down<00:03:58.190> from<00:03:58.400> when<00:03:58.550> you<00:03:58.670> started<00:03:59.000> your<00:03:59.090> plan<00:03:59.300> and

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
down from when you started your plan and

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.820 
down from when you started your plan and
all<00:03:59.600> of<00:03:59.690> a<00:03:59.720> sudden<00:03:59.750> something<00:04:00.350> just<00:04:00.440> rolls<00:04:00.680> all

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
all of a sudden something just rolls all

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.070 
all of a sudden something just rolls all
the<00:04:00.920> way<00:04:01.010> across<00:04:02.350> so<00:04:03.350> in<00:04:03.530> short<00:04:03.770> the<00:04:05.080> strategy

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
the way across so in short the strategy

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.690 
the way across so in short the strategy
really<00:04:06.290> here<00:04:06.500> or<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:07.070> object<00:04:07.340> of<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.520> game<00:04:07.550> is

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
really here or the object of the game is

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.610 
really here or the object of the game is
to<00:04:07.880> get<00:04:07.970> all<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.270> your<00:04:08.360> balls<00:04:08.600> onto<00:04:09.200> your

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
to get all of your balls onto your

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.140 
to get all of your balls onto your
opponent's<00:04:10.070> side<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:10.459> in<00:04:10.580> that<00:04:10.730> sense<00:04:10.970> it's

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
opponent's side so in that sense it's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.490 
opponent's side so in that sense it's
sort<00:04:11.360> of<00:04:11.390> like<00:04:11.540> Chinese<00:04:11.780> checkers<00:04:12.290> but<00:04:12.440> I

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
sort of like Chinese checkers but I

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.780 
sort of like Chinese checkers but I
think<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:12.800> game<00:04:12.920> is<00:04:13.100> way<00:04:13.280> more<00:04:13.489> fun<00:04:13.550> than

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
think this game is way more fun than

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.550 
think this game is way more fun than
Chinese<00:04:14.209> checkers<00:04:14.600> there<00:04:14.780> is<00:04:14.930> quite<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.290> bit<00:04:15.470> of

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
Chinese checkers there is quite a bit of

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.920 
Chinese checkers there is quite a bit of
strategy<00:04:15.770> to<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.549> found<00:04:17.299> it<00:04:17.450> to<00:04:17.570> be<00:04:17.600> I

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
strategy to it I found it to be I

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.270 
strategy to it I found it to be I
thought<00:04:18.200> it<00:04:18.350> was<00:04:18.440> gonna<00:04:18.560> be<00:04:18.650> fun<00:04:18.950> but<00:04:19.160> it

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
thought it was gonna be fun but it

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.650 
thought it was gonna be fun but it
turned<00:04:19.459> out<00:04:19.520> actually<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.910> be<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.090> lot<00:04:20.270> more<00:04:20.419> fun

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
turned out actually to be a lot more fun

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.150 
turned out actually to be a lot more fun
than<00:04:20.690> I<00:04:20.930> thought

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
than I thought

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.400 
than I thought
I<00:04:21.220> was<00:04:21.340> gonna<00:04:21.430> be<00:04:21.670> and<00:04:22.120> what<00:04:22.960> we'll<00:04:23.080> do<00:04:23.200> now<00:04:23.380> is

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
I was gonna be and what we'll do now is

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.960 
I was gonna be and what we'll do now is
just<00:04:23.800> demonstrate<00:04:23.950> a<00:04:24.220> couple<00:04:24.580> of<00:04:24.640> moves<00:04:24.820> like

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
just demonstrate a couple of moves like

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.640 
just demonstrate a couple of moves like
I<00:04:25.180> said<00:04:25.360> Carl<00:04:25.660> has<00:04:25.840> some<00:04:25.990> great<00:04:26.260> videos<00:04:26.620> about

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
I said Carl has some great videos about

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.770 
I said Carl has some great videos about
with<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.520> gameplay<00:04:27.880> just<00:04:28.150> kind<00:04:28.480> of<00:04:28.510> wanted<00:04:28.720> to

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
with the gameplay just kind of wanted to

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.840 
with the gameplay just kind of wanted to
give<00:04:28.900> you<00:04:28.990> our<00:04:29.020> impression<00:04:29.680> of<00:04:29.830> what<00:04:30.730> we

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
give you our impression of what we

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.850 
give you our impression of what we
thought<00:04:31.060> about<00:04:31.180> it<00:04:31.440> since<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.500> board<00:04:32.770> is

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
thought about it since the board is

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.020 
thought about it since the board is
tilted<00:04:33.190> toward<00:04:33.400> me<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.700> we're<00:04:33.850> at<00:04:33.940> the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
tilted toward me and we're at the

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.480 
tilted toward me and we're at the
beginning<00:04:34.330> of<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.600> game<00:04:34.750> state<00:04:34.960> right<00:04:35.290> here

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
beginning of the game state right here

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.580 
beginning of the game state right here
it's<00:04:36.490> gonna<00:04:36.700> be<00:04:36.850> my<00:04:37.060> move<00:04:37.270> first<00:04:37.600> and<00:04:37.900> what<00:04:38.560> I

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
it's gonna be my move first and what I

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.950 
it's gonna be my move first and what I
have<00:04:38.890> to<00:04:38.920> do<00:04:39.160> is<00:04:39.370> move<00:04:39.700> any<00:04:40.060> of<00:04:40.240> these<00:04:40.420> switches

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
have to do is move any of these switches

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.900 
have to do is move any of these switches
and<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.650> rule<00:04:41.860> is<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.160> can't<00:04:42.430> move<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.640> switch

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
and the rule is I can't move a switch

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.700 
and the rule is I can't move a switch
that<00:04:42.940> has<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.300> ball<00:04:43.570> touching<00:04:44.020> it<00:04:44.140> or<00:04:44.290> someone's

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
that has a ball touching it or someone's

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.490 
that has a ball touching it or someone's
play<00:04:44.920> marker<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.630> can<00:04:46.630> move<00:04:46.780> any<00:04:46.960> other<00:04:47.170> switch

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
play marker I can move any other switch

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.530 
play marker I can move any other switch
and<00:04:47.830> just<00:04:48.310> move<00:04:48.520> it<00:04:48.550> inside<00:04:49.030> these<00:04:49.210> gates

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
and just move it inside these gates

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.850 
and just move it inside these gates
right<00:04:49.780> here<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.230> I'm<00:04:50.440> just<00:04:50.470> going<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.740> move

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
right here and I'm just going to move

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.070 
right here and I'm just going to move
this<00:04:51.040> one<00:04:51.280> for<00:04:51.460> example<00:04:51.550> yeah<00:04:52.480> once<00:04:52.780> you<00:04:52.900> have

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
this one for example yeah once you have

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.600 
this one for example yeah once you have
put<00:04:53.260> your<00:04:53.380> finger<00:04:53.680> on<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:54.070> switch<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.490> are

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
put your finger on the switch you are

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.460 
put your finger on the switch you are
committed<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.120> moving<00:04:55.240> that<00:04:55.570> one<00:04:55.870> so<00:04:56.410> I'm

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
committed to moving that one so I'm

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.110 
committed to moving that one so I'm
going<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.650> move<00:04:56.770> my<00:04:56.950> play<00:04:57.190> marker<00:04:57.610> into<00:04:58.000> the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
going to move my play marker into the

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.640 
going to move my play marker into the
switch<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.480> I<00:04:58.570> just<00:04:58.810> moved<00:04:59.050> and<00:04:59.320> since<00:04:59.530> we

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
switch that I just moved and since we

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.380 
switch that I just moved and since we
are<00:04:59.830> at<00:04:59.920> the<00:05:00.010> beginning<00:05:00.160> of<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.610> game<00:05:00.760> I'm

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
one of those tabs and now she can move a

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.720 
one of those tabs and now she can move a
switch

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.780 

and<00:06:08.450> then<00:06:09.020> market<00:06:09.380> with<00:06:09.500> her<00:06:09.590> play<00:06:09.740> marker<00:06:10.100> and

then<00:06:11.330> release<00:06:11.750> a<00:06:12.020> ball<00:06:13.960> so<00:06:14.960> that's<00:06:15.140> generally

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
then release a ball so that's generally

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.290 
then release a ball so that's generally
how<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:15.800> how<00:06:16.310> the<00:06:16.340> play<00:06:16.610> of<00:06:16.760> the<00:06:16.880> game<00:06:16.910> goes

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
how the how the play of the game goes

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.850 
how the how the play of the game goes
eventually<00:06:17.780> you<00:06:17.870> can<00:06:17.990> see<00:06:18.140> how<00:06:18.320> once<00:06:18.590> you<00:06:18.710> got

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
eventually you can see how once you got

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.470 
eventually you can see how once you got
moving<00:06:19.310> some<00:06:19.460> switches<00:06:19.820> you<00:06:19.970> can<00:06:20.000> get<00:06:20.240> a<00:06:20.270> ball

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
moving some switches you can get a ball

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.870 
moving some switches you can get a ball
into<00:06:20.780> your<00:06:20.870> opponent's<00:06:21.100> space<00:06:22.100> once<00:06:22.700> that

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
into your opponent's space once that

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.160 
into your opponent's space once that
happens<00:06:23.240> you<00:06:23.360> would<00:06:23.480> just<00:06:23.600> kind<00:06:23.750> of<00:06:23.870> you<00:06:24.110> know

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.170 
happens you would just kind of you know

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.380 
happens you would just kind of you know
recapture<00:06:24.920> the<00:06:25.010> ball<00:06:25.190> and<00:06:25.520> put<00:06:26.030> it<00:06:26.090> back<00:06:26.210> in

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
recapture the ball and put it back in

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.910 
recapture the ball and put it back in
this<00:06:26.510> configuration<00:06:27.110> like<00:06:27.590> that<00:06:27.740> only

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
this configuration like that only

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.500 
this configuration like that only
obviously<00:06:28.340> that<00:06:28.460> would<00:06:28.580> be<00:06:28.610> one<00:06:29.330> of<00:06:29.420> my

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
obviously that would be one of my

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.890 
obviously that would be one of my
opponents<00:06:30.100> balls<00:06:31.100> in<00:06:31.340> that<00:06:31.520> case<00:06:31.700> so<00:06:32.330> overall

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
opponents balls in that case so overall

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.110 
opponents balls in that case so overall
I<00:06:33.350> got<00:06:33.950> it<00:06:34.040> that's<00:06:34.580> what<00:06:34.790> it<00:06:34.880> would<00:06:34.940> look<00:06:35.060> like

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
I got it that's what it would look like

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.170 
I got it that's what it would look like
right<00:06:35.630> I<00:06:36.200> gotta<00:06:37.040> say<00:06:37.250> I<00:06:37.280> really<00:06:37.460> had<00:06:37.940> a<00:06:37.970> great
