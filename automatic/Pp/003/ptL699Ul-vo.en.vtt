00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.850

 It looks like the town where the users are directly in this way . 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.209
 Let's go up once. 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.200

 You can not see it like this. 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:28.790
 That's why the idea of ​​terror is to bend into the bank anyway. 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:33.260
 Because you're still in the midst of a little while, 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.430

 Oh, it's not much to say if he owned to news server 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.000
 Because the server is not doing anything in my house just to know more 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.790
 We can only know that it is beautiful. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.659
 4 I think I built the house the most beautiful while I was multi-server. 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.590
 There are quite a lot of houses, too . 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.760

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:54.629
 You made it like this . 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:04:00.430
 You can fiddle with the picking roof here. 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:05.349

 Sponges like this so if you go to bed this way is common and one later 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:17.620
 Of course, you can also see this because it's obi. 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.910
 Here's a small spoon and you'll spawn on the ceiling . 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.740
 This ceiling is just below the ceiling spoon opening and when you drop down and down 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.439
 If you do, you will be born here. 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:32.280
 I will go down to it, build a house, 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:36.659
 Just because I just want to play games with you guys, 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.569

 I'll take a look at the sub-magic video description and you'll come in with it. 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.080
 I do not need Hamachi 1 because it is another misunderstanding 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:11.930
 I'll let you know, and Apple will do it for you. 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.930
 There's no multi-server promotional video.
