 won 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.809

 he did that so can all help I have you too 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.449
 for example, that is the difference with the Dutch wedding 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.429
 that you are going to be called fifteen 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:43.409
 and the rest that the combination on reception and then you might as well 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.479
 again a limited number of people 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:49.209
 and then when a party canceling everyone come again you know they must limit 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.129
 but what I am experiencing 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.959
 the Antillean people are injured 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.959
 I sit it is mainly able to stand 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.669
 scandalous 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.689
 who they are in the position they have 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.689
 and it is just shown once 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.879
 the 23-year-old great man 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.089
 are you again 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.109
 being big 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.650
 the bigger the better the impressive ones in between and it stays the whole evening 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:23.359
 4 next to bridal couples 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.979
 in his car when your legs are walking 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.349
 The first thing you see is that wedding couples are very nicely dressed 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.509
 and also the wedding cake and very often they could not get anything 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.599
 a table with a better 60 to two years 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.599
 cooperate westra second room 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.519
 with such an effect 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.899
 the wit they are just open 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:51.039
 and after aden of course through the years, now succeeded 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.589
 See that again 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:56.069
 just be happy you no longer have to undermine the successful life 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:00.059
 and there are people inclined 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.559
 a number from the hague every year 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:04.899
 they are also really believing 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:06.639
 if you are wondering 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.639
 krajicek in the uprising this means that 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.559
 marriage is short-lived 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.769
 other we believe clean up and tuesday there are for example 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.019
 no concrete and 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.949
 encountered the bridal couple 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.610
 I prefer not to bump into everything 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:31.599
 because too 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.819
 these clothes would have indicated that the marriage would last only briefly 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.409
 and so rosy picture 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.870
 so the intention is for the bridal couple to leave 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.339
 in some families the bridal couple will visibly say goodbye 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.129
 from one of the twelfth and fashion 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:52.129
 and if you are other and families 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:54.409
 they disappear 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.189
 she is the way in one go 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:00.259
 and as the wedding couple 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.009
 threatens to forget 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.110
 that she must leave the party 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.919
 then there is always someone who caught the beast and then very violent for the 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.909
 feet of the bridal couple begins to wipe 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.319
 and ask me to spend that told 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:14.899
 then they have to
