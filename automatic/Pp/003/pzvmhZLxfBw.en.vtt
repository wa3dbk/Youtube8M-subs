00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 chains the television more also 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.230
 talking about the metro oceania on the internet 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.750
 already circulates this video in the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.080
 just at the moment the convoy of the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.440
 metro collides with another there just the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.300
 invitation is nothing more 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.350
 the image is seen as one of the 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.030
 trains was parked 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.800
 literally in season when the 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:32.110
 nothing happened happened this 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.879
 this rugged several of the users 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.239
 who were in the hall tried 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:40.260
 to get to safety even manages to see the 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.260
 small explosion 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.770
 perhaps 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.600
 and there parked but 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.040
 and I will say he had the fortune but 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.700
 it's really no fortune in a 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.640
 accident like that but he touched him he touched 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.610
 randomly record this moment 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.200
 in which trains touch them and in more 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.180
 of this same topic I tell you that the train 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.070
 that hit the other convoy when it left 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.720
 the oceania station has multiple 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.790
 reports of failures that put at risk 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.340
 its operation and the safety of 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.369
 users since last January 29 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.869
 but this is not all this train had 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.259
 remained out of service from 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.149
 December 2009 imagine yourself 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.700

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.740
 recovered in February 2014 as part 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.600
 of the rescue program that he implemented 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.600
 collective transport-meter 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.000
 clearly clearly they did not fix it 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.000
