00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.700
 hello we make cotton candy 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.089
 that is, so for the harem I will tell that for 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.089
 this is necessary 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.840
 see the ship cut up on here and i 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.679
 exactly the fan of this case has secured 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.670
 lest he fall now is steeper 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:38.570
 all bars 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:41.690
 lattice quarrel new need box and stuff 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.770
 should cut holes here this 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:50.900
 diameter so that his departure and screw 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.950
 that is, to do everything here is our hole 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.860
 such a need 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:00.740
 that is, how it is done you need to 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:04.610
 you and I rotated something turned 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.439
 and dumped the wool around i mean i 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.869
 I'll tell you now so quickly primitive 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.649
 method using a fan 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:15.200
 Well, at the end of the video I will leave a link to 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:17.899
 the video where is more normal is good 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.619
 I will tell you in detail how it all is 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.009
 fasten it so I don't tickle 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.009
 chatted 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.100
 all together now if we get found 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.320
 we will spin it lowered by it 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.050
 the rod is left with you to secure 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.070
 now unwrap on scattering 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:44.820
 drive this case davos drive and 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.870
 so he moved and made expansion 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.060
 sew and here it is i now 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:56.190
 heat gun gray and just stick sit 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:01.140
 drive to this to our core the main thing 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.970
 how to make the main thing that was 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.590
 scatter ie we will cook syrup 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.510
 Now I'll tell you everything 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.630
 and there is a rod some motor pour 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.970
 We can make the drive all year round 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.740
 cardboard cut them something on the sides to 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.240
 what will catch our ie we 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:24.570
 we take hero reception on a disk it rotates and 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.850
 while she he thinks he's hot knives 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.290
 my hot it cools with us and 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.360
 turns into cotton candy 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.070
 that is, so it is done quickly now I 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.080
 quickly show as primitive as possible with 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.430
 using a fan do you 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.410
 of course if you can do 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.690
 neater all there is not just this 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.950
 I don't need a fan. I have a lot of it. 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.660
 so on the street or animated here and if 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.820
 do it carefully with some motor 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.090
 some construction will be neat 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.250
 and durable people see this he 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.430
 just came up with no glue at all 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.209
 you can get by here we take i found 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.550
 can cut 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.090
 it is possible to impose in the usual steps 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.920
 the stock goes here the stock thread is gone and then 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.690
 thread here we see then there is more 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.790
 scatter cap with some dregs under 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.060
 clutch 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:21.400
 still hat on 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:26.530
 Yes, and then twist the package all six 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.940
 better then like this then i'm all 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.680
 I will be screwed up I will be techniques 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:45.180
 congratulate that you somehow spun in 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:49.560
 more or less it was exactly like that 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.390
 now we go to cook syrup 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.049
 cooking sugar noses syrup 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.049
 will need 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.260
 sugar here we poured year 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.530
 and fill it with water 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.569
 water and fill it completely not 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.579
 covered with some water 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.440
 so here we would bring him delicious 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:18.120
 quantity 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.120
 spoon we learn more and even more 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.220
 turn you on 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.889
 speak from everything carefully so that we don't 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.990
 burned 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.470
 people to speak constantly must interfere 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.970
 so that it does not weld 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.120
 to dissolve was good mouth 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.919
 it boils and we have to stop getting in the way 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.770
 interfere in general constantly when boil a 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.260
 then we look at the color it should be on 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.180
 White coaster hour and a slightly 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:54.600
 brownish when he's ready we him 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:54.600
 remove and go further on what we go well 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.700
 oh, it turns out 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.700
 do the syrup correctly 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.380
 on a little ride you 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.810
 a lot of rocks and crashing 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:59.949
 as we see it turns out or reception 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:59.949
 quietly barely center disk 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:10.730
 he is weak the main thing is doing right 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:14.230
 recipe or reception on the edge but here's 6 pin 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:17.230
 sneaking yes the main thing is to make a recipe 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.230
 right 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.110
 syrups 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.110
 this is the second goal
