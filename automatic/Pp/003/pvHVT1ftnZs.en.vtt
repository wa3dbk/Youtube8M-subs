shield down you're going to want to
equip<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.840> B<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.259> you're<00:01:43.590> also<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
equip the B and you're also going to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.530 
equip the B and you're also going to
want<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.310> run<00:01:44.430> over<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.850> pipe<00:01:45.119> that's<00:01:45.390> by

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
want to run over to the pipe that's by

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.840 
want to run over to the pipe that's by
the<00:01:45.600> ammo<00:01:45.869> generation<00:01:46.649> machine<00:01:47.009> because<00:01:47.700> he's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the ammo generation machine because he's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.740 
the ammo generation machine because he's
going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.210> hit<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.780> his<00:01:49.020> Nova<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.750> that

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
going to hit you with his Nova and that

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.990 
going to hit you with his Nova and that
pipe<00:01:52.020> only<00:01:52.350> sends<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.860> spider<00:01:53.220> rounds<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.790> not

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
pipe only sends in spider rounds and not

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.990 
pipe only sends in spider rounds and not
rats<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.619> lot<00:01:55.799> easier<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.700> deal<00:01:56.969> with

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
rats so it's a lot easier to deal with

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.350 
rats so it's a lot easier to deal with
and<00:01:58.070> from<00:01:59.070> there<00:01:59.250> you're<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.460> going<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.939> want

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
and from there you're just going to want

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.600 
and from there you're just going to want
to<00:02:00.540> point<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> paper<00:02:01.680> at<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> ground<00:02:02.399> in

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
because if you didn't know the fever

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.440 
because if you didn't know the fever

either 8 or 9 bullets I can't remember
which<00:02:14.690> I<00:02:14.870> think<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.319> 9<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:15.860> I'm<00:02:15.950> not<00:02:16.069> sure

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
which I think it's 9 but I'm not sure

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.020 
which I think it's 9 but I'm not sure
and<00:02:17.440> if<00:02:18.440> he's<00:02:18.680> ever<00:02:18.890> not<00:02:19.160> slag<00:02:19.490> just<00:02:19.790> switch<00:02:20.000> to

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
and if he's ever not slag just switch to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.270 
and if he's ever not slag just switch to
the<00:02:20.239> Saiga<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.900> slag<00:02:21.140> him<00:02:21.350> again<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.830> repeat

the Saiga to slag him again and repeat
this<00:02:22.489> process<00:02:22.550> until<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.480> kill<00:02:23.840> him<00:02:26.080> thanks

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
this process until you kill him thanks

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
the favorite the second rail works

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.040 
the favorite the second rail works
