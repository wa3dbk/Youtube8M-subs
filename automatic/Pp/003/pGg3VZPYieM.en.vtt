00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.029
 was 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.749
 Dr 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.500
 Beethoven means to me had a fierce security interests 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.529
 to be played by the heart I have then as of course with the white sun 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.149
 close to it I can understand that I liked it so much but not one 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:36.999
 these 

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:41.129
 Keep that energy around this weird roaring one in the beginning 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.819
 Of course, I was intensely fascinated with it 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:47.780
 Examined and realized that not only not natural 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.780
 alone to hear the beautiful pieces Forlan 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.430
 Beyer to the arrival and also desperation 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.810
 Apen 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.270
 but 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.550
 percent 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.520
 percent 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 one 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.090
 the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.550
 the denser elements of this he 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.960
 It is the errant little thing 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.450
 Ideas has been 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.909
 who also had too idealistic or ideological hope 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.790
 this wedge of them this act should not in my pieces 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.350
 Mr. Forum 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.610
 especially now in the grooves of the Wall Street Journal had reported that then 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.229
 the transition from the second movement to the third movement or to the last sound 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.440
 The first sunbeams are on the way, that's why the company also had 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.870
 still a few euro revenue declining with seven other parts 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.870
 that always means a riddle 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.029
 Dr 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:43.689
 I think he has finally prepared for the exception 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.809
 Man has been dealt with the cities 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:52.299
 with the musicians came up and repeatedly brought advice but I think 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.099
 the biggest argument takes place at the moment in the delusion 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.509
 the recording studio is 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.919
 though the deadline is the scenes 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.919
 Waldheim 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.159
 Of course it is not something too big 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.159
 House from the club to tackle this piece but I think 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.779
 to evolve 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.779
 You also have to accept a hair challenge 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.669
 Enz it will certainly be a long way to go with this sonata 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:48.049
 and percent 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.120
 finally she has certainly stood and still has the 20 30 years 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.290
 partly certainly 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.229
 closed again and again 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.689
 but percent 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.849
 I do not regret a single victory without me now holding this level 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.860
 For me, every shot is a fingerprint 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.930
 I leave that behind somewhere 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.050
 to be my whole one at the moment 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.939
 and what I stole at the moment 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.669
 and that wiped away again 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.229
 Now that means he will always be a keystone he does not count 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.219
 stay that means it goes on I have my way if I continue to run 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:58.020
 that means finally leave this a bite at the moment 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.240
 a lot does not mean that anymore 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.240
 look back and just keep going 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.309
 all 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.949
