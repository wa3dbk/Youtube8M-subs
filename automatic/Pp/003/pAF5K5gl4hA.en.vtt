00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.800
 react above miracle 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:14.409
 although it is a so-called 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.069
 for normal people let us know what they do and a public order comes to me 

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:22.150
 have no work experience i have never been for more information 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.599
 a little later in the day go into the relational sphere 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.259
 we have 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.949
 no trouble at all 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.300
 you are used to take 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.929
 the project in the payment of a party 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:36.819
 it's just a shame but this is just a size too small girl from 

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:38.910
 Almere I don't think so 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.600
 possibly leaves to yes 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.780
 I do not think so 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.720
 Sign Up 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.880
 this at around 15 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.210
 many with me may like those services 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.570
 just like in April 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.100
 his whole life 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.020
 was therefore only from Monday 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.929
 were in the Netherlands 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.869
 that is important seventies a torture prison is taken care of more 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:04.430
 info 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.049
 we cannot take the mouth into account 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.109
 He is counting on a sales increase of 5 days a week and the loss for that 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:14.400
 the bell 20 year old wanderer is screwing in his monday 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.350
 the biggest problem 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.020
 it's a big issue 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.260
 but the visor meets it the most 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.920
 Here you see them happy that the minima 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.049
 the gelderlander 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.690
 not really 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.170
 it fell no 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.900
 in 2010 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.750
 oh no then only goes 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.040
 I do not think so 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.860
 against it as a failure 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.990
 but the question 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.229
 You will only have real ideas and a salary I want is in the Zijlstra order 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.020
 prison but it is not that a third device of easy life event 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.700
 so for the smx elementary a normal weather something else then you have to 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.770
 that is something you don't have to solve yourself, but let's go on until then 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.970
 make each other not so difficult the habit of being a little apart afterwards 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.140
 to accommodate 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.540
 but that at least meets the conditions for your benefit that is 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 just bales 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:13.199
 This is the last bit of help myself if I have an overview of I am not going 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.469
 help out
