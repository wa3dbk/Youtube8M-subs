hey<00:00:10.410> guys<00:00:10.620> today<00:00:10.889> I'm<00:00:11.099> going<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.309> show<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.580> how

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
hey guys today I'm going to show you how

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.970 
hey guys today I'm going to show you how
you<00:00:12.269> can<00:00:12.389> perform<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.929> cylinder<00:00:13.469> leap<00:00:13.740> down

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
you can perform a cylinder leap down

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.670 
you can perform a cylinder leap down
test<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:15.210> first<00:00:15.450> step<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:16.049> performing<00:00:16.590> a

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
test the first step to performing a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.769 
test the first step to performing a
cylinder<00:00:17.160> leak<00:00:17.340> down<00:00:17.550> test<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.570> run<00:00:18.750> your

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
cylinder leak down test is to run your

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.040 
cylinder leak down test is to run your
vehicle<00:00:19.220> until<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.369> gets<00:00:20.609> semi<00:00:21.390> warm<00:00:21.720> what

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
vehicle until it gets semi warm what

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.689 
vehicle until it gets semi warm what
what<00:00:22.650> you're<00:00:22.769> going<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.920> do<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.430> you're<00:00:23.670> going

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.920 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:00:23.820> heat<00:00:24.060> those<00:00:24.300> rings

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
to heat those rings

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.439 
to heat those rings
so<00:00:25.470> they<00:00:25.590> expand<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.820> don't<00:00:27.000> get<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> false

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
so they expand and you don't get a false

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.380 
so they expand and you don't get a false
reading<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.529> either<00:00:28.920> your<00:00:29.279> gauge<00:00:29.519> or<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
reading on either your gauge or it

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.900 
reading on either your gauge or it
doesn't<00:00:30.720> seal<00:00:30.900> properly<00:00:31.529> because<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.520> piston

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
doesn't seal properly because the piston

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.700 
doesn't seal properly because the piston
rings<00:00:33.149> aren't<00:00:33.360> sealed<00:00:33.690> when<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> piston

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
rings aren't sealed when the piston

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.430 
rings aren't sealed when the piston
rings<00:00:34.950> cool<00:00:35.250> down<00:00:35.430> they<00:00:35.730> extract<00:00:36.180> or<00:00:37.020> compress

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
rings cool down they extract or compress

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.160 
rings cool down they extract or compress
and<00:00:37.879> they<00:00:38.879> don't<00:00:39.059> seal<00:00:39.329> as<00:00:39.510> good<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:39.960> when

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and they don't seal as good as when

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.139 
and they don't seal as good as when
they're<00:00:40.320> warmed<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.770> after<00:00:41.730> heating<00:00:42.059> your

catch the spark plug always make sure to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.450 
catch the spark plug always make sure to
check<00:01:05.549> your<00:01:05.909> spark<00:01:06.270> plugs<00:01:06.680> this<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:08.010> looks

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
check your spark plugs this one looks

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.789 
check your spark plugs this one looks
like<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.790> burning<00:01:09.030> nice<00:01:09.450> tan<00:01:09.780> color<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.680> if

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
like it's burning nice tan color but if

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.120 
like it's burning nice tan color but if
you<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.070> white<00:01:11.400> or<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.930> really<00:01:13.170> wet<00:01:13.590> maybe

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
you have white or it's really wet maybe

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.640 
you have white or it's really wet maybe
oily<00:01:14.729> or<00:01:15.000> even<00:01:15.360> water<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.259> would<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.560> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
oily or even water then that would be a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.080 
oily or even water then that would be a
cylinder<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> would<00:01:17.460> definitely<00:01:17.939> take

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
cylinder I would definitely take

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.990 
cylinder I would definitely take
precaution<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.810> looking<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.350> into<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.820> now

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
precaution and looking more into so now

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.609 
precaution and looking more into so now
that<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.750> spark<00:01:22.049> plug<00:01:22.259> removed

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
that we have the spark plug removed

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.859 
that we have the spark plug removed
we're<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> stick<00:01:23.700> either<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
we're going to stick either a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.270 
we're going to stick either a
screwdriver<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.939> 3/8<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.290> extension<00:01:28.290> inside

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
screwdriver or 3/8 it extension inside

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.399 
screwdriver or 3/8 it extension inside
this<00:01:29.520> cylinder<00:01:29.970> where<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> spark<00:01:30.869> plug<00:01:31.229> would

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
this cylinder where the spark plug would

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.530 
this cylinder where the spark plug would
go<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.520> we're<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.909> do<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.390> we're

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
go and what we're going to do is we're

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.780 
go and what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> turn<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> crank<00:01:34.369> until<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
going to turn the crank until we get it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.630 
going to turn the crank until we get it
all<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.509> way<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.720> its<00:01:37.110> very<00:01:37.380> top<00:01:37.740> rotation<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
all the way to its very top rotation and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.950 
all the way to its very top rotation and
that's<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> put<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.450> at<00:01:39.570> top<00:01:39.780> dead

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
that's going to put it at top dead

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.260 
that's going to put it at top dead
center<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:41.250> would<00:01:41.400> mean<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
center and that would mean that the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.450 
center and that would mean that the
valves<00:01:42.600> are<00:01:42.720> closed<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:44.100> my

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
valves are closed now that I have my

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.270 
valves are closed now that I have my
three-eighths<00:01:44.880> inch<00:01:45.119> extension<00:01:46.100> inside<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
three-eighths inch extension inside the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.999 
three-eighths inch extension inside the
cylinder<00:01:47.729> I'm<00:01:48.720> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> turn<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.829> crank

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
cylinder I'm going to turn the crank

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.660 
cylinder I'm going to turn the crank
pulley<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.659> 19<00:01:52.200> millimeter<00:01:52.710> 1/2<00:01:53.369> inch

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
pulley with this 19 millimeter 1/2 inch

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:17.270 
pulley with this 19 millimeter 1/2 inch
wrench<00:01:54.470> until<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.939> full<00:01:57.329> rotation

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.930 

okay<00:02:18.810> now<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:19.960> see<00:02:20.460> it's<00:02:21.460> much<00:02:21.730> more

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
okay now you can see it's much more

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.600 
okay now you can see it's much more
higher<00:02:22.210> than<00:02:22.240> now<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.620> usually<00:02:23.800> go<00:02:24.130> over<00:02:24.370> it

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
higher than now and I usually go over it

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.070 
higher than now and I usually go over it
a<00:02:24.670> little<00:02:24.850> bit<00:02:25.060> because<00:02:25.330> when<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.690> go<00:02:25.780> over

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
a little bit because when you go over

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.420 
a little bit because when you go over
it'll<00:02:26.260> start<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.470> come<00:02:26.680> back<00:02:26.710> down<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.370> you

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
it'll start to come back down so you

hooks in I take this part out at the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.410 
hooks in I take this part out at the
bottom<00:03:38.620> there's<00:03:39.070> a<00:03:39.130> Schrader<00:03:39.430> valve<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:40.090> pull

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
bottom there's a Schrader valve I pull

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.780 
bottom there's a Schrader valve I pull
the<00:03:40.570> Schrader<00:03:40.810> valve<00:03:41.140> out<00:03:41.580> because<00:03:42.580> obviously

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
the Schrader valve out because obviously

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.990 
the Schrader valve out because obviously
if<00:03:43.209> I'm<00:03:43.330> putting<00:03:43.630> air<00:03:43.810> into<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.410> it<00:03:45.370> reverses

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
if I'm putting air into it it reverses

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.120 
if I'm putting air into it it reverses
it<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.870> can't<00:03:47.079> blow<00:03:47.320> air<00:03:47.500> in<00:03:47.739> because<00:03:47.920> the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
it and it can't blow air in because the

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.850 
it and it can't blow air in because the
Schrader<00:03:48.489> valve<00:03:48.610> only<00:03:49.239> takes<00:03:49.510> air<00:03:49.750> in<00:03:50.019> I<00:03:50.320> want

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
Schrader valve only takes air in I want

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.770 
Schrader valve only takes air in I want
to<00:03:50.890> push<00:03:51.070> air<00:03:51.280> out<00:03:51.489> so<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.150> take<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.540> Schrader

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
to push air out so I take the Schrader

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.900 
to push air out so I take the Schrader
valve<00:03:53.079> out<00:03:53.320> there's<00:03:53.890> little<00:03:54.220> screwdriver

here and then adjust it to what I want I
sometimes<00:04:26.770> set<00:04:26.979> it<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.220> 40<00:04:27.660> just<00:04:28.660> to<00:04:28.870> make<00:04:29.050> sure

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
sometimes set it to 40 just to make sure

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.290 
sometimes set it to 40 just to make sure
or<00:04:29.470> 20<00:04:29.830> just<00:04:30.039> to<00:04:30.190> make<00:04:30.340> sure<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.820> it's<00:04:31.000> at<00:04:31.120> top

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
or 20 just to make sure that it's at top

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.820 
or 20 just to make sure that it's at top
dead<00:04:31.509> center<00:04:31.810> because<00:04:32.199> if<00:04:32.350> you<00:04:32.440> have<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:32.680> at<00:04:32.800> a

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
dead center because if you have it at a

hunter and it's not at top dead center

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.749 
hunter and it's not at top dead center
it's<00:04:35.080> going<00:04:35.289> to<00:04:35.380> spin<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.860> crank<00:04:36.130> really<00:04:36.490> fast

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
it's going to spin the crank really fast

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.969 
it's going to spin the crank really fast
so<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:37.300> like<00:04:37.479> to<00:04:37.509> gradually<00:04:38.139> do<00:04:38.350> it<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.680> if<00:04:38.800> it's

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
so I like to gradually do it and if it's

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.180 
so I like to gradually do it and if it's
if<00:04:39.580> I<00:04:39.729> hear<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.000> little<00:04:40.120> bit<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.449> leak<00:04:40.630> at<00:04:40.900> 20<00:04:41.410> psi

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
if I hear a little bit of leak at 20 psi

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.740 
if I hear a little bit of leak at 20 psi
I'll<00:04:42.250> just<00:04:42.729> adjust<00:04:42.880> two<00:04:43.240> of<00:04:43.330> my<00:04:43.449> wrench

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
I'll just adjust two of my wrench

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.029 
I'll just adjust two of my wrench
because<00:04:43.930> if<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.199> stick<00:04:44.410> your<00:04:44.500> hand<00:04:44.740> on<00:04:44.860> there

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
because if you stick your hand on there

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.740 
because if you stick your hand on there
at<00:04:45.130> a<00:04:45.160> Haunter<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.880> rotates<00:04:46.090> it's<00:04:46.599> going

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
at a Haunter and it rotates it's going

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.080 
at a Haunter and it rotates it's going
to<00:04:46.810> slam<00:04:47.139> your<00:04:47.380> hand<00:04:47.560> anywhere<00:04:48.400> but<00:04:48.610> at<00:04:48.729> 20

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
to slam your hand anywhere but at 20

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.839 
to slam your hand anywhere but at 20
it's<00:04:49.240> barely<00:04:49.479> going<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.810> budget<00:04:50.169> so<00:04:50.979> you<00:04:51.669> hook

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
it's barely going to budget so you hook

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.999 
it's barely going to budget so you hook
it<00:04:51.970> up<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.479> AC<00:04:52.990> compressor<00:04:53.530> the

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
it up to the AC compressor the

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:59.040 
it up to the AC compressor the
compressor<00:04:54.479> you<00:04:56.250> adjust<00:04:57.250> your<00:04:57.690> knob<00:04:58.690> here

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
compressor you adjust your knob here

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.450 
compressor you adjust your knob here
after<00:04:59.410> you<00:04:59.470> pull<00:04:59.680> it<00:04:59.800> down<00:04:59.830> because<00:05:00.310> they're<00:05:00.430> a

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
after you pull it down because they're a

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.189 
after you pull it down because they're a
lock<00:05:00.729> mechanism<00:05:00.970> you<00:05:01.690> got<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.900> pull<00:05:02.050> it<00:05:02.169> down

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
lock mechanism you got to pull it down

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.070 
lock mechanism you got to pull it down
to<00:05:02.530> adjust<00:05:02.889> it<00:05:03.070> so<00:05:03.820> once<00:05:04.000> you<00:05:04.090> do<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:04.240> set<00:05:04.960> it

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
to adjust it so once you do that set it

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.700 
to adjust it so once you do that set it
to<00:05:05.169> 20<00:05:05.669> plug<00:05:06.669> it<00:05:06.820> in<00:05:06.970> then<00:05:07.960> hook<00:05:08.229> it<00:05:08.320> into<00:05:08.500> your

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
to 20 plug it in then hook it into your

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.580 
to 20 plug it in then hook it into your
air<00:05:08.860> compressor<00:05:09.070> line<00:05:09.580> here<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.410> make<00:05:11.410> sure

case I don't have any issues with

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.450 
case I don't have any issues with
coolant<00:05:43.389> getting<00:05:43.720> in<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:43.930> cylinders<00:05:44.440> I<00:05:44.620> just

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
coolant getting in the cylinders I just

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.730 
coolant getting in the cylinders I just
have<00:05:45.610> an<00:05:45.760> issue<00:05:45.849> of<00:05:46.120> getting<00:05:47.080> bubbles<00:05:47.590> in<00:05:47.710> my

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
have an issue of getting bubbles in my

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.200 
have an issue of getting bubbles in my
radiator<00:05:48.250> so<00:05:48.520> we're<00:05:48.639> going<00:05:48.760> to<00:05:48.820> find<00:05:49.060> out

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
radiator so we're going to find out

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.370 
radiator so we're going to find out
where<00:05:49.389> that's<00:05:49.570> coming<00:05:49.810> from<00:05:49.930> I'm<00:05:50.229> either

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
where that's coming from I'm either

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.120 
where that's coming from I'm either
pulling<00:05:50.770> air<00:05:51.190> from<00:05:51.789> a<00:05:51.849> hose<00:05:52.199> or<00:05:53.199> I'm<00:05:53.979> getting

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
pulling air from a hose or I'm getting

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.370 
pulling air from a hose or I'm getting
combustion<00:05:54.880> in<00:05:55.090> my<00:05:55.240> radiator<00:05:56.050> now<00:05:56.260> I've

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
combustion in my radiator now I've

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.899 
combustion in my radiator now I've
already<00:05:56.530> tested<00:05:56.979> for<00:05:57.130> combustion<00:05:57.639> and<00:05:57.820> it

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
already tested for combustion and it

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.089 
already tested for combustion and it
hasn't<00:05:58.240> shown<00:05:58.419> on<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.720> test<00:05:58.990> so<00:05:59.740> that's<00:05:59.979> why

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
hasn't shown on the test so that's why

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:01.790 
hasn't shown on the test so that's why
I'm<00:06:00.220> performing<00:06:00.520> this<00:06:00.820> Lake<00:06:01.030> down<00:06:01.210> test

I'm performing this Lake down test
another<00:06:02.800> key<00:06:03.070> factor<00:06:03.550> is<00:06:03.699> is<00:06:03.880> to<00:06:04.030> leave<00:06:04.240> your

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
another key factor is is to leave your

another key factor is is to leave your
other<00:06:04.659> spark<00:06:05.169> plugs<00:06:05.470> in<00:06:05.770> I<00:06:05.979> don't<00:06:06.729> know<00:06:06.820> if

other spark plugs in I don't know if

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.700 
other spark plugs in I don't know if
some<00:06:07.270> people<00:06:07.539> do<00:06:07.720> this<00:06:07.870> but<00:06:08.139> I<00:06:08.229> like<00:06:08.260> to<00:06:08.560> do

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
some people do this but I like to do

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.140 
some people do this but I like to do
this<00:06:08.860> because<00:06:09.430> when<00:06:09.729> you're<00:06:09.849> doing<00:06:10.090> a

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
this because when you're doing a

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.990 
this because when you're doing a
compression<00:06:10.509> test<00:06:10.720> or<00:06:11.199> a<00:06:11.280> leak<00:06:12.280> down<00:06:12.460> test<00:06:12.789> and

compression test or a leak down test and

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.790 
compression test or a leak down test and
you're<00:06:13.210> feeding<00:06:13.479> that<00:06:13.599> much<00:06:13.930> air<00:06:14.169> pressure<00:06:14.530> in

you're feeding that much air pressure in

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.670 
you're feeding that much air pressure in
there<00:06:15.009> and<00:06:15.509> these<00:06:16.509> are<00:06:16.659> just<00:06:16.780> wide<00:06:17.020> open<00:06:17.409> it's

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.800 
there and these are just wide open it's
going<00:06:17.889> to<00:06:17.949> be<00:06:18.039> more<00:06:18.280> prone<00:06:18.580> to<00:06:18.639> spin<00:06:19.180> but<00:06:19.690> if

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
going to be more prone to spin but if

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.230 
going to be more prone to spin but if
it's<00:06:19.960> under<00:06:20.259> compression<00:06:20.760> it's<00:06:21.760> not<00:06:22.000> going<00:06:22.150> to

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
it's under compression it's not going to

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.790 
it's under compression it's not going to
spin<00:06:22.539> it's<00:06:22.840> it's<00:06:23.200> kind<00:06:23.409> of<00:06:23.440> like<00:06:23.620> adding

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
spin it's it's kind of like adding

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.640 
spin it's it's kind of like adding
weights<00:06:24.219> to<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.700> Pistons

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
weights to the Pistons

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.290 
weights to the Pistons
it<00:06:25.740> keeps<00:06:26.009> them<00:06:26.130> down<00:06:26.400> keeps<00:06:26.880> them<00:06:27.060> in<00:06:27.180> their

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
it keeps them down keeps them in their

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.330 
it keeps them down keeps them in their
place<00:06:27.780> well<00:06:28.110> guys<00:06:28.290> I<00:06:28.320> hope<00:06:28.650> you<00:06:28.830> enjoyed<00:06:29.160> this
