00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
we're were we've built quite a few of

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.440 
we're were we've built quite a few of
them<00:00:38.730> at<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.059> point

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
them at this point

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.930 
them at this point
now<00:00:39.840> when<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.170> talk<00:00:40.379> about<00:00:40.579> what<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.760> is

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
now when you talk about what all is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.209 
now when you talk about what all is
involved<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.930> customer<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.829> gets

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219

involved for a customer that gets
delivery<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.180> these<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.840> get<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> fly

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
delivery of one of these to get it fly

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.170 
delivery of one of these to get it fly
well<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.620> build<00:00:46.860> them<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.370> deliver<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
well we build them and we deliver the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.510 
well we build them and we deliver the
kit<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.600> segments<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.469> there's<00:00:49.680> four<00:00:49.980> separate

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
kit in segments so there's four separate

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.110 
kit in segments so there's four separate
shipments<00:00:51.120> involved<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> kit<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
shipments involved with with the kit and

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.080 
shipments involved with with the kit and
and<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.300> sent<00:00:54.570> out<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.899> sort<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.350> logical

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
and it sent out in sort of a logical

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.549 
and it sent out in sort of a logical
assembly<00:00:57.090> fashion<00:00:57.719> meaning<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.289> all<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
assembly fashion meaning you get all the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.279 
assembly fashion meaning you get all the
parts<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.370> logical<00:00:59.820> order<00:01:00.050> it's<00:01:01.050> about<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
parts in a logical order it's about a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.529 
parts in a logical order it's about a
four<00:01:01.590> hundred<00:01:01.739> hour<00:01:02.070> construction<00:01:03.059> project

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
four hundred hour construction project

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.539 
four hundred hour construction project
so<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.780> fairly<00:01:04.229> fairly<00:01:04.799> straightforward

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
so it's fairly fairly straightforward

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.010 
so it's fairly fairly straightforward
and<00:01:05.610> all<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> instructions<00:01:06.479> are<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.720> video

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and all the instructions are in video

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.160 
and all the instructions are in video
format<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> we're<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.210> asking<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.780> sort

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
format so we're not asking you to sort

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.580 
format so we're not asking you to sort
through<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.439> bunch<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.740> drawings<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:13.049> customer

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
through a bunch of drawings the customer

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.609 
through a bunch of drawings the customer
watches<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.880> construction<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> video<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
watches the construction on a video and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
watches the construction on a video and
it<00:01:16.680> shows<00:01:16.950> them<00:01:17.189> how<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.700> each<00:01:17.939> phase<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
it shows them how to do each phase of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.890 
it shows them how to do each phase of
the<00:01:18.479> construction<00:01:19.310> how<00:01:20.310> much<00:01:20.970> area<00:01:21.509> would

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the construction how much area would

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.719 
the construction how much area would
somebody<00:01:22.170> need<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> take<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> project<00:01:23.400> like

complete in that respect there are some
parts<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.049> fabricate<00:02:07.649> so

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
parts that you have to fabricate so

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.630 
parts that you have to fabricate so
maybe<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.160> bandsaw<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
maybe a bandsaw and

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.790 
maybe a bandsaw and
grinder<00:02:10.360> or<00:02:10.479> something<00:02:10.539> like<00:02:10.930> that<00:02:11.140> but<00:02:11.350> it's

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
grinder or something like that but it's

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.670 
grinder or something like that but it's
fairly<00:02:12.370> straightforward

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
fairly straightforward

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.200 
fairly straightforward
is<00:02:14.680> there<00:02:14.830> any<00:02:14.980> fiberglassing<00:02:15.640> or<00:02:16.060> any

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
is there any fiberglassing or any

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.030 
is there any fiberglassing or any
construction<00:02:16.900> has<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.200> do<00:02:17.320> on<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.500> colouring

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
construction has to do on the colouring

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.860 
construction has to do on the colouring
there's<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.700> little<00:02:18.970> bit<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.210> cutting<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:19.720> then

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
there's a little bit of cutting but then

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.210 
there's a little bit of cutting but then
you<00:02:20.020> don't<00:02:20.110> have<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.440> actually<00:02:20.680> do<00:02:21.040> any

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
you don't have to actually do any

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.010 
you don't have to actually do any
fiberglass<00:02:21.820> work<00:02:22.060> we<00:02:22.240> have<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> fiberglass

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
fiberglass work we have a fiberglass

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.580 
fiberglass work we have a fiberglass
cabin<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.060> have<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.360> cut<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.840> fit<00:02:26.290> and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
cabin that you have to cut and fit and

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.830 
cabin that you have to cut and fit and
you<00:02:26.860> know<00:02:26.950> do<00:02:27.130> some<00:02:27.340> things<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.390> respect

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
you know do some things in that respect

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.570 
you know do some things in that respect
but<00:02:28.960> you<00:02:29.020> don't<00:02:29.230> actually<00:02:29.440> have<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.920> create

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
but you don't actually have to create

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.100 
but you don't actually have to create

the<00:02:49.300> gearbox<00:02:49.750> down<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.320> made<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.590> much

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
the gearbox down and made it much

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.550 
the gearbox down and made it much
lighter<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:52.060> then<00:02:52.660> we<00:02:52.780> take<00:02:52.959> that<00:02:53.170> engine<00:02:53.470> and

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
lighter and then we take that engine and

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.100 
lighter and then we take that engine and
dr8<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.550> about<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.390> hundred<00:02:55.600> horsepower

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
dr8 it to about a hundred horsepower

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.250 
dr8 it to about a hundred horsepower
which<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:57.180> just<00:02:58.180> about<00:02:58.390> perfect<00:02:58.690> for<00:02:58.989> this

per<00:03:29.200> hour<00:03:29.320> now<00:03:30.220> we<00:03:30.340> talked<00:03:30.489> a<00:03:30.519> little<00:03:30.730> bit

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
per hour now we talked a little bit

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.490 
per hour now we talked a little bit
about<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.420> engine<00:03:31.810> but<00:03:32.080> there's<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.350> reduction

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
about the engine but there's a reduction

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.530 
about the engine but there's a reduction
drivers<00:03:33.100> 1/4<00:03:33.610> is<00:03:33.760> involved<00:03:34.120> in<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.269> as<00:03:34.510> well

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
drivers 1/4 is involved in that as well

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.900 
drivers 1/4 is involved in that as well
they're<00:03:34.930> not<00:03:35.049> yeah<00:03:35.380> yeah<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:36.100> that's<00:03:36.549> what

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
they're not yeah yeah and that's what

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.479 
they're not yeah yeah and that's what
and<00:03:37.360> this<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:37.780> our<00:03:37.930> gearbox<00:03:38.200> here<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:39.280> engine

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
and this is our gearbox here the engine

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.670 
and this is our gearbox here the engine
the<00:03:39.970> engine<00:03:40.090> operates<00:03:40.690> normally<00:03:40.900> at<00:03:41.230> 62

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
the engine operates normally at 62

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.940 
the engine operates normally at 62
thousand<00:03:42.190> rpms<00:03:42.640> so<00:03:43.000> we<00:03:43.570> have<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.890> there's<00:03:44.890> a

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
thousand rpms so we have a there's a

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.340 
thousand rpms so we have a there's a
planetary<00:03:45.549> reduction<00:03:46.150> inside<00:03:46.510> here<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:47.110> then

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
planetary reduction inside here and then

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.670 
planetary reduction inside here and then
a<00:03:47.519> two-to-one<00:03:48.519> reduction<00:03:49.150> so<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.450> ultimate

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
a two-to-one reduction so the ultimate

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.199 
a two-to-one reduction so the ultimate
output<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:51.239> is<00:03:52.239> 3,000<00:03:52.989> rpms<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.850> this<00:03:55.030> is

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
output is is 3,000 rpms and and this is

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.910 
output is is 3,000 rpms and and this is
our<00:03:55.360> own<00:03:55.510> design<00:03:55.959> here<00:03:56.230> we<00:03:56.380> built<00:03:56.650> and

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
our own design here we built and

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.800 
our own design here we built and
designed<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.640> patterns<00:03:58.060> for<00:03:58.420> this<00:03:58.510> gearbox

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
designed the patterns for this gearbox

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.710 
designed the patterns for this gearbox
we<00:03:59.380> have<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.739> the<00:04:00.280> castings<00:04:00.760> done<00:04:01.000> at<00:04:01.480> a

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
we have the the castings done at a

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.479 
we have the the castings done at a
casting<00:04:02.260> house<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.620> then<00:04:02.709> we<00:04:02.860> do<00:04:02.980> all<00:04:03.190> of<00:04:03.220> the

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
casting house and then we do all of the

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.819 
casting house and then we do all of the
finished<00:04:03.790> machining<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.420> fit<00:04:04.630> up<00:04:04.829> in-house

we're coming though with our cover yeah

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.550 
we're coming though with our cover yeah
that<00:05:10.910> we<00:05:11.060> build<00:05:11.300> all<00:05:11.480> these<00:05:11.630> rotors<00:05:12.110> it's<00:05:12.380> a

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
that we build all these rotors it's a

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.310 
that we build all these rotors it's a
it's<00:05:12.830> a<00:05:12.920> standard<00:05:13.430> two<00:05:13.640> blade<00:05:13.940> rotor<00:05:14.780> system

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
it's a standard two blade rotor system

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.750 
it's a standard two blade rotor system
but<00:05:16.280> it's<00:05:16.430> got<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.640> lot<00:05:16.910> of<00:05:16.940> it's<00:05:17.690> a<00:05:17.810> solid

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
but it's got a lot of it's a solid

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.490 
but it's got a lot of it's a solid
leading<00:05:19.760> edge<00:05:19.940> spar<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.840> a<00:05:21.020> bonded<00:05:21.410> and

riveted skin so it's got a lot of it's a

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.020 
riveted skin so it's got a lot of it's a
fairly<00:05:24.140> heavy<00:05:24.350> blade<00:05:24.740> and<00:05:25.070> it's<00:05:25.640> got<00:05:25.790> a<00:05:25.820> lot<00:05:26.000> of

fairly heavy blade and it's got a lot of
the<00:05:26.240> rotor<00:05:26.510> inertia<00:05:26.870> so<00:05:27.260> it<00:05:27.410> does<00:05:28.190> good<00:05:28.400> for

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
the rotor inertia so it does good for

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.070 
the rotor inertia so it does good for
auto<00:05:28.790> rotations

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080
