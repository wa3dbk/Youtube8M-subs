hi<00:00:10.170> everyone<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.710> Ronnie<00:00:10.889> goo<00:00:11.040> boo<00:00:11.160> and

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
hi everyone this is Ronnie goo boo and

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.799 
hi everyone this is Ronnie goo boo and
today<00:00:11.700> we're<00:00:11.850> gonna<00:00:11.910> do<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> little<00:00:12.510> bit<00:00:12.719> of

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
today we're gonna do a little bit of

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.000 
today we're gonna do a little bit of
testing<00:00:13.709> with<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.309> proximity<00:00:14.670> detector<00:00:16.010> so

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
testing with the proximity detector so

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.880 
testing with the proximity detector so
in<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.910> original<00:00:18.270> design<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:19.020> need<00:00:19.200> four

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
in the original design you need four

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.550 
in the original design you need four
blocks<00:00:20.340> from<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.270> center<00:00:21.570> that's<00:00:21.870> one<00:00:22.170> two

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
blocks from the center that's one two

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.310 
blocks from the center that's one two
three<00:00:22.590> four<00:00:23.450> before<00:00:24.450> the<00:00:24.540> pressure<00:00:24.750> plate<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
three four before the pressure plate and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.350 
three four before the pressure plate and
this<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.650> little<00:00:26.040> bit<00:00:26.250> bulky<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.850> little<00:00:27.270> bit

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
this is a little bit bulky a little bit

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.930 
this is a little bit bulky a little bit
bulkier<00:00:27.750> than<00:00:27.780> I'd<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.020> it<00:00:28.440> to<00:00:28.560> be<00:00:28.760> and<00:00:29.760> it

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
bulkier than I'd like it to be and it

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.400 
bulkier than I'd like it to be and it
also<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.800> optimized<00:00:31.800> by<00:00:32.070> using<00:00:32.279> ocelots<00:00:33.379> so<00:00:34.379> I

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
also is optimized by using ocelots so I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.260 
also is optimized by using ocelots so I
wanted<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> little<00:00:35.280> bit<00:00:35.370> testing<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.059> see

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
wanted to do a little bit testing to see

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.510 
wanted to do a little bit testing to see
if<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.600> could<00:00:36.750> go<00:00:36.930> under<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.410> first<00:00:37.740> of<00:00:37.890> all<00:00:38.010> it

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
if you could go under it first of all it

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.950 
if you could go under it first of all it
turns<00:00:38.760> out<00:00:38.970> you<00:00:39.060> can<00:00:39.240> and<00:00:39.420> I've<00:00:39.540> come<00:00:39.720> up<00:00:39.840> with

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
turns out you can and I've come up with

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.170 
turns out you can and I've come up with
some<00:00:40.140> designs<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.310> also<00:00:41.520> wanted<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.060> know

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
some designs and I also wanted to know

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.620 
some designs and I also wanted to know
if<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.420> could<00:00:42.570> make<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.970> proximity<00:00:44.970> detector

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
if you could make a proximity detector

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.830 
if you could make a proximity detector
behind<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.290> wall<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:47.070> would<00:00:47.190> work<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.660> did

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
behind a wall that would work and I did

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.110 
behind a wall that would work and I did
and<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.260> turns<00:00:49.560> out<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.800> there<00:00:50.220> are<00:00:50.399> some

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and it turns out that there are some

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.389 
and it turns out that there are some
several<00:00:52.050> designs<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.770> work<00:00:52.950> pretty<00:00:53.130> well

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
several designs that work pretty well

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.550 
several designs that work pretty well
and<00:00:54.360> I'll<00:00:54.480> show<00:00:54.630> you<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.780> couple<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.140> them<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
and I'll show you a couple of them and

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.590 
and I'll show you a couple of them and
it<00:00:56.220> turns<00:00:56.399> out<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.790> wall<00:00:57.030> detector

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
it turns out that the wall detector

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.979 
it turns out that the wall detector
works<00:00:57.780> pretty<00:00:58.110> well<00:00:58.380> also<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.180> if<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.510> raise

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
works pretty well also and if you raise

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.410 
works pretty well also and if you raise
the<00:01:01.020> fence<00:01:01.620> post<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.700> make<00:01:02.880> it<00:01:03.000> smaller

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the fence post you can make it smaller

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.080 
the fence post you can make it smaller
and<00:01:03.719> more<00:01:04.500> effective<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.670> did<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> little

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
and more effective and I did a little

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.780 
and more effective and I did a little
bit<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.329> statistical<00:01:07.170> analysis<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.979> show<00:01:08.549> you

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
bit of statistical analysis to show you

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.990 
bit of statistical analysis to show you
who<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.090> some<00:01:09.120> bar<00:01:09.479> graphs<00:01:09.780> how<00:01:10.200> effective

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
who with some bar graphs how effective

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.260 
who with some bar graphs how effective
based<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.180> normal<00:01:12.960> running<00:01:13.170> bias<00:01:13.650> sneaking

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
based on normal running bias sneaking

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.350 
based on normal running bias sneaking
sprinting<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.479> using<00:01:16.080> invisibility<00:01:16.530> potions

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
sprinting and using invisibility potions

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.710 
sprinting and using invisibility potions
so<00:01:18.360> let's<00:01:18.750> go<00:01:18.900> back<00:01:19.049> over<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.420> first

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
so let's go back over here so the first

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.810 
so let's go back over here so the first
is<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> fence<00:01:22.710> posts<00:01:23.159> four<00:01:23.490> blocks

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
is with the fence posts four blocks

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.460 
is with the fence posts four blocks
above<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> ground<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.930> we're<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.260> going<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
above the ground and we're just going to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
above the ground and we're just going to
run<00:01:25.680> under<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.530> three

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
run under it and this is with three

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.160 
run under it and this is with three
oscillates<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.510> see<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:30.930> already

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
oscillates and you see it's already

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.850 
oscillates and you see it's already
triggered<00:01:31.740> several<00:01:31.979> times<00:01:33.290> this<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.530> five

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
triggered several times this is five

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.130 
triggered several times this is five
above<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.520> one<00:01:35.790> ocelot<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.780> already

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
above with one ocelot and it's already

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.960 
above with one ocelot and it's already
triggered<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.950> triggering<00:01:38.369> again<00:01:38.670> now

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
triggered and it's triggering again now

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.030 
triggered and it's triggering again now
this<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> pretty<00:01:39.600> good<00:01:39.840> system<00:01:40.350> using<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.890> in

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
this is a pretty good system using it in

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740 
this is a pretty good system using it in
the<00:01:41.189> ceiling<00:01:41.520> turns<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.630> very

the ceiling turns out to be very

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.460 
the ceiling turns out to be very
effective<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.220> five<00:01:44.970> above<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.260> means

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
effective this is five above that means

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.580 
effective this is five above that means

it takes three ocelots that's pretty

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.560 
it takes three ocelots that's pretty
effective<00:01:51.990> also<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:56.369> last<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.970> six<00:01:57.270> above

with three ocelots and it triggers but

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.069 
with three ocelots and it triggers but
it<00:02:02.520> took<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> little<00:02:02.850> bit<00:02:03.030> longer<00:02:03.090> no<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:03.750> didn't

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
it took a little bit longer no I didn't

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.340 
it took a little bit longer no I didn't
do<00:02:04.170> actual<00:02:04.560> statistics<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.340> these<00:02:06.350> ceiling

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
do actual statistics on these ceiling

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.410 
do actual statistics on these ceiling
platforms<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.610> wanted<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.000> test<00:02:09.209> and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
platforms but I just wanted to test and

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.140 
platforms but I just wanted to test and
see<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.629> they'd<00:02:09.780> work<00:02:10.250> also<00:02:11.250> there's<00:02:11.430> not<00:02:11.879> no

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
see if they'd work also there's not no

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.370 
see if they'd work also there's not no
block<00:02:12.390> here<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:12.780> if<00:02:12.870> they<00:02:12.959> have<00:02:13.110> one<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.290> those

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
block here so if they have one of those

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.270 
block here so if they have one of those
pressure<00:02:13.650> plates<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.099> didn't<00:02:14.280> go<00:02:14.400> off

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
pressure plates it didn't go off

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.950 
pressure plates it didn't go off
let's<00:02:16.000> check<00:02:16.600> out<00:02:17.730> these<00:02:18.730> over<00:02:19.240> here<00:02:19.510> now<00:02:19.780> if

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
let's check out these over here now if

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.480 
let's check out these over here now if
you<00:02:20.080> have<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.410> flush<00:02:20.620> with<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.890> ground<00:02:21.130> that

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
you have it flush with the ground that

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.670 
you have it flush with the ground that
fencepost<00:02:22.030> flush<00:02:22.300> with<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.570> ground<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:23.500> have

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
fencepost flush with the ground you have

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.620 
fencepost flush with the ground you have
to<00:02:23.830> go<00:02:23.980> four<00:02:24.460> blocks<00:02:24.700> away<00:02:24.910> before<00:02:25.210> you<00:02:25.510> can

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
to go four blocks away before you can

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.780 
to go four blocks away before you can
put<00:02:25.840> your<00:02:25.990> pressure<00:02:26.380> plates<00:02:26.740> which<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.550> kind

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
put your pressure plates which is kind

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.760 
put your pressure plates which is kind
of<00:02:27.880> far<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.540> makes<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.960> a<00:02:29.020> little<00:02:29.230> bit<00:02:29.380> bulky

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
of far this makes it a little bit bulky

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.830 
of far this makes it a little bit bulky
and<00:02:29.980> it's<00:02:30.610> gonna<00:02:30.760> be<00:02:30.970> tough<00:02:31.210> to<00:02:31.390> hide<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.690> in

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
and it's gonna be tough to hide that in

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.120 
and it's gonna be tough to hide that in
a<00:02:31.900> wall<00:02:32.050> because<00:02:32.320> you<00:02:32.410> have<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.620> have<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:32.770> pretty

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
a wall because you have to have a pretty

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.170 
a wall because you have to have a pretty
deep<00:02:33.840> wall<00:02:34.840> behind<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.580> now<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.670> higher<00:02:36.910> you

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
deep wall behind it now the higher you

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.680 
deep wall behind it now the higher you
lift<00:02:37.210> your<00:02:37.630> fence<00:02:37.930> gate<00:02:38.200> your<00:02:38.680> fence<00:02:38.950> post<00:02:39.690> the

lift your fence gate your fence post the

closer you can get unless you want to

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.510 
closer you can get unless you want to

have more than one Ocelot if you have

more than one one Ocelot you have to

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.140 
more than one one Ocelot you have to
back<00:02:47.860> up<00:02:48.040> those<00:02:48.220> pressure<00:02:48.459> plates<00:02:48.760> just<00:02:49.060> a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
back up those pressure plates just a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.590 
back up those pressure plates just a
little<00:02:49.360> bit<00:02:49.480> now<00:02:50.050> these<00:02:50.500> over<00:02:51.040> here<00:02:51.430> are<00:02:52.360> all

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
little bit now these over here are all

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.290 
little bit now these over here are all
some<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.740> most<00:02:53.950> effective<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.730> I'll<00:02:55.120> tell

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
some of the most effective and I'll tell

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.570 
some of the most effective and I'll tell
you<00:02:55.390> exactly<00:02:56.140> how<00:02:56.410> effective<00:02:56.560> they<00:02:56.980> are<00:02:57.010> with

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
you exactly how effective they are with

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.100 
you exactly how effective they are with
some<00:02:57.760> statistics<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.510> did<00:02:58.750> just<00:02:58.930> by

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
some statistics that I did just by

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.160 
some statistics that I did just by
testing<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.550> for<00:03:00.760> normal<00:03:00.940> all<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.390> did<00:03:01.690> was<00:03:01.900> I'd

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
testing so for normal all I did was I'd

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.030 
testing so for normal all I did was I'd
start<00:03:02.770> here<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.730> I'd<00:03:04.420> walk<00:03:04.630> by<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.200> if<00:03:05.890> it

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
start here and I'd walk by and if it

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.590 
start here and I'd walk by and if it
triggered<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.459> pressure<00:03:06.730> plates<00:03:07.030> I'd<00:03:07.240> count

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
triggered the pressure plates I'd count

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.900 
triggered the pressure plates I'd count
it<00:03:07.720> as<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:08.050> yes<00:03:08.440> if<00:03:08.740> it<00:03:09.220> didn't<00:03:09.550> trigger<00:03:09.730> the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
it as a yes if it didn't trigger the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.610 
it as a yes if it didn't trigger the
pressure<00:03:10.150> plates<00:03:10.450> by<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.750> time<00:03:10.959> I<00:03:10.990> left<00:03:11.230> then

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
pressure plates by the time I left then

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.460 
pressure plates by the time I left then
I'd<00:03:11.770> count<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.160> doesn't<00:03:12.459> know<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:14.140> let's<00:03:14.320> see

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
I'd count it doesn't know so let's see

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.410 
I'd count it doesn't know so let's see
how<00:03:14.620> effective<00:03:14.890> this<00:03:15.330> last<00:03:16.330> one<00:03:16.600> is<00:03:16.750> down<00:03:17.050> here

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
how effective this last one is down here

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.840 
how effective this last one is down here
so<00:03:19.420> just<00:03:19.810> by<00:03:19.959> walking<00:03:20.230> by<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.709> there<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:21.640> a

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
so just by walking by it there is a

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.900 
so just by walking by it there is a
relatively<00:03:22.750> low<00:03:23.290> chance<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:23.950> triggering

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
relatively low chance of triggering

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.820 
relatively low chance of triggering
those<00:03:25.150> pressure<00:03:25.480> plates<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.290> dinner<00:03:26.650> right

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
those pressure plates and dinner right

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.470 
those pressure plates and dinner right
now<00:03:26.890> but<00:03:27.310> -<00:03:27.880> out<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:28.840> six<00:03:29.260> times<00:03:29.580> was<00:03:30.580> how<00:03:31.090> often

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
now but - out of six times was how often

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.979 
now but - out of six times was how often
it<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:34.030> only<00:03:34.239> triggered<00:03:34.540> those<00:03:34.660> pressure

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
it and it only triggered those pressure

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.840 
it and it only triggered those pressure
plates<00:03:35.320> -<00:03:35.620> out<00:03:35.800> of<00:03:35.920> six<00:03:36.190> times<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.730> other

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
plates - out of six times and the other

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.870 
plates - out of six times and the other
four<00:03:37.180> out<00:03:37.360> of<00:03:37.390> six<00:03:37.690> were<00:03:38.680> were<00:03:39.130> know<00:03:39.340> goes<00:03:39.550> they

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
four out of six were were know goes they

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.600 
four out of six were were know goes they
didn't<00:03:40.209> trigger<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.630> mechanism<00:03:41.400> which<00:03:42.400> is

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
didn't trigger that mechanism which is

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.300 
didn't trigger that mechanism which is
not<00:03:42.850> very<00:03:43.060> effective<00:03:43.300> when<00:03:44.200> sneaking<00:03:44.830> by<00:03:45.010> we

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
not very effective when sneaking by we

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.009 
not very effective when sneaking by we
got<00:03:45.459> four<00:03:45.760> out<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.180> six<00:03:46.360> which<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:46.810> pretty

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
got four out of the six which is pretty

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.440 
got four out of the six which is pretty
good<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.500> when<00:03:48.100> sprinting<00:03:48.549> by<00:03:48.910> we<00:03:49.150> only<00:03:49.180> got

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
good and when sprinting by we only got

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.960 
good and when sprinting by we only got
one<00:03:49.510> out<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:49.989> six<00:03:50.410> while<00:03:51.010> invisible<00:03:51.310> sneaking

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
one out of six while invisible sneaking

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.960 
one out of six while invisible sneaking
by<00:03:52.090> it's<00:03:52.420> pretty<00:03:52.660> well<00:03:52.810> so<00:03:53.350> these<00:03:54.100> orange<00:03:54.700> will

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
by it's pretty well so these orange will

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.259 
by it's pretty well so these orange will
delineate<00:03:55.530> invisibility<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:58.000> that's<00:03:58.150> how

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
delineate invisibility and that's how

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.670 
delineate invisibility and that's how
effective<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:58.810> is<00:03:58.930> when<00:03:59.170> you're<00:03:59.320> sneaking

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
effective it is when you're sneaking

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.620

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
those pressure plates so invisibility

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.240 
those pressure plates so invisibility
doesn't<00:04:24.460> really<00:04:24.580> affect<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:26.260> type<00:04:27.070> of

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
doesn't really affect it and the type of

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.820 
doesn't really affect it and the type of

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
block that's in between you doesn't

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.060 
block that's in between you doesn't
effective<00:04:29.750> but<00:04:30.750> what<00:04:30.960> does<00:04:31.170> effect<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:31.920> is<00:04:32.010> the

effective but what does effect it is the

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.880 
effective but what does effect it is the
time<00:04:32.550> exposure<00:04:33.150> so<00:04:33.780> if<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:33.990> walk<00:04:34.200> by<00:04:34.230> normally

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
time exposure so if you walk by normally

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.790 
time exposure so if you walk by normally

and sprinting one out of six let's go to

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.610 
and sprinting one out of six let's go to
the<00:04:42.240> next<00:04:42.390> design<00:04:42.780> it's<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.050> little<00:04:43.290> bit<00:04:43.380> higher

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
the next design it's a little bit higher

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.090 
the next design it's a little bit higher
this<00:04:44.780> Ocelot<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:45.900> kept<00:04:46.290> closer<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.920> wall

this Ocelot is kept closer to the wall

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.580 
this Ocelot is kept closer to the wall
more<00:04:47.490> often<00:04:48.000> because<00:04:48.480> that<00:04:48.840> fence<00:04:49.050> post<00:04:49.140> keeps

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
more often because that fence post keeps

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.010 
more often because that fence post keeps
them<00:04:49.710> closer<00:04:50.060> which<00:04:51.060> brings<00:04:51.330> this<00:04:51.540> to<00:04:51.750> four

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
them closer which brings this to four

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.750 
them closer which brings this to four

out of six which is significantly better
I<00:04:54.030> know<00:04:54.240> it's<00:04:54.510> not<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:55.080> very<00:04:55.470> big<00:04:55.790> number<00:04:56.790> of

I know it's not a very big number of

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.020 
I know it's not a very big number of
repetitions<00:04:57.510> but<00:04:58.190> take<00:04:59.190> me<00:04:59.310> along<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.700> us<00:04:59.760> and

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
repetitions but take me along to us and

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.930 
repetitions but take me along to us and
it's<00:05:00.660> it's<00:05:01.020> still<00:05:01.290> an<00:05:01.470> effective<00:05:01.560> test<00:05:02.100> so

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
it's it's still an effective test so

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.360 
it's it's still an effective test so

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
of six for a sprint this one's better

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.810

this four above the ground you can bring
those<00:05:24.660> pressure<00:05:24.960> plates<00:05:25.260> in<00:05:25.380> a<00:05:25.500> little<00:05:25.740> bit

those pressure plates in a little bit

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.650 
those pressure plates in a little bit
and<00:05:26.100> consolidate<00:05:26.820> that<00:05:26.850> a<00:05:27.030> little<00:05:27.330> bit<00:05:27.450> more

it<00:05:50.100> turns<00:05:50.340> out<00:05:50.490> to<00:05:50.610> be<00:05:50.730> pretty<00:05:50.910> effective<00:05:51.260> so

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
it turns out to be pretty effective so

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.250 
it turns out to be pretty effective so
four<00:05:52.560> out<00:05:52.680> of<00:05:52.710> six<00:05:52.980> with<00:05:53.190> a<00:05:53.220> normal<00:05:53.610> walk<00:05:54.260> every

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
four out of six with a normal walk every

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.110

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
single one six out of six for a sneak

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.480

every single one six out of six for a

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.200 
every single one six out of six for a
sprint<00:05:59.970> which<00:06:00.150> is<00:06:00.300> surprising<00:06:00.930> and<00:06:02.060> it<00:06:03.060> only

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
sprint which is surprising and it only

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.080 
sprint which is surprising and it only
uses<00:06:03.450> one<00:06:03.780> Ocelot<00:06:04.200> so<00:06:04.610> when<00:06:05.610> this<00:06:05.730> is<00:06:05.910> all<00:06:06.060> over

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
uses one Ocelot so when this is all over

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.600 
uses one Ocelot so when this is all over
I<00:06:06.480> think<00:06:07.050> this<00:06:07.560> is<00:06:07.740> going<00:06:07.890> to<00:06:08.010> be<00:06:08.190> the<00:06:08.370> most

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
I think this is going to be the most

I think this is going to be the most

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.940 
Sprint and the last we have six high
which<00:06:48.100> turned<00:06:48.550> out<00:06:48.640> to<00:06:48.700> be<00:06:48.910> just<00:06:49.060> a<00:06:49.150> little<00:06:49.270> bit

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
which turned out to be just a little bit

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.350 
which turned out to be just a little bit
less<00:06:50.950> effective<00:06:51.520> it<00:06:51.670> it<00:06:51.820> still<00:06:52.000> got<00:06:52.150> four

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
less effective it it still got four

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.200 
less effective it it still got four
normal<00:06:52.600> and<00:06:52.900> it<00:06:52.990> still<00:06:53.200> got<00:06:53.460> all<00:06:54.460> six<00:06:54.790> of<00:06:54.970> the

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
normal and it still got all six of the

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.080 
normal and it still got all six of the
sneak<00:06:55.540> but<00:06:56.140> it<00:06:56.260> only<00:06:56.380> got<00:06:56.680> half<00:06:56.980> of<00:06:57.370> the<00:06:57.730> sprint

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
sneak but it only got half of the sprint

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.180 
sneak but it only got half of the sprint
so<00:06:58.510> it<00:06:58.690> turns<00:06:58.900> out<00:06:59.020> this<00:06:59.320> one<00:06:59.530> is<00:06:59.740> the<00:07:00.040> best

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
so it turns out this one is the best

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:06.450 
so it turns out this one is the best
overall<00:07:01.590> five<00:07:02.590> high<00:07:03.150> one<00:07:04.150> ocelot<00:07:04.570> and<00:07:05.460> seven

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.180 
completely ineffective actually I
suppose<00:07:10.870> you<00:07:11.260> could<00:07:11.380> put<00:07:11.410> a<00:07:11.620> pressure<00:07:11.920> plate

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.190 
suppose you could put a pressure plate

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.370 
suppose you could put a pressure plate
here<00:07:15.090> and<00:07:16.090> it<00:07:16.210> could<00:07:16.390> be<00:07:16.510> a<00:07:16.540> really<00:07:16.870> funny<00:07:17.140> way

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.380 
here and it could be a really funny way

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.440 
here and it could be a really funny way
to<00:07:17.410> get<00:07:17.740> a<00:07:17.770> a<00:07:18.900> continuous<00:07:19.900> bounce<00:07:21.180> if<00:07:22.180> that's

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.450 
to get a a continuous bounce if that's

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.790 
to get a a continuous bounce if that's
what<00:07:22.630> you're<00:07:22.750> looking<00:07:22.780> for<00:07:23.260> if<00:07:23.530> you're

what you're looking for if you're

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.630 
what you're looking for if you're

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:27.640 
looking for us a continuous pulse that

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.500 
looking for us a continuous pulse that

doesn't run off of redstone but that got

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.730 
doesn't run off of redstone but that got
annoying<00:07:31.780> so<00:07:32.050> I've<00:07:32.140> deleted<00:07:32.320> the<00:07:32.530> pressure

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.740 
annoying so I've deleted the pressure

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.180 
annoying so I've deleted the pressure
plate<00:07:33.780> so<00:07:34.780> there<00:07:35.080> we<00:07:35.200> have<00:07:35.380> it<00:07:35.410> we<00:07:35.830> have<00:07:35.860> some

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.190 
plate so there we have it we have some

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.850 
plate so there we have it we have some
cool<00:07:36.370> tests<00:07:37.050> pretty<00:07:38.050> soon<00:07:38.290> I<00:07:38.470> will<00:07:38.590> show<00:07:38.770> you
