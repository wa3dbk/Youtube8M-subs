00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hello welcome to part two of my energy

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.070 
hello welcome to part two of my energy
ex<00:00:02.310> settings<00:00:02.730> video<00:00:03.030> in<00:00:03.270> this<00:00:03.389> video<00:00:03.570> I'll<00:00:04.020> be

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
ex settings video in this video I'll be

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.950 
ex settings video in this video I'll be
going<00:00:04.230> over<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.950> option<00:00:05.879> settings<00:00:06.450> for<00:00:06.899> the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
going over the option settings for the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.230 
going over the option settings for the
aircraft<00:00:07.109> which<00:00:07.500> can<00:00:07.710> be<00:00:07.799> very<00:00:07.980> useful<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.580> set

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
aircraft which can be very useful to set

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.009 
aircraft which can be very useful to set
up<00:00:09.420> your<00:00:09.599> aircraft<00:00:10.080> correctly<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:11.250> ROI<00:00:12.019> so

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
up your aircraft correctly and ROI so

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.810 
up your aircraft correctly and ROI so
now<00:00:13.410> let's<00:00:13.769> go<00:00:13.920> into<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> options<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.700> this

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
now let's go into the options and this

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.420 
now let's go into the options and this
is<00:00:14.940> another<00:00:15.179> really<00:00:15.960> interesting<00:00:16.139> part<00:00:16.859> of

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
is another really interesting part of

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.810 
is another really interesting part of
what<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.270> can<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.630> service<00:00:19.560> base<00:00:19.830> failures<00:00:20.490> I

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
what you can do service base failures I

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.529 
what you can do service base failures I
have<00:00:21.570> off<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.340> turn<00:00:23.640> them<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.000> though<00:00:24.300> so

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
have off you can turn them on though so

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.580 
have off you can turn them on though so
the<00:00:26.510> failures<00:00:27.920> small<00:00:28.920> failures<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.789> believe

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
the failures small failures I believe

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.190 
the failures small failures I believe
occur<00:00:31.590> when<00:00:32.489> you're<00:00:32.669> flying<00:00:33.030> at<00:00:33.450> very<00:00:33.989> low

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
occur when you're flying at very low

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.340 
occur when you're flying at very low
percent<00:00:35.070> rate<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.430> think<00:00:35.790> that's<00:00:35.969> what<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.170> is

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
percent rate I think that's what that is

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.709 
percent rate I think that's what that is
if<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.620> remember<00:00:38.010> right<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> had<00:00:38.550> some<00:00:38.760> people

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
if I remember right I had some people

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.299 
if I remember right I had some people
talking<00:00:39.930> about<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.129> off

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
talking about that I have that off

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.010 
talking about that I have that off
because<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:44.480> just<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.780> fly

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
because I just like to just just fly

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.720 
because I just like to just just fly
without<00:00:46.289> any<00:00:46.410> failures<00:00:47.010> knowing<00:00:47.309> battle<00:00:47.579> gets

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
without any failures knowing battle gets

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.549 
without any failures knowing battle gets
my<00:00:47.910> destination<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.629> fly<00:00:48.840> sing<00:00:49.079> right<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.410> if

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
my destination and fly sing right so if

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.369 
my destination and fly sing right so if
I'm<00:00:49.680> making<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:50.070> youtube<00:00:50.430> video<00:00:51.110> pause<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
I'm making a youtube video pause at the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.810 
I'm making a youtube video pause at the
top<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.739> sent<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.160> could<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.430> used<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.760> if

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
top and sent this could be used so if

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.279 
top and sent this could be used so if
you're<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.120> long<00:00:54.360> flight<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
you're on a long flight in your in the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.080 
you're on a long flight in your in the
cruise<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.920> didn't<00:00:56.160> want<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.399> speed<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.670> up<00:00:56.910> so

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
cruise you didn't want to speed it up so

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.720 
cruise you didn't want to speed it up so
you<00:00:57.239> left<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> computer<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.410> flying<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
you left the computer going flying the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.819 
you left the computer going flying the
cruise<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.660> would<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.989> useful<00:01:01.170> feature<00:01:01.530> if

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
cruise this would be useful feature if

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.340 
cruise this would be useful feature if
you<00:01:02.010> were<00:01:02.129> downstairs<00:01:02.989> doing<00:01:03.989> something<00:01:04.229> else

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you were downstairs doing something else

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.210 
you were downstairs doing something else
you<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:05.100> away<00:01:05.760> from<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> PC<00:01:06.920> pause<00:01:07.920> at<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
you know away from the PC pause at the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.880 
you know away from the PC pause at the
top<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.520> descent<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.720> don't<00:01:09.960> over<00:01:10.740> run

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
top of descent so you don't over run

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.890 
top of descent so you don't over run
your<00:01:11.040> top<00:01:11.220> at<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> same<00:01:11.610> point<00:01:11.939> continue

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
your top at the same point continue

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.300 
your top at the same point continue
flying<00:01:13.170> until<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.470> run<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> fuel<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
flying until you run out of fuel and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.149 
flying until you run out of fuel and
then<00:01:14.400> glide<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.299> then<00:01:15.360> crash<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.040> would

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
then glide and then crash so that would

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.590 
then glide and then crash so that would
be<00:01:17.250> useful<00:01:17.909> feature<00:01:19.189> sink<00:01:20.189> captain<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.000> first

I<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.500> your<00:02:46.769> controls<00:02:47.280> must<00:02:47.640> be

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
I have on so your controls must be

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.390 
I have on so your controls must be
centered<00:02:48.269> when<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.569> engage<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.190> gauge<00:02:50.190> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
certain limits of where the flight

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.110 
certain limits of where the flight

director command bars I need to be

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.180 
director command bars I need to be
fairly<00:02:57.510> close<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.959> those<00:02:58.109> with<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.799> control

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
fairly close to those with the control

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.690 
fairly close to those with the control
centered<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:01.200> there's<00:03:01.530> no<00:03:01.799> really<00:03:02.220> jerking

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700

this<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.019> really<00:03:10.650> really<00:03:10.950> useful<00:03:11.459> feature

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
this is a really really useful feature

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.030 
this is a really really useful feature
because<00:03:12.930> obviously<00:03:13.319> when<00:03:13.650> you're<00:03:13.739> flying<00:03:13.920> a

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040

here<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.290> aircraft<00:03:19.739> now<00:03:20.699> when<00:03:20.970> you're

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
here in the aircraft now when you're

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.119 
here in the aircraft now when you're
flying<00:03:21.329> with<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.810> autothrottle<00:03:22.440> on<00:03:22.739> a<00:03:22.769> normal

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
flying with the autothrottle on a normal

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.500 
flying with the autothrottle on a normal
approach<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.849> you've<00:03:23.970> certainly<00:03:24.120> come<00:03:24.449> to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
approach and you've certainly come to

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.740 
approach and you've certainly come to
disengage<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.949> autothrottle<00:03:26.599> suddenly<00:03:27.599> your

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
disengage the autothrottle suddenly your

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.920 
disengage the autothrottle suddenly your
fund<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.199> thruster<00:03:28.620> changes<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.459> lot<00:03:30.030> if

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
fund the thruster changes a lot if

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.420 
fund the thruster changes a lot if
you're<00:03:31.560> if<00:03:32.250> your<00:03:32.489> own<00:03:32.669> Dratel<00:03:33.239> position<00:03:34.230> is

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
you're if your own Dratel position is

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.180 
you're if your own Dratel position is
vastly<00:03:35.430> different<00:03:35.519> from<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:37.190> aircraft

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
vastly different from the aircraft

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.650 
vastly different from the aircraft
social<00:03:38.519> position<00:03:38.879> that<00:03:39.060> can<00:03:39.209> be<00:03:39.269> kind<00:03:39.569> of

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
social position that can be kind of

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.509 
social position that can be kind of
putting<00:03:39.900> when<00:03:40.650> you're<00:03:40.769> close<00:03:40.949> to<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.220> runway

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
putting when you're close to the runway

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.970 
putting when you're close to the runway
so<00:03:42.120> basically<00:03:42.720> what<00:03:42.930> happens<00:03:43.199> is<00:03:43.319> blue<00:03:43.650> lines

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
so basically what happens is blue lines

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.729 
so basically what happens is blue lines
appear<00:03:44.430> based<00:03:45.329> on<00:03:45.629> where<00:03:45.900> your<00:03:46.079> own<00:03:46.260> throttle

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
appear based on where your own throttle

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.050 
appear based on where your own throttle
is<00:03:46.859> when<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:48.169> auto<00:03:49.169> throttle<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.919> engaged<00:03:50.310> so

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
is when the auto throttle is engaged so

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.150 
is when the auto throttle is engaged so
you<00:03:51.209> can<00:03:51.299> select<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.870> exact<00:03:52.379> throw<00:03:52.680> setting

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
you can select the exact throw setting

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.640 
you can select the exact throw setting
before<00:03:53.730> disengaging<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.750> auto<00:03:54.900> throttle<00:03:55.500> and

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
before disengaging the auto throttle and

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.869 
before disengaging the auto throttle and
it<00:03:55.739> provides<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.400> seamless<00:03:56.669> transition

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
it provides a seamless transition

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:03.289 
it provides a seamless transition
between<00:03:57.540> automatic<00:03:58.169> and<00:03:59.010> manual<00:03:59.060> flight<00:04:02.299> auto

calling v1 remember had the aircraft

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.689 
calling v1 remember had the aircraft
selected<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.539> call<00:04:44.169> out<00:04:44.319> v1<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.039> that's<00:04:45.460> why

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
selected to call out v1 so that's why

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.490 
selected to call out v1 so that's why
I'm<00:04:46.000> my<00:04:46.240> recent<00:04:46.660> take<00:04:46.840> off<00:04:46.990> some<00:04:47.139> I<00:04:47.229> have<00:04:47.319> seen

he goes v1 v1 rotate b2 because the

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.640 
he goes v1 v1 rotate b2 because the

aircraft and the first officer are
calling<00:04:54.039> out<00:04:54.160> v1<00:04:54.639> so<00:04:55.000> in<00:04:55.539> reality<00:04:56.349> if<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:56.500> have

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
calling out v1 so in reality if you have

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.920 
calling out v1 so in reality if you have
the<00:04:56.800> aircraft<00:04:56.949> selected<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.759> call<00:04:57.970> at<00:04:58.090> v1<00:04:58.270> you

the aircraft selected to call at v1 you

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.600 
the aircraft selected to call at v1 you
wouldn't<00:04:59.199> have<00:04:59.349> the<00:04:59.590> first<00:04:59.919> officer<00:05:00.400> calling

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
wouldn't have the first officer calling

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.089 
wouldn't have the first officer calling
at<00:05:00.849> me<00:05:01.000> one<00:05:01.180> they<00:05:01.330> wouldn't<00:05:01.539> do<00:05:01.630> that<00:05:01.979> first<00:05:02.979> of

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
at me one they wouldn't do that first of

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:04.529 
at me one they wouldn't do that first of
it's<00:05:03.280> a<00:05:03.340> call<00:05:03.490> that<00:05:03.610> rotate<00:05:04.030> that's<00:05:04.300> useful

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
it's a call that rotate that's useful

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.779 
it's a call that rotate that's useful
and<00:05:04.930> v2<00:05:06.150> tab<00:05:07.150> key<00:05:07.389> for<00:05:07.660> CDU<00:05:08.050> impact<00:05:08.410> CDU<00:05:09.340> input

even<00:05:10.180> this<00:05:10.599> is<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.930> most<00:05:11.380> useful<00:05:11.740> feature

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
even this is the most useful feature

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.469 
even this is the most useful feature
because<00:05:12.580> it<00:05:12.669> means<00:05:12.820> you<00:05:13.000> can<00:05:13.030> type<00:05:13.300> in

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
because it means you can type in

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.230 
because it means you can type in
anything<00:05:13.750> really<00:05:14.169> quickly<00:05:14.740> delete<00:05:15.430> it<00:05:15.729> using

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
anything really quickly delete it using

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.810 
anything really quickly delete it using
your<00:05:16.599> keyboard<00:05:16.900> so<00:05:17.550> hello

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
your keyboard so hello

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.339 
your keyboard so hello
and<00:05:19.240> then<00:05:19.360> just<00:05:19.509> delete<00:05:19.659> that<00:05:19.930> really<00:05:20.139> quickly

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
and then just delete that really quickly

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.740 
and then just delete that really quickly
like<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:21.250> just<00:05:21.699> by<00:05:21.849> holding<00:05:22.030> down<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.479> tab

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
that seems to work well if you have them

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.870 
that seems to work well if you have them
really<00:05:59.860> high<00:06:01.080> that<00:06:02.080> would<00:06:02.199> be<00:06:02.919> ideal<00:06:03.099> but<00:06:03.699> you

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
really high that would be ideal but you

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.920 
really high that would be ideal but you
would<00:06:04.090> use<00:06:04.210> a<00:06:04.240> lot<00:06:04.479> of<00:06:04.509> system<00:06:04.870> resources

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
would use a lot of system resources

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.100 
would use a lot of system resources
because<00:06:05.680> the<00:06:06.340> these<00:06:06.789> screens<00:06:07.180> are<00:06:07.509> what<00:06:07.690> uses

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
because the these screens are what uses

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.159 
because the these screens are what uses
a<00:06:08.289> lot<00:06:08.590> of<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:08.919> system<00:06:09.610> resources<00:06:10.479> up<00:06:10.719> having

these for quite a while but I haven't
used<00:07:09.910> them<00:07:10.030> in<00:07:10.150> my<00:07:10.270> videos<00:07:10.630> really<00:07:11.020> because

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.290 
used them in my videos really because

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.880 
used them in my videos really because
I've<00:07:11.740> just<00:07:11.980> been<00:07:12.160> showing<00:07:12.580> how<00:07:13.170> the<00:07:14.170> realistic

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570 
patter would do it because for example

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.000 
patter would do it because for example
you<00:07:16.660> wouldn't<00:07:16.780> have<00:07:16.960> this<00:07:17.110> box<00:07:17.380> washing<00:07:17.890> up

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.010
