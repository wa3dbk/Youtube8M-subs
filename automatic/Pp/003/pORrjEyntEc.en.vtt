00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
going even when you're not playing the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:06.539 
going even when you're not playing the
strings<00:03:58.019> 1<00:03:59.019> &amp;<00:03:59.290> 3<00:03:59.560> &amp;<00:04:00.160> 1<00:04:00.669> &amp;<00:04:01.389> 2<00:04:01.540> 3<00:04:02.199> &amp;<00:04:02.290> 4<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.370> can

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
strings 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 4 so you can

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.129 
strings 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 4 so you can
play<00:04:06.669> around<00:04:06.790> with<00:04:07.060> those<00:04:07.180> drum<00:04:07.480> patterns<00:04:07.870> all

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
play around with those drum patterns all

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.839 
play around with those drum patterns all
different<00:04:08.620> kinds<00:04:08.739> of<00:04:08.980> stuff<00:04:09.160> but<00:04:09.459> my

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
different kinds of stuff but my

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.449 
different kinds of stuff but my
suggestion<00:04:10.329> would<00:04:10.510> be<00:04:10.569> that<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:10.900> just<00:04:11.459> just

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
suggestion would be that you just just

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.920 
suggestion would be that you just just
kind<00:04:12.699> of<00:04:12.760> do<00:04:12.879> this<00:04:13.030> for<00:04:13.299> a<00:04:13.329> while<00:04:13.449> take<00:04:13.780> your

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
kind of do this for a while take your

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.620 
kind of do this for a while take your
hand<00:04:14.139> gets<00:04:14.349> used<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.650> that<00:04:14.739> motion<00:04:15.449> just<00:04:16.449> keep

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
hand gets used to that motion just keep

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.939 
hand gets used to that motion just keep
doing<00:04:16.930> that<00:04:17.049> and<00:04:17.289> then<00:04:17.380> everyone<00:04:17.680> still<00:04:17.829> want

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
doing that and then everyone still want

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.560 
doing that and then everyone still want
to<00:04:18.099> skip<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.400> beat<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:21.459> just<00:04:22.270> do<00:04:22.389> whatever

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
to skip a beat and just do whatever

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.409 
to skip a beat and just do whatever
sounds<00:04:23.050> good<00:04:26.639> here's<00:04:27.639> how<00:04:27.760> that<00:04:27.880> sounds<00:04:28.270> with

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
sounds good here's how that sounds with

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:38.019 
sounds good here's how that sounds with
some<00:04:29.229> tones

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:38.029 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:46.809 

G<00:04:39.169> c2<00:04:41.149> piece<00:04:42.149> us

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.159 

so<00:04:47.819> that's<00:04:47.969> just<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.330> same<00:04:48.539> chord<00:04:48.810> pattern

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
so that's just that same chord pattern

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.899 
so that's just that same chord pattern
that<00:04:49.289> we<00:04:49.439> were<00:04:49.560> working<00:04:50.219> on<00:04:50.460> just<00:04:50.669> a<00:04:50.699> second

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909 
that we were working on just a second

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.290 
that we were working on just a second
ago<00:04:50.939> so<00:04:51.900> hopefully<00:04:52.229> all<00:04:52.259> got<00:04:52.650> this<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.300> it

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
ago so hopefully all got this and it

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.850 
ago so hopefully all got this and it
makes<00:04:54.569> a<00:04:54.659> little<00:04:54.810> bit<00:04:54.960> more<00:04:55.080> sense<00:04:55.409> keep

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
makes a little bit more sense keep

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.290 
makes a little bit more sense keep
practicing<00:04:56.069> at<00:04:56.430> home<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.819> we'll<00:04:57.030> see<00:04:57.270> you

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
practicing at home and we'll see you

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.659 
practicing at home and we'll see you
next<00:04:57.360> week
