00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
figure out the combination to any of

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.890 
figure out the combination to any of
these<00:00:09.929> master<00:00:10.380> locks<00:00:11.269> I'm<00:00:12.269> also<00:00:12.450> going<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.719> say

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
these master locks I'm also going to say

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.780 
these master locks I'm also going to say
that<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.530> don't<00:00:13.679> want<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.219> use<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.639> way

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
that I don't want you to use it in a way

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.430 
that I don't want you to use it in a way
they<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.059> get<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.360> trouble<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.780> know

they can get you in trouble I know
you're<00:00:16.590> probably<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.070> maybe<00:00:17.789> not<00:00:18.000> you

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
you're probably going to maybe not you

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.550 
you're probably going to maybe not you
but<00:00:18.359> one<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> other<00:00:18.840> people<00:00:19.020> watches<00:00:19.439> this

least my ass is not going to be on the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.620 
least my ass is not going to be on the
line<00:00:25.580> only<00:00:26.580> use<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.090> if<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.269> forgot<00:00:27.539> your

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
line only use it if you forgot your

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.410 
line only use it if you forgot your
combination<00:00:28.519> this<00:00:29.519> lock<00:00:29.760> for<00:00:30.029> example

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
combination this lock for example

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.389 
combination this lock for example
someone<00:00:30.929> gave<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.320> me<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.679> said<00:00:31.830> here<00:00:32.009> or

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
someone gave it to me and said here or

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.010 
someone gave it to me and said here or
no<00:00:32.550> that's<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:32.940> when<00:00:33.180> someone<00:00:33.540> was<00:00:33.780> throwing

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
no that's not when someone was throwing

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.240 
no that's not when someone was throwing
it<00:00:34.140> away<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.290> said<00:00:34.530> hey<00:00:34.620> can<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:34.980> he's

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
it away I said hey can I have that he's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.319 
it away I said hey can I have that he's
like<00:00:35.399> why<00:00:35.640> would<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.880> want<00:00:36.120> it

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
like why would you want it

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.520 
like why would you want it
I<00:00:36.360> forgot<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> combination<00:00:36.930> outs<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.410> I

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
I forgot the combination outs like I

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.350 
I forgot the combination outs like I
don't<00:00:37.590> care<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.829> figure<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.280> out<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.579> now<00:00:39.329> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
don't care I figure it out and now I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.350 
don't care I figure it out and now I
know<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.660> combination<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.290> lock<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
know the combination to this lock and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.540 
know the combination to this lock and
this<00:00:42.360> takes<00:00:42.570> about<00:00:42.690> ten<00:00:42.960> minutes<00:00:43.280> all<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.340> need

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
this takes about ten minutes all I need

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.630 
this takes about ten minutes all I need
is<00:00:44.640> piece<00:00:44.850> paper<00:00:45.090> pencil<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.340> lock<00:00:47.489> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
is piece paper pencil and the lock of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.709 
is piece paper pencil and the lock of
course<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.850> let's<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.120> write<00:00:51.390> down<00:00:51.539> 1

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
course so first let's just write down 1

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
course so first let's just write down 1
through<00:00:51.930> 12<00:00:53.870> all<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.190> have

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
through 12 all right now that you have

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.580 
through 12 all right now that you have
numbers<00:00:57.180> written<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.199> clear<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
numbers written down and you clear the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.279 
numbers written down and you clear the
pins<00:00:58.910> which<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.090> what<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:00.809> call<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.109> just

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
pins which is what they call you just

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.560 
pins which is what they call you just
rotate<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.829> about<00:01:01.920> three<00:01:02.190> times<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.149> then

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
rotate it about three times and then

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.500 
rotate it about three times and then
you're<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> stop<00:01:04.260> at<00:01:04.379> zero<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.270> can

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
you're going to stop at zero and you can

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.210 
you're going to stop at zero and you can
pull<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.260> hard<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.860> well<00:01:08.100> not

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
pull on this as hard as you can well not

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.740 
pull on this as hard as you can well not
really<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.330> enough<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
really you just have to have enough so

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.620 
really you just have to have enough so
that<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.760> kind<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.880> stops<00:01:12.119> between<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.510> two

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
that this kind of stops between the two

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.810 
that this kind of stops between the two
numbers<00:01:12.960> you'll<00:01:13.590> Steve<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.100> you'll<00:01:14.490> see<00:01:14.700> it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
numbers you'll Steve it's you'll see it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.870 
numbers you'll Steve it's you'll see it
stops<00:01:15.090> between<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.960> zero<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.759> we're

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
stops between one and zero so we're

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.219 
stops between one and zero so we're
going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.060> write<00:01:18.180> down<00:01:18.210> zero<00:01:18.840> point<00:01:19.049> five

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
going to write down zero point five

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.950 
going to write down zero point five
because<00:01:19.470> that's<00:01:19.740> halfway<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.130> between<00:01:20.960> now

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
because that's halfway in between now

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.030 
because that's halfway in between now
we're<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> go<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.560> next<00:01:22.680> number

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
we're going to go to the next number

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.420 
we're going to go to the next number
you'll<00:01:23.939> see<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.150> stops<00:01:24.470> at<00:01:25.470> about<00:01:25.740> four<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.369> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
you'll see it stops at about four and a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.980 
you'll see it stops at about four and a
half<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.820> three<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> half<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.810> right

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
half and three and a half so right

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.280 
half and three and a half so right
between<00:01:28.110> those<00:01:28.380> stuff<00:01:28.619> before<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.780> your<00:01:31.020> next

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
between those stuff before and your next

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.870 
between those stuff before and your next
number<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.860> be<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.729> way

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
number you have to be going this way

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.100 
number you have to be going this way
around<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.509> go<00:01:33.570> backwards<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.079> doesn't

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
around if you go backwards it doesn't

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.370 
around if you go backwards it doesn't
work<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.650> don't<00:01:34.770> think<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.049> easier<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
work I don't think but this is easier to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.080 
work I don't think but this is easier to
do<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.560> way<00:01:37.770> anyway<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.909> go<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
do it this way anyway then you go the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.300 
do it this way anyway then you go the
next<00:01:39.270> number<00:01:39.509> next<00:01:40.200> number<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.680> between<00:01:41.040> about

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
next number next number is between about

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.929 
next number next number is between about
seven<00:01:43.070> like<00:01:44.070> seven<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:46.430> three-quarters<00:01:47.430> so

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
seven like seven and three-quarters so

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.719 
seven like seven and three-quarters so
you<00:01:48.360> put<00:01:48.540> down<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.899> seven<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.320> two<00:01:49.350> five<00:01:49.729> now

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
you put down like seven one two five now

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.249 
you put down like seven one two five now
you<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.119> very<00:01:51.299> accurate<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.750> about<00:01:51.840> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you have to be very accurate to about a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.889 
you have to be very accurate to about a
quarter<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> way<00:01:52.920> between<00:01:53.070> each<00:01:53.340> number

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
quarter of the way between each number

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.359 
quarter of the way between each number
this<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.049> stops<00:01:55.320> at<00:01:55.470> about<00:01:55.649> eleven<00:01:56.189> point

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
this one stops at about eleven point

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.160 
this one stops at about eleven point
five<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.969> ten<00:01:57.119> point<00:01:57.329> five<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.960> put<00:01:58.140> down

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
five and ten point five so put down

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.620 
five and ten point five so put down
eleven<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.909> keep<00:02:00.060> doing<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.360> all<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
eleven and just keep doing this all the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.149 
eleven and just keep doing this all the
way<00:02:00.719> down<00:02:00.930> until<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.530> get<00:02:01.649> twelve<00:02:01.890> numbers

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
way down until you get twelve numbers

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.060 
way down until you get twelve numbers
because<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.850> will<00:02:02.939> stop<00:02:03.149> 12<00:02:03.450> times<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.950> it's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
because it will stop 12 times and it's

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.139 
because it will stop 12 times and it's
write<00:02:05.189> down<00:02:05.340> each<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.729> those<00:02:05.790> numbers

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
write down each one of those numbers

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.160 
write down each one of those numbers
being<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.960> accurate<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.439> can

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
being this accurate as it can

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.199 
being this accurate as it can
to<00:02:08.440> about<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.619> quarter<00:02:08.979> between<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.910> numbers

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
to about a quarter between the numbers

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.880 
to about a quarter between the numbers
alright<00:02:10.899> now<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.319> got<00:02:11.440> all<00:02:11.500> my<00:02:11.590> twelve

difficult part of all you have to divide
this<00:03:22.120> number<00:03:22.180> by<00:03:22.450> 4<00:03:22.600> and<00:03:23.140> get<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.920> remainder

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
this number by 4 and get the remainder

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.270 
this number by 4 and get the remainder
so<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.540> would<00:03:25.630> be<00:03:25.720> like<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.040> like<00:03:27.040> if<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.220> add

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
so that would be like a like if you add

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.860 
so that would be like a like if you add
the<00:03:27.400> number<00:03:27.609> 4<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:28.000> divide<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.359> by<00:03:28.510> 4<00:03:28.720> and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
the number 4 you divide that by 4 and

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.050 
the number 4 you divide that by 4 and
have<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.019> remainder<00:03:29.350> of<00:03:29.470> 0<00:03:29.859> it<00:03:30.040> feels<00:03:30.220> 5<00:03:30.519> you

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
have a remainder of 0 it feels 5 you

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.280 
have a remainder of 0 it feels 5 you
would<00:03:31.150> divide<00:03:31.329> that<00:03:31.480> by<00:03:31.630> 4<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.170> have<00:03:32.260> a

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
would divide that by 4 and have a

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.930 
would divide that by 4 and have a
remainder<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.680> 1<00:03:33.600> if<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.720> add<00:03:34.840> like<00:03:35.620> 7<00:03:36.160> 7

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
remainder of 1 if you add like 7 7

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.210 
remainder of 1 if you add like 7 7
divided<00:03:37.239> by<00:03:37.269> 4<00:03:37.570> is<00:03:37.950> going<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.070> have<00:03:39.190> a

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
divided by 4 is going to have a

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.360 
divided by 4 is going to have a
remainder<00:03:39.489> of<00:03:39.609> 3<00:03:39.700> 11<00:03:40.690> divided<00:03:41.019> by<00:03:41.049> 4<00:03:41.350> it's<00:03:42.250> also

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
remainder of 3 11 divided by 4 it's also

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.370 
remainder of 3 11 divided by 4 it's also
going<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.609> have<00:03:42.730> our<00:03:42.760> manger<00:03:43.209> of<00:03:43.239> 3<00:03:43.540> so<00:03:44.290> what

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
going to have our manger of 3 so what

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.080 
going to have our manger of 3 so what
you<00:03:44.440> do<00:03:44.590> is<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:45.070> write<00:03:45.220> that<00:03:45.400> number<00:03:45.700> whatever

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
you do is you write that number whatever

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.780 
you do is you write that number whatever
the<00:03:46.329> remainder<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:46.780> right<00:03:46.989> here<00:03:47.280> 3<00:03:48.280> then<00:03:48.700> you

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
the remainder is right here 3 then you

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.990 
the remainder is right here 3 then you
add<00:03:48.910> 4<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.420> it<00:03:49.450> 3<00:03:50.380> +<00:03:50.560> 4<00:03:50.769> 7<00:03:50.829> they<00:03:51.549> just<00:03:51.730> keep<00:03:51.880> going

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
add 4 to it 3 + 4 7 they just keep going

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:02.570 
add 4 to it 3 + 4 7 they just keep going

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
on 1115 1923 27:31

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.950 
on 1115 1923 27:31
35<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:04.050> 39<00:04:04.610> these<00:04:05.610> are<00:04:05.790> all<00:04:05.940> possible<00:04:06.630> numbers

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
35 and 39 these are all possible numbers

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.470 
35 and 39 these are all possible numbers
that<00:04:07.080> could<00:04:07.200> be<00:04:07.260> your<00:04:07.470> first<00:04:08.300> number<00:04:09.300> in<00:04:09.390> the

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
that could be your first number in the

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.930 
that could be your first number in the
combination<00:04:09.690> all<00:04:10.680> right<00:04:10.800> then<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:11.730> go<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:11.880> the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
combination all right then you go to the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.360 
combination all right then you go to the
next<00:04:12.180> column<00:04:12.530> now<00:04:13.530> you're<00:04:13.680> going<00:04:13.800> to<00:04:13.860> add<00:04:14.010> now

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
next column now you're going to add now

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.530 
next column now you're going to add now
you're<00:04:14.490> going<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.670> subtract<00:04:15.000> two<00:04:15.210> from<00:04:15.390> that

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
you're going to subtract two from that

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.110 
you're going to subtract two from that
remainder<00:04:15.960> so<00:04:16.620> like<00:04:17.520> this<00:04:17.640> was<00:04:17.790> a<00:04:17.820> remainder

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
remainder so like this was a remainder

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.030 
remainder so like this was a remainder
of<00:04:18.209> 3<00:04:18.300> here<00:04:19.170> you<00:04:19.320> can<00:04:19.500> now<00:04:19.709> you're<00:04:19.860> going<00:04:19.980> to

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
of 3 here you can now you're going to

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.670 
of 3 here you can now you're going to
subtract<00:04:21.030> 2<00:04:21.209> from<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.510> now<00:04:22.440> if<00:04:22.560> your

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
subtract 2 from that now if your

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.840 
subtract 2 from that now if your
remainder<00:04:22.890> was<00:04:23.070> 1<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.280> could<00:04:23.370> just<00:04:23.520> add<00:04:23.640> to<00:04:23.790> it

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
remainder was 1 you could just add to it

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.770 
remainder was 1 you could just add to it
doesn't<00:04:24.090> matter<00:04:24.210> it's<00:04:24.360> all<00:04:24.420> going<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.630> be<00:04:24.690> the

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
doesn't matter it's all going to be the

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.880 
doesn't matter it's all going to be the
same<00:04:26.240> because<00:04:27.380> it's<00:04:28.380> just<00:04:28.530> going<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.740> be<00:04:28.830> the

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
same because it's just going to be the

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.720 
same because it's just going to be the
same<00:04:29.040> so<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.900> like<00:04:30.900> 3<00:04:31.140> minus<00:04:31.410> 2<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:32.010> going<00:04:32.670> to

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
same so you like 3 minus 2 is going to

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.400 
same so you like 3 minus 2 is going to
be<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:32.910> 1<00:04:33.270> then<00:04:33.780> you're<00:04:33.870> going<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.020> add<00:04:34.110> 4<00:04:34.320> to

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
be a 1 then you're going to add 4 to

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.330 
be a 1 then you're going to add 4 to
that<00:04:35.120> 5<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.390> you<00:04:36.840> can<00:04:36.960> see<00:04:37.110> if<00:04:37.200> I<00:04:37.290> had<00:04:37.410> added<00:04:37.620> 2

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
that 5 and you can see if I had added 2

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.040 
that 5 and you can see if I had added 2
I<00:04:38.370> just<00:04:38.670> get<00:04:38.790> 5<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.270> then<00:04:39.360> I'd<00:04:39.450> start<00:04:39.660> over<00:04:39.960> and

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
I just get 5 and then I'd start over and

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.860 
I just get 5 and then I'd start over and
then<00:04:40.170> this<00:04:40.320> would<00:04:40.470> just<00:04:40.560> be<00:04:40.740> like<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:41.180> oh<00:04:42.180> no

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
then this would just be like that oh no

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.860 
then this would just be like that oh no
like<00:04:43.100> 37<00:04:44.100> or<00:04:44.670> something<00:04:44.910> but<00:04:45.600> it<00:04:45.690> doesn't

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
like 37 or something but it doesn't

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.820 
like 37 or something but it doesn't
matter<00:04:45.990> because<00:04:46.170> that's<00:04:46.410> going<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:46.620> be<00:04:46.710> down

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
matter because that's going to be down

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.710 
matter because that's going to be down
here<00:04:47.010> now<00:04:47.150> so<00:04:48.150> it's<00:04:48.270> just<00:04:48.300> going<00:04:48.480> to<00:04:48.570> shift

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
here now so it's just going to shift

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.830 
here now so it's just going to shift
everything<00:04:49.140> if<00:04:49.200> you<00:04:49.290> do<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.800> other<00:04:49.830> way<00:04:50.840> so

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
everything if you do it the other way so

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.970 
everything if you do it the other way so
anyway<00:04:52.110> you're<00:04:52.200> just<00:04:52.380> subtracting<00:04:52.830> 2<00:04:52.950> from

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
anyway you're just subtracting 2 from

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.030 
anyway you're just subtracting 2 from
each<00:04:53.190> one<00:04:53.370> of<00:04:53.430> these<00:04:53.520> numbers<00:04:54.920> they're<00:04:55.920> going

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
each one of these numbers they're going

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:10.220 
each one of these numbers they're going
to<00:04:56.100> 1<00:04:56.280> 5<00:04:57.060> 9<00:04:58.550> 13<00:05:00.020> 17<00:05:01.310> 21<00:05:02.930> 25<00:05:04.130> 29<00:05:06.200> 33<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:08.480> 37<00:05:09.480> now

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
to 1 5 9 13 17 21 25 29 33 and 37 now

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.110 
to 1 5 9 13 17 21 25 29 33 and 37 now
these<00:05:10.380> are<00:05:10.590> all<00:05:10.710> possible<00:05:11.280> numbers<00:05:11.460> that

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
these are all possible numbers that

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.140 
these are all possible numbers that
could<00:05:12.270> be<00:05:12.390> your<00:05:12.540> second<00:05:12.930> combination<00:05:13.170> or<00:05:14.150> your

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
could be your second combination or your

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.330 
could be your second combination or your
second<00:05:15.480> number<00:05:15.720> in<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:15.870> combination<00:05:16.340> all

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
second number in the combination all

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.570 
second number in the combination all
right<00:05:17.430> so<00:05:17.940> you're<00:05:18.810> going<00:05:18.990> from<00:05:19.230> about<00:05:19.580> 64,000

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
right so you're going from about 64,000

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.670 
right so you're going from about 64,000
possible<00:05:21.090> combinations<00:05:21.600> to<00:05:22.170> this<00:05:22.320> lock<00:05:22.500> if

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
possible combinations to this lock if

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.710 
possible combinations to this lock if
you<00:05:22.740> did<00:05:22.920> every<00:05:23.160> single<00:05:23.430> number<00:05:23.550> like<00:05:23.790> 0<00:05:24.030> 0<00:05:24.090> 0<00:05:24.510> 0

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
you did every single number like 0 0 0 0

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.930 
you did every single number like 0 0 0 0
0<00:05:25.110> 1<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:25.740> 1<00:05:25.920> all<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:26.220> way<00:05:26.310> around<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:26.640> started

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
0 1 and 1 all the way around and started

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.840 
0 1 and 1 all the way around and started
again<00:05:27.090> at<00:05:27.180> 1<00:05:27.390> 0<00:05:27.720> 0<00:05:27.990> 1<00:05:28.260> 0<00:05:28.320> 1<00:05:28.650> 1<00:05:28.980> if<00:05:29.430> you<00:05:29.580> did<00:05:29.700> that

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
again at 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 if you did that

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.880 
again at 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 if you did that
there's<00:05:30.090> about<00:05:30.320> 64,000<00:05:31.320> combinations<00:05:31.770> I

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
there's about 64,000 combinations I

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.810 
there's about 64,000 combinations I
think<00:05:33.260> now<00:05:34.260> I<00:05:34.290> there<00:05:35.220> are<00:05:35.250> a<00:05:35.370> couple<00:05:35.580> things

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
think now I there are a couple things

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.950 
think now I there are a couple things
you<00:05:35.940> can<00:05:36.120> knock<00:05:36.240> out<00:05:36.390> you<00:05:36.570> can't<00:05:36.750> have<00:05:36.870> the

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
you can knock out you can't have the

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.440 
you can knock out you can't have the
same<00:05:37.140> number<00:05:37.380> in<00:05:37.410> a<00:05:37.500> combination<00:05:37.980> twice<00:05:38.450> so

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
same number in a combination twice so

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.180 
same number in a combination twice so
you<00:05:39.480> can't<00:05:39.690> have<00:05:39.780> 1111<00:05:40.500> so<00:05:40.860> you<00:05:40.950> know<00:05:41.040> that

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
you can't have 1111 so you know that

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.980 
you can't have 1111 so you know that
none<00:05:41.490> of<00:05:41.520> these<00:05:41.700> none<00:05:42.360> thing<00:05:42.570> that<00:05:42.750> starts

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
none of these none thing that starts

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
none of these none thing that starts
with<00:05:43.080> 11<00:05:43.200> is<00:05:43.530> going<00:05:43.650> to<00:05:43.710> be<00:05:43.800> in<00:05:43.920> your

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
with 11 is going to be in your

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.070 
with 11 is going to be in your
combination<00:05:44.460> 6<00:05:44.670> just<00:05:44.850> cross<00:05:45.090> out<00:05:45.300> 11<00:05:45.630> that

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
combination 6 just cross out 11 that

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.450 
combination 6 just cross out 11 that
brings<00:05:46.290> it<00:05:46.410> down<00:05:46.500> to<00:05:46.560> 90<00:05:47.010> because<00:05:47.310> you

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
brings it down to 90 because you

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.140 
brings it down to 90 because you
multiply<00:05:47.610> 9<00:05:48.060> times<00:05:48.300> 10<00:05:49.760> some<00:05:50.760> people<00:05:51.000> might

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
multiply 9 times 10 some people might

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.280 
multiply 9 times 10 some people might
say<00:05:51.330> you<00:05:51.390> can't<00:05:51.570> have<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.780> same<00:05:51.810> enough<00:05:52.140> a

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
say you can't have the same enough a

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.960 
say you can't have the same enough a
number<00:05:52.710> that's<00:05:52.800> 2<00:05:53.100> away<00:05:53.310> from<00:05:53.490> another<00:05:53.640> number

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
number that's 2 away from another number

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.210 
number that's 2 away from another number
like<00:05:54.390> 9<00:05:54.540> and<00:05:54.750> 11<00:05:54.810> that's<00:05:55.500> not<00:05:55.740> true<00:05:55.919> I've<00:05:56.040> seen

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
like 9 and 11 that's not true I've seen

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.310 
like 9 and 11 that's not true I've seen
a<00:05:56.280> couple<00:05:56.310> locks<00:05:56.760> I<00:05:57.360> saw<00:05:57.600> one<00:05:57.750> of<00:05:57.780> those<00:05:57.870> 38<00:05:58.290> 0

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
a couple locks I saw one of those 38 0

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.270 
a couple locks I saw one of those 38 0
10<00:05:58.770> and<00:05:58.800> 38<00:05:59.930> right<00:06:00.930> there<00:06:01.200> it's<00:06:01.680> only<00:06:01.830> 2<00:06:02.070> away

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
10 and 38 right there it's only 2 away

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.030 
10 and 38 right there it's only 2 away
from<00:06:02.460> 0<00:06:02.820> so<00:06:03.270> that's<00:06:03.960> not<00:06:04.140> true<00:06:04.380> don't<00:06:04.590> don't

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
from 0 so that's not true don't don't

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.370 
from 0 so that's not true don't don't
don't<00:06:05.520> cross<00:06:05.730> those<00:06:05.970> out<00:06:06.150> it<00:06:07.020> might<00:06:07.140> make<00:06:07.320> it

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
don't cross those out it might make it

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.140 
don't cross those out it might make it
easier<00:06:07.530> but<00:06:07.830> it<00:06:07.950> also<00:06:08.100> might<00:06:08.400> make<00:06:08.880> it<00:06:08.970> so<00:06:09.060> you

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
easier but it also might make it so you

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.570 
easier but it also might make it so you
can't<00:06:09.300> figure<00:06:09.450> out<00:06:09.540> your<00:06:09.690> combination

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
can't figure out your combination

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.560 
can't figure out your combination
so<00:06:11.580> at<00:06:11.670> this<00:06:11.790> point<00:06:12.030> you're<00:06:12.210> just<00:06:12.360> trying

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
so at this point you're just trying

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.940 
so at this point you're just trying
every<00:06:12.810> single<00:06:13.080> combination<00:06:13.260> and<00:06:13.680> going<00:06:13.830> down

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
every single combination and going down

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.340 
every single combination and going down
the<00:06:14.040> line<00:06:14.160> three<00:06:14.610> one<00:06:14.820> eleven<00:06:15.210> three<00:06:16.140> five

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
the line three one eleven three five

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.370 
the line three one eleven three five
eleven<00:06:16.710> three<00:06:16.950> nine<00:06:17.100> eleven<00:06:18.200> three<00:06:19.200> yeah

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
eleven three nine eleven three yeah

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.350 
eleven three nine eleven three yeah
three<00:06:20.310> thirteen<00:06:20.610> eleven<00:06:20.700> and<00:06:20.970> you<00:06:21.060> two<00:06:21.180> keep

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
three thirteen eleven and you two keep

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.100 
three thirteen eleven and you two keep
going<00:06:21.600> down<00:06:21.750> now<00:06:22.680> I<00:06:23.420> know<00:06:24.420> right<00:06:24.690> now<00:06:24.870> for<00:06:25.080> a

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
going down now I know right now for a

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.810 
going down now I know right now for a
fact<00:06:25.380> that<00:06:25.620> this<00:06:26.100> one<00:06:26.280> is<00:06:26.400> twenty<00:06:26.670> three

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
fact that this one is twenty three

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.600 
fact that this one is twenty three
twenty<00:06:27.060> nine<00:06:27.210> eleven<00:06:30.860> so<00:06:31.860> that<00:06:32.010> might<00:06:32.190> be<00:06:32.220> kind

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
twenty nine eleven so that might be kind

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.070 
twenty nine eleven so that might be kind
of<00:06:32.670> an<00:06:32.790> annoyance<00:06:33.150> if<00:06:33.360> your<00:06:33.570> combinations

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
of an annoyance if your combinations

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.410 
of an annoyance if your combinations
like<00:06:34.700> 3933<00:06:35.700> eleven<00:06:36.000> because<00:06:36.060> you'd<00:06:36.270> have<00:06:36.300> to

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
like 3933 eleven because you'd have to

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.940 
like 3933 eleven because you'd have to
go<00:06:36.570> through<00:06:36.600> almost<00:06:36.930> all<00:06:37.170> of<00:06:37.230> them<00:06:37.410> but

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
go through almost all of them but

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.430 
go through almost all of them but
sometimes<00:06:38.610> get<00:06:38.820> lucky<00:06:39.090> and<00:06:39.210> it's<00:06:39.300> like<00:06:39.450> 7<00:06:39.930> 1<00:06:39.960> 11

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
sometimes get lucky and it's like 7 1 11

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.240 
sometimes get lucky and it's like 7 1 11
and<00:06:40.590> you<00:06:40.650> real<00:06:40.860> quick

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
and you real quick

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.690 
and you real quick
you<00:06:41.550> know<00:06:43.220> that's<00:06:44.220> how<00:06:44.340> it's<00:06:44.490> done

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
you know that's how it's done

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.700 
you know that's how it's done
so<00:06:45.330> I'll<00:06:45.450> show<00:06:45.630> you<00:06:45.690> for<00:06:45.900> a<00:06:45.960> fact<00:06:46.140> that<00:06:46.440> this

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
so I'll show you for a fact that this

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:55.910 
so I'll show you for a fact that this
works<00:06:50.150> 23:22<00:06:51.150> 9<00:06:52.190> 11<00:06:54.290> and<00:06:55.290> this<00:06:55.440> works<00:06:55.680> for

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
works 23:22 9 11 and this works for

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.210 
works 23:22 9 11 and this works for
every<00:06:56.250> single<00:06:56.580> master<00:06:56.940> lock<00:06:57.830> that<00:06:58.830> has<00:06:58.890> these

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
every single master lock that has these

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.070 
every single master lock that has these
three<00:06:59.490> combinations<00:06:59.730> and<00:07:00.390> it<00:07:00.540> even<00:07:00.750> works<00:07:00.930> on

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
three combinations and it even works on

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.940 
three combinations and it even works on
some<00:07:01.260> of<00:07:01.350> the<00:07:01.410> knockoffs<00:07:03.620> but<00:07:04.620> I<00:07:04.680> can't

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:04.950 
some of the knockoffs but I can't

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.280 
some of the knockoffs but I can't
guarantee<00:07:05.130> it<00:07:05.370> because<00:07:05.880> I<00:07:06.300> only<00:07:06.810> tried<00:07:07.080> it<00:07:07.110> on

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
guarantee it because I only tried it on

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.690 
guarantee it because I only tried it on
a<00:07:07.320> couple<00:07:07.530> and<00:07:07.770> I'm<00:07:07.860> try<00:07:08.100> them<00:07:08.220> on<00:07:08.310> all<00:07:08.490> of<00:07:08.580> them

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
a couple and I'm try them on all of them

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.020 
a couple and I'm try them on all of them
so<00:07:09.080> there<00:07:10.080> you<00:07:10.170> go<00:07:10.580> that's<00:07:11.580> how<00:07:11.730> you<00:07:11.850> break

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.030 
so there you go that's how you break

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.890 
so there you go that's how you break
your<00:07:12.150> master<00:07:12.480> lock<00:07:14.450> you<00:07:15.450> get<00:07:15.690> all<00:07:15.780> your

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 
your master lock you get all your

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.920 
your master lock you get all your
numbers<00:07:16.130> between<00:07:17.130> the<00:07:17.490> numbers<00:07:17.930> including

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:18.930 
numbers between the numbers including

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.410 
numbers between the numbers including
the<00:07:18.990> pins<00:07:19.200> cross<00:07:19.920> out<00:07:20.130> then<00:07:20.340> the<00:07:20.790> non<00:07:20.970> whole

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.420 
the pins cross out then the non whole

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.290 
the pins cross out then the non whole
numbers<00:07:21.750> don't<00:07:22.530> be<00:07:22.650> left<00:07:22.800> with<00:07:22.950> 5<00:07:23.150> for<00:07:24.150> when

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 
numbers don't be left with 5 for when

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.490 
numbers don't be left with 5 for when
we're<00:07:24.390> going<00:07:24.480> to<00:07:24.540> have<00:07:24.600> the<00:07:24.780> same<00:07:24.960> ones<00:07:25.170> digit

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 
we're going to have the same ones digit

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.690 
we're going to have the same ones digit
so<00:07:25.770> you<00:07:25.830> cross<00:07:25.980> those<00:07:26.160> out<00:07:26.280> you're<00:07:26.460> left<00:07:26.520> with

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:26.700 
so you cross those out you're left with

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.210 
so you cross those out you're left with
one<00:07:26.850> number<00:07:27.030> in<00:07:27.810> this<00:07:27.900> case<00:07:27.990> 11<00:07:28.350> that<00:07:28.950> is<00:07:29.100> your

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 
one number in this case 11 that is your

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.190 
one number in this case 11 that is your
last<00:07:29.400> digit<00:07:30.980> and<00:07:31.980> you<00:07:32.820> divide<00:07:33.570> that<00:07:33.600> by<00:07:33.750> 4<00:07:34.050> and

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.200 
last digit and you divide that by 4 and

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.800 
last digit and you divide that by 4 and
get<00:07:34.260> their<00:07:34.440> main<00:07:34.590> deck<00:07:34.770> which<00:07:35.370> is<00:07:35.400> 3<00:07:35.760> add<00:07:36.300> 4<00:07:36.660> to

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:36.810 
get their main deck which is 3 add 4 to

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.900 
get their main deck which is 3 add 4 to
those<00:07:36.990> and<00:07:37.230> then<00:07:38.040> you<00:07:38.160> subtract<00:07:38.520> 2<00:07:38.670> from<00:07:38.700> the

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:38.910 
those and then you subtract 2 from the

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.520 
those and then you subtract 2 from the
remainder<00:07:39.210> put<00:07:39.570> there<00:07:39.750> and<00:07:39.900> add<00:07:40.080> 4<00:07:40.350> to<00:07:40.440> all

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 
remainder put there and add 4 to all

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.840 
remainder put there and add 4 to all
those<00:07:41.120> easier<00:07:42.120> possible<00:07:42.510> combinations<00:07:42.990> and

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:43.850 
those easier possible combinations and

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.080 
those easier possible combinations and
then<00:07:44.990> then<00:07:45.990> you<00:07:46.050> just<00:07:46.260> try<00:07:46.410> them<00:07:46.560> all<00:07:46.650> out<00:07:47.090> you

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.090 
then then you just try them all out you

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.750 
then then you just try them all out you
can<00:07:48.210> cross<00:07:48.390> out<00:07:48.630> double<00:07:48.960> numbers<00:07:49.340> like<00:07:50.340> 11<00:07:50.640> and

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:50.760 
can cross out double numbers like 11 and

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.270 
can cross out double numbers like 11 and
11<00:07:51.000> it's<00:07:51.270> not<00:07:51.450> possible<00:07:51.840> and<00:07:52.050> then<00:07:52.950> use<00:07:53.100> try

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 
11 it's not possible and then use try

00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:02.520 
11 it's not possible and then use try
them<00:07:53.400> all<00:07:53.460> out<00:07:53.520> in<00:07:53.910> this<00:07:54.360> case<00:07:54.510> of<00:07:54.720> 23<00:07:56.990> 29<00:07:59.360> 11

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:02.530
