00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.340
 problem that some have 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.460
 humorous usual form or person 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.199

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.990
 but 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.990
 let's say a little 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.210

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.390

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.059
 You can hide them in a systematic way. 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.380

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:45.690

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.629
 its system is not visible but by going to 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.699

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.909

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.500
 man made a hidden file with me 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.060
 I have a different type of problem 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.179
 appeared let's say my video lessons 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.580
 who are shooting for you now and others 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:23.909
 my working file then it may be 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.880
 either as a virus or as 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.280
 script that hides on the system 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.830
 level here helps the summer go away 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.830
 total commander you can download it in 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.369
 Internet is freely available or 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.610
 trial version either 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.740
 the paid free version turns out 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.180
 hacked version is up to you 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.659

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.009
 sector me here is admin 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.860
 So 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.079
 We look that we have a desktop but 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.110
 here it â€™s still empty 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:24.020
 desktop back by clicking 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:27.670
 arrow select that folder or here 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.670
 drive to work with 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:36.450
 by clicking on it let's say we 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.450
 killed he highlighted we press the file and 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.420
 change attributes 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.580
 and remove all the checkboxes 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.520
 process 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.700
 click yes going inside but this is you 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.500
 see I have everything displayed in 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.560
 principle, in principle, helped me more than once 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.080
 Thinner forgot that there might be a virus 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.650
 or customers stones resorted with frantic 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.410
 eyes that they have lost files in this 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.650
 total commander saves a lot 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.020
 unless of course there are other ways I'm talking about 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.380
 I will not tell them because not 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.710
 I know everything myself probably have a lot 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.600
 There are about four ways to this one, but 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.550
 for a long time to tell not a move, but two 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.040
 the most standard way that you can 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.590
 return your files after viruses which 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.160
 hide on a flash drive you think in a panic 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.590
 that they are missing you either on the computer 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.170
 I hope you total commander more than once 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.090
 Others will also come in handy. 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.320
 some functions you can learn in 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.970
 other reviews in other channel authors 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.160
 I can also ask questions for you 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.000
 I will do a video review on certain 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.819
 functions 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.100
 this or that 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.260
 programs 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.680
 here probably everything is up today 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.800
 dates today by the way we looked 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.050
 problem of hidden files or viruses 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.100
 that hide files 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.100
 date of the whole house
