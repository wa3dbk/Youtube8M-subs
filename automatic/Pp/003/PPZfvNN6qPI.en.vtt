00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.560 
on this glitter and purple water marble
and<00:00:15.710> it's<00:00:16.710> actually<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.460> sparkly<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.119> think

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
and it's actually so sparkly I think

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.350 
and it's actually so sparkly I think
it's<00:00:18.750> probably<00:00:19.169> hard<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.890> see<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.700> design<00:00:21.090> on

it's probably hard to see the design on

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
very close to one of the glitter colors

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.380 
very close to one of the glitter colors
and<00:00:57.680> as<00:00:58.680> far<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.250> goes<00:00:59.309> it<00:01:00.000> worked<00:01:00.210> out

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and as far as that goes it worked out

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.590 
and as far as that goes it worked out
really<00:01:00.660> well<00:01:00.780> seniorita<00:01:01.590> Bonita<00:01:02.280> matches<00:01:03.269> the

really well seniorita Bonita matches the
purple<00:01:04.320> glitter<00:01:04.580> very<00:01:05.580> closely<00:01:06.140> but<00:01:07.220> it

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
purple glitter very closely but it

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.300 
purple glitter very closely but it
actually<00:01:08.880> turned<00:01:09.300> out<00:01:09.539> really<00:01:10.130> difficult<00:01:11.130> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
actually turned out really difficult to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.990 
actually turned out really difficult to
see<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.509> nail<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:14.490> don't<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.820> how

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
see on the nail so I just don't know how

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.730 
see on the nail so I just don't know how
happy<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.450> am<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:17.930> clears<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.290> top

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
happy I am with it and clears and top

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.310 
happy I am with it and clears and top
coats<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.610> tend<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.090> dry<00:01:21.330> kind<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.780> fast<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
coats do tend to dry kind of fast in the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.380 
coats do tend to dry kind of fast in the
water<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:23.520> I'm<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.939> draw<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
turn the cup so that I can get a better

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.990 
turn the cup so that I can get a better
angle<00:01:33.860> there<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> glitter<00:01:35.610> on

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
angle there you can see the glitter on

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.859

orange stick I'm going to reach in and
clean<00:01:53.759> up<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.090> excess<00:01:55.520> not<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.820> big<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
clean up that excess not as big of a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.880 
clean up that excess not as big of a
deal<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> clear<00:01:58.740> but<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:01.229> still<00:02:01.590> want

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
deal with the clear but you still want

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.690 
deal with the clear but you still want
to<00:02:02.180> get<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.420> clean<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.810> possible

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
to get it as clean as possible

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.789 
to get it as clean as possible
just<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.880> avoid<00:02:06.000> anything<00:02:06.630> extra<00:02:07.259> sticking<00:02:07.649> on

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
just to avoid anything extra sticking on

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.390 
just to avoid anything extra sticking on
your<00:02:07.829> nails<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.750> then<00:02:09.750> slowly<00:02:10.410> draw<00:02:10.709> out<00:02:11.009> and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
your nails and then slowly draw out and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.330 
your nails and then slowly draw out and
there<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.519> can<00:02:14.760> maybe<00:02:15.299> hopefully<00:02:16.160> see<00:02:17.160> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
there you can maybe hopefully see the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.020 
there you can maybe hopefully see the
water<00:02:17.519> marble<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:20.100> can<00:02:20.220> also<00:02:20.370> see<00:02:20.730> there's<00:02:20.940> a

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
water marble you can also see there's a

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.909 
water marble you can also see there's a
little<00:02:21.269> drop<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.720> polish<00:02:22.230> down<00:02:22.440> there<00:02:22.680> at<00:02:22.829> the

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:22.919 
little drop of polish down there at the

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:23.150 
little drop of polish down there at the
bottom

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160

the<00:02:23.340> cup<00:02:23.580> which<00:02:23.790> goes<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.300> show<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.510> even<00:02:24.990> I

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
the cup which goes to show that even I

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.960 
the cup which goes to show that even I
have<00:02:26.190> polish<00:02:26.640> sinks<00:02:27.030> sometimes<00:02:28.280> but<00:02:29.280> I'm

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
have polish sinks sometimes but I'm

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.720 
have polish sinks sometimes but I'm
thinking<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.900> may<00:02:31.470> be<00:02:31.530> easier<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.460> see

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
thinking that this may be easier to see

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.180 
thinking that this may be easier to see
the<00:02:32.850> water<00:02:33.060> marble<00:02:33.420> design<00:02:33.450> if<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.410> modify<00:02:35.160> it

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the water marble design if I modify it

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.810 
the water marble design if I modify it
and<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:36.390> may<00:02:36.720> do<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.250> depending<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.340> how<00:02:38.550> long

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
and I may do that depending on how long

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.890 
and I may do that depending on how long
I<00:02:39.120> wear<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.600> manicure<00:02:40.580> but<00:02:41.600> let<00:02:42.600> me<00:02:42.720> know<00:02:42.870> what

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
I wear the manicure but let me know what

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.140 
I wear the manicure but let me know what
