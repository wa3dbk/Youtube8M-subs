00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.690
 hi all users spazioogames.it are 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.600
 Dr. White we are here today with a new one 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.970
 video dedicated to fifa 15 latest teams 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.560
 come back to review players from 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.290
 school of the week that currently 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.630
 in packages so ultimately they had 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.009
 saw menez in the first week and suarez 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.660
 in its basic version 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.290
 today we are back to the team on the week number 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.340
 20 which has some excellent players 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.500
 especially for the series of dinners 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.029
 someone interesting someone less e 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.829
 nowadays we are talking about with series 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.559
 miroslav klose are already seeing the 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.629
 statistics a player who is a little bit 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.190
 surprised in fear many expected 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.199
 words I saw the double against the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.179
 Milan was awarded Klose for the goal 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.780
 and always assist against the team 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.640
 Rossoneri 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.670
 the statistics are not bad for the year 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.600
 last had a record breaker version 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.030
 fantastic because it was a version 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.539
 fantastic with pretense of state protection 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.519
 at most 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.519
 this year only an 82 we see how 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.269
 always how fast it behaves 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.269
 in game 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.390
 speed is not that great let's face it 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.490
 right away but klose doesn't have to run because 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.620
 must be within the area a 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.240
 then finalize 74 of 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.950
 accelerations to 71 of maximum speed 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.810
 they also go quite well because 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.850
 however on the short right in the 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.990
 very short period therefore in 56 meters 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.560
 manages to take a slight advantage 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.140
 on opponents that allows him to 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.270
 pull and get rid of physical strength 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.070
 it's not great when you could 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.580
 surely do better then it is not 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.750
 however a very difficult opponent to 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.730
 throw it down especially if 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.500
 used various ramos chiellini barzagli 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.840
 etc. etc. 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.820
 as for the shot instead one 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.190
 feature we must highlight the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.690
 penalty 90 and this is 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.220
 generally true then there are those 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.720
 matches in which maybe he will miss goals 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.140
 also quite simple though 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.890
 usually when he has the ball 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.880
 it will be difficult to make mistakes 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.860
 this is important because it is excellent 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.840
 finalizer so if you are looking for one who 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.350
 you finalize the klose action is right for you 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.450
 your 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.370
 he has excellent head accuracy then 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.510
 puts together the finalization with 97 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.070
 even if you know it really is 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.620
 difficult to score to head into 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.050
 these last team compared to the year 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.910
 last so I would say bets maybe 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.670
 on the finalization with the feet rather 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.020
 that is good air and then the shooting power 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.130
 all the rest 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.530
 it will also go because it doesn't have a very big one 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.000
 shooting from distance I am 55 so it is a 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.830
 player who must stay inside 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.230
 of the penalty area receives the ball e 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.440
 score for dribbling 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.540
 it's not bad because at 75 of course 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.720
 you can't do the skill stars because 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.850
 he only has two so it's not really one 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.120
 schoeler indeed we say that it is not one 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.170
 skimmer in fact, even agility is not a 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.740
 much the dreaming was good I thought 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.990
 better then I would not tell you to take 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.600
 ball and skip them to pour more from 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.340
 take as I said receives the ball 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.980
 pull right away so don't think of 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.020
 start making 8 10 dribbles as with 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.460
 a neymar with other people also like it 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.260
 tevez times himself is already a player 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.970
 who can jump more easily 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.890
 opponents regarding the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.530
 passage 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.630
 nothing to report is not 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.610
 very scarce because it seems anyway 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.310
 a little bit more but it's not even a 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.460
 exceptional value physical we 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.950
 therefore seen a player who has some 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.090
 flaw click free style we can put them 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.190
 to try to solve 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.040
 surely an engine that increases 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.780
 speed, passage and dripping 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.820
 are the most scarce statistics 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.440
 or if speed doesn't interest us 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.050
 I would tell you however to improve the 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.280
 passage and dribbling we have seen 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.380
 could be improved enough 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.360
 easily where to use this 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.580
 player definitely the tip because a 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.110
 medium low of warcraft so it's great 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.220
 this work for a player like that 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.709
 must stay within the area of 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.990
 rigor because closer receives and marks the 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.000
 I recommend two solutions one is more low 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.360
 cost so to speak because in any case a 4 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.770
 3 3 4 standard a with three players who 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.459
 they moved into our league 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.990
 or both varela shaqiri and costa then 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.810
 three new players you can enter 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.240
 in a series school ae klose in al 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.850
 center of attack ready to receive i 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.920
 balloons and then remove the terminal 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.860
 single of the action 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.180
 or you can take advantage of the fact that it is 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.299
 German so you can safely 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.879
 insert them in this bundesliga 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.680
 you have raw royce muller like 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.479
 external and trequartista in a 4 2 3 1 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.069
 in its second version they must 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.870
 simply follow klose that anyway 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:32.590
 he is also good at attacking depth 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.020
 so really not bad the cost is 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.300
 generally enough to be released from 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.159
 little time already costs 25 thousand credits 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.629
 so for the weekend maybe you can 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.449
 find it under 20,000 credits and in 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:46.750
 In that case I would advise you to try it 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.449
 because in any case klose has not very big 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.039
 dribbling skills in passing and it is not 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.439
 likely there fast enough 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.029
 however he has a great shot a movie of 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:56.439
 incredible four-star doctor 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:59.770
 closes weak so you can pull either 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:02.830
 right or left is not much 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.259
 expensive can be tied easily with 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.849
 other championships and then a player is a 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.680
 little different from those we have 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.169
 in series we did not have a player of 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.240
 kind because the troubles in them a 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.699
 excellent finalist because anyway 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.919
 when the ball is unlikely to fail 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.110
 89 finalization of a basic version 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.539
 however he is a different player than 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.460
 klose so I don't know I would tell you 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.009
 try it if you're volvera other 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.569
 try absolutely if you are not others 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.379
 fans 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.389
 try it because it could anyway 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.680
 exit legend and in the coming years 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.940
 he is a player that I think he can 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.009
 entertaining is not easy from 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.139
 use but can give you satisfaction 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.339
 so with today we have concluded if there is 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.680
 liked to disrupt the registered competitors 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:44.009
 at the canal we will see each other again soon 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.009
 all
