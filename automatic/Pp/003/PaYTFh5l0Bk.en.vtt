00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
very unimaginative now if I take a

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.370 
very unimaginative now if I take a
little<00:01:07.850> bit<00:01:07.970> later<00:01:08.270> in<00:01:08.480> that<00:01:08.630> study<00:01:08.960> when<00:01:09.230> the

in let me show you something else that
is<00:02:04.380> contrasting<00:02:05.380> this<00:02:05.500> is<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.799> beginning<00:02:06.340> of

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
is contrasting this is the beginning of

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:18.250 
is contrasting this is the beginning of
the<00:02:06.610> Ravel<00:02:07.420> sonatina

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260

and<00:02:24.060> what<00:02:24.269> I'm<00:02:24.420> doing<00:02:24.689> there<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:24.930> controlling

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
and what I'm doing there is controlling

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.330 
and what I'm doing there is controlling
the<00:02:27.120> level<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.629> sound<00:02:28.049> in<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.620> middle<00:02:29.159> voice

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the level of sound in the middle voice

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.179 
the level of sound in the middle voice
that<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.700> want<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> be<00:02:30.209> really<00:02:30.540> soft<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.189> slow

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
that I want to be really soft and slow

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.979 
that I want to be really soft and slow
practice<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.790> ideal<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.799> really<00:02:34.799> will

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
practice is ideal for that really will

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.390 
practice is ideal for that really will
really<00:02:36.989> enhance<00:02:37.110> my<00:02:37.500> control<00:02:37.920> when<00:02:38.099> I<00:02:38.189> come<00:02:38.370> to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
really enhance my control when I come to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.420 
really enhance my control when I come to
play<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.730> faster<00:02:39.530> let<00:02:40.530> me<00:02:40.650> show<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.069> process

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
play it faster let me show you a process

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.229 
play it faster let me show you a process
now<00:02:41.849> it's<00:02:42.750> slow<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:43.769> fast<00:02:44.159> which<00:02:44.760> seems<00:02:45.060> to

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
now it's slow but fast which seems to

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.449 
now it's slow but fast which seems to
contradict<00:02:45.750> itself<00:02:46.079> what<00:02:46.560> I'm<00:02:46.709> doing<00:02:47.069> is<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
contradict itself what I'm doing is the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.849 
contradict itself what I'm doing is the
the<00:02:47.730> tempo<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.299> going<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.629> be<00:02:48.750> slow<00:02:49.109> but<00:02:49.709> the

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
the tempo is going to be slow but the

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.949 
the tempo is going to be slow but the
movements<00:02:50.579> I<00:02:50.730> make<00:02:50.970> are<00:02:51.209> going<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.540> be<00:02:51.659> fast

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
movements I make are going to be fast

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.020 
movements I make are going to be fast
and<00:02:52.290> I'm<00:02:52.409> going<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.709> demonstrate<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.609> using

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
and I'm going to demonstrate this using

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.390 
and I'm going to demonstrate this using
the<00:02:54.120> beginning<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.689> the<00:02:55.590> Rondo<00:02:55.980> from<00:02:56.280> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the beginning of the Rondo from the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.569 
the beginning of the Rondo from the
Rondo<00:02:56.700> capriccioso<00:02:57.109> opus<00:02:58.109> 14<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.829> Mendelssohn

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
Rondo capriccioso opus 14 of Mendelssohn

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.690 
Rondo capriccioso opus 14 of Mendelssohn
so<00:03:00.480> let<00:03:01.379> me<00:03:01.500> take<00:03:01.709> this<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.159> that<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.549> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
so let me take this is that this is the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.110 
so let me take this is that this is the
eventual<00:03:03.000> speed<00:03:03.510> something<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:04.970> we<00:03:05.970> all

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
eventual speed something like we all

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.940 
eventual speed something like we all
know<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.450> piece<00:03:06.720> let<00:03:07.230> me<00:03:07.349> show<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.590> how<00:03:07.920> I

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
know that piece let me show you how I

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:24.349 
know that piece let me show you how I
would<00:03:08.099> build<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.730> slowly<00:03:22.970> do<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.060> see<00:03:24.209> how

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
would build that slowly do you see how

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.830 
would build that slowly do you see how
far<00:03:24.659> stop<00:03:25.019> all<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.220> movements<00:03:26.849> are<00:03:26.970> each<00:03:27.510> room

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
far stop all the movements are each room

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.800 
far stop all the movements are each room
movement<00:03:28.349> is<00:03:28.500> lightning<00:03:29.310> fast<00:03:29.549> so<00:03:30.269> as<00:03:30.449> soon<00:03:30.629> as

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
movement is lightning fast so as soon as

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.530 
movement is lightning fast so as soon as
I<00:03:30.930> release<00:03:31.319> these<00:03:31.590> two<00:03:31.859> keys<00:03:32.190> my<00:03:33.090> hand<00:03:33.389> is

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
I release these two keys my hand is

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.819 
I release these two keys my hand is
ready<00:03:33.870> over<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.379> next<00:03:34.829> pair<00:03:35.870> I'm<00:03:36.870> responding

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
ready over the next pair I'm responding

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.449 
ready over the next pair I'm responding
as<00:03:38.699> fast<00:03:39.180> as<00:03:39.389> as<00:03:39.540> possible

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
as fast as as possible

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.460 
as fast as as possible
up<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.000> bottom<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.510> key<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.019> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
up to the bottom of the key and the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.220 
up to the bottom of the key and the
bottom<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.919> key<00:03:44.329> rebounds<00:03:45.329> me<00:03:45.510> Springs<00:03:45.989> me

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
bottom of the key rebounds me Springs me

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.339 
bottom of the key rebounds me Springs me
up<00:03:46.379> into<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.889> next<00:03:47.160> position<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:48.109> do<00:03:49.109> you<00:03:49.199> see

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
up into the next position so do you see

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:55.490 
up into the next position so do you see
that<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:53.250> it's<00:03:53.609> slow<00:03:54.449> tempo<00:03:54.930> but<00:03:55.139> lightning

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
that so it's slow tempo but lightning

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.000 
that so it's slow tempo but lightning
fast<00:03:55.949> reflexes<00:03:56.780> lightning<00:03:57.780> fast<00:03:58.019> motions<00:03:58.709> in

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
fast reflexes lightning fast motions in

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.309 
fast reflexes lightning fast motions in
fact<00:03:59.699> that<00:03:59.910> would<00:04:00.060> be<00:04:00.209> as<00:04:00.419> fast<00:04:00.870> if<00:04:01.079> not<00:04:01.109> faster

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
fact that would be as fast if not faster

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:15.830 
fact that would be as fast if not faster
than<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:03.359> finished<00:04:03.720> product<00:04:04.410> at<00:04:04.590> speed<00:04:14.720> so<00:04:15.720> it

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
than the finished product at speed so it

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.710 
than the finished product at speed so it
goes<00:04:16.019> on<00:04:16.229> so<00:04:17.039> there<00:04:17.789> are<00:04:17.909> various<00:04:18.269> different

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
goes on so there are various different

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.020 
goes on so there are various different
types<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.260> slow<00:04:19.500> practicing<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.699> have<00:04:20.820> come

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
types of slow practicing that have come

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.909 
types of slow practicing that have come
out<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.359> this<00:04:21.510> demonstration<00:04:22.199> the<00:04:23.130> slow

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919
