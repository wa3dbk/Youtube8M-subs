I have a 33 guys here about installing
this<00:00:08.700> Arctic<00:00:09.090> 7<00:00:09.530> CPU<00:00:10.530> core<00:00:10.800> into<00:00:11.219> an<00:00:11.309> LGA<00:00:11.700> 775

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
this Arctic 7 CPU core into an LGA 775

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.930 
this Arctic 7 CPU core into an LGA 775
CPU<00:00:13.110> socket<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:14.040> isn't<00:00:14.429> an<00:00:14.610> unboxing

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
CPU socket this isn't an unboxing

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.599 
CPU socket this isn't an unboxing
obviously<00:00:15.900> desire<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.470> rapid<00:00:16.740> box<00:00:16.980> I'm

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
obviously desire to the rapid box I'm

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.070 
obviously desire to the rapid box I'm
just<00:00:17.850> going<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.029> cover<00:00:18.240> how<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.539> put<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.900> onto

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
just going to cover how to put it onto

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.130 
just going to cover how to put it onto
the<00:00:19.619> CPU<00:00:20.130> here<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.420> first<00:00:21.630> off<00:00:21.869> you're<00:00:22.109> going

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the CPU here so first off you're going

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.560 
the CPU here so first off you're going
to<00:00:22.260> notice<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.740> black<00:00:23.670> mounting<00:00:24.119> bracket

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
to notice this black mounting bracket

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.179 
to notice this black mounting bracket
what<00:00:24.810> happens<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.470> actually<00:00:25.800> goes<00:00:25.949> down

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
what happens is this actually goes down

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.490 
what happens is this actually goes down
on<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.640> motherboard<00:00:26.880> first<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:28.199> first<00:00:28.410> thing

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
on the motherboard first so first thing

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.769 
on the motherboard first so first thing
you<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.680> worry<00:00:28.859> about<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.570> you<00:00:30.570> take

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you have to worry about so you take

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.160 
you have to worry about so you take
these<00:00:30.990> little<00:00:31.980> uh<00:00:32.219> tan-colored<00:00:32.880> tab<00:00:33.809> things

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
these little uh tan-colored tab things

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.350 
these little uh tan-colored tab things
there<00:00:34.829> are<00:00:34.890> three<00:00:35.370> different<00:00:35.760> holes<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.149> here

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
there are three different holes in here

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.630 
there are three different holes in here
once<00:00:37.020> when<00:00:37.230> sirup<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.010> closest<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
once when sirup the one closest to the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.670 
once when sirup the one closest to the
center<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.899> edge<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:41.270> thing<00:00:42.270> is

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
center so that the edge of the thing is

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.799 
center so that the edge of the thing is
right<00:00:43.680> up<00:00:43.770> against<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> edge<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.370> there<00:00:44.809> keep

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
right up against the edge of there keep

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.369 
right up against the edge of there keep
that<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.200> all<00:00:46.289> four<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.190> these<00:00:47.930> just<00:00:48.930> angle<00:00:49.320> it

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that for all four of these just angle it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:58.310 
that for all four of these just angle it
focus<00:00:49.860> drop<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:54.590> now<00:00:55.940> to<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.050> put<00:00:58.260> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
focus drop one now to do is you put it

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.689 
focus drop one now to do is you put it
on<00:00:58.379> your<00:00:58.530> motherboard<00:00:58.770> now<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> manual<00:00:59.640> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
on your motherboard now in the manual it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.299 
on your motherboard now in the manual it
shows<00:01:00.210> these<00:01:00.989> screw<00:01:01.379> holes<00:01:01.410> being<00:01:01.829> closest<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
shows these screw holes being closest to

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.529 
shows these screw holes being closest to
the<00:01:02.399> top<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> motherboard<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.390> don't

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the top of the motherboard but you don't

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.850 
the top of the motherboard but you don't
want<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.229> want<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.650> that

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
want it like that you want it so that

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.679 
want it like that you want it so that
the<00:01:05.250> screw<00:01:05.549> holes<00:01:05.760> are<00:01:06.619> oriented<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.689> you

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the screw holes are oriented like so you

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.120 
the screw holes are oriented like so you
just<00:01:09.869> push<00:01:10.110> these<00:01:10.260> things<00:01:10.470> down<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:11.010> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
just push these things down to get you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.950 
just push these things down to get you
the<00:01:11.250> holes<00:01:11.460> they<00:01:11.820> don't<00:01:12.000> snap<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.479> quite<00:01:12.750> yet

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the holes they don't snap in quite yet

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.289 
the holes they don't snap in quite yet
so<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.470> not<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.820> offer<00:01:15.060> any

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
so it's not going to offer any

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.810 
so it's not going to offer any
resistance<00:01:16.189> now<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.250> take<00:01:17.490> these<00:01:17.610> little

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
resistance now you take these little

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.840 
resistance now you take these little
black<00:01:17.939> tabs<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.570> here<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:20.100> insert<00:01:20.700> them

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
black tabs you have here you insert them

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.440 
black tabs you have here you insert them
into<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> top<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.600> each<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.990> those<00:01:22.080> tan<00:01:22.439> tabs

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
into the top of each of those tan tabs

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.179 
into the top of each of those tan tabs
it<00:01:24.450> shouldn't<00:01:25.020> make<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.140> click<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> kind

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
it shouldn't make a click but the kind

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.469 
it shouldn't make a click but the kind
of<00:01:26.310> firmly<00:01:26.640> inserts<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:30.000> that's<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
of firmly inserts and that's it for the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.789 
of firmly inserts and that's it for the
mounting<00:01:30.810> installation<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.650> there
