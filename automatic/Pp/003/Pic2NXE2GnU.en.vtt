00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
to think that uh so you guys can maybe

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.289 
to think that uh so you guys can maybe
learn<00:01:45.780> something<00:01:45.810> from<00:01:46.579> I'm<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:48.090> forcing

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
learn something from I'm not forcing

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.929 
learn something from I'm not forcing
this<00:01:48.479> upon<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.490> see<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.610> gasps<00:01:50.820> this

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
this upon you but see that gasps this

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.270 
this upon you but see that gasps this
guy<00:01:51.149> yeah<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> reason<00:01:51.990> i<00:01:52.350> want<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.070> show<00:01:53.250> you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
guy yeah the reason i want to show you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.359 
guy yeah the reason i want to show you
this<00:01:53.369> one<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.790> mainly<00:01:54.360> tactic<00:01:54.869> based<00:01:55.369> not

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
this one is mainly tactic based not

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.399 
this one is mainly tactic based not
particularly<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:57.810> major<00:01:58.110> entertainment

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
particularly like major entertainment

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.030 
particularly like major entertainment
but<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.939> many<00:02:00.119> about<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.659> tactics<00:02:01.040> thought

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
but it is many about the tactics thought

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.620 
but it is many about the tactics thought
processes<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.939> go<00:02:03.210> Bob<00:02:03.420> their<00:02:03.780> deal<00:02:04.649> but

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
processes that go Bob their deal but

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.400 
processes that go Bob their deal but
processes<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:07.020> go<00:02:07.259> behind<00:02:07.409> it

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.729 

so<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.580> thing<00:02:12.819> about<00:02:12.970> gas<00:02:13.750> marcin<00:02:14.140> shades<00:02:14.410> is

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
so the thing about gas marcin shades is

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.740 
so the thing about gas marcin shades is
that<00:02:14.950> non<00:02:15.129> particularly<00:02:15.819> knows<00:02:16.000> when<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.420> use

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
that non particularly knows when to use

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.699 
that non particularly knows when to use
them<00:02:16.780> or<00:02:17.260> when<00:02:17.800> they<00:02:17.980> are<00:02:18.129> actually<00:02:18.519> useful<00:02:18.700> is

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
them or when they are actually useful is

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.040 
them or when they are actually useful is
I<00:02:20.940> think<00:02:21.940> maybe<00:02:22.120> if<00:02:22.269> they<00:02:22.360> combine<00:02:22.720> them<00:02:22.900> both

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
I think maybe if they combine them both

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.440 
I think maybe if they combine them both
into<00:02:23.260> one<00:02:23.500> it'll<00:02:24.370> be<00:02:24.459> more<00:02:24.640> viable<00:02:24.910> as<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.209> perk

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
into one it'll be more viable as a perk

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.530 
into one it'll be more viable as a perk
but<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:26.760> think<00:02:27.760> they<00:02:27.849> use<00:02:27.970> them<00:02:28.090> from<00:02:28.239> time<00:02:28.390> to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
but I think they use them from time to

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.449 
but I think they use them from time to
time<00:02:28.569> anyway<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.110> make<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.890> feel<00:02:30.099> like<00:02:30.280> I'm

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
time anyway to make it feel like I'm

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.050 
time anyway to make it feel like I'm
doing<00:02:31.060> something<00:02:31.269> good<00:02:31.860> huffing<00:02:32.860> huh<00:02:32.940> like<00:02:33.940> I

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
doing something good huffing huh like I

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.640 
doing something good huffing huh like I
said<00:02:34.120> it'd<00:02:34.420> be<00:02:34.510> really<00:02:34.690> easy<00:02:34.870> for<00:02:35.050> me<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.319> just

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
said it'd be really easy for me to just

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.930 
said it'd be really easy for me to just
go<00:02:35.799> ahead<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.160> stop<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.580> power<00:02:36.700> every

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
go ahead and you stop and power every

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.350 
go ahead and you stop and power every
time<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.330> would<00:02:38.260> be<00:02:38.349> easy<00:02:38.500> enough<00:02:38.739> but<00:02:39.360> doesn't

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
time it would be easy enough but doesn't

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.380 
time it would be easy enough but doesn't
feel<00:02:40.750> right<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.230> me<00:02:41.260> just<00:02:41.769> don't<00:02:41.950> want<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.390> burn

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
feel right to me just don't want to burn

want to use the gas as a special pen aid

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.809 
want to use the gas as a special pen aid
is<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.690> mainly<00:02:50.349> for<00:02:50.680> disruption<00:02:51.010> techniques

megabits yeah to megabit connection it
is<00:03:59.920> this<00:04:00.069> kind<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.340> blind<00:04:00.879> naive<00:04:01.510> optimism

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
is this kind of blind naive optimism

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.830 
is this kind of blind naive optimism
that<00:04:02.110> they<00:04:02.319> have<00:04:02.470> it's<00:04:03.400> like<00:04:03.610> it's<00:04:04.510> like<00:04:04.569> when

don't really know when it gets used

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.969 
don't really know when it gets used
because<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:01.990> only<00:05:02.110> time<00:05:02.200> you<00:05:02.350> know<00:05:02.620> you've

because the only time you know you've

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.070 
because the only time you know you've
been<00:05:03.010> gassed<00:05:03.400> is<00:05:04.180> when<00:05:04.450> you<00:05:04.600> have<00:05:04.780> actually

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
been gassed is when you have actually

been gassed there is no real visible

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.360 
been gassed there is no real visible
indication<00:05:08.350> apart<00:05:08.650> from<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.950> effects<00:05:09.250> you

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
indication apart from the effects you

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.159 
indication apart from the effects you
get<00:05:09.520> from<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:09.729> gas<00:05:09.910> but<00:05:10.810> if<00:05:10.900> you're<00:05:11.020> not

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
get from the gas but if you're not

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.960 
get from the gas but if you're not
receiving<00:05:11.530> them<00:05:11.830> how<00:05:12.220> do<00:05:12.280> you<00:05:12.430> know<00:05:12.610> when<00:05:12.850> you

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
receiving them how do you know when you

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.270 
receiving them how do you know when you
when<00:05:13.570> you<00:05:13.600> would<00:05:13.870> have<00:05:13.900> got<00:05:14.200> them<00:05:14.350> so

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
when you would have got them so

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.800 
when you would have got them so
therefore<00:05:15.520> how<00:05:15.789> do<00:05:15.850> you<00:05:16.000> know<00:05:16.090> when<00:05:16.330> gas<00:05:16.570> mask

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
therefore how do you know when gas mask

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.770 
therefore how do you know when gas mask
is<00:05:16.990> actually<00:05:17.289> being<00:05:17.710> useful<00:05:17.889> to<00:05:18.190> you<00:05:18.780> who
