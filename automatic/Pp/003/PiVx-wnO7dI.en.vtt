at the dagger XP the jagger XE is

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.529 
at the dagger XP the jagger XE is
actually<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.010> least<00:00:17.550> exciting<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.270> most

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
actually the least exciting and most

exciting of the dagger cars at this show

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.509 
exciting of the dagger cars at this show
the<00:00:21.600> reason<00:00:21.840> why<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.590> most<00:00:22.830> exciting<00:00:23.160> is

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
the reason why it's the most exciting is

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.970 
the reason why it's the most exciting is
because<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.269> competes<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:24.869> cars<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
because it competes with cars like the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.240 
because it competes with cars like the
BMW<00:00:26.130> 3<00:00:26.699> Series<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.300> audi<00:00:27.689> a4<00:00:28.019> if<00:00:28.560> dagger<00:00:29.130> is

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
BMW 3 Series and audi a4 if dagger is

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.189 
BMW 3 Series and audi a4 if dagger is
first<00:00:29.550> car<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.000> compete<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.810> midsize

first car to compete in this midsize

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.470 
first car to compete in this midsize
sedan<00:00:31.529> segment<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:32.399> also<00:00:32.579> least<00:00:33.000> exciting

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
sedan segment it's also least exciting

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.700 
sedan segment it's also least exciting
because<00:00:33.750> when<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.079> compared<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> other

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
because when you compared to the other

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.549 
because when you compared to the other
cars<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.090> dagger<00:00:36.300> range<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.380> most
