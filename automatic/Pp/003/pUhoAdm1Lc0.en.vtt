00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.550 
if somebody's wearing black contacts and
the<00:00:13.650> key<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.759> make<00:00:14.790> sure<00:00:15.560> when

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
the key to this is to make sure when

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.870 
the key to this is to make sure when
you're<00:00:16.680> taking<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> picture<00:00:17.310> here's<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
you're taking the picture here's the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.960 
you're taking the picture here's the
original<00:00:18.210> image<00:00:18.800> that<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.070> reflections<00:00:20.730> in

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
original image that the reflections in

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.470 
original image that the reflections in
the<00:00:21.150> eyes<00:00:21.330> are<00:00:21.840> really<00:00:22.230> visible<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.820> basically

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
the eyes are really visible so basically

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.460 
the eyes are really visible so basically
just<00:00:24.600> make<00:00:24.750> sure<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.990> shoot<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.410> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
just make sure you shoot it in a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.679 
just make sure you shoot it in a
well-lit<00:00:25.830> area<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:27.119> should<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:27.510> good

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
well-lit area and you should be good

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.139 
well-lit area and you should be good
first<00:00:28.140> step<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.670> create<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.420> new<00:00:30.779> layer<00:00:31.109> and

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
first step is to create a new layer and

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.380 
first step is to create a new layer and
we're<00:00:33.149> gonna<00:00:33.239> take<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:34.579> black<00:00:35.579> brush<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.210> just

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
we're gonna take a black brush and just

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.240 
we're gonna take a black brush and just
paint<00:00:36.630> black<00:00:37.020> over<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.010> general<00:00:38.940> eye<00:00:39.180> area<00:00:40.250> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
paint black over the general eye area so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.490 
paint black over the general eye area so
okay<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.210> after<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.140> we're<00:00:43.440> gonna

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
okay so after we do that we're gonna

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.410 
okay so after we do that we're gonna
make<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> layer<00:00:43.980> mask<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.610> we're<00:00:44.969> gonna<00:00:45.059> erase

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
make a layer mask and we're gonna erase

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.340 
make a layer mask and we're gonna erase
away<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.129> unwanted<00:00:47.930> areas<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.079> turn

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
away all of the unwanted areas so turn

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.470 
away all of the unwanted areas so turn
like<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.829> opacity<00:00:50.100> down<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.520> 50%<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.329> see

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
like the opacity down to 50% so you see

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.610 
like the opacity down to 50% so you see
we're<00:00:51.660> doing<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.590> erase<00:00:52.949> away

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
we're doing and just erase away

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.569 
we're doing and just erase away
everything<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.860> don't<00:00:56.070> want<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.550> just

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
alright so after we did that we're gonna

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.130 
alright so after we did that we're gonna
turn<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> opacity<00:01:06.240> back<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> hundred

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
turn the opacity back up to a hundred

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.840 
turn the opacity back up to a hundred
percent<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.549> looks<00:01:08.700> like

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
as you can see the edge is a little

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.350

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
sloppy so I'm gonna fix the edge up a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.600 
sloppy so I'm gonna fix the edge up a
little<00:01:12.510> bit

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
little bit

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
the reflections so after you have that

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.320 
the reflections so after you have that
done<00:01:47.830> turn<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.280> black<00:01:48.490> layer<00:01:48.700> back<00:01:48.909> on<00:01:49.090> and

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
away using the layer mask the white of

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.179 
away using the layer mask the white of
the<00:01:57.039> eyes<00:02:00.929> okay<00:02:01.959> next<00:02:02.409> step<00:02:02.560> after<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.950> erase

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
the eyes okay next step after you erase

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.980 
the eyes okay next step after you erase
the<00:02:03.220> white<00:02:03.549> of<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.700> eyes<00:02:03.880> you're<00:02:04.569> gonna<00:02:04.720> want

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
the white of the eyes you're gonna want

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.139 
the white of the eyes you're gonna want
to<00:02:05.049> take<00:02:05.679> each<00:02:05.950> of<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.220> eye<00:02:06.250> layers<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.970> go<00:02:07.060> to

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
to take each of the eye layers and go to

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.300 
to take each of the eye layers and go to
adjustment<00:02:07.599> levels<00:02:08.019> and<00:02:08.259> what<00:02:08.979> we're<00:02:09.099> doing

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
adjustment levels and what we're doing

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.360 
adjustment levels and what we're doing
is<00:02:09.429> darkening<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:11.170> image<00:02:11.470> down<00:02:11.769> so<00:02:12.069> all<00:02:12.250> you

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
is darkening the image down so all you

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.190 
is darkening the image down so all you
can<00:02:12.519> see<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:12.880> just<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.269> reflection<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.049> if<00:02:14.140> you

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
can see is just the reflection so if you

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.860 
can see is just the reflection so if you
see<00:02:14.349> I'm<00:02:15.280> taking<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.790> mid-tones<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.450> pushing

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
see I'm taking the mid-tones and pushing

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.220 
see I'm taking the mid-tones and pushing
them<00:02:17.019> down

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
them down

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.640 
them down
also<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.130> shadows<00:02:18.519> down<00:02:18.730> just<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.060> little<00:02:19.329> bit

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
also the shadows down just a little bit

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.140 
also the shadows down just a little bit
so<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.950> when<00:02:21.100> I<00:02:21.130> do<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:21.549> can<00:02:21.820> see<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.120> I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
so and when I do this you can see that I

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.490 
so and when I do this you can see that I
didn't<00:02:22.450> erase<00:02:22.690> everything<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.350> I'm<00:02:23.410> just

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
didn't erase everything so I'm just

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.979 
didn't erase everything so I'm just
gonna<00:02:23.590> erase<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:25.030> stuff<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.359> I<00:02:25.390> missed<00:02:25.720> and

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
gonna erase the stuff that I missed and

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.530 
gonna erase the stuff that I missed and
then<00:02:26.410> do<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.620> with<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.829> other<00:02:26.859> eye<00:02:27.480> okay<00:02:30.540> so

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
then do it with the other eye okay so

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.059 
then do it with the other eye okay so
okay<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:31.780> now<00:02:32.019> we<00:02:32.079> have<00:02:32.230> everything<00:02:32.470> darkened

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
okay so now we have everything darkened

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.830 
okay so now we have everything darkened
you<00:02:33.130> can<00:02:33.250> see<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.000> still<00:02:34.420> need<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.630> clean

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
you can see that I still need to clean

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.530 
you can see that I still need to clean
up<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.140> edges<00:02:35.290> just<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.769> little<00:02:35.799> bit<00:02:36.160> okay<00:02:37.030> so

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
up the edges just a little bit okay so

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.349 
up the edges just a little bit okay so
after<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.310> darken<00:02:39.310> both<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.329> eye

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
after you darken both the eye

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.780 
after you darken both the eye
reflections<00:02:41.049> and<00:02:41.380> cleaning<00:02:42.130> up<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.310> edges<00:02:42.430> of

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
reflections and cleaning up the edges of

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.740 
reflections and cleaning up the edges of
those<00:02:42.940> what<00:02:43.750> we're<00:02:43.870> gonna<00:02:43.959> do<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.620> burn<00:02:45.750> use

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
those what we're gonna do is burn use

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.949 
those what we're gonna do is burn use
the<00:02:46.930> burn<00:02:47.139> tool<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.709> darken<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.940> edge<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
the burn tool and darken the edge of the

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.020 
the burn tool and darken the edge of the
eyelid<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.920> blend<00:02:51.459> everything<00:02:51.639> together

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
eyelid just to blend everything together

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.240 
eyelid just to blend everything together
a<00:02:52.269> little<00:02:52.540> bit<00:02:52.690> better<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.530> what<00:02:53.859> I<00:02:53.889> did<00:02:54.130> is

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
a little bit better so what I did is

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.099 
a little bit better so what I did is
duplicated<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.000> original<00:02:55.480> layer<00:02:55.660> just<00:02:55.930> in

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
duplicated the original layer just in

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.229 
duplicated the original layer just in
case<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.350> screw<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.680> up<00:02:57.090> duplicate<00:02:58.090> that

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
case you screw it up duplicate that

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.940 
case you screw it up duplicate that
choose<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.019> burn<00:02:59.200> tool<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.709> we're<00:02:59.859> gonna

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
choose the burn tool and we're gonna

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.650 
choose the burn tool and we're gonna
want<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.340> work<00:03:00.459> with<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.819> mid-tones<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.569> the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
want to work with the mid-tones and the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.080 
want to work with the mid-tones and the
shadows<00:03:02.109> so<00:03:02.829> I<00:03:03.160> turned<00:03:03.459> down<00:03:03.609> the<00:03:03.670> exposure

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
shadows so I turned down the exposure

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.890 
shadows so I turned down the exposure
pretty<00:03:04.989> low<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.769> think<00:03:06.459> it's<00:03:06.549> at<00:03:06.639> like<00:03:06.760> 36%<00:03:07.750> and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
pretty low I think it's at like 36% and

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.289 
pretty low I think it's at like 36% and
just<00:03:08.440> go<00:03:08.980> along<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.340> edge<00:03:09.489> of<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.850> eyelid

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
just go along the edge of the eyelid

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.270 
just go along the edge of the eyelid
until<00:03:11.049> it's<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.260> little<00:03:11.530> bit<00:03:11.650> darker<00:03:12.040> because

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
until it's a little bit darker because

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.690 
until it's a little bit darker because
what<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.579> don't<00:03:12.760> want<00:03:12.910> is<00:03:13.829> like<00:03:14.829> a<00:03:15.160> little<00:03:15.519> bit

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
what you don't want is like a little bit

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.160 
what you don't want is like a little bit
of<00:03:15.850> white<00:03:16.090> showing<00:03:16.389> from<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.810> original

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
of white showing from the original

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.840 
of white showing from the original
eyeball<00:03:17.530> let's<00:03:18.160> be<00:03:18.310> careful<00:03:18.670> with<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
eyeball let's be careful with the

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.129 
eyeball let's be careful with the
shadows<00:03:19.209> you're<00:03:19.389> gonna<00:03:19.480> want<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.780> turn<00:03:20.019> the

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
shadows you're gonna want to turn the

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.690 
shadows you're gonna want to turn the
exposure<00:03:20.500> down<00:03:20.739> a<00:03:20.769> lot<00:03:21.040> otherwise<00:03:21.370> just<00:03:21.549> gonna

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
exposure down a lot otherwise just gonna

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.960 
exposure down a lot otherwise just gonna
get<00:03:21.850> really<00:03:22.000> dark<00:03:22.439> okay<00:03:23.439> so<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.580> looks<00:03:24.760> pretty

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
get really dark okay so it looks pretty

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.420 
get really dark okay so it looks pretty
good<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:25.330> far<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:26.560> reflections<00:03:27.040> are<00:03:27.129> a<00:03:27.189> little

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
good so far the reflections are a little

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.410 
good so far the reflections are a little
bit<00:03:27.670> dark

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
bit dark

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.240 
bit dark
so<00:03:28.480> what<00:03:28.630> I'm<00:03:28.720> gonna<00:03:28.840> do<00:03:29.110> is<00:03:29.260> duplicate<00:03:29.770> each

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
so what I'm gonna do is duplicate each

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.559 
so what I'm gonna do is duplicate each
of<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.730> eye<00:03:31.240> reflections<00:03:31.990> and<00:03:33.450> what<00:03:34.450> we're

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
of the eye reflections and what we're

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.180 
of the eye reflections and what we're
gonna<00:03:34.660> do<00:03:34.930> from<00:03:35.140> there<00:03:35.380> is<00:03:35.650> take<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:37.110> top

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
gonna do from there is take the top

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.650 
gonna do from there is take the top
layers<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.640> put<00:03:40.450> them<00:03:40.630> both<00:03:40.810> on<00:03:41.080> an<00:03:41.440> ADD<00:03:41.739> mode

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
layers and put them both on an ADD mode

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.559 
layers and put them both on an ADD mode
that<00:03:43.660> that'll<00:03:44.110> bring<00:03:44.290> out<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.590> reflection

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
that that'll bring out the reflection

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.809 
that that'll bring out the reflection
quite<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.600> bit<00:03:46.920> it's<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:48.040> little<00:03:48.280> bit<00:03:48.400> too<00:03:48.610> bright

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
quite a bit it's a little bit too bright

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.809 
quite a bit it's a little bit too bright
so<00:03:49.180> we're<00:03:49.330> gonna<00:03:49.420> take<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.080> opacity<00:03:50.950> down<00:03:51.370> of

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
so we're gonna take the opacity down of

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
to adjustment layer color lookup and I

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.330 
to adjustment layer color lookup and I
just<00:04:07.030> found<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.239> cool<00:04:07.450> preset<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.950> ended<00:04:09.280> up

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
just found a cool preset it ended up

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.800 
just found a cool preset it ended up
being<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.640> little<00:04:09.730> bit<00:04:09.880> too<00:04:09.970> strong<00:04:10.360> so<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.600> took

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
being a little bit too strong so I took

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.570 
being a little bit too strong so I took
it<00:04:10.900> down<00:04:10.989> about<00:04:11.140> 50%<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:12.160> next<00:04:12.400> thing<00:04:12.549> that

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
it down about 50% the next thing that

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.160 
it down about 50% the next thing that
I'm<00:04:12.790> gonna<00:04:12.910> do<00:04:13.090> is<00:04:13.269> add<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.450> selective<00:04:13.959> color

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
I'm gonna do is add a selective color

a circle or oval marquee tool and then
pick<00:04:51.669> refine<00:04:52.150> edge<00:04:52.450> and<00:04:52.810> then<00:04:53.289> what<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:53.890> do<00:04:54.010> is<00:04:54.130> I

pick refine edge and then what I do is I

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.460 
pick refine edge and then what I do is I
turn<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.729> feather<00:04:54.940> up<00:04:55.180> a<00:04:55.390> lot<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:56.020> then<00:04:56.200> do

shift<00:04:56.800> edge<00:04:57.070> just<00:04:57.850> to<00:04:57.940> push<00:04:58.120> it<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.390> the

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
shift edge just to push it to the

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.990 
shift edge just to push it to the
outside<00:04:58.660> and<00:04:59.229> then<00:04:59.620> if<00:04:59.740> you<00:04:59.860> pick<00:05:00.039> layer<00:05:00.700> mask

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
outside and then if you pick layer mask

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.570 
outside and then if you pick layer mask
tool<00:05:01.300> it'll<00:05:01.570> automatically<00:05:02.280> add<00:05:03.280> that

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
tool it'll automatically add that

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.279 
tool it'll automatically add that
selection<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.180> layer<00:05:04.419> mask<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:05.080> then<00:05:05.200> you

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
selection to the layer mask and then you

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.200 
selection to the layer mask and then you
want<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.560> do<00:05:05.740> you're<00:05:06.460> gonna<00:05:06.580> want<00:05:06.850> to<00:05:06.910> invert

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
want to do you're gonna want to invert

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.830 
want to do you're gonna want to invert
the<00:05:07.419> mask<00:05:07.630> do<00:05:08.140> ctrl<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:08.800> invert<00:05:09.130> it<00:05:09.550> and<00:05:09.669> then

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.380 
both layers on overlay mode and then I
turn<00:05:19.539> down<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:19.870> opacity<00:05:19.900> of<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.530> top<00:05:20.740> one<00:05:21.390> all
