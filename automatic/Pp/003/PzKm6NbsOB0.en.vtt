00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.160
 hello very good everyone I'm imp and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.780
 I bring you a new trick to talk 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.210
 against the multiplayer for any 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.160
 game mode and any map is worth 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.560
 so that the enemy turrets do not 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.390
 cause no harm and good the truth if 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.099
 is that it is very easy to put us the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.680
 turret where we want us 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.630
 let's avoid it, how are we going to do this? 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.270
 we will need the tomahawk or the load of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.230
 shock and we will have to look down 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.340
 It's worth everything we can once 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.629
 we are looking down with the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.670
 tomahawk with the shock load 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.829
 holding on we have to walk for the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.170
 turret or to the opposite side of the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.930
 laterally turret is never worth 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.579
 front or back sideways like this 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.649
 It will not hurt us if we do it right as 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.140
 You see, it will not hurt us, we can 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.600
 escape from the turret without suffering 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.370
 damage and good this serves for online 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600
 as I said but now I was 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.250
 recording in private to make it more 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 easy to record it worth I thank 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.489
 war since he gave me help 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.900
 you will have bucharest in the description and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.000
 good I leave you with the video voucher 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.290
 Let's see if we reach 300 likes 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.260
 also that if you are doing this and 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.480
 past the enemy in front of the turret 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.070
 to them it will kill them because they get 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.470
 in the path of the turret blade 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.330
 because it is shooting but it is not 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.380
 It hurts worth and good I leave it with the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.380
 video and until next time 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.940
 Y 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.680
 and 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.400
 the roles in it
