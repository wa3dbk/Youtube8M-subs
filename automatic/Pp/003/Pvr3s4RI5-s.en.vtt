00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
we're now going to have a look at simple

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.579 
we're now going to have a look at simple
if<00:00:02.550> statements

00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:03.589 
if statements

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.820 
if statements
now<00:00:04.940> don't<00:00:05.940> worry<00:00:06.089> statements<00:00:06.930> aren't<00:00:07.140> overly

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
now don't worry statements aren't overly

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.640 
now don't worry statements aren't overly
that<00:00:08.010> complicated<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.450> engulf<00:00:10.200> pair<00:00:10.440> there's

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
that complicated in engulf pair there's

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.440 
that complicated in engulf pair there's
two<00:00:10.800> ways<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.099> doing<00:00:11.160> if<00:00:11.670> statement<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.360> I'm

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
two ways of doing if statement so I'm

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.900 
two ways of doing if statement so I'm
gonna<00:00:12.630> show<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.139> both<00:00:13.410> ways<00:00:13.639> but<00:00:14.639> I'm<00:00:14.790> gonna

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
gonna show you both ways but I'm gonna

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.120 
gonna show you both ways but I'm gonna
concentrate<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.870> one<00:00:16.109> way<00:00:16.320> because<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:17.010> is

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
concentrate on one way because this is

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.679 
concentrate on one way because this is
the<00:00:17.250> way<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:18.300> prefer<00:00:18.570> doing<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:20.689> also

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
the way that I just prefer doing it also

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.000 
the way that I just prefer doing it also
we're<00:00:21.840> gonna<00:00:21.960> walk<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.380> using<00:00:22.769> else

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
we're gonna walk it using else

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.210 
we're gonna walk it using else
statements<00:00:23.670> else<00:00:23.970> if<00:00:24.359> statements<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.289> we're

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
statements else if statements and we're

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.609 
statements else if statements and we're
gonna<00:00:26.310> incorporate<00:00:26.760> all<00:00:27.330> these<00:00:27.570> into<00:00:28.260> this

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
gonna incorporate all these into this

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.339 
gonna incorporate all these into this
one<00:00:28.890> tutorial<00:00:29.599> so<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:30.779> might<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:30.960> remote

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
one tutorial so what might we remote

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.459 
one tutorial so what might we remote
connected<00:00:32.540> I'm<00:00:33.540> gonna<00:00:33.809> let<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.140> now

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
on the other hand if you might be only

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.689 
on the other hand if you might be only
have<00:00:55.500> one<00:00:55.680> remote<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.340> case<00:00:56.520> you'll<00:00:56.670> be

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
have one remote in that case you'll be

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.279 
have one remote in that case you'll be
referring<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.600> first<00:00:57.780> Wii<00:00:57.989> Remote

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
referring to the first Wii Remote

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.410 
referring to the first Wii Remote
however<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.609> your<00:00:59.820> possession<00:01:00.270> at<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
however if you have your possession at a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.299 
however if you have your possession at a
third<00:01:00.719> wheel<00:01:00.930> remote<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.770> st.<00:01:02.129> you

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
third wheel remote that you st. you

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.470 
third wheel remote that you st. you
could<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.579> using<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.879> third<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.420> you

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
could be using your third one so you

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.299 
could be using your third one so you
need<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.809> replace<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.650> number<00:01:04.920> two<00:01:05.070> with

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
need to replace the number two with

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.899 
need to replace the number two with
whatever<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:06.180> remote<00:01:06.479> you're<00:01:06.659> actually<00:01:07.049> using

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
whatever we remote you're actually using

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.010 
whatever we remote you're actually using
so<00:01:09.350> let's<00:01:10.350> get<00:01:10.590> started<00:01:11.420> basic<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.540> statement

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so let's get started basic if statement

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.700 
so let's get started basic if statement
just<00:01:13.530> looks<00:01:13.740> something<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:17.960> if<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.680> go

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
just looks something like this if we go

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:30.310 
just looks something like this if we go
if<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:22.130> note<00:01:25.700> one<00:01:26.700> dot<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.650> equals<00:01:28.650> true<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
if we note one dot a equals true and

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.840 
if we note one dot a equals true and
then<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.409> put<00:01:31.560> an<00:01:31.650> open<00:01:31.799> square<00:01:32.189> bracket<00:01:32.340> on

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
then we put an open square bracket on

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.810 
then we put an open square bracket on
the<00:01:33.000> same<00:01:33.210> line<00:01:33.509> next<00:01:34.079> line<00:01:34.290> down<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.610> now

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the same line next line down and now

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.480 
the same line next line down and now
we're<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> use<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.659> debug<00:01:37.110> tool<00:01:37.490> now

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
we're going to use the debug tool now

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.230 
we're going to use the debug tool now
our<00:01:38.610> debug<00:01:39.180> allows<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.860> output<00:01:41.189> data<00:01:41.670> that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
our debug allows you to output data that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.789 
our debug allows you to output data that
we<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.570> actually<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:43.079> while<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.439> scripts

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
we can actually see while the scripts

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.990 
we can actually see while the scripts
running<00:01:44.009> I'm<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.640> show<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.850> brief

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
running I'm going to show you a brief

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.130 
running I'm going to show you a brief
example<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:46.110> use<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> command<00:01:47.040> D<00:01:47.659> bug<00:01:48.659> just

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
example you use the command D bug just

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.289 
example you use the command D bug just
move<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> mouse<00:01:49.470> out<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> way<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:51.119> they

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
move the mouse out the way and then they

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.090 
move the mouse out the way and then they
equal<00:01:51.899> something<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.590> put<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.950> in

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
equal something and you put this in

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.340 
equal something and you put this in
speech<00:01:53.670> brackets<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:54.420> gonna<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.990> put<00:01:55.229> in

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
speech brackets I'm gonna just put in

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.100 
speech brackets I'm gonna just put in
test<00:01:55.969> then<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.210> next<00:01:57.450> line<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:57.840> gonna<00:01:57.990> do

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
test then on the next line I'm gonna do

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.499 
test then on the next line I'm gonna do
a<00:01:58.140> closed<00:01:58.500> roller<00:01:59.159> bracket<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.240> between

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
a closed roller bracket so in between

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.630 
a closed roller bracket so in between
those<00:02:00.750> two<00:02:00.990> brackets<00:02:01.530> goes<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.310> code

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
those two brackets goes all that code

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.910 
those two brackets goes all that code
that<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:02.939> want<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.360> happen<00:02:03.600> if<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.439> press<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
that we want to happen if we press a

now<00:02:49.280> there's<00:02:49.520> another<00:02:49.670> way<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:49.910> writing<00:02:50.090> this

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
now there's another way of writing this

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.120 
now there's another way of writing this
if<00:02:50.540> statement<00:02:50.690> without<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.500> brackets<00:02:51.920> if<00:02:52.100> you

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
prefer this way and all we do is we

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.190 
prefer this way and all we do is we
don't<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:55.760> an<00:02:56.030> Open<00:02:56.450> bracket<00:02:56.480> we<00:02:56.930> don't<00:02:57.110> have

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
don't have an Open bracket we don't have

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.660 
don't have an Open bracket we don't have
a<00:02:57.260> closed<00:02:57.470> bracket<00:02:57.739> but<00:02:58.100> at<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.280> end<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.550> the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
a closed bracket but at the end of the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.280 
a closed bracket but at the end of the
statement<00:02:59.030> would<00:02:59.330> type<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.900> if<00:03:00.790> like<00:03:01.790> so

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
statement would type in and if like so

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.220 
statement would type in and if like so
as<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.560> can<00:03:03.650> see<00:03:03.709> that<00:03:04.040> does<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.340> same<00:03:04.580> thing

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
as you can see that does the same thing

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.840 
as you can see that does the same thing
that<00:03:06.230> those<00:03:06.860> are<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.070> two<00:03:07.250> ways<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.550> doing<00:03:07.670> if

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
that those are the two ways of doing if

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.490 
that those are the two ways of doing if
statements<00:03:08.590> personally<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:10.450> do<00:03:11.450> prefer<00:03:11.840> the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
statements personally I do prefer the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.600 
statements personally I do prefer the
other<00:03:13.489> method<00:03:13.930> just<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.200> me<00:03:15.500> it's<00:03:15.800> a<00:03:16.100> lot

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
other method just to me it's a lot

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.550 
other method just to me it's a lot
better<00:03:18.190> now<00:03:19.190> we're<00:03:19.670> gonna<00:03:19.790> actually<00:03:20.000> just

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
better now we're gonna actually just

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.710 
better now we're gonna actually just
modify<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:21.620> if<00:03:21.860> statement<00:03:22.370> slightly<00:03:23.060> so

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
modify this if statement slightly so

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.199 
modify this if statement slightly so
that<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:24.080> only<00:03:24.230> outputs<00:03:24.799> test<00:03:25.190> when<00:03:25.519> both<00:03:25.880> Wii

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
that it only outputs test when both Wii

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.630 
that it only outputs test when both Wii
Remote<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.500> button<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.130> B<00:03:28.250> button<00:03:28.519> I

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640

so this is where brackets come in so

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.690 
so this is where brackets come in so
when<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.000> put<00:03:32.239> brackets<00:03:33.310> I'm<00:03:34.310> gonna<00:03:34.489> put

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
really nicely now we're gonna look at

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.449 
really nicely now we're gonna look at
something<00:04:07.910> called<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.660> else<00:04:09.019> oh<00:04:09.500> by<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.310> way

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
something called and else oh by the way

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.210 
something called and else oh by the way
we<00:04:10.730> could<00:04:10.940> stick<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.540> an<00:04:11.660> R<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.590> R<00:04:12.950> if<00:04:13.190> we

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
we could stick that to an R and R if we

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.960 
we could stick that to an R and R if we
wanted<00:04:14.079> so<00:04:15.079> we<00:04:15.350> could<00:04:15.500> either<00:04:15.590> press<00:04:15.860> A<00:04:16.010> or<00:04:16.609> B

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
wanted so we could either press A or B

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.539 
wanted so we could either press A or B
but<00:04:17.769> currently<00:04:18.769> as<00:04:18.919> I<00:04:19.010> said<00:04:19.190> we're<00:04:19.310> going<00:04:19.459> to

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
but currently as I said we're going to

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.750 
but currently as I said we're going to
just<00:04:19.700> look<00:04:19.970> at<00:04:20.090> an<00:04:20.390> else<00:04:20.780> statement<00:04:21.370> now<00:04:22.370> an

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
just look at an else statement now an

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.029 
just look at an else statement now an
else<00:04:22.970> statement<00:04:23.289> goes<00:04:24.289> in<00:04:24.500> between<00:04:24.650> the

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
else statement goes in between the

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.420 
else statement goes in between the
brackets

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
brackets

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.100 
brackets
so<00:04:27.430> we<00:04:27.790> have<00:04:27.940> our<00:04:27.970> open<00:04:28.390> bracket<00:04:28.750> we<00:04:28.840> have<00:04:28.990> the

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
so we have our open bracket we have the

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.470 
so we have our open bracket we have the
code<00:04:29.350> we<00:04:29.470> want<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:29.800> do<00:04:29.980> we<00:04:30.850> then<00:04:30.970> stick<00:04:31.240> in<00:04:31.360> an

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
code we want to do we then stick in an

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.320 
code we want to do we then stick in an
else<00:04:31.660> statement<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.500> then<00:04:33.460> we<00:04:33.640> can<00:04:33.820> stick<00:04:34.120> in

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
else statement and then we can stick in

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.190 
else statement and then we can stick in
something<00:04:34.960> like<00:04:35.370> this<00:04:36.370> let's<00:04:36.850> say<00:04:37.000> debug<00:04:37.810> is

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
something like this let's say debug is

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.990 
something like this let's say debug is
going<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.590> equal<00:04:40.200> not<00:04:41.200> so<00:04:42.160> we<00:04:42.400> can<00:04:42.580> remove<00:04:42.820> this

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
going to equal not so we can remove this

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.750 
going to equal not so we can remove this
debug<00:04:43.390> statement<00:04:43.750> at<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.900> top<00:04:44.080> now<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:45.580> we

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
debug statement at the top now so we

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.260 
debug statement at the top now so we
have<00:04:46.000> our<00:04:46.840> code<00:04:47.910> then<00:04:48.910> we<00:04:48.940> have<00:04:49.570> oh<00:04:51.150> by<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.180> way

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
have our code then we have oh by the way

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.240 
have our code then we have oh by the way
something<00:04:52.540> I<00:04:52.690> forgot<00:04:52.930> to<00:04:53.050> mention<00:04:53.170> you<00:04:53.590> see

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
something I forgot to mention you see

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.710 
something I forgot to mention you see
this<00:04:54.400> bit<00:04:54.580> here<00:04:54.820> we<00:04:54.970> don't<00:04:55.120> need<00:04:55.300> to<00:04:55.450> put

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
this bit here we don't need to put

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.280 
this bit here we don't need to put
equals<00:04:56.380> true<00:04:57.300> whenever<00:04:58.300> you<00:04:58.660> refer<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.170> the

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
equals true whenever you refer to the

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.220 
equals true whenever you refer to the
Wii<00:04:59.410> remotes<00:04:59.800> you<00:05:00.190> can<00:05:00.970> actually<00:05:01.120> go<00:05:01.510> if<00:05:01.900> we

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
Wii remotes you can actually go if we

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.540 
Wii remotes you can actually go if we
melt<00:05:02.560> a<00:05:03.480> and<00:05:04.480> what<00:05:05.320> that<00:05:05.500> basically<00:05:05.710> says<00:05:06.220> if

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
melt a and what that basically says if

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.940 
melt a and what that basically says if
the<00:05:07.030> Wii<00:05:07.150> Remote<00:05:07.480> button<00:05:07.720> is<00:05:07.810> pressed<00:05:08.110> then<00:05:08.740> do

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
the Wii Remote button is pressed then do

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.150 
the Wii Remote button is pressed then do
the<00:05:09.070> following<00:05:09.340> code<00:05:09.640> you<00:05:09.880> see<00:05:10.500> so<00:05:11.500> you<00:05:11.950> don't

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
the following code you see so you don't

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.830 
the following code you see so you don't
actually<00:05:12.310> if<00:05:12.580> if<00:05:12.820> you<00:05:13.000> want<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.330> check<00:05:13.480> C<00:05:13.690> for

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
actually if if you want to check C for

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.090 
actually if if you want to check C for
buttons<00:05:14.170> press<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.530> don't<00:05:14.560> need<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.860> put<00:05:15.010> your

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
buttons press you don't need to put your

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.700 
buttons press you don't need to put your
for<00:05:15.220> equals<00:05:15.580> true<00:05:15.940> if<00:05:16.270> you<00:05:16.690> just<00:05:16.840> put<00:05:17.050> if<00:05:17.260> we

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
for equals true if you just put if we

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.640 
for equals true if you just put if we
remote<00:05:17.980> dot<00:05:18.160> a<00:05:18.370> and<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:19.540> says<00:05:19.960> there<00:05:20.170> if<00:05:20.350> we

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
remote dot a and it says there if we

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.160 
remote dot a and it says there if we
remote<00:05:20.920> that<00:05:21.040> a<00:05:21.190> are<00:05:21.460> we're<00:05:21.970> not<00:05:22.210> B<00:05:22.630> it<00:05:23.080> means

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
remote that a are we're not B it means

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.740 
remote that a are we're not B it means
if<00:05:23.380> either<00:05:23.710> buttons<00:05:24.190> pressed<00:05:24.490> so<00:05:25.450> it's<00:05:25.570> just

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
if either buttons pressed so it's just

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.720 
if either buttons pressed so it's just
it's<00:05:25.990> just<00:05:26.050> a<00:05:26.260> way<00:05:27.040> that<00:05:27.190> you<00:05:27.250> can<00:05:27.400> reduce<00:05:27.670> your

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
it's just a way that you can reduce your

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.600 
it's just a way that you can reduce your
code<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.950> really<00:05:29.950> speed<00:05:30.190> up<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.460> way<00:05:30.580> that

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
code and really speed up the way that

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.670 
code and really speed up the way that
runs<00:05:31.030> because<00:05:31.690> it's<00:05:31.990> got<00:05:32.140> less<00:05:32.290> code<00:05:32.530> to

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
runs because it's got less code to

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:40.410 
runs because it's got less code to
process<00:05:37.050> so<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:39.520> Claude<00:05:39.850> anyway<00:05:40.120> we<00:05:40.270> have<00:05:40.390> a

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
process so this Claude anyway we have a

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.960 
process so this Claude anyway we have a
open<00:05:40.870> square<00:05:41.110> bracket<00:05:41.230> we<00:05:41.890> have<00:05:42.100> a<00:05:42.130> stuff<00:05:42.880> we

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
open square bracket we have a stuff we

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.190 
open square bracket we have a stuff we
want<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.270> do<00:05:43.390> we<00:05:43.660> then<00:05:43.780> have<00:05:43.900> an<00:05:44.020> else

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
want to do we then have an else

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.590 
want to do we then have an else
statement<00:05:44.320> and<00:05:44.950> then<00:05:45.669> we<00:05:45.760> have<00:05:45.970> our<00:05:46.419> other

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
statement and then we have our other

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.450 
statement and then we have our other
stuff<00:05:46.810> who<00:05:46.930> want<00:05:47.080> to<00:05:47.169> do<00:05:47.260> now<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.190> else

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
stuff who want to do now the else

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.670 
stuff who want to do now the else
statement<00:05:48.640> this<00:05:49.150> happens<00:05:49.690> if<00:05:49.990> either<00:05:50.440> of

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
statement this happens if either of

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.970 
statement this happens if either of
these<00:05:51.040> conditions<00:05:51.220> up<00:05:51.730> here<00:05:51.760> are<00:05:52.120> not<00:05:52.419> true<00:05:52.980> so

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
these conditions up here are not true so

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.280 
these conditions up here are not true so
basically<00:05:54.400> if<00:05:54.669> the<00:05:55.000> ableton<00:05:55.570> and<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:56.080> B

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
basically if the ableton and the B

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.350 
basically if the ableton and the B
button<00:05:56.500> are<00:05:56.740> both<00:05:57.070> but<00:05:57.550> both<00:05:57.850> of<00:05:58.000> them<00:05:58.120> are<00:05:58.210> not

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
button are both but both of them are not

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.090 
button are both but both of them are not
pressed<00:05:58.690> then<00:05:59.110> it<00:05:59.230> will<00:05:59.350> do<00:05:59.470> the<00:05:59.620> else<00:05:59.770> part

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
pressed then it will do the else part

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.220 
pressed then it will do the else part
and<00:06:00.460> then<00:06:01.120> after<00:06:01.419> that<00:06:01.540> we<00:06:01.660> have<00:06:01.810> our<00:06:01.840> close

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
and then after that we have our close

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.200 
and then after that we have our close
square<00:06:02.470> bracket<00:06:02.980> to<00:06:03.070> end<00:06:03.220> the<00:06:03.310> statement<00:06:03.820> so

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
square bracket to end the statement so

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.450 
square bracket to end the statement so
you<00:06:04.270> see<00:06:04.450> neither<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.320> ARB<00:06:05.710> but<00:06:06.070> in<00:06:06.160> a<00:06:06.220> press

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
you see neither the ARB but in a press

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.540 
you see neither the ARB but in a press
so<00:06:06.640> it<00:06:06.700> says<00:06:06.880> note<00:06:07.120> I<00:06:07.419> press<00:06:08.080> either<00:06:08.440> the<00:06:08.650> a<00:06:08.740> all

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
so it says note I press either the a all

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.610 
so it says note I press either the a all
the<00:06:09.880> B<00:06:10.000> button<00:06:10.330> it<00:06:10.570> says<00:06:10.930> test<00:06:13.140> to<00:06:14.140> change<00:06:14.440> that

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
the B button it says test to change that

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.300 
the B button it says test to change that
again<00:06:14.740> to<00:06:15.160> and<00:06:15.520> and<00:06:15.820> if<00:06:16.090> I<00:06:16.180> wanted<00:06:17.310> so

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
again to and and if I wanted so

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.940 
again to and and if I wanted so
basically<00:06:18.760> it<00:06:19.630> will<00:06:19.840> always<00:06:20.320> do<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:20.560> else

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
basically it will always do the else

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.100 
basically it will always do the else
unless<00:06:21.760> both<00:06:21.940> the<00:06:22.150> a<00:06:22.180> and<00:06:22.330> B<00:06:22.660> button<00:06:22.990> are

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
unless both the a and B button are

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.740 
unless both the a and B button are
pressed<00:06:23.410> on<00:06:23.850> their<00:06:24.850> own<00:06:25.000> they<00:06:25.210> do<00:06:25.270> nothing

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
pressed on their own they do nothing

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.370 
pressed on their own they do nothing
together<00:06:26.350> it<00:06:26.620> says<00:06:26.860> test<00:06:28.050> so<00:06:29.050> that's<00:06:29.140> using

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
together it says test so that's using

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.950 
together it says test so that's using
else<00:06:29.830> finally<00:06:30.669> we<00:06:31.000> can<00:06:31.180> do<00:06:31.390> something<00:06:31.780> called

else finally we can do something called

moat<00:06:44.810> -<00:06:45.410> dot<00:06:45.770> -<00:06:49.510> so<00:06:53.350> so<00:06:54.350> basically<00:06:54.940> if<00:06:55.940> I<00:06:56.090> press

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
moat - dot - so so basically if I press

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.010 
moat - dot - so so basically if I press
a<00:06:56.570> and<00:06:56.870> B<00:06:57.020> says<00:06:57.350> test<00:06:57.970> if<00:06:58.970> I<00:06:59.060> press<00:06:59.240> -<00:06:59.690> it<00:06:59.840> says

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
a and B says test if I press - it says

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.800 
a and B says test if I press - it says
note<00:07:00.320> and<00:07:00.650> that's<00:07:01.400> the<00:07:01.610> difference<00:07:02.060> so

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
note and that's the difference so

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.740 
note and that's the difference so
basically<00:07:03.290> if<00:07:04.070> I<00:07:04.340> press<00:07:04.670> a<00:07:04.850> and<00:07:05.180> B<00:07:05.330> and<00:07:05.540> then

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
basically if I press a and B and then

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.070 
basically if I press a and B and then
press<00:07:06.050> -<00:07:06.310> nothing<00:07:07.310> happens<00:07:07.700> because<00:07:08.510> this

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080

previous condition is not true so if we

remote if the a and the B button aren't
press<00:07:17.750> then<00:07:17.990> it<00:07:18.110> will<00:07:18.200> go<00:07:18.350> to<00:07:18.410> the<00:07:18.620> elsif<00:07:19.040> and

press then it will go to the elsif and

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.340 
press then it will go to the elsif and
check<00:07:19.550> to<00:07:19.670> see<00:07:19.790> if<00:07:19.850> the<00:07:19.970> -<00:07:20.330> buttons<00:07:20.630> pressed<00:07:20.930> if

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
check to see if the - buttons pressed if

check to see if the - buttons pressed if
it<00:07:21.710> is<00:07:21.860> it<00:07:22.010> all<00:07:22.130> then<00:07:22.340> run<00:07:22.550> the<00:07:22.670> code<00:07:22.990> so<00:07:23.990> that's

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.110 
it is it all then run the code so that's

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.530 
it is it all then run the code so that's

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:47.570 
a better understanding of it but really

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.410 
a better understanding of it but really

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:50.420 
scripting Ingle of Pi you do need a bit

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.530 
scripting Ingle of Pi you do need a bit

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:53.540 
of a basis for programming and I'm not

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.750 
of a basis for programming and I'm not
really<00:07:53.810> gonna<00:07:53.930> go<00:07:54.110> in<00:07:54.230> depth<00:07:54.500> on<00:07:54.800> it<00:07:54.860> over<00:07:55.640> and

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:55.760 
really gonna go in depth on it over and

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.520 
really gonna go in depth on it over and
over<00:07:55.850> again<00:07:55.970> because<00:07:56.300> if<00:07:56.450> I<00:07:56.570> do<00:07:56.630> that<00:07:56.960> I'll<00:07:57.170> all

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:57.530 
over again because if I do that I'll all

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.290 
over again because if I do that I'll all
the<00:07:57.830> tutors<00:07:58.190> on<00:07:58.400> the<00:07:58.490> set<00:07:58.700> will<00:07:58.850> be<00:07:58.880> really

00:07:59.290 --> 00:07:59.300 
the tutors on the set will be really

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.730 
the tutors on the set will be really
boring<00:07:59.600> if<00:07:59.960> you've<00:08:00.110> actually<00:08:00.230> got<00:08:00.530> some

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:00.740 
boring if you've actually got some

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.100 
boring if you've actually got some
programming<00:08:01.220> experience<00:08:01.460> in<00:08:01.880> the<00:08:01.970> past<00:08:02.180> so

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.110 
programming experience in the past so

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.350 
programming experience in the past so
that<00:08:03.770> is<00:08:03.920> all<00:08:04.070> I'm<00:08:04.190> gonna<00:08:04.340> cover<00:08:04.580> in<00:08:04.940> this

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 
that is all I'm gonna cover in this

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.420 
that is all I'm gonna cover in this
tutorial
