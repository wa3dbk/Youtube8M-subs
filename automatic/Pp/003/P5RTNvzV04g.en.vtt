00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.170 
flashes a skirt and leg and the shadow
of<00:01:24.229> what<00:01:24.440> could<00:01:24.920> be<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.310> brass<00:01:25.640> but<00:01:25.940> i'm<00:01:26.060> not

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
of what could be the brass but i'm not

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.280 
of what could be the brass but i'm not
sure<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:26.479> i<00:01:26.630> don't<00:01:26.780> want<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:26.960> risk<00:01:27.080> looking

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
sure and i don't want to risk looking

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.020 
sure and i don't want to risk looking
for<00:01:27.620> longer<00:01:27.860> than<00:01:27.890> like<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.159> 10<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.580> second

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
for longer than like a 10 to the second

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.910 
for longer than like a 10 to the second
so<00:01:29.720> it's<00:01:29.840> sort<00:01:29.960> of<00:01:30.080> like<00:01:30.140> dumping<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.590> pieces

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
so it's sort of like dumping the pieces

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.710 
so it's sort of like dumping the pieces
of<00:01:31.010> a<00:01:31.070> puzzle<00:01:31.280> out<00:01:31.490> on<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.760> floor<00:01:31.970> looking<00:01:32.420> at
