what liquor drive means
motor<00:01:06.009> locomotive<00:01:07.009> is<00:01:07.250> actually<00:01:07.869> inside<00:01:08.869> the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
motor locomotive is actually inside the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.620 
motor locomotive is actually inside the
main<00:01:09.649> body<00:01:09.950> of<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.610> locomotive<00:01:11.240> instead<00:01:11.540> of

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
main body of the locomotive instead of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.070 
main body of the locomotive instead of
being<00:01:11.840> inside<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.320> tender<00:01:12.909> so<00:01:13.909> I'm<00:01:14.180> play<00:01:14.930> the

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
being inside the tender so I'm play the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.029 
being inside the tender so I'm play the
easiest<00:01:15.470> way<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:16.040> tell<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:17.090> difference<00:01:17.320> is<00:01:18.320> if

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
easiest way to tell the difference is if

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.649 
easiest way to tell the difference is if
the<00:01:19.189> locusts<00:01:19.520> local<00:01:19.939> trip<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.479> food

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
the locusts local trip and the food

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.550 
the locusts local trip and the food
drive<00:01:21.490> when<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:22.580> try<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:22.789> move<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:23.299> it's<00:01:24.170> the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
drive when you try to move it it's the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.469 
drive when you try to move it it's the
wheels<00:01:24.799> are<00:01:24.979> going<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.159> lock<00:01:25.429> and<00:01:25.729> then<00:01:26.090> you

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
wheels are going to lock and then you

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.450 
wheels are going to lock and then you
see<00:01:26.659> there<00:01:26.810> are<00:01:26.899> weaving<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:27.259> back<00:01:27.439> and<00:01:27.649> forth

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
see there are weaving it back and forth

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.120 
see there are weaving it back and forth
but<00:01:28.910> it's<00:01:29.060> not<00:01:29.810> really<00:01:30.080> freely<00:01:30.440> moving<00:01:30.920> the

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
but it's not really freely moving the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.330 
but it's not really freely moving the
wheels<00:01:31.340> aren't<00:01:32.830> rotating<00:01:33.830> when<00:01:33.980> I<00:01:34.010> remove<00:01:34.190> it

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
wheels aren't rotating when I remove it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.940 
wheels aren't rotating when I remove it
there<00:01:34.640> are<00:01:34.790> crystal<00:01:35.180> in<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.360> rock<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:36.440> reason

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
there are crystal in the rock and reason

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.790 
there are crystal in the rock and reason
for<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.220> as<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.520> motor<00:01:37.760> is<00:01:38.000> actually<00:01:38.800> here

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
for that as the motor is actually here

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.760 
for that as the motor is actually here
into<00:01:40.190> those<00:01:40.340> wheels<00:01:40.780> so<00:01:41.780> they're<00:01:42.410> not<00:01:42.590> going

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
into those wheels so they're not going

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.010 
into those wheels so they're not going
to<00:01:42.800> leave<00:01:43.010> unless<00:01:43.250> it's<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:44.360> motors<00:01:44.660> moving

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
to leave unless it's the motors moving

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.730 
to leave unless it's the motors moving
it<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:46.250> if<00:01:46.370> we<00:01:46.550> am<00:01:46.729> slide<00:01:47.330> this<00:01:47.479> one<00:01:47.720> along

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.340 

and<00:01:53.190> you'll<00:01:53.520> see<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:53.880> tender<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:55.200> it's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
and you'll see it's tender and it's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.210 
and you'll see it's tender and it's
quite<00:01:55.590> freely<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> result<00:01:57.890> we<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.010> tell

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
quite freely and as a result we can tell

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.300 
quite freely and as a result we can tell
that<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.729> a<00:02:00.119> local<00:02:00.750> job<00:02:01.970> just<00:02:02.970> because

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.080 

the<00:02:05.399> main<00:02:06.360> fire<00:02:06.600> locomotive<00:02:07.170> you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
the main fire locomotive you

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.850 
the main fire locomotive you
preventing<00:02:09.929> those<00:02:10.049> wheels<00:02:10.379> from<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.679> and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
preventing those wheels from you and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.479 
preventing those wheels from you and
feeling

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
feeling

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.589 
feeling
whereas<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.329> tender<00:02:12.980> moving<00:02:13.980> back<00:02:14.159> and<00:02:14.340> forth

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
whereas the tender moving back and forth

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.070 
whereas the tender moving back and forth
broader<00:02:15.599> easily

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.800 

so<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:20.640> next<00:02:20.850> look<00:02:21.000> made<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.690> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
so the next look made it this is the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.000 
so the next look made it this is the
Princess<00:02:22.710> Elizabeth<00:02:23.270> as<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.420> can<00:02:24.540> see<00:02:24.780> there

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
Princess Elizabeth as you can see there

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.900 
Princess Elizabeth as you can see there
it's<00:02:26.010> moving<00:02:26.430> quite<00:02:27.270> freely<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:28.790> recent<00:02:29.790> but

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
it's moving quite freely and recent but

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.270 
it's moving quite freely and recent but
I

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
I

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.550

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
and it's a little newer that they're

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.710 
and it's a little newer that they're

they're the ears and the fishing rods

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.830 
they're the ears and the fishing rods
are<00:02:44.750> moving<00:02:45.400> moving<00:02:46.400> freely
