00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.559
 for all of that milk and curd and there we have a fifpro tennis frei 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.140
 frodo pcf we'll drown run or not in morovis 2 courtesy of a friend told me 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.139
 who lent me the game 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.970
 this is three times and you will be 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.949
 the game seems to me that it has a balance but it feels to me 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.580
 feels like a new game because it is not or yemen and has very 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.320
 interesting and I think they are better than new challenges 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.030
 percent in general morón the challenges of the present then more competitive 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.560
 however a 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.109
 percent in the competitive prisoner swap because as I know I do not 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.110
 in the morbid was the first 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.750
 I think they are only putting me in the game because 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.880
 do not be more for example than the 25 3 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.769
 the previous one had been like 25 6 and the previous one had been 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.039
 it takes off bogado at least in maps that I know won us very 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.470
 easily 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.610
 percent and it's not because I'm terrific because I'm not 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.920
 in but because I felt that my rival sony 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.030
 Well, very bad 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.570
 Acta accepted when they are in danger maps that have to do with 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.580
 jones there are no persecuted 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.380
 I'm tweeting in this game if it's different than being a sniper in the new 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.770
 results 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.380
 there is no singing floor 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.690
 then no 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.380
 uu uu was never yours look more quickly 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.190
 i do not know why his teachers do not have hard his two costumes 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.020
 camouflage 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.210
 even after which they come 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.250
 as an abnormal 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.950
 you have to ask much more skill to shoot know what to investigate 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.390
 and by the way if you add the three I think then I'm going to leave you here 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.580
 it was not like that because it persists gambling halls 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.500
 good yes using the m 5 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.260
 the mp5 I think it's called with percent is upward they were because only by 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
 use guns that is something that is very interesting 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.290
 I have roberts 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.660
 the first pack 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.220
 it took us two wednesdays to see so is the first park is to have them min 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.189
 Critical force is like having a third weapon 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:12.429
 the missiles 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.220
 the second project is iu and upyd 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.959
 i 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.049
 and the Villarreal I think it's for estimated buying 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.330
 and this sector this before ips that in conditions 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.610
 it's something like a marathon but 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.939
 the difference that here is spent 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.239
 in new challenges in it is trying the window always come out of the other 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.379
 platinum flight 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.989
 in morbid salaries or can not run with marathon unlimitedly never tires 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.280
 aquino and that in this one is a little more realistic one if you get married when you are not 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.639
 running with be in conditions 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.039
 by the way 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:47.629
 in the former kiosks in this game others derrick x excuse 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:52.729
 haiti is firing at him to have had to compete but no no no no 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:55.619
 worse there is no interest prix other 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.549
 I do not know where you are going the sacca while I left so disparate players have 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.559
 those things and that study 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.239
 and I who thought that you worry 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.839
 verón pain of webos tm 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.079
 new challenges here there is also a principle of not being and how it is put to 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.959
 plus 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.279
 percent 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:16.069
 the jokes ex in this game is wrongly done because even after death 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.150
 but fourth quarter starts counting for trump 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.170
 porq simoca competition sex is not I do not understand is frowned for example 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.860
 if they will kill me now that they have just taken out by helicopter and will send helicopter 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.000
 after death the helicopter begins its tag to the kiosks 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.539
 Swiss experts 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:32.919
 if one is intelligent 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.539
 the prices that exist alarm toxqui you search immediately that does not take out the 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:37.239
 First 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.089
 the first to spot 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.349
 all this and what they are called 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.289
 here will send by helicopter 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.649
 i is helicopter to go to play there 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.249
 and if he wants to kill people by himself to get the 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.249
 the 100 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.969
 I mean, it seems to me that they corrected it, I move, not because I already 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:00.069
 I imagine what would have happened if people were kept on a journey and could 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.069
 starting the kiosk will make you endless 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.129
 another reason why I'm enjoying playing this game more than 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.259
 new challenges is because I'm not having the year playing here 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:13.569
 lately like the last two or three weeks practically red 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.099
 connect to any game when I connect any game immediately 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.759
 the throne is terrible and the rest can not be given 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:21.900
 and in this year 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.040
 and the other reason is because I want to practice this game it looks a lot like 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.189
 what has prevented that is going to be that no 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:28.629
 black ops 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:32.809
 for example the aspects as I said before you can not raise the sights quickly 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:35.050
 because I'm not so deep roots 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.050
 for second thing that there is not and is that the shotguns transport us to schools 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.319
 primary expressing and who died 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.719
 very smart 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:46.169
 in this game only offers much more balanced something else than in black ops not 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.319
 have this marathon although the sea to your marathon exists or to have a 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.840
 Does like this one in critical condition 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.840
 per hundred and the other the hours to see if you like us 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.719
 the this map if I know him because he does not pay the actress the other game 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.779
 but I'm going to try to upload games on maps that I do not know lizano because 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.869
 Although it's not going badly, they do not really hear me because I do not know the 

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:10.919
 maps then 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.240
 people kill other people first pull 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.560
 for these two 11 video converts it really is not an extrama tutorial 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.969
 basketry talk about some things I had in mind 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.899
 and I thank you all the time and until the next see you later
