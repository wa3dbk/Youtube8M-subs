00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.629
 the ball 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.990
 Our line seems to hop on a 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.929
 vertical trajectory up and down 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.490
 down in the wagon of a train that 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.789
 moves in the dark 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.859
 the train passes through a city if our 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.420
 change from the wagon to the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.640
 set of buildings 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.180
 we will see that the trajectory of the ball will be 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.130
 completely different to describe 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.260
 the movements of the body describe the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.460
 trajectory he traverses in his 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.920
 movement 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.129
 we need to establish a benchmark the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.040
 reference system, the reference 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.090
 to be even your computer or floor 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.170
 of the elevator 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.870
 the buildings of your city in the beginning of our 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.690
 referential will be a straight line and the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.149
 will be retine then the trajectory will be 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.210
 described by a curve in the plane 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.030
 but the movement but to be studied 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.399
 uniform velocity movement 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.610
 constant next we will study 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.280
 uniformly varied movement in 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.880
 ball by pure begins slowly and 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.159
 accelerates will increase speed stays 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.740
 behind the beginning of the movement 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.689
 but soon it reaches yellow ball to 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.920
 blue ball starts at great speed 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.409
 and slows down slows down part 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.200
 ahead but then reached by the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.470
 Yellow ball when vertical 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.090
 uniformly varied movement 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.000
 correspond to the movement of a body in 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.909
 free fall under the effect of gravity 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.530
 combining the movements of the polka dots 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.990
 red and yellow 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.280
 we will have a green ball movement 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.210
 which describes a parabolic trajectory 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.880
 document of a soccer ball 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.820
 looking from above by placing the observer in the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.650
 top of the trajectory movement 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.920
 of the green ball seems to be a 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.270
 uniform rectilinear movement of the left 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.520
 to the right with constant speed 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.679
 looking sideways placing the observer 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.660
 right or left side 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.470
 the movement of the green ball seems to 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.480
 be a varied rectilinear movement 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.410
 slows down when it rises and accelerates when 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.420
 falls for each type of movement 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.080
 we will learn to find out where the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.920
 body at what speed cioffi and what is the 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.920
 your celebration
