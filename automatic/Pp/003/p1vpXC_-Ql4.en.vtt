00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.029
 curtain on spot 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.040
 the great symbolic occurs too 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.420
 Every wrestling event is like 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.580
 the salt in the soup 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.130
 you come out and you go through the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.660
 curtain and 400 spectators or 500 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.369
 spectators or 800 spectators 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.840
 and they see you and give them 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.100
 reactions from other names too 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.109
 write the cheer you and so on 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.480
 further this is it is such a 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.529
 incredible feeling that's that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.689
 actually that's pretty wrestling 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.119
 this adrenaline also accounts for this 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.880
 this is the will to fight in the ring 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.690
 it's duel well against evil 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.670
 probably one of the reasons why 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.829
 Wrestling has millions of followers 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.790
 you simply identify with the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.680
 protagonists 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.629
 who can take which role in the ring 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 be well design thing 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.350
 the spectator has decided more or 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.239
 less who the good or bad just 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.500
 first a character as you said 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.850
 then the evil one has it though 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.430
 viewers simply decide that 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.050
 good to very good chance something 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.820
 partly after heavy physical 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.100
 Violence looks to a great extent 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.870
 the winner is already announced 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.760
 the fight is firm but who is now 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.619
 choreographed duels introduces the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.930
 strictly according to scripts run off the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.260
 In Germany, the construction of the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.430
 fighting improvises more sport less 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.710
 entertainment and New Year's Eve will be so 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.689
 that if trained today, print here 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.850
 he could immediately and wrestle with and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.890
 a red bulls or with all pasqua 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.210
 later if at the same moment 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.650
 We send the two in a match 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.570
 deny and there is no agreement 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.490
 it was not necessary at my learned right 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.950
 unprofessional and can make that up 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.750
 look the staging heroic 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.579
 are and remain essential 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.530
 components of every wrestling 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.450
 event against many 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.310
 Prejudice is just one 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.590
 demanding sport that much 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.720
 training requires the mix it does 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.850
 if I strike the permit strikes 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.040
 there really pure popping clap 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.180
 despite everything, despite this high 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.979
 sporting requirement but still 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.049
 various decency the spectator too 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.670
 entertained with their partially airy 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.829
 partially aggressive character the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.640
 people again so really directly 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.439
 speak to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.360
 then you will see what really 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.490
 there is a lot behind it 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.450
 much more sport 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.330
 maybe the stuntman is the one 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.170
 most fitting comparison to a wrestling 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.590
 acting talent is not allowed 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.780
 absence 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.819
 but without fitness nothing works 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.000
 maneuvers require both power engineering 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.470
 and time requires the motivation 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.850
 every day anew to raise 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.739
 Gym to go under the 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.180
 week to rip open the ass then on 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.500
 to stand in the ring or weekend 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.270
 in any case also in the week depending on 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.980
 where you are fighting and there 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.959
 to be victorious and a good one 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.910
 work to deliver and good a good one 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.590
 to be wrestler 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.430
 Beats and fall techniques all this can 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.410
 you learn 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.840
 but one thing must weigh you 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.010
 Charisma can be laid 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.920
 So you really have something to practice 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.050
 So you have so you have the sport 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.340
 and the stated side part show with 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.470
 The audience is like you again 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.160
 Jurassic occurs when the music plays and 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.019
 but that really is not the moral of 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.120
 the story nothing works without the 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.620
 right broadcast but also 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.620
 not without the physical fitness
