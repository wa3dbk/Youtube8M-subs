newspaper<00:00:17.939> or<00:00:18.650> catalog<00:00:19.650> pages<00:00:20.060> so<00:00:21.060> let's<00:00:21.360> get

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
newspaper or catalog pages so let's get

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.510 
newspaper or catalog pages so let's get
started

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
started

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.190 
started
first<00:00:23.520> cut<00:00:23.759> out<00:00:23.880> your<00:00:24.060> shape<00:00:24.330> from<00:00:24.570> cardboard

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
first cut out your shape from cardboard

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.950 
first cut out your shape from cardboard
I'm<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:25.949> using<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.460> cover<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.270> pill

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
I'm just using the cover of a pill

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200 
I'm just using the cover of a pill
bottle<00:00:28.350> if<00:00:28.680> your<00:00:28.949> cardboard<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.640> thin<00:00:30.000> then

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
bottle if your cardboard is thin then

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.810 
bottle if your cardboard is thin then
you'll<00:00:30.390> use<00:00:30.630> two<00:00:31.380> circles<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.400> think<00:00:32.730> this

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
you'll use two circles but I think this

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.729 
you'll use two circles but I think this
cardboard<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.660> probably<00:00:34.080> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.500> fine

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
cardboard is probably going to be fine

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.150 
cardboard is probably going to be fine
so<00:00:35.040> I'm<00:00:35.129> just<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.519> to<00:00:35.610> use<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:36.120> layer<00:00:37.160> open

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
so I'm just going to use one layer open

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.640 
so I'm just going to use one layer open
a<00:00:38.309> paper<00:00:38.610> clip<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.269> just<00:00:39.870> bend<00:00:40.080> it<00:00:40.230> back<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
a paper clip and just bend it back and

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.760 
a paper clip and just bend it back and
forth<00:00:40.920> several<00:00:41.280> times<00:00:41.670> until<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.300> breaks<00:00:42.770> find

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
forth several times until it breaks find

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.850 
forth several times until it breaks find
a<00:00:43.950> place<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.550> slide<00:00:44.880> it<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.380> through<00:00:46.380> the<00:00:46.500> slots

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
a place to slide it in through the slots

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.069 
a place to slide it in through the slots
of<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> cardboard<00:00:49.219> using<00:00:50.219> school<00:00:50.640> glue<00:00:51.079> fill

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079

the<00:00:52.350> cavity<00:00:52.920> full<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.579> glue<00:00:58.670> like<00:00:59.670> that<00:01:01.579> now

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the cavity full of glue like that now

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.790 
the cavity full of glue like that now
you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.850> either<00:01:03.000> let<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.480> dry<00:01:03.840> or<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.589> you're

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
you can either let that dry or if you're

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.010 
you can either let that dry or if you're
like<00:01:04.920> me<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.369> you're<00:01:05.550> too<00:01:05.759> impatient<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.300> let

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.040 
like me and you're too impatient to let
it<00:01:07.170> dry<00:01:07.440> then<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.160> could<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.700> take<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.270> small

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
it dry then you could just take a small

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.680 
it dry then you could just take a small
piece<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.740> paper<00:01:11.130> towel<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.789> push<00:01:12.450> that

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
into the cavity and that will just keep

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.719 
into the cavity and that will just keep
the<00:01:16.170> glue<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.530> place<00:01:16.560> while<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.250> working

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.130

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.380 
you repeat all the way around like that
this<00:01:57.620> is<00:01:57.800> all<00:01:57.980> still<00:01:58.580> probably<00:01:58.850> going<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.240> have

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
this is all still probably going to have

you can sort of pinch the edges down

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.290 
you can sort of pinch the edges down
flat<00:03:24.230> while<00:03:24.650> it's<00:03:24.890> still<00:03:25.250> not<00:03:25.459> hardened<00:03:26.060> and
