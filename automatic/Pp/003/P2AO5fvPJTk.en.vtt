to take various light measurements do
different<00:00:44.040> tests<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.489> different

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
different tests in different

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.029 
different tests in different
environments<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.840> let's<00:00:46.289> give<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.770> i

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
environments so let's give it a go and i

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.000 
environments so let's give it a go and i
have<00:00:47.309> adjusted<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.140> am<00:00:49.410> using<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
have adjusted the and I am using the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.970 
have adjusted the and I am using the
narrow<00:00:50.820> field<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.510> view<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.199> camera<00:00:52.770> so

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
narrow field of view on the camera so

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.220 
narrow field of view on the camera so
that<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.460> basically<00:00:54.239> exactly<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.020> same

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
that we get basically exactly the same

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.590 
that we get basically exactly the same
frame<00:00:55.800> or<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.129> close<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.879> get<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.420> on

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
frame or as close as I can get it on

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
frame or as close as I can get it on
both<00:00:58.230> cameras<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:58.949> let's<00:00:59.309> give<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.670> go

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
both cameras so let's give it a go

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.000 
both cameras so let's give it a go
alright<00:01:00.660> we're<00:01:00.840> indoors<00:01:01.199> at<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> moment<00:01:01.859> and

it or not a lot of people don't know
this<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.720> actually<00:01:10.080> considered<00:01:10.650> low-light

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
this is actually considered low-light

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.789 
this is actually considered low-light
low-light<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:13.020> outdoors<00:01:13.470> it's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
low-light is not just outdoors it's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.510 
low-light is not just outdoors it's
indoors<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.610> well<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.960> there<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.860> go<00:01:16.890> some<00:01:17.310> pan

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
indoors as well so there we go some pan

across and you can have a look at the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.670 
across and you can have a look at the
noise<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.850> there<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.330> freeze<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.170> do

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
noise on there you can freeze it and do

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.289 
noise on there you can freeze it and do

GoPro at the moment I can't see any form
of<00:01:29.579> noise

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.150 

and<00:01:35.660> I've<00:01:36.140> just<00:01:36.320> turned<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.710> lights<00:01:36.920> off

inside the lab here and so we've got

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.030 
inside the lab here and so we've got
dark<00:01:39.650> inside<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.660> really<00:01:41.660> bright<00:01:42.110> background

coming<00:01:46.280> in<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:46.760> can<00:01:46.970> see<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.660> grain<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.410> can

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
coming in and I can see the grain I can

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.870 
coming in and I can see the grain I can
see<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.460> noise<00:01:49.729> on<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.360> GoPro<00:01:51.190> backpack<00:01:52.190> LCD

screen I'm pretty sure I can anyway and

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.719 
screen I'm pretty sure I can anyway and
if<00:01:55.880> we<00:01:56.060> have<00:01:56.660> a<00:01:56.690> look<00:01:56.900> inside<00:01:57.050> here<00:01:57.680> not<00:01:58.340> both

you<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> reasonable<00:03:31.350> like<00:03:31.770> a<00:03:31.800> streetlight

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
you a reasonable like a streetlight

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
and it should give you a good color

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.800 
and it should give you a good color
difference<00:03:43.740> and<00:03:43.980> all<00:03:44.130> that<00:03:44.340> sort<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.670> stuff<00:03:44.810> so

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
there we go

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.540 
there we go
and<00:04:34.990> once<00:04:35.410> again<00:04:35.560> I'm<00:04:35.830> being<00:04:36.010> lit<00:04:36.310> by<00:04:36.490> two

and once again I'm being lit by two
separate<00:04:37.380> streetlights<00:04:38.380> here<00:04:38.680> practically

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
separate streetlights here practically

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.940 
separate streetlights here practically
directly<00:04:40.180> on<00:04:40.360> me<00:04:40.750> actually<00:04:40.960> they're<00:04:41.530> pointing

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
directly on me actually they're pointing

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.280 
directly on me actually they're pointing
downwards<00:04:42.490> almost<00:04:43.210> directly<00:04:43.720> at<00:04:43.870> me<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.170> I'm

downwards almost directly at me and I'm

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.340 
downwards almost directly at me and I'm
measuring<00:04:44.500> about<00:04:44.920> 50<00:04:45.370> lux<00:04:45.730> or<00:04:46.030> thereabout<00:04:46.750> so

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
measuring about 50 lux or thereabout so

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.500 
measuring about 50 lux or thereabout so
that<00:04:48.340> is<00:04:48.490> me<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:49.780> street<00:04:50.110> lights<00:04:50.760> and<00:04:51.760> when<00:04:52.480> I

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
that is me the street lights and when I

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.170 
that is me the street lights and when I
go<00:04:52.750> into<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.140> black<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:54.700> bright<00:04:54.940> light

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180

behind<00:04:55.600> me

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.350 

the<00:04:59.050> frames<00:04:59.380> won't<00:04:59.680> exactly<00:05:00.100> line<00:05:00.280> up<00:05:00.310> but<00:05:00.760> you

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
the frames won't exactly line up but you

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.170 
the frames won't exactly line up but you
get<00:05:01.510> the<00:05:01.660> idea<00:05:01.710> let's<00:05:02.710> go<00:05:02.920> for<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:03.160> walk<00:05:06.180> just

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
get the idea let's go for a walk just

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.500 
get the idea let's go for a walk just
going<00:05:07.540> through<00:05:07.750> a<00:05:07.780> construction<00:05:08.170> zone<00:05:09.420> at<00:05:10.420> the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
going through a construction zone at the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.680 
going through a construction zone at the
moment<00:05:12.660> so<00:05:13.660> it's<00:05:13.870> pretty<00:05:14.080> dim<00:05:15.360> once<00:05:16.360> again

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
moment so it's pretty dim once again

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.810 
moment so it's pretty dim once again
we're<00:05:16.870> down<00:05:17.050> in<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.320> double-digit<00:05:18.100> er<00:05:18.310> Lux

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
we're down in the double-digit er Lux

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:36.150 
we're down in the double-digit er Lux
area

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.220 

no<00:05:37.160> let's<00:05:37.520> get<00:05:37.670> some<00:05:37.850> walking<00:05:38.240> footage<00:05:38.600> sorry

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
no let's get some walking footage sorry

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.530 
no let's get some walking footage sorry
this<00:05:39.500> is<00:05:39.680> going<00:05:39.860> to<00:05:39.920> be<00:05:40.010> really<00:05:40.310> bouncy<00:05:41.150> bouncy

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
this is going to be really bouncy bouncy

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.720 
this is going to be really bouncy bouncy
and<00:05:41.770> I<00:05:43.030> expect<00:05:44.030> well<00:05:44.810> this<00:05:45.170> hero<00:05:45.950> for<00:05:46.400> this<00:05:46.610> is

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
and I expect well this hero for this is

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.160 
and I expect well this hero for this is
the<00:05:46.880> Silver<00:05:47.330> Edition<00:05:47.420> this<00:05:47.810> will<00:05:48.050> be

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
the Silver Edition this will be

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.450 
the Silver Edition this will be
identical<00:05:48.410> I'm<00:05:49.220> pretty<00:05:49.490> sure<00:05:49.760> to<00:05:50.390> the<00:05:50.720> Black

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
identical I'm pretty sure to the Black

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.370 
identical I'm pretty sure to the Black
Edition<00:05:52.460> Hero<00:05:53.150> 4<00:05:53.600> as<00:05:53.840> well<00:05:54.530> so<00:05:55.420> but<00:05:56.420> it<00:05:56.750> should

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
Edition Hero 4 as well so but it should

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.490 
Edition Hero 4 as well so but it should
have<00:05:57.650> slightly<00:05:58.040> better<00:05:58.370> performance<00:05:58.580> so<00:05:59.240> I'm

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
have slightly better performance so I'm

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.870 
have slightly better performance so I'm
so<00:06:00.500> I've<00:06:00.650> been<00:06:00.800> reading<00:06:01.190> compared<00:06:01.610> to<00:06:01.730> the

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
so I've been reading compared to the

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.190 
so I've been reading compared to the
sill<00:06:02.840> compared<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:03.950> three<00:06:04.430> black<00:06:05.200> so

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
sill compared to the three black so

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.510 
sill compared to the three black so
there<00:06:06.410> you<00:06:06.470> go<00:06:06.590> I<00:06:06.620> hope<00:06:06.860> you<00:06:07.010> enjoyed<00:06:07.340> this

quick look at the GoPro Hero 4 silver
edition<00:06:11.680> low-light<00:06:13.060> test<00:06:14.060> and<00:06:14.450> just<00:06:15.170> sort<00:06:15.590> of

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
edition low-light test and just sort of

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.340 
edition low-light test and just sort of
outdoors<00:06:16.130> at<00:06:16.310> night<00:06:16.340> pretty<00:06:16.910> harsh

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
outdoors at night pretty harsh

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.570 
outdoors at night pretty harsh
comparison<00:06:18.350> it's<00:06:18.740> not<00:06:18.950> a<00:06:18.980> fair<00:06:19.220> comparison

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
comparison it's not a fair comparison

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.470 
comparison it's not a fair comparison
with<00:06:20.180> the<00:06:20.330> Sony<00:06:20.630> NEX<00:06:20.990> with<00:06:21.230> this<00:06:21.350> aps-c<00:06:22.480> sized

with the Sony NEX with this aps-c sized

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.510 
with the Sony NEX with this aps-c sized
sensor<00:06:23.510> not<00:06:24.110> even<00:06:24.410> close<00:06:24.650> but<00:06:24.680> hopefully<00:06:25.430> it

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
sensor not even close but hopefully it

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.770 
sensor not even close but hopefully it
gives<00:06:25.610> you<00:06:25.760> a<00:06:25.790> good<00:06:25.910> idea<00:06:25.970> cuz<00:06:26.420> I<00:06:26.450> want<00:06:26.600> to<00:06:26.660> use

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
gives you a good idea cuz I want to use

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.720 
gives you a good idea cuz I want to use
the<00:06:26.930> GoPro<00:06:27.560> Hero<00:06:27.590> 4<00:06:27.890> in<00:06:28.310> low-light

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
the GoPro Hero 4 in low-light

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.210 
the GoPro Hero 4 in low-light
environments<00:06:29.200> inside<00:06:30.200> canyons<00:06:30.710> and<00:06:30.920> stuff

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
environments inside canyons and stuff

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.770 
environments inside canyons and stuff
like<00:06:31.400> that<00:06:31.640> where<00:06:31.850> it's<00:06:32.000> you<00:06:32.210> know<00:06:32.240> can<00:06:32.600> get

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
like that where it's you know can get

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.020 
like that where it's you know can get
pretty<00:06:33.110> dark<00:06:33.620> so<00:06:33.950> hopefully<00:06:34.640> this<00:06:34.820> is<00:06:35.000> a

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
pretty dark so hopefully this is a

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.480 
pretty dark so hopefully this is a
reasonable<00:06:35.720> comparison<00:06:36.710> and<00:06:36.920> it'll<00:06:37.220> give<00:06:37.370> me

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
reasonable comparison and it'll give me

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.750 
reasonable comparison and it'll give me
a<00:06:37.520> good<00:06:37.700> idea<00:06:37.790> of<00:06:38.350> what<00:06:39.350> it's<00:06:39.760> actually

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
a good idea of what it's actually

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.150 
a good idea of what it's actually
capable<00:06:41.120> of<00:06:41.510> before<00:06:41.990> I<00:06:42.020> get<00:06:42.380> in<00:06:42.500> a<00:06:42.590> canyon<00:06:42.800> this

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
capable of before I get in a canyon this

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.200 
capable of before I get in a canyon this
weekend<00:06:43.690> catch<00:06:44.690> you<00:06:44.840> next<00:06:44.960> time
