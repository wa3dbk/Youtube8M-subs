original<00:00:21.960> seven<00:00:22.439> but<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.220> know<00:00:23.310> what<00:00:23.490> I'm

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
original seven but you know what I'm

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.330 
original seven but you know what I'm
went<00:00:24.359> all<00:00:24.480> out<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:25.490> have<00:00:26.490> my<00:00:27.029> 15<00:00:28.130> Justice<00:00:29.130> League

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340

went all out I have my 15 Justice League
members<00:00:30.050> this<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.679> probably<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.940> of

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
members this so this is probably one of

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.389

my<00:00:33.059> biggest<00:00:33.559> collections<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.860> guess<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.370> I

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
my biggest collections I guess that I

like<00:00:35.880> because<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.600> mix<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.230> just

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
like because it's a mix of not just

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.639 
like because it's a mix of not just
Legos<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:39.000> customs<00:00:39.690> I've<00:00:39.960> been<00:00:40.079> made<00:00:40.230> by<00:00:40.379> very
