00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
two five gigabytes of RAM when I built

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.469 
two five gigabytes of RAM when I built
my<00:01:31.380> computer<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.890> installed<00:01:32.369> four<00:01:32.819> gigs<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.240> RAM

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
my computer I installed four gigs of RAM

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.330 
my computer I installed four gigs of RAM
so<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.780> know<00:01:33.899> for<00:01:34.200> sure<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.500> has<00:01:34.649> four<00:01:34.979> gigs<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
so I know for sure it has four gigs of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.700 
so I know for sure it has four gigs of
memory<00:01:35.399> but<00:01:36.300> since<00:01:36.690> this<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.110> 32-bit

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
memory but since this is a 32-bit

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.650 
memory but since this is a 32-bit
operating<00:01:37.950> system<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.940> only<00:01:39.179> recognizes

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
operating system it only recognizes

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
if I had a 64-bit operating system it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.139 
if I had a 64-bit operating system it
would<00:01:46.080> recognize<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.740> fool<00:01:47.100> four<00:01:47.580> gigabytes

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
would recognize the fool four gigabytes

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.600 
would recognize the fool four gigabytes
