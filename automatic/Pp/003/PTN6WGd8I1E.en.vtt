for me from all the collections that
I've<00:02:35.480> seen<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.890> really<00:02:37.580> love<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.690> collection

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
I've seen I really love the collection

I've seen I really love the collection
from<00:02:40.540> Dior<00:02:41.540> but<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.230> wasn't<00:02:42.680> for<00:02:42.860> me<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.250> think

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
from Dior but it wasn't for me I think

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.400 
from Dior but it wasn't for me I think
those<00:02:44.239> shades<00:02:44.630> were<00:02:44.989> way<00:02:45.440> too<00:02:45.470> pastel<00:02:46.310> for<00:02:46.730> my

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
those shades were way too pastel for my

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.240 
those shades were way too pastel for my
skin<00:02:48.410> tone<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.430> blush<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:50.410> did<00:02:51.410> not<00:02:51.620> have

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
skin tone and the blush is did not have

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.930 
skin tone and the blush is did not have
really<00:02:53.150> good<00:02:53.360> pigmentation<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.860> on<00:02:55.250> me<00:02:55.640> it

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
really good pigmentation so on me it

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.000 
really good pigmentation so on me it
does<00:02:56.180> not<00:02:56.209> show<00:02:56.660> up<00:02:56.690> at<00:02:56.900> all<00:02:57.079> so<00:02:57.319> I<00:02:57.349> skipped<00:02:57.799> on

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010
