00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.290
 [Music] 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:20.060
 and now that I made a new song, she was 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:27.789
 chasing me again but I managed 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.789
 evade the a in and well I guess so 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:37.310
 but I guess that would not exist so much 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.610
 if you were not so shy to direct 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.990
 [Applause] 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.550
 he is serious he repeats the same 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.550
 but no 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.340
 or what 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.190
 wait please I saw several balloons 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.840
 do not despair 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.180
 what a bad thing he could not give me 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.180
 opportunity or have you returned 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.980
 do not 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.850
 well that was close and tell me why 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.850
 you have returned this time 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.460
 which is where my 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.860
 I still do not understand why he does not give me a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.260
 opportunity you understand 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.910
 I want to say everything that is that I am a 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.910
 unpleasant person is not like that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.460
 ah no thanks 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.799
 I made a cake, I do not want to bother you 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:02.340
 but you would like to spend a little time 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:05.130
 with me as I only came that witch not 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.330
 I see them falling for his quick mind 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.330
 we have to save it 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.750
 to see to live 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.650
 It's good 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.760
 how sweet are you know sonic never wants 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.710
 taste nothing of what you cook what 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.180
 You understand 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.180
 because if it does not stop 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.920
 damned 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.980
 because we do this I do not want to say is 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.530
 an advantage for you after all she 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.720
 it will not bother you anymore 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.590
 speaking we are here so he does not 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.590
 make a serious mistake 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.260
 I already understand that his look comes 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
 nothing 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.720
 I stayed still you are so cute 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.690
 and this is getting interesting 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.810
 do not believe it 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.890
 [Music] 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.890
 he did not kill me 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.890
 i 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.319
 what is 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.319
 it will not serve 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.590
 a sonic 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.590
 hello how about me 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:47.260
 also you theis do not want to accompany us and 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:50.340
 I know I would like you to try not the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.340
 I'm really here for him 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.990
 out gay and you if you want cake teis 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.990
 okay 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.420
 to see see 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.530
 he has hands you know 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.450
 I know but it's so adorable that I do not 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.920
 I can avoid it 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.500
 do not 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.390
 and also when I will have the 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.560
 opportunity to spend time with you from 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.620
 this way is better to take advantage 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.600
 the truth I just reviewed it and it seems 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.270
 that there was waste of that energy with 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.030
 the one that they came to our time and 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.180
 if I calculated well, another one may appear 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.730
 more with less for later seriously great 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.090
 that means we have time that 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.090
 I would not like to spend this afternoon with me 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.520
 I'm not sorry I'm busy I was shaking 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.229

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.750

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.830

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.430

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.930
