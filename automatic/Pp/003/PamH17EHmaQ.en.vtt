00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:11.040
 new six together and today I want 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.450
 briefly something almost bailey 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.610
 it's a Friday so it's beautiful again 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.850
 daughter and the discussion or new construction and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.140
 a fight and the fight is in 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.830
 In this case the battle I am talking about 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.199
 is that between fifa and pass 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.400
 I get no so was not so and I will 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.109
 start with the me today 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.029
 someone of idea had the line and that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.930
 said i'm about pipa borgo 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.340
 pass and he said to me yes yes you 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.690
 are attraction may be played 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.460
 yes some things changed 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.649
 and suddenly you came betty 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.300
 very negative license and it's true 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.090
 twin set very negative coffee on large 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.379
 the gemini 6 min if I love him 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.930
 I explain myself after a bit 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.079
 pipa since 2009 or 2010 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.800
 actually and 11 12 13 14 show 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.260
 incredibly fantastic game was good 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.500
 on the realism that fifa ultimate team 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.159
 is still the best mode I have ever seen 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.719
 have seen a football on paper I say 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.189
 me after 15 just all falls apart 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:11.369
 and I've talked to you about it a lot 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.590
 about the sows problems that very much 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.259
 people have way too many people left 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.599
 the after the problems with that the focus 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.099
 the game on individualism lights you up 

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:22.020
 directed the ball back to a 

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:23.639
 Ronaldo and who shoots those spirits 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.349
 the ball from a distance of 20 meters into the goal 

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:27.060
 if you are a good player 

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:28.560
 and actually he wasn't very much 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.939
 to do with the number of times you 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.349
 that I scored from the halfway line 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.149
 or people of mine from the center line 

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:35.520
 I scored is way too high for one 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.380
 gemini realism kind of paramount 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.289
 does not have that alone 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.770
 tess was the better game last year 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.929
 since 2008 that has just been remembered 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.669
 some problems or back again 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.319
 super cool action super cool 

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:51.179
 soccer game still on buildings 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.279
 guess typical things 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.079
 and I have to say how great I like the modes 

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.999
 finds days quad-core honor and they have 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.259
 also kind of the ultimate team it is 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:59.869
 very nice but it is nothing it goes 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.309
 not such a type and not so perfect 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.459
 it is addictive if it is not one with 

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:07.319
 ultimate team or all of him last 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.349
 clearly won the battle for years 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.060
 there is provision socks and this year I am 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.340
 also curious because I hear a lot 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.709
 people grab with white smoke 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.970
 custom responses happen again today 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.489
 someone who are from you may he again 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.660
 again psd may be playing one minute 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.700
 know my review fifa and i in group 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.620
 also good things about fifa 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.810
 So it's a start to be that we point 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.640
 to erupt also comprise two weeks 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.530
 is you mo just fifa 16 and 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.379
 next month three of fifa could 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.239
 off course like the pass 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.680
 also comes in September so it goes the 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.549
 Your apps may also be dead 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.769
 to be 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.879
 pin me deeply attached but I'm moving on 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.950
 today you do the menu concept 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.239
 think about it i must say i am there 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.069
 last year 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.579
 on the one hand though so I am really ristie 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.560
 fifty on the one hand ate 50% in me pessers 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.180
 better last year than on this path 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.090
 go then you go and it is ruined 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.700
 certainly the better football and viva or idea 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.959
 does not suddenly switch to that server after five years 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.640
 solve problems 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.269
 they do not go nature is 15 minutes once 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.549
 take a different path that problems or 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.750
 enjoyed the online virtual market with 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.430
 teams are of course not yet either 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.470
 probably solved that 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.290
 she must also come up with a solution 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.190
 and that 5% of that say 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.769
 test becomes the foot of 2016 and he 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.850
 2015 and on the other hand those other 5 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.980
 x May 7 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.019
 I say give that idea a little scroll 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.569
 pay attention and maybe here after it 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.310
 read and hear and on the forums too 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.590
 considering that a lot of people don't 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.840
 be satisfied with the way they are 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.970
 Asleep are those that go to it 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.530
 individualism of players then water 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.590
 that many people still play top teams 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.900
 however this is the power of sport to 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.069
 people appreciate that more and that they 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.540
 maybe go back a bit anyway 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.109
 to that side I have a good story 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.419
 of operation 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.919
 I have to say look like she is playing 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.989
 Ultimate team was a lot though 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.790
 look at how to solve those problems 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.220
 there if he maintain that mode 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.950
 and we are still a lot better 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.919
 mode then that has it best with 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.419
 but ultimate team-like thing and 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.760
 I also see myself in that regard 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.470
 not and last year has been fifa 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.900
 I really stopped playing could out 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.849
 anger and that I found the bad game 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.200
 i also really go river with friends 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.630
 games throw obviously still 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.440
 Regularly it's not me 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.000
 still in my own time 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.650
 effe a game of fifa on or through the 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.360
 seasons can run job normally 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.050
 all the way through to season 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.390
 scary 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.040
 or to the first division, I mean 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.940
 i also pass i actually have it too 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.170
 not done 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.360
 I played those two games movie 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.420
 comprehensive between times ffs is such a piece 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.120
 better but not really on my own 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.980
 also play and and I see it myself 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.900
 also not 100% open steps this yes 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.790
 but it would also just be a thesis 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.680
 does well again and surrounds someone around 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.510
 a fat and then we have completely 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.280
 fancy and you know what it is so my 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.070
 reasoning I am still sitting 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.420
 other fans as the English say 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.480
 but i know a lot of you and get it 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.830
 not for nothing I almost get up 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.390
 I could not imagine that there is 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.610
 more responses in a row from you through it 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.490
 year, therefore, liabilities a pass and 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.100
 so today today very simple today 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.080
 what games were running for were what did 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.760
 you last year and what do you think you are now 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.970
 choose 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.850
 goes off the throne every week 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.770
 shedding or is it back with its all 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.140
 besides those gifts because the diet was 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.460
 all goes well okay let's know 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.690
 in the comments that that of course one 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.180
 good weekend with a card 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.060
 discuss it and I will also briefly 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.130
 mix it to us it enough 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.650
 this is also the middle what screen 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.960
 fifty-fifty is damn was I one 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.820
 almost 40 we count the whole reason 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.680
 extra reason for this vlog is because 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.090
 so they played deep sdmo 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.950
 it is very difficult i want there too 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.990
 start with but very much in the end 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.220
 I distracted him myself would still be there 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.110
 let's just say i got him on the board 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.770
 played and that why for people me 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.650
 played it 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.419
 I think he is just the first one 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.040
 five potteries played played against the 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.120
 Margin also came with which I always 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.490
 play football 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:07.470
 ant wins and just 605 471 or something 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.690
 because quite well now want the whole 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.100
 pushing the square is like 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.230
 you have freedom and then he shoots the 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.550
 ball at once to the curvature of the 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.470
 balm van i prefer to keep thinking for oil 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.680
 must post or I need sister or something 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.480
 or if I do that extra power shot then 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.070
 it should be lucky we have to 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.780
 the directions should fall well with and with 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.130
 my lead must be good and then I fold 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.720
 him in it 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.250
 only when pass is from square is 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.240
 tracks 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.770
 that only say that I 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.070
 therefore a little shudder I am 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.980
 ruined 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.180
 yes grab this addition know your bike 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.920
 Appendix 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.750
 do with it what you want i am like that too 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.650
 not you Jews experienced the demon 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.110
 to have 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.610
 let it know in below and then see
