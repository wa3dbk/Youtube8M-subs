okay<00:00:00.690> I've<00:00:00.930> always<00:00:01.770> tried<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.190> make<00:00:02.310> it<00:00:02.429> a

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
okay I've always tried to make it a

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.400 
okay I've always tried to make it a
habit<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:03.000> telling<00:00:03.270> you<00:00:03.510> guys<00:00:03.659> when<00:00:03.990> I<00:00:04.020> find

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
habit of telling you guys when I find

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.860 
habit of telling you guys when I find
new<00:00:04.680> glitches<00:00:04.950> but<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.120> particular<00:00:06.450> glitch

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
new glitches but this particular glitch

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.210 
new glitches but this particular glitch
made<00:00:07.109> me<00:00:07.230> question<00:00:07.620> whether<00:00:07.799> or<00:00:07.919> not<00:00:08.160> I

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
made me question whether or not I

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.820 
made me question whether or not I
actually<00:00:08.519> wanted<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.300> spread<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:09.750> around<00:00:09.870> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
actually wanted to spread it around the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.709 
actually wanted to spread it around the
consequences<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.179> glitch<00:00:12.389> like<00:00:12.570> this

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
consequences of a glitch like this

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.030 
consequences of a glitch like this
getting<00:00:12.990> out<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.380> masses<00:00:13.530> without

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
getting out to the masses without

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.550 
getting out to the masses without
Blizzard<00:00:14.519> fixing<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.000> are<00:00:15.179> massive<00:00:15.780> but<00:00:16.440> I

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
Blizzard fixing it are massive but I

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.320 
Blizzard fixing it are massive but I
think<00:00:16.949> if<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.400> problem<00:00:17.730> becomes<00:00:17.940> common

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
think if this problem becomes common

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.359 
think if this problem becomes common
knowledge<00:00:18.439> Blizzard<00:00:19.439> will<00:00:19.560> maybe<00:00:19.890> fix<00:00:20.250> it

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
knowledge Blizzard will maybe fix it

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.830 
knowledge Blizzard will maybe fix it
faster<00:00:20.760> than<00:00:20.910> if<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.180> were<00:00:21.330> swept<00:00:21.600> under<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
faster than if it were swept under the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.109 
faster than if it were swept under the
rug<00:00:22.070> so<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.460> right<00:00:23.609> there<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.880> my

into<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.830> matches<00:01:42.130> normal<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:42.610> what<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.150> do

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
into the matches normal and what you do

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.780 
into the matches normal and what you do
is<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:44.320> have<00:01:44.470> your<00:01:44.590> warlike<00:01:44.950> friend<00:01:45.220> dot<00:01:45.550> the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
is you have your warlike friend dot the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.450 
is you have your warlike friend dot the
entire<00:01:46.119> enemy<00:01:46.330> team<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:46.990> then<00:01:47.590> he<00:01:47.770> leaves<00:01:48.040> and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
entire enemy team and then he leaves and

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.490 
entire enemy team and then he leaves and
it<00:01:49.000> sounds<00:01:49.330> really<00:01:49.450> weird<00:01:49.570> like<00:01:49.900> why<00:01:50.110> would<00:01:50.350> he

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
it sounds really weird like why would he

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.070 
it sounds really weird like why would he
leave<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.740> arena<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:52.270> some<00:01:52.479> reason<00:01:52.840> when<00:01:52.990> the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
leave the arena for some reason when the

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.930 
leave the arena for some reason when the
Warlock<00:01:53.410> actually<00:01:53.890> exits<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.460> arena<00:01:54.790> when<00:01:54.910> he

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
Warlock actually exits the arena when he

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.090 
Warlock actually exits the arena when he
gets<00:01:55.180> out<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.509> the<00:01:55.600> loading<00:01:55.899> screen<00:01:55.930> his<00:01:56.800> dots

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
gets out of the loading screen his dots

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.530 
gets out of the loading screen his dots
start<00:01:57.640> hitting<00:01:57.970> through<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.270> enemy

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
start hitting through the enemy

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.530 
start hitting through the enemy
resilience<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.670> dots<00:02:00.850> go<00:02:01.060> from<00:02:01.240> ticking

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
resilience so the dots go from ticking

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.160 
resilience so the dots go from ticking
to<00:02:01.720> in<00:02:01.869> 4<00:02:02.110> k's<00:02:02.290> 2<00:02:02.619> 15<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.580> 20<00:02:04.060> k's<00:02:04.270> for<00:02:04.600> every

to in 4 k's 2 15 and 20 k's for every

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.570 
to in 4 k's 2 15 and 20 k's for every
single<00:02:05.440> dot<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.800> as<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.100> can<00:02:06.250> see<00:02:06.280> in<00:02:06.490> these

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
single dot and as you can see in these

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.999 
single dot and as you can see in these
clips<00:02:06.820> it<00:02:07.060> kind<00:02:07.390> of<00:02:07.479> tears<00:02:07.690> people<00:02:07.869> up<00:02:08.140> now<00:02:08.979> I

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
clips it kind of tears people up now I

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.979 
clips it kind of tears people up now I

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
with a warlock but you probably could do

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.470 
with a warlock but you probably could do
it<00:02:41.709> with<00:02:41.799> like<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.920> fire<00:02:42.160> mage<00:02:42.400> or<00:02:42.760> shadow
