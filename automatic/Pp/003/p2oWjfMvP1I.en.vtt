00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.059 
torque this engine won't produce that
much<00:04:01.220> so<00:04:01.579> we're<00:04:02.209> within<00:04:02.449> the<00:04:02.690> limits<00:04:03.010> this<00:04:04.010> is

it<00:04:20.720> through<00:04:20.750> a<00:04:20.930> regulator<00:04:21.409> to<00:04:21.560> step<00:04:21.769> it<00:04:21.919> down

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
it through a regulator to step it down

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.159 
it through a regulator to step it down
to<00:04:22.159> twelve<00:04:22.430> pounds<00:04:22.849> that<00:04:23.450> provides<00:04:23.870> enough

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
to twelve pounds that provides enough

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.960 
to twelve pounds that provides enough
fuel<00:04:24.469> to<00:04:24.680> support<00:04:25.099> up<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.460> six

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
fuel to support up to six

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.720 
fuel to support up to six
25<00:04:26.570> horsepower<00:04:26.930> so<00:04:27.500> again<00:04:27.830> we're<00:04:28.520> well<00:04:28.700> within

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
25 horsepower so again we're well within

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.460 
25 horsepower so again we're well within
the<00:04:29.120> limits<00:04:29.450> but<00:04:29.600> as<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:29.900> can<00:04:30.020> see<00:04:30.080> and

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
the limits but as you can see and

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.400 
the limits but as you can see and
looking<00:04:30.770> around<00:04:31.180> everything<00:04:32.180> is<00:04:32.810> in<00:04:33.050> its<00:04:33.230> oh

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
looking around everything is in its oh

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.790 
looking around everything is in its oh
em<00:04:33.770> look<00:04:33.980> a<00:04:34.160> ssin<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:35.030> it<00:04:36.020> works<00:04:36.470> and

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
em look a ssin and it works and

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.750 
em look a ssin and it works and
functions<00:04:37.370> just<00:04:38.240> like<00:04:38.390> any<00:04:39.130> om<00:04:40.130> Duramax

drive that came with the diesels so we

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.570 
drive that came with the diesels so we
applied<00:06:42.630> that<00:06:42.840> to<00:06:43.080> his<00:06:43.290> Denali<00:06:44.070> so<00:06:44.370> now

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
applied that to his Denali so now

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.660 
applied that to his Denali so now
instead<00:06:44.940> of<00:06:45.000> an<00:06:45.150> all-wheel<00:06:45.510> drive<00:06:45.810> this<00:06:46.080> is<00:06:46.290> a

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
instead of an all-wheel drive this is a

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:53.380 
instead of an all-wheel drive this is a
4x4<00:06:48.350> so<00:06:49.350> that<00:06:50.280> is<00:06:50.580> pretty<00:06:51.090> much<00:06:51.240> it<00:06:51.780> for<00:06:52.350> the

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
4x4 so that is pretty much it for the
