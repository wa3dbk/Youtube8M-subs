could<00:02:40.560> lose<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.920> weight<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:42.060> course<00:02:42.299> your

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
could lose the weight and of course your

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.630 
could lose the weight and of course your
immediate<00:02:43.140> reaction<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.799> just<00:02:43.950> fight<00:02:44.400> and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640
