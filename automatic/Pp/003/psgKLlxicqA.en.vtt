to<00:02:25.420> be<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.569> theme<00:02:26.110> every<00:02:26.380> single<00:02:26.860> week<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.310> in

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
to be a theme every single week so in

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.300 
to be a theme every single week so in
this<00:02:27.790> week's<00:02:28.090> case<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.930> overall<00:02:29.770> theme<00:02:30.040> or

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
this week's case the overall theme or

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.190 
this week's case the overall theme or
the<00:02:30.370> objective<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.000> highest<00:02:31.630> objective

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
the objective is the highest objective

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.830 
the objective is the highest objective
score<00:02:32.500> per<00:02:32.890> squad<00:02:33.430> it's<00:02:33.700> cumulative<00:02:34.000> so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
score per squad it's cumulative so

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.940 
score per squad it's cumulative so
that's<00:02:34.989> why<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.140> doesn't<00:02:35.380> matter<00:02:35.530> if<00:02:35.739> we're<00:02:35.860> on

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
that's why it doesn't matter if we're on

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.830 
that's why it doesn't matter if we're on
opposing<00:02:36.190> teams<00:02:36.580> or<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.850> same<00:02:37.060> team<00:02:37.239> right<00:02:37.600> so

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
opposing teams or the same team right so

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.199 
opposing teams or the same team right so
we're<00:02:38.020> not<00:02:38.140> looking<00:02:38.410> for<00:02:38.830> even<00:02:39.400> pulling<00:02:39.819> out<00:02:40.030> a
