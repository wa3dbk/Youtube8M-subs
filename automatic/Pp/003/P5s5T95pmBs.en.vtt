you<00:02:29.340> step<00:02:29.580> out<00:02:29.790> drop<00:02:30.450> your<00:02:30.600> hips<00:02:30.750> straight

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
you step out drop your hips straight

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.910 
you step out drop your hips straight
down<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.820> drive<00:02:32.820> back<00:02:33.030> up<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:34.290> instead<00:02:34.650> of

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
down and drive back up so instead of

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.350 
down and drive back up so instead of
keeping<00:02:35.430> on<00:02:35.550> going<00:02:35.580> forward<00:02:36.150> you're<00:02:36.210> just

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
keeping on going forward you're just

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.490 
keeping on going forward you're just
gonna<00:02:36.480> go<00:02:36.660> out<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.050> then<00:02:37.650> down<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.280> back<00:02:39.150> up

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
gonna go out and then down and back up

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.290 
gonna go out and then down and back up
so<00:02:40.500> stop<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.010> forward<00:02:41.400> movement<00:02:41.730> once<00:02:42.210> you

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
so stop that forward movement once you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.170 
so stop that forward movement once you
plan<00:02:42.540> your<00:02:42.690> foot<00:02:43.160> after<00:02:44.160> you've<00:02:44.460> done<00:02:44.520> 15<00:02:44.970> per

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
plan your foot after you've done 15 per

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.690 
plan your foot after you've done 15 per
side<00:02:45.860> we're<00:02:46.860> gonna<00:02:46.950> go<00:02:47.040> down<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.340> mountain
