00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.059 

all<00:00:01.589> right<00:00:01.740> so<00:00:02.010> what<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.490> have<00:00:02.790> here<00:00:03.000> is<00:00:03.240> um<00:00:04.069> four

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
all right so what I have here is um four

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.230 
all right so what I have here is um four
rounds<00:00:05.460> I<00:00:05.549> made<00:00:06.890> each<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:07.950> them<00:00:08.250> have<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.580> primer

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
rounds I made each of them have a primer

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.830 
rounds I made each of them have a primer
that<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.690> mean<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.349> felt<00:00:10.950> all<00:00:11.099> these<00:00:11.250> within

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
that I mean I felt all these within

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.570 
that I mean I felt all these within
about<00:00:12.840> half<00:00:13.139> an<00:00:13.469> hour<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.740> guess<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.340> make<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
about half an hour I guess to make the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.140 
about half an hour I guess to make the
bullets<00:00:16.039> and<00:00:17.039> then<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.400> make<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.640> primers<00:00:17.970> and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
bullets and then to make the primers and

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.400 
bullets and then to make the primers and
put<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.330> all<00:00:18.390> together<00:00:18.510> took<00:00:19.050> me<00:00:19.199> about<00:00:19.350> half

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
put it all together took me about half

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.890 
put it all together took me about half
an<00:00:19.650> hour<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.890> make<00:00:20.010> these<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.369> hopefully

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
an hour to make these so hopefully

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.210 
an hour to make these so hopefully
hopefully<00:00:21.900> these<00:00:22.230> work<00:00:22.470> out<00:00:22.650> all<00:00:22.890> because<00:00:23.100> I'm

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
hopefully these work out all because I'm

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.700 
hopefully these work out all because I'm
going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.519> attempting<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.240> shoot<00:00:24.390> them

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
going to be attempting to shoot them

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:34.010 
going to be attempting to shoot them
consecutively<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:26.519> won't<00:00:27.380> recall<00:00:30.140> but<00:00:32.630> it<00:00:33.630> has

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
consecutively it won't recall but it has

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.410 
consecutively it won't recall but it has
enough<00:00:34.410> charge<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:36.410> expel<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.590> bullet

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
enough charge to expel the bullet

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.910 
enough charge to expel the bullet
through<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.480> barrel

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
through the barrel

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.790 
through the barrel
so<00:00:40.920> hopefully<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.000> works<00:00:42.149> out<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:43.379> four

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
so hopefully this works out so four

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.440 
so hopefully this works out so four
shots<00:00:44.040> I'll<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.610> wrecking<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> slide<00:00:45.239> each

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
shots I'll be wrecking the slide each

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.850 
shots I'll be wrecking the slide each
time<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.050> doesn't<00:00:46.379> go<00:00:47.129> off<00:00:47.250> I'll<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:48.860> cock

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
time if it doesn't go off I'll just cock

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.569 
time if it doesn't go off I'll just cock
the<00:00:49.980> hammer<00:00:50.010> again<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.469> try<00:00:52.469> again<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:53.399> right

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the hammer again and try again all right

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:12.670 
the hammer again and try again all right
here<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:53.940> go

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.840 

all<00:01:13.680> right<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.250> doesn't<00:01:14.430> see<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
all right so that one doesn't see if you

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.660 
all right so that one doesn't see if you
want<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> go<00:01:15.180> off<00:01:16.759> go<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.299> next<00:01:18.450> one

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
want to go off go on to the next one

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.969 
want to go off go on to the next one
something<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.880> little<00:01:20.909> bit<00:01:21.150> stuck<00:01:24.979> all

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
something just a little bit stuck all

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.789 
something just a little bit stuck all
right<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.420> that's<00:01:27.630> three<00:01:27.960> out<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.229> four<00:01:28.500> I

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
right so that's three out of four I

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.880 
right so that's three out of four I
guess<00:01:29.070> not<00:01:29.280> too<00:01:29.460> bad<00:01:30.470> let's<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.770> could

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
guess not too bad let's see if I could

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.590 
guess not too bad let's see if I could
try<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> make<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.340> other<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.520> gone<00:01:32.759> again<00:01:33.090> so

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
try to make the other one gone again so

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.270 
try to make the other one gone again so
I'll<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.439> pop<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:37.100> alright<00:01:38.100> it's

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
I'll just pop that in there alright it's

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.600 
I'll just pop that in there alright it's
in<00:01:40.430> there<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.640> now<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.299> want<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:43.579> see<00:01:44.579> a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
well the firing pin strikes pretty

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.770 
well the firing pin strikes pretty
centered<00:02:20.790> except<00:02:21.790> for<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.060> one<00:02:22.209> maybe<00:02:22.420> for

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
centered except for the one maybe for

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.970 
centered except for the one maybe for
some<00:02:22.930> reason<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.290> didn't<00:02:23.500> put<00:02:23.620> enough<00:02:23.650> powder
