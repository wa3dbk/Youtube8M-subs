seconds<00:03:01.330> we'll<00:03:01.480> leave<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.720> on<00:03:01.810> there<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.230> the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
seconds we'll leave it on there and the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.770 
seconds we'll leave it on there and the
paper<00:03:02.680> paper<00:03:03.160> will<00:03:03.430> come<00:03:03.459> off<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:04.239> can<00:03:04.270> see<00:03:04.600> I

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
paper paper will come off you can see I

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.610 
paper paper will come off you can see I
don't<00:03:04.900> know<00:03:04.959> if<00:03:05.020> you<00:03:05.080> can<00:03:05.200> see<00:03:05.350> in<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.530> video

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
don't know if you can see in the video

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.960 
don't know if you can see in the video
here<00:03:05.920> but<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.130> can<00:03:06.250> see<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.489> already<00:03:06.640> starting

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
here but you can see it already starting

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.530 
here but you can see it already starting
to<00:03:07.030> Ripple

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
to Ripple

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.150 
to Ripple
so<00:03:08.020> what's<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.320> been<00:03:08.380> on<00:03:08.500> there<00:03:08.650> maybe<00:03:08.770> 10<00:03:09.010> 15

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
so what's it been on there maybe 10 15

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.460 
so what's it been on there maybe 10 15
seconds<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.000> voila<00:03:12.450> right<00:03:13.450> off<00:03:13.660> no<00:03:13.959> problem

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
seconds and voila right off no problem

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.509 
seconds and voila right off no problem
done<00:03:15.280> deal<00:03:15.580> so<00:03:16.030> let's<00:03:16.180> do<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.420> other<00:03:16.450> side

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
done deal so let's do the other side

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.870 
done deal so let's do the other side
very<00:03:18.519> simple

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.900 

and<00:03:24.840> watch<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.260> fumes<00:03:25.590> should<00:03:26.100> alcohol<00:03:26.610> fumes

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
and watch the fumes should alcohol fumes

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.110 
and watch the fumes should alcohol fumes
aren't<00:03:27.270> very<00:03:27.450> good<00:03:27.540> for<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:28.050> but<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.970> got<00:03:29.970> to

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
aren't very good for you but you got to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.850 
aren't very good for you but you got to
take<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.870> good<00:03:31.050> with<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.260> bad<00:03:31.380> here<00:03:33.860> speed

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
take the good with the bad here speed

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.380 
take the good with the bad here speed
I'm<00:03:34.950> taking<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.250> shower<00:03:35.460> and<00:03:35.670> Ally<00:03:35.850> gets<00:03:36.180> free

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
I'm taking a shower and Ally gets free

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.870 
I'm taking a shower and Ally gets free
some<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:36.780> on<00:03:36.930> yourself<00:03:40.460> but<00:03:41.460> usually<00:03:41.850> by

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
some of this on yourself but usually by

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.550 
some of this on yourself but usually by
the<00:03:42.060> time<00:03:42.270> I'm<00:03:42.420> done<00:03:42.450> spraying<00:03:43.020> and<00:03:43.320> get<00:03:43.470> it

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
the time I'm done spraying and get it

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.350 
the time I'm done spraying and get it
all<00:03:43.680> saturated<00:03:44.370> as<00:03:44.880> good<00:03:45.180> as<00:03:45.300> I<00:03:45.630> can<00:03:46.620> get<00:03:46.860> it

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
all saturated as good as I can get it

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.900 
all saturated as good as I can get it
it's<00:03:48.360> ready<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.720> pull<00:03:48.960> off<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:50.250> again<00:03:50.730> what's

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
it's ready to pull off and again what's

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.170 
it's ready to pull off and again what's
that<00:03:51.030> been<00:03:51.210> maybe<00:03:51.390> 10<00:03:51.600> 15<00:03:51.960> seconds<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:53.180> right

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
that been maybe 10 15 seconds and right

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.280 
that been maybe 10 15 seconds and right
off<00:03:54.590> so<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.860> think<00:03:56.130> after<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.550> demonstration

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
off so I think after that demonstration

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.020 
off so I think after that demonstration
you<00:03:58.290> know<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.410> hard<00:03:58.710> time<00:03:58.920> arguing<00:03:59.430> with<00:03:59.880> me

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
you know a hard time arguing with me

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.700 
you know a hard time arguing with me
that<00:04:00.300> there's<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.870> better<00:04:01.080> way<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.320> do<00:04:01.560> it

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
that there's a better way to do it

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.200 
that there's a better way to do it
because<00:04:01.920> guess<00:04:02.070> what<00:04:02.310> there<00:04:02.610> isn't<00:04:03.030> there's

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
because guess what there isn't there's

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.250 
because guess what there isn't there's
no<00:04:03.450> way<00:04:03.570> you're<00:04:03.690> going<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.870> get<00:04:03.960> that<00:04:04.080> off

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
no way you're going to get that off

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.410 
no way you're going to get that off
where<00:04:04.740> it<00:04:04.800> comes<00:04:05.040> off<00:04:05.220> that<00:04:05.430> easy<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:06.150> paper

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
where it comes off that easy the paper

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.760 
where it comes off that easy the paper
doesn't<00:04:06.780> rip<00:04:06.960> apart<00:04:07.080> as<00:04:07.410> you're<00:04:07.500> trying<00:04:07.710> to

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
doesn't rip apart as you're trying to

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.650 
doesn't rip apart as you're trying to
get<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:07.980> off<00:04:08.100> another<00:04:08.970> cool<00:04:09.210> thing<00:04:09.240> about<00:04:09.540> it

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
get it off another cool thing about it

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.050 
get it off another cool thing about it
is<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:10.200> just<00:04:10.350> since<00:04:10.890> it's<00:04:11.010> alcohol<00:04:11.460> it's<00:04:11.940> going

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
is it just since it's alcohol it's going

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.430 
is it just since it's alcohol it's going
to<00:04:12.120> evaporate<00:04:12.360> pretty<00:04:12.810> quick<00:04:13.020> usually<00:04:13.350> I'll

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
to evaporate pretty quick usually I'll

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.160 
to evaporate pretty quick usually I'll
set<00:04:13.620> this<00:04:13.710> up<00:04:13.860> on<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.040> side<00:04:14.630> next<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:15.840> table

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
set this up on the side next to a table

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.720 
set this up on the side next to a table
or<00:04:16.200> something<00:04:16.440> under<00:04:16.770> a<00:04:16.799> ceiling<00:04:17.100> fan<00:04:17.460> and

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
or something under a ceiling fan and

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.580 
or something under a ceiling fan and
dries<00:04:18.090> right<00:04:18.360> out<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:19.140> don't<00:04:19.230> have<00:04:19.350> any

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
dries right out you don't have any

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.039 
dries right out you don't have any
residue<00:04:20.190> on<00:04:20.370> here<00:04:20.700> because<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.630> alcohol<00:04:21.780> is

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
residue on here because the alcohol is

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.010 
residue on here because the alcohol is
going<00:04:22.110> to<00:04:22.230> evaporate<00:04:22.440> now<00:04:23.690> this<00:04:24.690> is<00:04:24.840> pretty

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
going to evaporate now this is pretty

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.990 
going to evaporate now this is pretty
flimsy<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.830> that's<00:04:26.460> what<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.610> first<00:04:26.880> thought

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
flimsy and that's what I first thought

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.940 
flimsy and that's what I first thought
when<00:04:27.210> I<00:04:27.300> started<00:04:27.600> using<00:04:27.750> this<00:04:27.930> stuff<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:28.890> I'm

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
when I started using this stuff and I'm

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.130 
when I started using this stuff and I'm
like<00:04:29.070> well<00:04:29.250> maybe<00:04:30.120> I'll<00:04:30.330> double<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:30.750> up<00:04:30.900> so<00:04:31.110> I

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
like well maybe I'll double it up so I

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.380 
like well maybe I'll double it up so I
doubled<00:04:31.560> up<00:04:31.590> two<00:04:31.830> pieces<00:04:32.250> together<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.850> then

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
doubled up two pieces together and then

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.030 
doubled up two pieces together and then
with<00:04:33.480> me<00:04:33.600> with<00:04:33.930> your<00:04:34.050> carbon<00:04:34.350> fiber<00:04:34.560> rod<00:04:34.830> in

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
with me with your carbon fiber rod in

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.120 
with me with your carbon fiber rod in
there<00:04:35.160> that<00:04:35.460> 9<00:04:35.670> millimeter<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.540> know

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
there that 9 millimeter you know

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.100 
there that 9 millimeter you know
laminated<00:04:38.130> 2<00:04:38.460> pieces<00:04:38.670> laminated<00:04:39.360> we're<00:04:39.780> great

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
laminated 2 pieces laminated we're great

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.840 
laminated 2 pieces laminated we're great
I<00:04:40.380> mean<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:40.860> build<00:04:41.070> all<00:04:41.160> my<00:04:41.220> planes<00:04:41.580> with<00:04:41.730> it

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
I mean I build all my planes with it

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.300 
I mean I build all my planes with it
after<00:04:42.120> that<00:04:42.270> when<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.170> laminate<00:04:43.800> two<00:04:43.980> pieces

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
after that when you laminate two pieces

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.060 
after that when you laminate two pieces
together<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.880> spray<00:04:45.180> that<00:04:45.710> spray<00:04:46.710> adhesive

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
together and spray that spray adhesive

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.470 
together and spray that spray adhesive
on<00:04:47.190> there<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:47.520> then<00:04:47.700> put<00:04:47.880> your<00:04:47.970> second<00:04:48.300> sheet

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
on there and then put your second sheet

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.170 
on there and then put your second sheet
on<00:04:48.660> that<00:04:49.010> layer<00:04:50.010> of<00:04:50.340> spray<00:04:50.670> adhesive<00:04:50.700> in

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
on that layer of spray adhesive in

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.550 
on that layer of spray adhesive in
between<00:04:51.510> it<00:04:51.660> actually<00:04:51.960> gives<00:04:52.170> a<00:04:52.260> little<00:04:52.380> bit

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
between it actually gives a little bit

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.990 
between it actually gives a little bit
more<00:04:52.710> strength<00:04:53.040> because<00:04:53.400> when<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.730> foam<00:04:53.970> is

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
more strength because when that foam is

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.270 
more strength because when that foam is
bending<00:04:54.510> that<00:04:54.660> top<00:04:54.690> piece<00:04:55.140> is<00:04:55.380> getting

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
bending that top piece is getting

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.390 
bending that top piece is getting
smaller<00:04:57.380> tip<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:58.530> tip<00:04:58.680> wise<00:04:58.920> it's<00:04:59.130> kinda<00:04:59.310> hard

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
smaller tip to tip wise it's kinda hard

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.070 
smaller tip to tip wise it's kinda hard
to<00:04:59.460> explain<00:04:59.670> the<00:04:59.850> physics<00:05:00.150> of<00:05:00.240> it<00:05:00.360> but<00:05:00.870> it

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
to explain the physics of it but it

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.600 
to explain the physics of it but it
actually<00:05:01.140> gives<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:01.800> some<00:05:01.950> resistance

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
actually gives it some resistance

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.840 
actually gives it some resistance
whereas<00:05:03.510> a<00:05:03.870> 9<00:05:04.710> millimeter<00:05:04.950> thick<00:05:05.430> piece<00:05:05.700> of

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
whereas a 9 millimeter thick piece of

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.850 
whereas a 9 millimeter thick piece of
foam<00:05:06.030> by<00:05:06.360> itself<00:05:06.780> probably<00:05:07.380> wouldn't<00:05:07.650> be<00:05:07.740> as

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
foam by itself probably wouldn't be as

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.350 
foam by itself probably wouldn't be as
strong<00:05:08.130> without<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.730> layer<00:05:08.880> of<00:05:08.910> glue<00:05:09.180> in<00:05:09.300> the

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
strong without that layer of glue in the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.400 
strong without that layer of glue in the
middle<00:05:09.540> so<00:05:09.660> that<00:05:09.690> actually<00:05:10.050> gives<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.290> little

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
middle so that actually gives a little

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.300 
middle so that actually gives a little
bit<00:05:10.560> more<00:05:10.620> rigidity<00:05:11.610> also<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.920> one<00:05:13.920> thing<00:05:14.190> I

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
bit more rigidity also and one thing I

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.560 
bit more rigidity also and one thing I
want<00:05:14.550> to<00:05:14.610> let<00:05:14.700> you<00:05:14.820> know<00:05:14.970> right<00:05:15.240> here<00:05:15.300> off<00:05:15.540> the

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
want to let you know right here off the

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.730 
want to let you know right here off the
bat<00:05:15.810> and<00:05:15.960> I'll<00:05:16.020> probably<00:05:16.200> say<00:05:16.470> this<00:05:16.590> in<00:05:16.680> the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
bat and I'll probably say this in the

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.430 
bat and I'll probably say this in the
build<00:05:17.310> videos<00:05:17.610> as<00:05:17.700> well<00:05:17.850> don't<00:05:18.360> laminate<00:05:19.200> two

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
build videos as well don't laminate two

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.190 
build videos as well don't laminate two
full<00:05:19.770> pieces<00:05:20.250> then<00:05:20.760> try<00:05:21.000> to<00:05:21.060> cut<00:05:21.360> your<00:05:21.690> pieces

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
full pieces then try to cut your pieces

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.050 
full pieces then try to cut your pieces
of<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.650> plane<00:05:22.890> out<00:05:23.100> what's<00:05:23.610> going<00:05:23.730> to<00:05:23.760> happen

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
of the plane out what's going to happen

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.310 
of the plane out what's going to happen
is<00:05:24.150> is<00:05:24.300> that<00:05:24.330> that's<00:05:24.690> braid<00:05:24.990> glue<00:05:25.170> in<00:05:25.260> the

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
is is that that's braid glue in the

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.050 
is is that that's braid glue in the
middle<00:05:25.590> it<00:05:25.800> takes<00:05:25.980> a<00:05:26.100> while<00:05:26.250> before<00:05:26.490> it<00:05:26.700> dries

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
middle it takes a while before it dries

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.690 
middle it takes a while before it dries
hard<00:05:27.740> it'll<00:05:28.740> hold<00:05:29.010> those<00:05:29.220> pieces<00:05:29.460> together

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
hard it'll hold those pieces together

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.880 
hard it'll hold those pieces together
together<00:05:30.330> right<00:05:30.690> away<00:05:30.930> but<00:05:31.500> when<00:05:31.620> you<00:05:31.740> go<00:05:31.830> to

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
together right away but when you go to

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.070 
together right away but when you go to
cut<00:05:32.190> it<00:05:32.340> it's<00:05:32.520> gonna<00:05:32.790> get<00:05:33.300> on<00:05:33.419> your<00:05:33.570> knife<00:05:33.780> and

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
cut it it's gonna get on your knife and

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.940 
cut it it's gonna get on your knife and
it's<00:05:34.380> gonna<00:05:34.500> get<00:05:34.680> all<00:05:34.830> gooey<00:05:35.160> and<00:05:35.550> your

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
it's gonna get all gooey and your

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.310 
it's gonna get all gooey and your
all<00:05:36.490> the<00:05:36.610> time<00:05:36.790> trying<00:05:37.000> to<00:05:37.090> cut<00:05:37.300> it<00:05:37.420> so<00:05:37.600> cut<00:05:38.170> all

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
all the time trying to cut it so cut all

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.040 
all the time trying to cut it so cut all
your<00:05:38.500> pieces<00:05:38.680> out<00:05:38.980> first<00:05:39.340> then<00:05:40.270> laminate<00:05:40.960> them

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
your pieces out first then laminate them

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.570 
your pieces out first then laminate them
with<00:05:41.170> your<00:05:41.320> spray<00:05:41.500> adhesive<00:05:41.890> now<00:05:42.100> B<00:05:42.310> that'll

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
with your spray adhesive now B that'll

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.040 
with your spray adhesive now B that'll
be<00:05:42.670> in<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:42.940> build<00:05:43.360> videos<00:05:43.690> you'll<00:05:43.810> see<00:05:43.840> all

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
be in the build videos you'll see all

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.890 
be in the build videos you'll see all
that<00:05:44.340> it's<00:05:45.340> just<00:05:45.460> good<00:05:45.640> stuff<00:05:45.730> so<00:05:46.150> that's<00:05:46.780> what

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
that it's just good stuff so that's what

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.170 
that it's just good stuff so that's what
I<00:05:46.960> use<00:05:47.080> dollar<00:05:47.410> tree<00:05:47.770> foam<00:05:48.070> pull<00:05:48.910> the<00:05:49.000> paper

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
I use dollar tree foam pull the paper

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.410 
I use dollar tree foam pull the paper
off<00:05:49.480> use<00:05:50.350> my<00:05:50.560> alcohol<00:05:51.100> technique<00:05:51.550> you<00:05:52.180> can't

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
off use my alcohol technique you can't

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.270 
off use my alcohol technique you can't
go<00:05:52.570> wrong<00:05:52.810> and<00:05:53.170> if<00:05:53.500> you<00:05:53.590> have<00:05:53.680> any<00:05:53.830> questions

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
go wrong and if you have any questions

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.220 
go wrong and if you have any questions
about<00:05:54.460> this<00:05:55.180> which<00:05:55.600> I<00:05:55.720> don't<00:05:55.900> see<00:05:56.050> how<00:05:56.170> you

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
about this which I don't see how you

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.010 
about this which I don't see how you
would<00:05:56.620> but<00:05:57.340> if<00:05:57.460> you<00:05:57.550> have<00:05:57.790> any<00:05:57.940> questions<00:05:58.330> just

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
would but if you have any questions just
