00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 Well , first I want to congratulate that 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:12.509
 well-deserved victory and well-deserved way out 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:15.530
 in the premier league with regard to us then to 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.530
 Sorry big 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.080
 we crumbled in the second half yes but it 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.699
 due to the fact that in general we are far away 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.980
 far from optimal composition played and 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.650
 but even so, we are, in general, 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.360
 first half and start of the second half 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.450
 had a pretty good and not 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.460
 realized those moments that had 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:46.230
 with such a team with such a powerful team 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:51.270
 somehow and of course playing especially in 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.730
 away you have to score goals and that moment 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.710
 which we did not use it at the beginning 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.960
 a second half when the empty net dynaco 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.530
 letting it not score it went very strong 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.239
 and affected our game and then after 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.860
 we almost never had this 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.729
 a chance to save the game but once again life 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.630
 continues 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.790
 we take it very seriously and even make a conclusion 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.659
 You can be sure that this is me. 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.939
 spoke 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.979
 our fans and our specialists 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:32.759
 yeah grad so there once again wins if 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:35.610
 there are some questions and in general 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.220
 I think we are very good season 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.770
 conducted and those tasks that faced 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.400
 the team we executed them for 200 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.049
 percent 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.540
 our task was to catch on 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.460
 the main thing is to show yourself to show that 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.530
 Volgograd there is a team in the city 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.630
 there is football it was very very 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.570
 important on and there it is possible to build further 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.439
 work, I think it's a success to us 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.170
 succeeded 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.680
 the rotor in recent years is just 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.149
 began to forget that there is such a city 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.840
 on the football map of Russia 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:13.020
 We successfully recalled that Volgograd 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.180
 There is football Volgograd there is and the rotor still 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.720
 I repeat once again it is possible to build 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.180
 so the evaluation of our season I consider to 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.849
 quite satisfactory but on 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.050
 this should not stop and 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.989
 you can move further forward 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.180
 what are we going to do as for there 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.670
 Tomsk what assessment can I want 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.730
 congratulate Sergey before him his 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.790
 colleague of his friend yes and lend him 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.450
 there say him words of support i know 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.250
 there is a difficult situation here therefore 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.159
 well done and what together with the team decided 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.799
 I therefore congratulate the task 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:55.980
 Well personally first season ended yet 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.230
 congratulations to all fans of the text 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.739
 swords with a well-deserved victory 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.370
 example of the league well, and on the game and today we 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.470
 elected 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.420
 tactics of three defenders played 5 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.840
 midfielders and two strikers principle 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.790
 she brought us the result we scored two 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.769
 goals then you have already rebuilt 4 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.530
 started playing stubble 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.720
 The combination was different today I hope 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:28.889
 you liked football and showed that game 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:31.530
 who waited so long before even over here 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.959
 not due to the fact that guys principle on 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.659
 coaching tried this circuit but you 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.489
 understand that you need to play around and 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.989
 know this thoroughly lacked 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.590
 interaction in the lines well that's because 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.319
 this a little bit 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.510
 forgot him then calmed down and 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.510
 corrected the principle of scored cars 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.660
 yes no she was an ordinary game i won't tell 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.210
 that the company was weaker than the same example and grief 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.910
 no good team fast and very 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:14.120
 have seen young players run ahead 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.070
 aim at the gate here well again 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.010
 tactically he tells us act today 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.110
 us and here is the drawing that led to 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.550
 results and then we played 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.300
 understandably from defense 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.300
 scored the third goal
