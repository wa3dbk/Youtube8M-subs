00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.490 
okay in this blender 2.7 tutorial for
advanced<00:00:03.600> beginners<00:00:04.049> I'm<00:00:04.200> going<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.380> show<00:00:04.470> you

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
advanced beginners I'm going to show you

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.619 
advanced beginners I'm going to show you
my<00:00:04.710> workflow<00:00:05.009> for<00:00:05.430> working<00:00:05.790> with<00:00:05.940> weight

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
my workflow for working with weight

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.660 
my workflow for working with weight
painting<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.290> I've<00:00:07.859> showed<00:00:08.069> others<00:00:08.340> but<00:00:08.580> this

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
painting and I've showed others but this

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.370 
painting and I've showed others but this
is<00:00:08.880> there's<00:00:09.450> some<00:00:09.570> other<00:00:09.690> techniques<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.230> here

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
is there's some other techniques in here

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.669 
is there's some other techniques in here
that<00:00:10.500> are<00:00:10.590> really<00:00:10.800> useful<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:12.590> normally<00:00:13.590> when

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
that are really useful so normally when

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.020 
that are really useful so normally when
you<00:00:13.769> come<00:00:13.889> up<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.340> have<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.820> I

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
you come up here and you have this I

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.880 
you come up here and you have this I
mean<00:00:15.630> weight<00:00:15.809> paint<00:00:16.080> mode<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.680> object

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
mean weight paint mode on this object

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.730 
mean weight paint mode on this object
here<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.699> I'm<00:00:18.390> in<00:00:18.539> add<00:00:18.810> mode<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.529> come

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
here and I'm in add mode so I can come

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.000 
here and I'm in add mode so I can come
over<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.490> paint<00:00:21.140> like<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.170> or<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> can

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
over here and paint like that or I can

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.759 
over here and paint like that or I can
click<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.699> go<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.910> subtract<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.680> I

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
click this and go to subtract and I

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.970 
click this and go to subtract and I
could<00:00:25.920> subtract<00:00:26.430> from<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.789> weight<00:00:26.970> up<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.689> here

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
could subtract from a weight up in here

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.620 
could subtract from a weight up in here
like<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.130> but<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.880> lot<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> times<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.570> don't

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
like this but a lot of times I don't

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.990 
like this but a lot of times I don't
paint<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.470> that's<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.579> way<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.969> it

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
paint like that that's one way to do it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.729 
paint like that that's one way to do it
but<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.300> I'm<00:00:33.719> always<00:00:34.140> looking<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.680> little

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
but I I'm always looking for a little

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.190 
but I I'm always looking for a little
more<00:00:34.920> control<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.120> reason<00:00:36.809> being<00:00:37.020> is

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
more control and the reason being is

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.220 
more control and the reason being is
that<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.739> use<00:00:37.950> these<00:00:38.840> vertex<00:00:39.840> groups

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
that you can use these vertex groups

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.200 
that you can use these vertex groups
because<00:00:40.620> weight<00:00:40.860> paint<00:00:41.129> applies<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.850> vertex

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
because weight paint applies to vertex

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.729 
because weight paint applies to vertex
groups<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:42.930> back<00:00:43.079> into<00:00:43.230> object<00:00:43.440> mode

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
groups if I go back into object mode

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.209 
groups if I go back into object mode
with<00:00:44.309> control<00:00:45.030> tab<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.739> over<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.950> here

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
with control tab and I go over to here

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.770 
with control tab and I go over to here
the<00:00:47.460> upside-down<00:00:47.760> triangle<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.510> look<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the upside-down triangle and look at the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.260 
the upside-down triangle and look at the
vertex<00:00:49.110> group<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:50.700> vertex

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
vertex group it is just this one vertex

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.240 
vertex group it is just this one vertex
groups<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> values<00:00:52.350> are<00:00:52.590> actually<00:00:52.710> set

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
groups but the values are actually set

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.910 
groups but the values are actually set
in<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.690> well<00:00:55.110> they're<00:00:55.379> kind<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:55.890> of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
in this as well they're kind of one of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180 
in this as well they're kind of one of
the<00:00:56.070> same<00:00:56.219> if<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:56.550> into<00:00:56.699> edit<00:00:57.000> mode<00:00:57.890> here<00:00:58.890> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the same if I go into edit mode here I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.189 
the same if I go into edit mode here I
can<00:01:00.149> set<00:01:00.420> them<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.780> thought<00:01:00.899> I'm<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
can set them if I thought I'm going to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.049 
can set them if I thought I'm going to
send<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.440> back<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.649> I'll<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.340> set<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> back<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
send it back to I'll just set it back to

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.200 
send it back to I'll just set it back to
zero<00:01:03.619> for<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> moment<00:01:05.040> let's<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.430> since<00:01:06.090> I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
zero for the moment let's just since I

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.969 
zero for the moment let's just since I
have<00:01:06.330> zero<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.900> I'll<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.049> assign<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.770> like

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
have zero here I'll just assign it like

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.859 
have zero here I'll just assign it like
this<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.520> I'm<00:01:09.030> gonna<00:01:09.119> go<00:01:09.299> back<00:01:09.479> into<00:01:09.659> weight

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
this and I'm gonna go back into weight

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.780 
this and I'm gonna go back into weight
paint<00:01:10.140> mode<00:01:10.380> there<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.640> I've

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
paint mode there it is it's I've

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.429 
paint mode there it is it's I've
assigned<00:01:12.119> everything<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.689> zero<00:01:12.930> which<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.290> all

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
assigned everything to zero which is all

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.920 
assigned everything to zero which is all
blue<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.060> come<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.659> add

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
blue and then if I come up here and add

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.289 
blue and then if I come up here and add
then<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.619> see<00:01:16.799> we're<00:01:16.979> doing<00:01:17.670> by<00:01:17.820> painting

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
then you can see we're doing by painting

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.830 
then you can see we're doing by painting
like<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:20.060> vertex<00:01:21.060> groups<00:01:21.330> really<00:01:21.630> matter

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
like this so vertex groups really matter

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.600 
like this so vertex groups really matter
for<00:01:21.990> lots<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.680> things<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.070> mean<00:01:23.220> one<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
for lots of things I mean one of the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.570 
for lots of things I mean one of the
most<00:01:23.759> basic<00:01:23.970> things<00:01:24.210> we'd<00:01:24.540> be<00:01:24.689> saying<00:01:25.580> here

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
most basic things we'd be saying here

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.760 
most basic things we'd be saying here
particles<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:28.140> over<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.470> they<00:01:28.650> had<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
particles go over here they had a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.069 
particles go over here they had a
particle<00:01:29.280> system<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.329> hair<00:01:30.540> particles

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
particle system you do hair particles

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.050 
particle system you do hair particles
and<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.799> see<00:01:31.950> Harim<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.610> everywhere

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and you can see Harim it's everywhere

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.649 
and you can see Harim it's everywhere
from<00:01:33.329> all<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.549> all<00:01:35.549> these<00:01:35.850> vertices<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.420> are

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
from all the all these vertices that are

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.999 
from all the all these vertices that are
having<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.520> come<00:01:39.450> down<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:40.009> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
having here but if I come down here to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.179 
having here but if I come down here to
vertex<00:01:41.369> group<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.600> use<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.110> length<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
vertex group and I use a length and I

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.639 
vertex group and I use a length and I
pick<00:01:44.490> my<00:01:44.520> vertex<00:01:45.060> group<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.500> just

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
pick my vertex group then it's just

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.740 
pick my vertex group then it's just
going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.860> emit<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.280> from<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.670> area<00:01:48.119> where

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
going to emit it from that area where

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.380 
going to emit it from that area where
that<00:01:48.990> where<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.649> weight<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.890> painted<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.729> that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that where the weight is painted on that

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.719 
that where the weight is painted on that
mesh<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.710> applies<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> lot<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.579> things

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
mesh so this applies for a lot of things

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.230 
mesh so this applies for a lot of things
for<00:01:54.200> physics<00:01:55.200> effects<00:01:55.560> soft<00:01:56.100> body<00:01:56.369> effects<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
for physics effects soft body effects I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.749 
for physics effects soft body effects I
mean<00:01:58.140> these<00:01:58.409> all<00:01:58.619> kinds<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.250> effects<00:01:59.579> so

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
mean these all kinds of effects so

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.760 
mean these all kinds of effects so
vertex<00:02:00.149> groups<00:02:00.390> are<00:02:00.509> really<00:02:00.689> powerful<00:02:01.140> but

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
vertex groups are really powerful but

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.550 
vertex groups are really powerful but
there's<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.729> let's<00:02:02.909> turn<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.210> back<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.719> well

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
there's so let's turn this back to well

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.640 
there's so let's turn this back to well
get<00:02:04.979> rid<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.219> particle<00:02:05.670> system

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
get rid of the particle system

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.960 
get rid of the particle system
and<00:02:08.650> I'll<00:02:08.920> go<00:02:09.040> back<00:02:09.190> into<00:02:09.370> wait<00:02:09.580> paint<00:02:09.820> mode

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
and I'll go back into wait paint mode

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.840 
and I'll go back into wait paint mode
here<00:02:10.270> in<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.630> edit<00:02:10.870> mode<00:02:10.920> first<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.520> I'll

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
here in the edit mode first and I'll

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.150 
here in the edit mode first and I'll
reassign<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.570> zero<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.200> then<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:14.830> go<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.100> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
reassign it to zero and then I go in the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.400 
reassign it to zero and then I go in the
wait<00:02:15.310> paint<00:02:15.580> mode<00:02:15.840> alright<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.020> there<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.350> a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
wait paint mode alright so there it is a

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.020 
wait paint mode alright so there it is a
blank<00:02:17.650> slate<00:02:17.740> so<00:02:18.430> instead<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.820> directly

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
blank slate so instead of directly

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.640 
blank slate so instead of directly
painting<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:21.280> an<00:02:21.460> heater<00:02:21.670> with<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.880> brush

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
painting like an heater with a brush

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.230 
painting like an heater with a brush
what<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.680> tend<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.100> do<00:02:24.250> is<00:02:24.430> they<00:02:24.460> paid<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:25.030> couple

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
what I tend to do is they paid a couple

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.310 
what I tend to do is they paid a couple
different<00:02:25.570> ways<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.780> may<00:02:25.900> not<00:02:26.080> be<00:02:26.200> familiar

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
different ways you may not be familiar

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.500 
different ways you may not be familiar
these<00:02:27.010> are<00:02:27.160> really<00:02:27.400> useful<00:02:27.610> techniques<00:02:28.270> is

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
these are really useful techniques is

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.240 
these are really useful techniques is
one<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:31.020> hold<00:02:32.020> down<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.350> ctrl<00:02:32.800> key<00:02:32.830> and

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
one is that I hold down the ctrl key and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.630 
one is that I hold down the ctrl key and
the<00:02:33.310> Alt<00:02:33.610> key<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.500> have<00:02:35.950> both<00:02:36.190> held<00:02:36.430> down

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
the Alt key and so I have both held down

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.040 
the Alt key and so I have both held down
and<00:02:36.940> then<00:02:37.030> with<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.240> left<00:02:37.420> mouse<00:02:37.600> button<00:02:37.630> I

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
and then with the left mouse button I

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.800 
and then with the left mouse button I
just<00:02:38.230> pull<00:02:38.590> back<00:02:38.620> like<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.490> and<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:40.600> can

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
just pull back like this and I can

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.040 
just pull back like this and I can
basically<00:02:41.440> add<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.070> spot<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.720> that's

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
basically add a spot to it and that's

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.590 
basically add a spot to it and that's
dependent<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:46.330> weight<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:49.270> the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
dependent on this weight and the

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.150 
dependent on this weight and the
strength<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.110> course<00:02:50.410> as<00:02:50.650> well

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
strength of course as well

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.870 
strength of course as well
what<00:02:51.820> kind<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.120> spot<00:02:52.330> you're<00:02:52.540> gonna<00:02:52.630> add<00:02:53.880> I'll

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
what kind of spot you're gonna add I'll

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.700 
what kind of spot you're gonna add I'll
crank<00:02:55.150> up<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.420> weight<00:02:55.570> I<00:02:55.870> wanted<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.590> know

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
crank up the weight I wanted you know

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.340 
crank up the weight I wanted you know
weight<00:02:56.920> that's<00:02:57.520> gonna<00:02:57.670> be<00:02:57.850> get<00:02:58.780> me<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.050> a<00:02:59.080> red

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
weight that's gonna be get me to a red

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.640 
weight that's gonna be get me to a red
spot<00:02:59.650> as<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.130> go<00:03:00.660> if<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.720> had<00:03:01.870> full<00:03:02.080> strength<00:03:02.470> it

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
spot as I go if I had full strength it

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.730 
spot as I go if I had full strength it
would<00:03:02.800> be<00:03:02.950> red<00:03:03.190> should<00:03:03.790> be<00:03:03.940> red<00:03:04.560> there<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.650> is

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
would be red should be red there it is

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.160 
would be red should be red there it is
red<00:03:06.130> like<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.580> ok<00:03:06.970> so<00:03:07.510> that's<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.780> great<00:03:07.930> way

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
red like that ok so that's a great way

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.310 
red like that ok so that's a great way
and<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:09.570> resolution<00:03:10.570> of<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:10.960> dependent

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
and the resolution of that is dependent

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.790 
and the resolution of that is dependent
upon<00:03:11.380> your<00:03:11.590> mesh<00:03:12.040> underneath<00:03:12.400> too<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.870> that

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
upon your mesh underneath too so that

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.650 
upon your mesh underneath too so that
matters<00:03:15.130> now<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.430> other<00:03:15.610> thing<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:15.910> also<00:03:16.060> paint

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
matters now the other thing I also paint

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.210 
matters now the other thing I also paint
with<00:03:16.810> is<00:03:16.990> with<00:03:17.170> gradients<00:03:17.800> and<00:03:17.950> these<00:03:18.100> are

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
with is with gradients and these are

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.480 
with is with gradients and these are
really<00:03:18.520> powerful<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.900> now<00:03:20.770> I'm<00:03:21.190> just<00:03:21.370> gonna

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
really powerful so now I'm just gonna

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.810 
really powerful so now I'm just gonna
hold<00:03:21.790> down<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.180> Alt<00:03:22.570> key<00:03:22.780> only<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:24.130> now<00:03:24.670> with

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
hold down the Alt key only and now with

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.250 
hold down the Alt key only and now with
the<00:03:24.940> left<00:03:25.090> mouse<00:03:25.300> button<00:03:25.330> at<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.900> same<00:03:26.080> time

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
the left mouse button at the same time

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.900 
the left mouse button at the same time
I'm<00:03:26.320> gonna<00:03:26.440> start<00:03:26.650> dragging<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.220> across<00:03:27.310> and

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
I'm gonna start dragging it across and

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.330 
I'm gonna start dragging it across and
you<00:03:27.970> can<00:03:28.120> see<00:03:28.300> I'm<00:03:28.420> pulling<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.900> gradient

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
you can see I'm pulling a gradient

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.920 
you can see I'm pulling a gradient
across<00:03:30.340> this<00:03:30.730> whole<00:03:30.940> thing<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:31.390> this<00:03:31.660> and

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
across this whole thing like this and

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.199 
across this whole thing like this and
not<00:03:32.770> only<00:03:32.890> could<00:03:33.100> do<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.760> can<00:03:33.880> start

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
not only could do it you can start

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.540 
not only could do it you can start
closer<00:03:34.959> or<00:03:35.230> farther<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:36.010> know<00:03:36.130> if<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.310> start

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
closer or farther you know if you start

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.970 
closer or farther you know if you start
here<00:03:37.140> like<00:03:38.140> that<00:03:38.320> you<00:03:38.380> can<00:03:38.620> see<00:03:38.770> what<00:03:38.920> the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
here like that you can see what the

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.470 
here like that you can see what the
gradient<00:03:39.220> starts<00:03:39.670> like<00:03:39.970> this

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
gradient starts like this

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.900 
gradient starts like this
Arnold<00:03:41.140> ctrl<00:03:41.500> Z<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:42.190> like<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.489> start<00:03:42.730> out

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
Arnold ctrl Z that I like to start out

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.240 
Arnold ctrl Z that I like to start out
here<00:03:45.900> feels<00:03:46.900> like<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:47.410> then<00:03:47.590> as<00:03:47.800> you<00:03:48.010> get<00:03:48.160> it

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
here feels like and then as you get it

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.680 
here feels like and then as you get it
you<00:03:48.280> can<00:03:48.520> rotate<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:49.090> gradient<00:03:49.510> as<00:03:49.660> well<00:03:51.690> so

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
you can rotate the gradient as well so

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.820 
you can rotate the gradient as well so
this<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:52.870> how<00:03:53.050> to<00:03:53.110> set<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.470> then<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.709> have

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
this is how to set it and then you have

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.020 
this is how to set it and then you have
the<00:03:54.010> other<00:03:54.100> option<00:03:54.550> down<00:03:54.700> here<00:03:54.880> you<00:03:54.940> can

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
the other option down here you can

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.820 
the other option down here you can
change<00:03:55.239> this<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.450> radial<00:03:55.989> and<00:03:56.440> you'll<00:03:56.590> have<00:03:56.709> to

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
change this to radial and you'll have to

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.140 
change this to radial and you'll have to
just<00:03:57.040> experiment<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:57.520> can<00:03:57.640> see<00:03:57.820> how<00:03:58.000> it's

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
just experiment you can see how it's

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.630 
just experiment you can see how it's
changed<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.660> in<00:03:58.840> that<00:03:58.989> sense

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
changed it in that sense

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
changed it in that sense
yikes<00:04:01.020> there<00:04:02.020> as<00:04:02.170> you<00:04:02.260> can<00:04:02.290> see<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.650> road

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
yikes there as you can see the road

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.030 
yikes there as you can see the road
curves<00:04:04.660> you<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.080> so<00:04:05.680> all<00:04:05.709> these<00:04:05.980> little

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
curves you to it so all these little

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.280 
curves you to it so all these little
things<00:04:06.550> really<00:04:06.790> help<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:07.360> it's<00:04:07.989> a<00:04:08.140> lot

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
things really help and it's a lot

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.900 
things really help and it's a lot
simpler<00:04:08.680> for<00:04:08.770> me<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.220> try<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:09.580> generate<00:04:09.670> a

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
simpler for me to try and generate a

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.150 
simpler for me to try and generate a
gradient<00:04:10.390> this<00:04:10.570> way<00:04:10.780> than<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.620> is<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:11.920> try<00:04:12.100> and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
gradient this way than it is to try and

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.300 
gradient this way than it is to try and
do<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:12.580> with<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.760> paintbrush<00:04:13.390> up<00:04:13.840> here

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
do it with a paintbrush up here

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.819 
do it with a paintbrush up here
is<00:04:15.550> or<00:04:16.329> some<00:04:16.810> cases<00:04:17.169> I'll<00:04:17.290> do<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.620> with<00:04:18.450> just<00:04:19.450> in

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
is or some cases I'll do it with just in

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.260 
is or some cases I'll do it with just in
well<00:04:20.829> I'll<00:04:20.980> show<00:04:21.190> you<00:04:21.250> I'll<00:04:21.489> go<00:04:21.639> into<00:04:21.910> here<00:04:22.150> and

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
well I'll show you I'll go into here and

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.250 
well I'll show you I'll go into here and
edit<00:04:22.660> mode<00:04:22.990> and<00:04:23.290> sometimes<00:04:24.010> I'll<00:04:24.220> do<00:04:24.370> it<00:04:24.520> with

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
edit mode and sometimes I'll do it with

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.770 
edit mode and sometimes I'll do it with
the<00:04:26.260> Alt<00:04:26.500> key<00:04:26.650> and<00:04:27.100> I'll<00:04:27.340> do<00:04:27.820> an<00:04:27.940> edge<00:04:28.150> select

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
the Alt key and I'll do an edge select

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.710 
the Alt key and I'll do an edge select
like<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:29.730> then<00:04:30.730> I'll<00:04:31.090> just<00:04:31.389> set<00:04:31.600> the

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
like that and then I'll just set the

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.780 
like that and then I'll just set the
values<00:04:32.080> directly<00:04:32.470> in<00:04:32.800> here<00:04:33.070> you<00:04:33.400> know<00:04:33.520> maybe<00:04:33.669> I

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
values directly in here you know maybe I

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.960 
values directly in here you know maybe I
want<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.389> pin<00:04:34.720> this<00:04:34.990> set<00:04:35.680> this<00:04:35.860> one<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.580> I'll

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
want to pin this set this one and I'll

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.570 
want to pin this set this one and I'll
assign<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:38.530> then<00:04:38.770> you'll<00:04:38.919> see<00:04:39.130> it<00:04:39.160> back<00:04:39.370> in

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
assign it and then you'll see it back in

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.879 
assign it and then you'll see it back in
way<00:04:39.730> pane<00:04:40.000> mode<00:04:41.880> like<00:04:42.880> that<00:04:43.650> there<00:04:44.650> it<00:04:44.740> is

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
way pane mode like that there it is

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.409 
way pane mode like that there it is
there<00:04:45.070> like<00:04:45.370> that<00:04:45.580> so<00:04:45.760> it<00:04:45.910> but<00:04:46.090> actually<00:04:46.330> that

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
there like that so it but actually that

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.360 
there like that so it but actually that
edge<00:04:46.570> is<00:04:46.750> pinned<00:04:47.050> so<00:04:47.470> we<00:04:47.590> can<00:04:47.740> see<00:04:47.950> that<00:04:48.190> if<00:04:48.340> we

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
edge is pinned so we can see that if we

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.200 
edge is pinned so we can see that if we
do<00:04:48.610> say<00:04:49.000> let's<00:04:49.300> add<00:04:49.479> something<00:04:49.840> like

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
do say let's add something like

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.360 
do say let's add something like
something<00:04:52.210> simple<00:04:52.570> like<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.720> wind<00:04:53.050> effect<00:04:53.370> to

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
something simple like a wind effect to

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.770 
something simple like a wind effect to
this<00:04:54.490> object<00:04:54.970> I'll<00:04:55.150> just<00:04:55.270> put<00:04:55.479> it<00:04:55.570> over<00:04:55.630> here

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
this object I'll just put it over here

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.510 
this object I'll just put it over here
shift<00:04:56.680> a<00:04:56.889> add<00:04:57.220> physics<00:04:57.850> add<00:04:58.750> effect<00:04:59.290> wind<00:04:59.919> okay

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
shift a add physics add effect wind okay

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.010 
shift a add physics add effect wind okay
there<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:01.479> is<00:05:01.600> then<00:05:02.200> I'll<00:05:02.410> do<00:05:02.590> our<00:05:03.160> Y<00:05:03.750> they<00:05:04.750> tilt

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
there it is then I'll do our Y they tilt

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.640 
there it is then I'll do our Y they tilt
it<00:05:05.200> up<00:05:05.320> go<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.310> physics<00:05:06.639> tab<00:05:07.470> crank<00:05:08.470> up<00:05:08.590> the

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
it up go to the physics tab crank up the

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.140 
it up go to the physics tab crank up the
strength<00:05:09.040> a<00:05:09.160> little<00:05:09.280> bit<00:05:09.550> like<00:05:09.729> this<00:05:09.910> and

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
strength a little bit like this and

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.930 
strength a little bit like this and
press<00:05:10.389> all<00:05:10.570> day<00:05:10.600> Oh<00:05:11.639> cuz<00:05:12.639> they<00:05:12.700> don't<00:05:12.850> have

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
press all day Oh cuz they don't have

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.250 
press all day Oh cuz they don't have
anything<00:05:13.150> applied<00:05:13.510> to<00:05:13.660> it<00:05:13.720> let's<00:05:13.870> make<00:05:14.020> them<00:05:14.139> a

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
anything applied to it let's make them a

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.960 
anything applied to it let's make them a
cloth<00:05:14.500> object<00:05:14.979> okay<00:05:15.790> and<00:05:16.120> get<00:05:16.450> a<00:05:17.760> let's<00:05:18.760> get

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
cloth object okay and get a let's get

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.930 
cloth object okay and get a let's get
that<00:05:19.090> vertex<00:05:19.479> group<00:05:19.810> alright<00:05:20.669> and<00:05:21.669> then<00:05:21.820> with

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
that vertex group alright and then with

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:30.330 
that vertex group alright and then with
wind<00:05:25.289> level<00:05:26.289> crank<00:05:26.560> it<00:05:26.650> up<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:29.830> you<00:05:29.950> can<00:05:30.100> see

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
wind level crank it up and you can see

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.580 
wind level crank it up and you can see
it's<00:05:30.550> blowing<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.030> wind<00:05:31.210> across<00:05:31.419> there<00:05:31.990> but

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
it's blowing the wind across there but

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.200 
it's blowing the wind across there but
this<00:05:32.740> piece<00:05:32.979> is<00:05:33.190> pinned<00:05:33.490> in<00:05:33.640> place<00:05:33.820> so<00:05:34.120> the

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
this piece is pinned in place so the

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:41.130 
this piece is pinned in place so the
whole<00:05:34.330> thing<00:05:34.570> can't<00:05:34.840> move<00:05:39.000> like<00:05:40.000> that<00:05:40.060> in<00:05:40.990> fact

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
whole thing can't move like that in fact

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.900 
whole thing can't move like that in fact
even<00:05:41.350> this<00:05:41.530> far<00:05:41.830> side<00:05:42.130> doesn't<00:05:42.400> want<00:05:42.669> to<00:05:42.729> move

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
even this far side doesn't want to move

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.370 
even this far side doesn't want to move
too<00:05:43.120> much<00:05:43.150> let's<00:05:43.510> crank<00:05:43.780> this<00:05:43.870> up<00:05:44.080> a<00:05:44.200> little

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
too much let's crank this up a little

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.650 
too much let's crank this up a little
bit<00:05:47.220> so<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.340> far<00:05:48.550> sides<00:05:48.820> are<00:05:48.970> not<00:05:49.060> moving<00:05:49.389> and

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
bit so the far sides are not moving and

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.629 
bit so the far sides are not moving and
we<00:05:49.840> can<00:05:49.990> verify<00:05:50.200> that<00:05:50.410> let's<00:05:50.919> see<00:05:51.039> what<00:05:51.460> we

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
we can verify that let's see what we

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.570 
we can verify that let's see what we
paint<00:05:51.940> mode<00:05:52.150> looks<00:05:52.389> like<00:05:52.570> on<00:05:52.750> this<00:05:52.960> thing

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
paint mode looks like on this thing

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.159 
paint mode looks like on this thing
that's<00:05:54.580> because<00:05:54.789> it's<00:05:54.970> pretty<00:05:55.240> solid<00:05:55.479> back<00:05:55.960> in

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
that's because it's pretty solid back in

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:01.110 
that's because it's pretty solid back in
here<00:05:56.410> on<00:05:56.530> this<00:05:56.740> side<00:05:56.950> as<00:05:57.160> well<00:05:57.400> so<00:05:59.729> of<00:06:00.729> course<00:06:01.000> I

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
here on this side as well so of course I

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.360 
here on this side as well so of course I
could<00:06:01.270> just<00:06:01.450> subtract<00:06:01.870> that<00:06:02.080> out<00:06:02.350> I<00:06:02.680> could

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
could just subtract that out I could

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.740 
could just subtract that out I could
subtract<00:06:03.850> this<00:06:04.090> edge

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
subtract this edge

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:17.370 
subtract this edge
I'll<00:06:05.169> just<00:06:05.440> control

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.840 

subtract<00:06:18.380> that<00:06:18.620> well<00:06:18.890> this<00:06:19.070> is<00:06:19.250> still<00:06:19.490> held<00:06:19.700> so

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
subtract that well this is still held so

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:33.309 
subtract that well this is still held so
now<00:06:19.970> the<00:06:20.030> whole<00:06:20.210> thing<00:06:20.270> is<00:06:20.510> going<00:06:20.660> to<00:06:20.750> move

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.170 

and<00:06:33.710> there<00:06:34.069> you<00:06:34.189> go<00:06:34.369> alright<00:06:34.819> well<00:06:35.059> that

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
and there you go alright well that

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.700 
and there you go alright well that
should<00:06:35.330> give<00:06:35.449> you<00:06:35.509> pretty<00:06:35.839> good<00:06:36.050> ideas<00:06:36.439> how<00:06:36.680> to

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
should give you pretty good ideas how to

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.589 
should give you pretty good ideas how to
get<00:06:37.009> control<00:06:37.309> these<00:06:37.580> things<00:06:37.639> since<00:06:38.389> that's

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
get control these things since that's

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.299 
get control these things since that's
not<00:06:38.719> completely<00:06:39.319> pinned<00:06:39.680> down<00:06:39.800> you<00:06:40.009> can<00:06:40.159> see

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:40.309 
not completely pinned down you can see

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:42.459 
not completely pinned down you can see
it<00:06:40.339> wants<00:06:40.669> to<00:06:40.849> get<00:06:41.599> pulled<00:06:41.869> out<00:06:42.020> of<00:06:42.199> there<00:06:42.319> as

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:42.469 
it wants to get pulled out of there as

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:45.040 
it wants to get pulled out of there as
well<00:06:42.680> so<00:06:43.399> but<00:06:43.969> these<00:06:44.149> really<00:06:44.389> help<00:06:44.629> all<00:06:44.839> these

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
well so but these really help all these

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.689 
well so but these really help all these
little<00:06:45.229> tricks<00:06:45.559> really<00:06:45.889> help<00:06:46.159> depending<00:06:46.610> on

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:46.699 
little tricks really help depending on

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:48.399 
little tricks really help depending on
which<00:06:46.819> we<00:06:46.969> were<00:06:47.059> trying<00:06:47.330> to<00:06:47.360> do<00:06:47.539> in<00:06:47.809> the<00:06:48.110> engine

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:48.409 
which we were trying to do in the engine

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:49.209 
which we were trying to do in the engine
okay

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:49.219 
okay

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:51.129
