00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
over the last 20 years I've literally

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.720 
over the last 20 years I've literally
made<00:00:03.419> tens<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:04.110> thousands<00:00:04.770> of<00:00:04.890> feet<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.250> trim

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
made tens of thousands of feet of trim

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.000 
made tens of thousands of feet of trim
and<00:00:05.940> molding<00:00:06.080> using<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.140> router<00:00:07.319> table<00:00:07.770> setup

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
and molding using a router table setup

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.250 
and molding using a router table setup
and<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.550> want<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.820> show<00:00:09.000> you<00:00:09.059> exactly<00:00:09.599> how<00:00:09.960> you

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
and I want to show you exactly how you

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.830 
and I want to show you exactly how you
can<00:00:10.559> succeed<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:12.030> same<00:00:12.210> kind<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.630> venture

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
can succeed in the same kind of venture

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.680 
can succeed in the same kind of venture
now<00:00:13.769> first<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.610> all<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.940> have<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.299> understand

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
now first of all you have to understand

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.410 
now first of all you have to understand
that<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.440> process<00:00:16.949> needs<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.400> start<00:00:17.789> with

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
that the process needs to start with

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.189 
that the process needs to start with
wood<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.350> very<00:00:19.980> crisp<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.090> regular<00:00:21.720> you

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
wood that is very crisp and regular you

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.170 
wood that is very crisp and regular you
want<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.590> wood<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.949> have<00:00:23.100> square<00:00:23.580> edges<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
want that wood to have square edges and

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.570 
want that wood to have square edges and
to<00:00:24.390> be<00:00:24.510> exactly<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.320> same<00:00:25.350> size<00:00:25.830> from<00:00:26.310> one

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
to be exactly the same size from one

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.099 
to be exactly the same size from one
piece<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.119> other<00:00:27.210> if<00:00:27.810> there's<00:00:27.960> any

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
piece to the other if there's any

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.870 
piece to the other if there's any
difference<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.800> size<00:00:29.099> that's<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.820> to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
difference in size that's going to

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.759 
difference in size that's going to
translate<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.420> differences<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.320> size<00:00:31.529> of

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
translate to differences in the size of

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.590 
translate to differences in the size of
your<00:00:31.890> trim<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.880> not<00:00:33.090> going<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.360> meet

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
your trim and it's not going to meet

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.830 
your trim and it's not going to meet
together<00:00:34.079> properly<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> corners<00:00:35.489> now<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
together properly in the corners now the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.520 
together properly in the corners now the
table<00:00:37.200> itself<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.860> another<00:00:38.340> critical<00:00:38.640> issue<00:00:39.530> I

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
table itself is another critical issue I

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.639 
table itself is another critical issue I
prefer<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> stationary<00:00:42.149> floor<00:00:42.840> mounted<00:00:43.230> table

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
prefer a stationary floor mounted table

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.560 
prefer a stationary floor mounted table
for<00:00:43.920> making<00:00:44.250> trim<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.390> lot

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
for making trim because it's just a lot

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.150 
for making trim because it's just a lot
easier<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:46.170> work<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.379> when<00:00:46.800> it's

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
easier to work with when it's

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.549 
easier to work with when it's
automatically<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:47.969> table<00:00:48.390> height<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:49.350> also

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
automatically at table height it's also

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.279 
automatically at table height it's also
more<00:00:50.250> stable<00:00:50.370> which<00:00:51.300> comes<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.780> play<00:00:52.079> as

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
more stable which comes into play as

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.560 
more stable which comes into play as
you'll<00:00:52.500> see<00:00:52.770> when<00:00:53.309> you're<00:00:53.430> feeding<00:00:53.760> pieces<00:00:54.420> of

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
you'll see when you're feeding pieces of

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.990 
you'll see when you're feeding pieces of
trim<00:00:54.809> through<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.620> require<00:00:55.920> quite<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> lot<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
trim through can require quite a lot of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.689 
trim through can require quite a lot of
pulling<00:00:57.420> force<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.949> trim<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.550> go

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
pulling force to get that trim to go

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.819 
pulling force to get that trim to go
past<00:00:59.969> all<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> feather<00:01:00.989> boards<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.590> see

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
past all of the feather boards you see

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.729 
past all of the feather boards you see
here<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.359> stationary<00:01:04.199> table<00:01:04.559> just

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
here and so a stationary table just

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.310 
here and so a stationary table just
works<00:01:04.920> better<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.760> things<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.360> now

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
works better for things like that now

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.770 
works better for things like that now
take<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> close<00:01:08.460> look<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> table<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.450> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
take a close look at the table and I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.570 
take a close look at the table and I
want<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.350> point<00:01:10.530> out<00:01:10.740> some<00:01:11.070> essential

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
want to point out some essential

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.870 
want to point out some essential
features<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:13.650> fence<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.640> feather

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
features the fence and the feather

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.539 
features the fence and the feather
boards<00:01:15.299> are<00:01:15.710> critically<00:01:16.710> important<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
boards are critically important and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.249 
boards are critically important and
you'll<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.479> lot<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.900> feather

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
you'll see I have a lot of feather

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.810 
you'll see I have a lot of feather
boards<00:01:19.650> here<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.460> it's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
boards here that's because it's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300 
boards here that's because it's
essential<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.659> trim<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.710> supported

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
essential that the trim be supported

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.300 
essential that the trim be supported
fully<00:01:23.640> as<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.570> passes<00:01:24.780> past<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.770> router<00:01:25.979> bit

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
fully as it passes past the router bit

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.480 
fully as it passes past the router bit
without<00:01:26.850> moving<00:01:27.630> from<00:01:28.049> piece<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.350> piece<00:01:28.560> so

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
without moving from piece to piece so

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.999 
without moving from piece to piece so
I've<00:01:29.820> got<00:01:30.090> feather<00:01:30.360> boards<00:01:30.810> pointing<00:01:31.680> from

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
I've got feather boards pointing from

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.789 
I've got feather boards pointing from
top<00:01:32.549> down<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.720> hold<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> wood<00:01:34.290> down<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
top down to hold the wood down and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.130 
top down to hold the wood down and
feather<00:01:35.340> boards<00:01:35.790> coming<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.540> from<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> side

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
feather boards coming in from the side

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.800 
feather boards coming in from the side
to<00:01:37.770> push<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.220> wood<00:01:38.490> tight<00:01:39.210> against<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to push that wood tight against the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.230 
to push that wood tight against the
fence<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.290> can't<00:01:41.220> say<00:01:41.520> enough<00:01:41.670> about<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
fence I can't say enough about the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.020 
fence I can't say enough about the
importance<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.140> crisp<00:01:43.619> stock<00:01:44.189> preparation

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
importance of crisp stock preparation

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.690 
importance of crisp stock preparation
now<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:46.079> could<00:01:46.380> run<00:01:46.649> your<00:01:46.829> strips<00:01:47.159> through

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
now you could run your strips through

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.249 
now you could run your strips through
the<00:01:47.850> table<00:01:48.180> saw<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.659> get<00:01:48.750> them<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> right<00:01:49.079> size

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the table saw to get them the right size

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.590 
the table saw to get them the right size
but<00:01:50.009> ideally<00:01:50.399> you'll<00:01:51.149> want<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> use<00:01:51.509> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
but ideally you'll want to use a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.109 
but ideally you'll want to use a
thickness<00:01:52.049> planer<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:53.070> final<00:01:53.520> dimensioning

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
thickness planer for final dimensioning

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.450 
thickness planer for final dimensioning
that's<00:01:54.630> because<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.170> planer<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.710> more

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
that's because the planer is more

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.490 
that's because the planer is more
precise<00:01:56.820> than<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> table<00:01:57.509> saw<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.350> also

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
precise than the table saw and it also

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.010 
precise than the table saw and it also
yields<00:01:59.310> smooth<00:01:59.759> results<00:02:00.360> which<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
yields smooth results which is going to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.200 
yields smooth results which is going to
make<00:02:01.200> your<00:02:01.350> trim<00:02:01.649> easier<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.460> install<00:02:02.729> later

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
make your trim easier to install later

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.179 
make your trim easier to install later
because<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.990> back<00:02:04.200> surfaces<00:02:04.799> are<00:02:04.979> all<00:02:05.070> going

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
because the back surfaces are all going

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.639 
because the back surfaces are all going

to be perfectly flat we're just about
ready<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.160> run<00:02:09.000> some<00:02:09.300> strips<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.929> wood<00:02:10.140> through

one last thing
it's<00:02:13.890> essential<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.910> featherboards<00:02:15.600> be

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
it's essential that the featherboards be

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.440 
it's essential that the featherboards be

pressure to the wood as it goes through

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.060 
pressure to the wood as it goes through
it's<00:02:21.000> not<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.630> enough<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.140> be<00:02:22.350> there<00:02:22.650> they

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
it's not just enough of a be there they

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.190 
it's not just enough of a be there they
have<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.370> actually<00:02:23.520> press<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.360> wood<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.750> like
