performance and technique and developing

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.850 
performance and technique and developing
power<00:00:33.469> in<00:00:33.800> your<00:00:33.980> list<00:00:34.539> you<00:00:35.539> know<00:00:35.860> cosmetic

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
power in your list you know cosmetic

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.189 
power in your list you know cosmetic
stuff<00:00:37.129> is<00:00:37.430> kind<00:00:37.940> of<00:00:37.969> a<00:00:38.059> byproduct<00:00:38.239> there<00:00:38.870> side

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
stuff is kind of a byproduct there side

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.470 
stuff is kind of a byproduct there side
effect<00:00:39.620> of<00:00:40.780> lifting<00:00:41.780> with<00:00:42.489> heavier<00:00:43.489> loads<00:00:43.820> or

lifting<00:00:45.230> with<00:00:45.379> better<00:00:45.589> technique<00:00:46.159> okay<00:00:46.550> so

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
lifting with better technique okay so

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.500 
lifting with better technique okay so
three<00:00:47.690> things<00:00:47.929> through<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:48.710> states<00:00:49.359> that<00:00:50.359> are

really
more<00:03:04.460> of<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.730> power<00:03:05.060> lose<00:03:05.600> much<00:03:06.470> like<00:03:06.770> the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
more of a power lose much like the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.470 
more of a power lose much like the
deadlift<00:03:07.400> for<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.820> squat<00:03:08.770> what<00:03:09.770> easily<00:03:10.280> was

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
deadlift for the squat what easily was

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.780 
deadlift for the squat what easily was
heavier<00:03:11.480> loads<00:03:11.960> and<00:03:12.410> it's<00:03:12.920> about<00:03:13.130> performance

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
heavier loads and it's about performance

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.830 
heavier loads and it's about performance
listen<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.480> for<00:03:14.690> us<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.970> number<00:03:17.300> three<00:03:17.710> is

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
listen is for us so number three is

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:44.480 
listen is for us so number three is
another<00:03:20.840> mistake<00:03:21.230> that's<00:03:21.890> pretty<00:03:22.130> common

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.930 

now<00:03:45.030> that's<00:03:45.900> almost<00:03:46.230> fundamental<00:03:46.980> pink<00:03:47.340> but

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
now that's almost fundamental pink but

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.320 
now that's almost fundamental pink but
highly<00:03:48.750> dangerous<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:50.910> can<00:03:51.030> be<00:03:51.150> real<00:03:51.360> easy<00:03:51.390> to

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
highly dangerous it can be real easy to

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.610 
highly dangerous it can be real easy to
hurt<00:03:54.330> yourself<00:03:54.690> especially<00:03:54.870> if<00:03:55.470> you're
