00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
give this one to the intamin prefab

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.060 
give this one to the intamin prefab
colossus<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.270> insanely<00:01:42.869> tall<00:01:43.380> has<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> very

Europa<00:03:23.060> Park<00:03:23.269> is<00:03:23.420> that<00:03:23.600> they<00:03:23.750> don't<00:03:23.900> really

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
Europa Park is that they don't really

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.379 
Europa Park is that they don't really
have<00:03:24.260> any<00:03:24.829> thrilling<00:03:25.609> attractions<00:03:26.209> that

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
have any thrilling attractions that

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.300

aren't roller coasters Heidi Park

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.390 
aren't roller coasters Heidi Park

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
however has two of them a top spin and a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.770
