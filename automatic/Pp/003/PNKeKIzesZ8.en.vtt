00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:25.030
 he is aware of the ponies 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.030
 a balanced formula in its tracks 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.520
 it's a bit like watching where the woods 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.930
 it 's worse for others 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.930
 names that are scared 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.320
 I thank you for accepting our 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.629
 invitation 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.430
 having said that, to have a balance between 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.469
 different areas of life is one 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.440
 the main concerns of 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.360
 ibm gems that feels that there is stuff 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.519
 comic also savannah iran 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.860
 the business then for you sir 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.940
 style that is supposed to give vacuum 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.030
 and what do we hear more 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.619
 precisely of banos are from the church 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.530
 very well played even if already first of all 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.700
 to choose this theme because 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.860
 that she is very important and 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.210
 essential today in the in the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.679
 areas either of personal life or 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.060
 professional 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:16.159
 when talking about the balance making 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.590
 the part of two things the first one 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.690
 talk about the natural balanced human 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.679
 and then we talk about the balance of life 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.179
 and 1,2 there is a difference between helped to 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.580
 the human balance in fact and this is 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.899
 simply to ask the question 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.289
 when we define the human being 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:37.159
 what an already without brain is a body 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.630
 it's the spirit inside 5h20 what 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.070
 I often call the four is even 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.450
 if the mind does not start by years and he 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.280
 are people who in a lot more 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.960
 of importance to their brains so they 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.360
 read a lot they follow a lot of 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.579
 diploma training seminars 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.329
 lots of books etc 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.770
 but he forgot that when we give so 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.030
 you want more information to our 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.969
 brains automatically it's at 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.000
 detriment for example of our body so 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.619
 for example I do not do sports if 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.700
 my diet is not healthy and 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.410
 balanced 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.849
 automatically my brain does not go anymore 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.500
 follow because the body and the weak 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.510
 and ben automatically the brain is going 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.319
 reach what is called the deficit 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.290
 attention 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.819
 in the same way my heart if I 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.150
 am good at the physical level I do the 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.430
 sport 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.920
 if I'm balanced at the level 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.810
 food at the level of my brain I 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.940
 am well it's full of information 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.680
 intellectually I'm fine but at 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.599
 level of my heart I am great 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.310
 emotionally stressed I'm not 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.349
 emotionally intelligent so 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.900
 automatically there is an imbalance a 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.900
 so automatically it will affect there 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.489
 still my body I can be I 'll be 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.780
 more sick today the 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.090
 scientists say that the lack 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.799
 of emotional intelligence and ben they 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.709
 want where they cry where they manifest 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.140
 more than 85% of current diseases 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.880
 it's dangerous and then a fourth 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.519
 element is the mind that's the aspect 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.500
 his molds is spiritual if for example 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.540
 I live alone and I 'm not going 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.160
 in a climate of spirit of equipped 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.260
 okay not automatically I'm 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.760
 unbalanced even though I have a brain that 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.370
 is flat even though I still have that is 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.540
 well of a well-founded even though I have a 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.459
 emotional intelligence 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.799
 if I'm alone it does not work so 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.870
 already that's the basic elements of 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.420
 the human balance 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.310
 now let's go back to a young graduate to 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.620
 an employee and who tells you I am 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.750
 unbalanced already has and must know he 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.269
 is unbalanced on which one on which 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.739
 paul or on which axes 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.389
 that's the concept we call the 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.970
 wheel of life the love of life is 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.340
 what are these taxes or life a 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.109
 Balanced form in this brown axis 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.209
 becomes happier simply 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.829
 gold what are these seven axes the first 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.569
 axis and racks of personal life 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.880
 that is to say, my relationship with myself 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.770
 how am I with myself you know 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.690
 handicap number one 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.120
 you of this balance there is not to 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.100
 to love oneself as we are is a bit like 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.260
 look at the mellois and get dressed for 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.430
 the others not for ourselves after 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.990
 to professional life 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.430
 what is the professional life to 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.100
 professionals it's just 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.210
 do what I love to do to do it 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.790
 the right way with the good 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.540
 people for the right reasons 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.700
 that 's the professional domain 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.260
 today if anyone is asking 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.180
 question and tell you why I am 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.890
 not good that I'm unbalanced in 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.690
 my professional field 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.280
 very often maybe he does something 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.799
 thing he does well but that's because 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.380
 that he likes if we answer these four 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.780
 questions I do what I like good 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.360
 way with the right people and 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.040
 for the right reasons 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.050
 automatically the balanced it gets 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.290
 restores a third element 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.690
 automatically it's linked with the neo 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.310
 professional is the financial aspect 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.350
 today you will find even 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.250
 someone who loves what he does he the 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.870
 do good 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.300
 good reasons with the good 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.770
 people he is not happy why 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.660
 because automatically there is the aspect 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.300
 that enters into competition is 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.770
 to say for example will come twin country 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.200
 or simply he is well paid but 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.180
 gerbal his finances it's a solid pack 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.580
 personal and it impacts his life 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.720
 professional so he is unbalanced 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.280
 financially what touches the others 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.470
 axes and that's what's called 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.390
 financial intelligence and me it's 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.980
 always my wish is that 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.570
 education at the education level 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.490
 national that integrated it into the 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.470
 children's programs in any 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.630
 what graduates from revenge this is 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.810
 really my fourth element wish 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.390
 it's life if you want to family 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.710
 and relationship ok I'm fine 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.540
 with myself I am well 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.490
 professionally I handle well the 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.290
 finances but I'm not good at 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.800
 family level beyond my 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.919
 relationship 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.380
 relationships are toxic it smells like 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.310
 other axes will be impacted the action 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.500
 hero 5 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.430
 that's what I call life 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.130
 spiritual 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.580
 you know I can be good with me 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.530
 well in my profession well with my 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.100
 finances well with my family and my 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.680
 relationship 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.020
 but for example just a little disconnected 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.300
 on the great creator on the great god 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.310
 spirituality that means when 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.660
 I work for example with a team 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.430
 I do not work with the docks because 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.800
 I am French I work with 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.660
 amiens with naïma with that but there with 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.880
 a slr because I like them 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.100
 basically I like them it's nice 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.140
 to work with them if there is no 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.700
 this aspect that is invisible that me 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.650
 allows to work with this team 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.150
 there automatically I'll have a 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.500
 problem day an imbalance in 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.450
 egg 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.840
 so that's the ex number 5 there is our 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:26.690
 axis also quite forgotten that's what 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.220
 I call pleasure the hobbies you 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.510
 know me I've noticed since very 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.400
 long time when we do not have the 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.470
 leisure culture the people of the thief 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.850
 of state at the weekend how do you 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.770
 go spend your time often and we 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:40.100
 will tell you I'm tired I'm going to sleep 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.500
 oh I want to sleep in and 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.150
 it's extraordinary people do not have 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.160
 the culture of having fun 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.440
 I'll tell you one thing is it 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.320
 are there even people who are afraid of 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.490
 to please because when one is 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.199
 when 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.340
 we were children often our parents 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.750
 because he loves us but 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.060
 unfortunately the way of transmitting 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.030
 it was a little veyronnet am asked 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.410
 often to please others 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.419
 and it's a bit like it's a sin 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.500
 when we have fun we also 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:06.789
 even today I 'm not so you 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.039
 notice today in the travels 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:11.229
 annual dose find a frame that comes out 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:13.210
 with his family a trip full of 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:15.250
 pleasure and when he comes back to you 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.680
 of ivory was hyper stressed its price 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.900
 he takes himself for pleasure 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.940
 so that's the billysian more than 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.039
 pleasure either in the work or by 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.889
 a person having four hours later 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:29.560
 the last axis and health health 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:31.990
 imagine I'm good in my ex but 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.340
 all the time I get sick or all
