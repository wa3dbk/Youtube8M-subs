00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
I think there are just so many cards

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.420 
I think there are just so many cards
that<00:02:57.569> can<00:02:57.750> county<00:02:58.260> otter<00:02:58.500> off<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.130> top<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.340> my

that can county otter off the top of my

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.740 
that can county otter off the top of my
head<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.940> know<00:03:00.090> you've<00:03:00.209> got<00:03:00.390> your<00:03:00.480> effect

fiendish<00:03:02.459> chain<00:03:02.519> d<00:03:03.060> prison<00:03:03.569> mirror<00:03:03.930> force

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
fiendish chain d prison mirror force

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.500 
fiendish chain d prison mirror force
which<00:03:04.620> was<00:03:04.799> back<00:03:05.069> then<00:03:05.340> compulsory<00:03:05.970> there<00:03:06.420> are

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
which was back then compulsory there are

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.940 
which was back then compulsory there are
just<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:06.930> many<00:03:06.989> different<00:03:07.380> cards<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:07.890> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
just so many different cards and the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.729 
just so many different cards and the
fact<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.459> such<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> low<00:03:09.180> low<00:03:10.019> attack<00:03:10.440> I

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
fact this is such a low low attack I

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.890 
fact this is such a low low attack I
think<00:03:11.489> it's<00:03:11.700> possible<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.450> could<00:03:12.630> come

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
think it's possible that it could come

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
feather duster and right Jackie so

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.430 
feather duster and right Jackie so
Yahtzee<00:05:05.000> is<00:05:05.030> an<00:05:05.240> interesting<00:05:05.539> one<00:05:05.840> I<00:05:06.020> think<00:05:06.320> it

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
Yahtzee is an interesting one I think it

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.930 
Yahtzee is an interesting one I think it
could<00:05:06.620> come<00:05:06.830> back<00:05:06.860> but<00:05:07.340> I<00:05:07.370> don't<00:05:07.460> think<00:05:07.820> it

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
could come back but I don't think it

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.510 
could come back but I don't think it
will<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.330> think<00:05:08.630> Konami<00:05:08.990> should<00:05:09.320> at<00:05:10.070> least<00:05:10.280> put

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
will I think Konami should at least put

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.640 
will I think Konami should at least put
it<00:05:10.639> to<00:05:10.729> one<00:05:10.940> and<00:05:11.180> see<00:05:11.389> how<00:05:11.419> it<00:05:11.599> goes<00:05:11.690> obviously

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
it to one and see how it goes obviously

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.249 
it to one and see how it goes obviously
people<00:05:13.280> are<00:05:13.460> gonna<00:05:13.580> create<00:05:13.940> locks<00:05:14.360> again

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
people are gonna create locks again

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.050 
people are gonna create locks again
they're<00:05:15.740> gonna<00:05:15.860> create<00:05:16.159> new<00:05:16.400> locks<00:05:16.669> with

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
they're gonna create new locks with

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.360 
they're gonna create new locks with
yatta<00:05:17.270> it's<00:05:17.720> kind<00:05:18.110> of<00:05:18.259> there's<00:05:18.500> so<00:05:18.830> many<00:05:18.949> cards

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
yatta it's kind of there's so many cards

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.189 
yatta it's kind of there's so many cards
out<00:05:19.520> there<00:05:19.550> in<00:05:19.940> the<00:05:20.030> actual<00:05:20.300> card<00:05:20.539> base<00:05:20.750> that

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
out there in the actual card base that

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.370 
out there in the actual card base that
it<00:05:21.440> would<00:05:21.860> be<00:05:22.490> hard<00:05:22.849> not<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:23.180> recreate<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:24.050> lock

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
it would be hard not to recreate a lock

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.899 
it would be hard not to recreate a lock
I<00:05:24.620> just<00:05:24.979> don't<00:05:25.190> think<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:25.460> would<00:05:25.550> be<00:05:25.580> good<00:05:25.880> I

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909 
I just don't think it would be good I

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.029 
I just don't think it would be good I
think<00:05:26.090> it<00:05:26.360> would<00:05:26.449> be<00:05:26.509> way<00:05:26.780> too<00:05:27.039> inconsistent

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
think it would be way too inconsistent

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.790 
think it would be way too inconsistent
and<00:05:28.430> not<00:05:29.210> very<00:05:29.449> good<00:05:29.630> at<00:05:29.750> all<00:05:29.960> so<00:05:30.289> I<00:05:30.409> just<00:05:30.620> think

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
and not very good at all so I just think

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.770 
and not very good at all so I just think
the<00:05:30.919> card<00:05:31.130> is<00:05:31.340> just<00:05:31.610> like<00:05:31.940> you<00:05:32.180> know<00:05:32.300> so<00:05:32.570> good

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
the card is just like you know so good

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.110 
the card is just like you know so good
but<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:33.590> don't<00:05:33.889> think<00:05:34.070> it's<00:05:34.190> good<00:05:34.430> anymore<00:05:34.729> and

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
but I don't think it's good anymore and

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.360 
but I don't think it's good anymore and
I<00:05:35.509> don't<00:05:35.570> think<00:05:35.780> it<00:05:35.990> would<00:05:36.229> be<00:05:36.259> good<00:05:36.620> in<00:05:36.919> the

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
I don't think it would be good in the

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.800 
I don't think it would be good in the
format's<00:05:37.789> and<00:05:38.030> I<00:05:38.090> think<00:05:38.270> it<00:05:38.389> would<00:05:38.509> just<00:05:38.659> kind

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
format's and I think it would just kind

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.469 
format's and I think it would just kind
of<00:05:38.990> drift<00:05:39.380> in<00:05:39.650> to<00:05:39.860> drift<00:05:40.430> into<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:40.880> ether

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
of drift in to drift into the ether

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.810 
of drift in to drift into the ether
let's<00:05:41.960> say<00:05:42.169> kind<00:05:42.590> of<00:05:42.680> like<00:05:43.070> how<00:05:43.219> cyber<00:05:43.520> Stein

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
let's say kind of like how cyber Stein

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.270 
let's say kind of like how cyber Stein
has<00:05:44.090> I<00:05:44.360> know<00:05:44.810> cyber<00:05:45.080> Stein<00:05:45.380> has<00:05:45.620> a<00:05:45.650> field<00:05:45.979> spell

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
has I know cyber Stein has a field spell

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.339 
has I know cyber Stein has a field spell
and<00:05:46.550> DNA<00:05:46.849> surgery<00:05:47.120> thing<00:05:47.570> that<00:05:47.810> you<00:05:47.900> can<00:05:48.050> do<00:05:48.199> it

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
and DNA surgery thing that you can do it

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.010 
and DNA surgery thing that you can do it
but<00:05:48.650> that<00:05:49.280> requires<00:05:49.849> a<00:05:50.240> fair<00:05:50.719> bit<00:05:50.930> of

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
but that requires a fair bit of

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.409 
but that requires a fair bit of
searching<00:05:51.199> and<00:05:51.710> yatta<00:05:52.610> doesn't<00:05:53.000> really<00:05:53.180> have

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
searching and yatta doesn't really have

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.839 
searching and yatta doesn't really have
that<00:05:53.780> so<00:05:54.500> I<00:05:54.800> don't<00:05:54.889> know<00:05:55.099> what<00:05:55.250> you<00:05:55.370> guys<00:05:55.550> think

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849
