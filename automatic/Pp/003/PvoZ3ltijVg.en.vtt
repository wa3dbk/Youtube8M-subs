in this tutorial you will learn how to

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.500 
in this tutorial you will learn how to
create<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.190> print<00:00:02.580> design<00:00:02.850> for<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.149> t-shirt

first<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.700> all<00:00:05.759> let's<00:00:06.270> open<00:00:06.420> up<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.720> document

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
first of all let's open up a document

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.080 
first of all let's open up a document
and<00:00:07.290> configure<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.950> settings<00:00:08.160> for<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.880> size

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
and configure the settings for the size

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.610 
and configure the settings for the size
you<00:00:09.570> would<00:00:09.690> want<00:00:09.870> something<00:00:10.110> that's<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.440> bit

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
you would want something that's a bit

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.039 
you would want something that's a bit
larger<00:00:11.040> than<00:00:11.219> an<00:00:11.309> a4<00:00:11.580> paper<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.690> for<00:00:12.900> now<00:00:12.990> we

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
larger than an a4 paper so for now we

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.230 
larger than an a4 paper so for now we
will<00:00:13.320> keep<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.710> size<00:00:13.889> 12<00:00:14.309> inches<00:00:14.580> by<00:00:14.759> 14

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
will keep the size 12 inches by 14

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.680 
will keep the size 12 inches by 14

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.749 
we have used the blue and yellow color
followed<00:01:40.679> by<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:40.830> different<00:01:41.280> brush<00:01:41.490> from<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
followed by a different brush from the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.359 
followed by a different brush from the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
set applied in magenta color the idea is

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.060 
set applied in magenta color the idea is
to<00:01:44.490> give<00:01:44.640> an<00:01:44.759> artistic<00:01:45.360> splash<00:01:45.720> look<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.920> this

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
to give an artistic splash look so this

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.100 
to give an artistic splash look so this
is<00:01:47.190> what<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.429> have<00:01:47.580> so<00:01:47.789> far<00:01:48.090> next<00:01:48.929> we<00:01:49.020> will

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
is what we have so far next we will

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.899 
is what we have so far next we will
create<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.440> new<00:01:49.590> layer<00:01:49.979> above<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.340> color<00:01:50.700> layer

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
create a new layer above the color layer

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.240 
create a new layer above the color layer
and<00:01:51.179> use<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.630> urban<00:01:52.170> scroll<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> phobia

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.370 
and use the urban scroll and phobia
paint<00:01:53.580> brush<00:01:53.880> packs<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.600> add<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.050> design

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
paint brush packs to add to the design

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.560

around<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> number<00:01:56.250> therefore<00:01:56.909> we<00:01:57.299> will<00:01:57.420> use

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
around the number therefore we will use

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.569 
around the number therefore we will use
the<00:01:57.780> same<00:01:58.020> color<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.530> brush<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.280> number

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the same color for brush as the number

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.210 
the same color for brush as the number
which<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.270> case<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.720> black<00:02:01.079> now<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.009> will

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
which in this case is black now we will

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.770 
which in this case is black now we will
apply<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.520> different<00:02:02.939> brushes<00:02:03.329> around<00:02:03.450> the
