00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.800
Hi, my name is Justin Lauria, and today I'm
going to teach you how to do a

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.680
skateboard trick called a powerslide.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.080
A powerslide is a trick that involves turning
your board perpendicular to the direction

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.600
you're traveling and sliding your wheels on
the ground. This maneuver can be used to slow

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.520
yourself down when you're skating at high
speeds, but it's a trick by itself so you

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.620
can do them on their own or add them to a
line as well.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.440
One thing to note before you start doing this
trick is that your wheels need to be made

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.580
out of something hard. Soft wheels are great
for giving you extra traction and absorbing

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.810
bumbs in the road,  but they're not
going to slide along the ground very easily.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.410
Worse yet, if you do get them
to slide, you're going to file down a flat spot

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.350
on one side of each wheel.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.040
Alright, so the easiest powerslide to learn
is the frontside powerslide. It's called frontside

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.040
because you're going to be rotating your body
so that the front side of your body will be

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.420
facing the the direction you're traveling.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.980
In order to do a frontside powerslide, you
want to make sure you're riding on a smooth

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.890
surface that your wheels can slide on, and
that you're going pretty fast. If you're going

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.630
too slow, the friction between your wheels
and the concrete is going to keep you from

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.290
sliding at all, so be sure to get a few good
pushes in before you start.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.560
Once you're moving forward with a good bit
of speed, set up your feet so that your front

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.040
foot is on top of your front wheels, and your
back foot is behind your back wheels, both

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.659
perpendicular to the board.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.780
Now comes the wind up. Crouch down and turn
your arms and shoulders opposite of the way

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.020
you're going to turn when you do the slide.
When you unwind, you want your shoulders to

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.920
be facing completely forward, so that your
hips and eventually your feet can turn to

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.420
face forward too. But most importantly, you're
going to be using your legs to jump up, almost

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.439
to where your feet come off the board, so
that your weight isn't pressing the wheels

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.090
down into the concrete very much. This is
the key step that will actually allow your

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.450
board to slide more than just a few inches.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.700
Ok, so now, simultaneously uncrouch, and unwind
your arms and shoulders to face forward.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.020
As you move into this position, you want to
lean slighty backwards, and kick out your

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.720
back wheels so the board turns 90 degrees
and starts sliding.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.640
While you're sliding, you going to want to keep even
pressure on both feet, and since you're going

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.040
to be deccelerating, make sure to keep your
body weight behind the board so it doesn't

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.329
stick and send you flying forward.

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.340
When you're ready to roll away from this trick,
crouch down again and take some of the weight

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.200
off of your back foot, and your board will
naturally slide back into its normal alignment.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.720
When you first start learning frontside powerslides,
you probably won't slide very much, and sometimes

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.109
not at all, but you just need to keep practicing
them and eventually you'll be able to control

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.529
them enough to slide them as far as you want.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.180
Once you get your frontside powerslides down,
you can start working on your backside powerslides.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.219
Backside powerslides are a little tougher
since you'll be turning to face backwards

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.900
while you slide, and until you really get
used to it, you're going to have a hard time

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.230
getting the board to turn the full 90 degrees.
Even if you do manage to get it

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.290
to turn all the way, the board is going to
have a tendency to suddenly stop sliding halfway

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.689
through the
maneuver, sending you flying backward over

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:06.929
your heels.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.240
While this might seem like a good reason not
to practice this trick, I can assure you that

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:15.289
once you get it down, it feels and looks great,
and it's definitely worth going through the

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:20.849
process of learning them. If you don't feel
like you can comfortably run backwards out

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.029
of this trick at the speed you're going though,
put on a helmet before you start.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.519
Alright so on to the technique. Just like
with frontside powerslides, you need to be

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.099
on a smooth surface, and you need to have
a lot of speed. Then, you're going to slightly

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.119
wind up your shoulders to face forward and
crouch down.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.359
Remember that crouching all the way down and
springing up to take your weight off the board

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.229
is the most important part, and the hardest
part to get your body to do, so pay attention

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.219
to whether or not you're actually doing this
while you're learning.

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:53.430
As you jump up, also turn your shoulders,
hips, and eventually your feet backwards, 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.310
so that
your board turns 90 degrees and starts to slide.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.460
 During a backside powerslide, you want
to keep your head facing forward as much as

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:05.409
you can, so you can judge how you need to
balance and to see where you're going. Also,

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.459
keep your weight leaned back, away from the
direction you're sliding, and press fairly

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.079
evenly on both feet, keeping your weight on
your toes.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.560
In my opinion, it's better to lean too far
back and have the board slide out from underneath

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:23.590
you, causing you to gracefully fall down onto
your hands, rather than not lean back enough

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.740
and have your board stick, causing you to
either have to run backwards out of this trick,

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.620
or fall to your back or even possibly your
head.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.440
Now, before you slow down too much, use both of
your legs to simultaneously straighten your

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:41.610
board out as much as possible and ride away
clean. Backside powerslides are fairly difficult

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.479
to straighten out completely before you start
rolling again, so expect the whole maneuver

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.560
to steer you a little bit to one side.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.879
When you really want to start sliding these
a long ways, you can practice them by doing

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.419
the slide and riding away fakie. To get into fakie stance, you have to turn your board

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.719
at least all the way to the 90 degree point,
and doing this will help your body understand

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.699
what it feels like to be sliding backwards,
with your board sliding perpendicular to your

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.010
forward momentum.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.120
Another thing that might help you get into
the slide more easily is to do a small frontside

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.849
carve right before you uncrouch to start sliding.
Not only will this give you a little more

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.160
room to wind up your shoulders, but it can
help you stay moving in a straight line overall

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.769
even if you're unable to completely straighten
your board out after the slide.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.280
With both types of powerslides, there are
a few common problems you might run into.

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.629
First, you might not be able to get your wheels
to slide at all. It may be the case that your

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.120
wheels are too soft, or the ground is too
rough, but more often, the problem is that

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.280
you're not going fast enough, you're not leaning
back enough, or you're picking your weight

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.740
up off the board enough. Make sure to commit
to fully rotating your board 90 degrees and

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.909
lean back so your momentum will push the board
out in front of you, and remember to crouch

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:58.249
down and jump up right before you kick your
board out, so that it can slide with as little

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:01.379
friction on the wheels as possible.

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:05.279
If you're getting into the slide and then
the board sticks to the ground halfway through,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.060
you're not keeping your weight back behind
the board far enough. For frontside powerslides,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.639
incrementally increase the amount that you
lean back until you find the sweet spot. For

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.539
backside powerslides, it's better to start out
leaning too far behind the board, and incrementally

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:26.139
decrease the amount that you lean back until
you get your weight positioning dialed in.

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.599
With this approach, you'll be falling backwards
as little as possible while you're learning.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.599
