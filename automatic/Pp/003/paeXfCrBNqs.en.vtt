this warbly voice of his that is very
pleasant<00:01:25.680> as<00:01:26.040> well<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:27.060> also<00:01:27.360> maybe<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.990> little

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
pleasant as well but also maybe a little

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.980 
pleasant as well but also maybe a little
sad<00:01:28.829> now<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.310> band's<00:01:29.490> latest<00:01:29.790> LP<00:01:30.180> muchacho<00:01:30.810> is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
sad now the band's latest LP muchacho is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.039 
sad now the band's latest LP muchacho is
no<00:01:31.259> less<00:01:31.619> easygoing<00:01:32.369> than<00:01:33.060> much<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.840> anything

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
no less easygoing than much of anything

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.690 
no less easygoing than much of anything
else<00:01:34.320> they've<00:01:34.560> put<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.979> recent<00:01:35.159> years<00:01:35.549> I

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
else they've put out in recent years I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.980 
else they've put out in recent years I
would<00:01:35.820> actually<00:01:36.000> say<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.840> as

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
would actually say it's just as

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.950 
would actually say it's just as
easygoing<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.670> sort<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.939> goes<00:01:39.299> about

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
easygoing but it sort of goes about

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.319 
easygoing but it sort of goes about
capturing<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.040> vibe<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.610> different<00:01:42.119> way

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
capturing this vibe in a different way

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.620 
capturing this vibe in a different way
because<00:01:42.659> glistening<00:01:43.590> reverb<00:01:44.579> kind<00:01:45.329> of

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
because glistening reverb kind of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.780 
because glistening reverb kind of
psychedelic<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.409> pristine<00:01:46.979> production<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
psychedelic and pristine production is

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.539 
psychedelic and pristine production is
essentially<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.840> game<00:01:49.200> changer<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:49.799> muchacho

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
essentially the game changer on muchacho

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.219 
essentially the game changer on muchacho
I<00:01:50.759> wouldn't<00:01:51.090> necessarily<00:01:51.210> call<00:01:51.570> muchacho<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
I wouldn't necessarily call muchacho a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.810 
I wouldn't necessarily call muchacho a
safe<00:01:52.619> record<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.369> certainly<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
safe record but it is certainly a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.090 
safe record but it is certainly a
friendly<00:01:54.509> record<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.020> record<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.890> sure

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
friendly record a record that is sure

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.539 
friendly record a record that is sure
not<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.640> offend<00:01:57.000> much<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.799> anybody<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:59.100> quite

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
not to offend much of anybody it's quite

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.249 
not to offend much of anybody it's quite
pretty<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.880> lot<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.299> time<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> lead<00:02:00.840> vocals

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
pretty a lot of the time the lead vocals

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.469 
pretty a lot of the time the lead vocals
often<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.799> harmonies<00:02:02.310> behind<00:02:02.820> them<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
often have harmonies behind them the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.899 
often have harmonies behind them the
production<00:02:03.899> melts<00:02:04.469> them<00:02:04.680> together<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.310> soars

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
production melts them together and soars

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.760 
production melts them together and soars
them<00:02:06.149> above<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.530> instrumentation<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
them above the instrumentation and the
