00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.529
 then improvisation a well defined 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.700
 simple and straight forward is the art of you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.830
 create solos or melodies or create music 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.240
 in the hour without you have rehearsed if you 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.910
 has agreed before so eva a 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.529
 first time practice situation the first 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.359
 first contact he has the improvisation 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.279
 usually when you're playing with 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.240
 Someone is playing alone together. 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.439
 with a song playing the ringing up 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.000
 of a song 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.760
 but the fact is you 're playing with 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.950
 someone and sometimes you can create a 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.230
 solo to create a melody while the total 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.480
 in playing the base the chords you 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.309
 can create solos and melodies and you 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.680
 can create in the hour then using the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.829
 tools I will present in class is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.440
 you can create on the spot and you know 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.719
 which notes you will use good to be 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.210
 Correct, they'll be right. 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.370
 You'll get your cool, will you? 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.030
 to do with music will be in the tone not 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.250
 Nothing is out of tune without you. 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.280
 created nothing before you will ever succeed 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.310
 is to do something with the same musical 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.770
 that trying to listen from the outside will find out 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.680
 that you created what you left me 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.000
 but was actually improvised and the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.490
 people start working this with 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.710
 melodies with solos melodies plus five 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.540
 then solos of guitar and guitar more 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.000
 and then we can 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.820
 Doing this with chords is 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.979
 Also, do you know how to deal with 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.659
 update with single notes that are the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.150
 melodies then we can do 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.320
 This with chords, that 's why I 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.759
 I say it is once again a door 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.500
 entrance because you first go 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.970
 work with individual notes after the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.549
 people are working with more notes than 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.159
 It's the chords and there you, but you always. 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.290
 will get the ideas we had from the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.240
 improvise will move to the chords 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.909
 also then even you do not like 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.369
 lots of guitar solos and guitar 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.990
 you also benefit by studying this 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.210
 class because you can apply this 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.500
 chords in the bases that you play 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.049
 so here it is important to stress a 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.880
 detail is yours I told you that 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.179
 improvise we will be able to create 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.520
 melodies at improvised hour even if 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.170
 Can you do this improvised in the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.000
 hour 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.760
 also has the opportunity to suddenly become 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.520
 You have time to create to compose 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.920
 not a melody using the same 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.480
 tools that worked out there before you 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.190
 will be able to make a melody 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.530
 better still whatever 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.340
 best examples more beautiful with more 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.410
 notes - notes then it's so easy 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.530
 create time if you can think 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.660
 before you can do better things 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.340
 still because you are using the same 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.130
 tool then see that the tool is 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.230
 so simple you can create on time 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.440
 but then we can think and 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.049
 That's what we're going to say. 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.930
 tools to create and to take 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.540
 songs and these tools and 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.700
 The ways that I'm telling you that 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.950
 We 'll use it to create melodies. 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.069
 the same tools as any musician 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.170
 uses to create melodies only the chords 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.920
 anything musical at all 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.380
 So is a very good musician. 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.049
 beginner to a musician and famous 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.540
 which already has decades of music, 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.650
 experience and they will use the same 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.420
 tools 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.370
 so any conclusion of this if you 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.130
 will take a song you already know 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.470
 What tool did he use to 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.090
 creating that song will also stay 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.579
 much easier you using it 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.370
 tool you take the music is you 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.680
 take the music you decorate the music is 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.810
 Do you sometimes know her? 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.000
 intuitively already know what the guy is going 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.920
 doing before doing happens in many 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.049
 mainly in the health issue 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.750
 but guitar and the court did not 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.910
 It did not work that much, that's it. 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.290
 all because we were on the impromptu 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.480
 We are going to study the tools that 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.060
 create the songs you want to play 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.709
 know these tools are you will 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.540
 able to apply all the songs to the 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.850
 songs that you already play in songs that 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.650
 you will still play will still take the 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.790
 songs you want to create the songs you 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.950
 Do you want to improvise? 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.440
 anyway everything that relates to music is 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.239
 they relate these tools and 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.209
 these tools and this way of 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.100
 to think we 'll handle it right 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.109
 then that's why 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.659
 improvisation is very important to you 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.280
 musically think to start opening 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.680
 new horizons for you not to be 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.670
 depending only on what is written than 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.830
 is being touched 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.260
 What is to be touched can also 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.060
 exercise its exact creation 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.060
 independence in music
