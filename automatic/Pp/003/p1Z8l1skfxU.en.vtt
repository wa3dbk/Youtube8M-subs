00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.559
 the main round of the Oberliga my colleagues Florian Wackenhut and Bernd 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.559
 Halder report from the stadium to Berliner Platz 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.379
 in front of nearly 3,100 spectators 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.850
 Along the Niers sells your three words like a custom-made debut 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.520
 Jordan Webb scored a rebound for the 1-0 lead for the match 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.900
 the hosts 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.160
 seconds later, visitors could have refilled right away 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 Captain Benedikt just insists on missing goal 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.110
 even in the initial phase mostly outnumbered the people on your other hand 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.960
 with further possibilities to expand the leadership 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.720
 after nine minutes the leopards in double overpowered great shot and 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.140
 A shiny parade of goalkeeper has been complaining of fetlock 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.460
 Place would have been almost the compensation 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.980
 relax for the twelfth minute with guest-coach Reflex Leopard Goalie 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.130
 Andrej could not hold the puck down for it 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.230
 also in the consequence the sugars with numerous good possibilities one 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.050
 higher leadership would have been quite in here 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.160
 if that just does not take revenge 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.940
 Dellwig Bürgers had just before the final whistle compensation on the racket of 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.920
 ESC Vienna 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.550
 at the beginning of the second third of the ifo rivers outnumbered and equal to 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.100
 a good possibility of compensation was initially denied them 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.100
 the game exciting and with great opportunities for both teams 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.690
 28 minutes it went back and forth alone, the hits apply 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.729
 Gallen the 29 the minute while many worth watching 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.390
 even unimpressed they had the right answer just 16 seconds 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.150
 later again 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.420
 the garage is open 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.600
 in the consequence both teams always possibilities that 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.920
 Opportunity held the balance 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.860
 ten seconds before the end of the second game played then the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.490
 Leopards back to André Nauman with Switzerland two off 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.639
 last game section had it then in 45 the minute Kaufbeurens outnumbered 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.769
 but feet with a counter 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.769
 less liked a scrap dealer warts 2 to 3 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:30.289
 the 48 seconds later, the visitors struck back in over-used 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.089
 Kevin rightly the chance 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:36.779
 The now increasingly tough referee Promille had the game 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.170
 hard actions were hardly ever endangered trifles with 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.900
 Penalties prove too Matter was clearly the worst man last night 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.769
 on the ice 47 minutes of play Great chance for the "leopard" 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.299
 have probably already at 4 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.299
 but the visitors still had one or the other option 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.189
 here failed Kevin came to the world to offer defoe feet goaltender 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.679
 42 seconds before the regular end of the game, Müller was back in the snow 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:03.380
 Focus 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.380
 He sent Dornberg to the penalty box after a questionable foul 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.889
 With that, the doubles had to do less with one man 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.459
 the Kaufbeurer survived the outnumber but then had to deal with one 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.229
 Man less in the overtime thus resulted in the same situation as before 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:18.549
 a week in Fussen 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.889
 the leopards took advantage of the overtime in overtime and won the game thanks 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.789
 the decisive goal of Ricky Helmbrecht 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:26.529
 14 3 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:30.869
 a good game with a lot of struggle and tension the only downer of the game 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:33.659
 Referee and the lack of opportunity utilization of Jucker 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.009
 especially in the first third of the delivery deadline he certainly be 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.499
 celebrates with its fans the fourth Derby victory this season 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.299
