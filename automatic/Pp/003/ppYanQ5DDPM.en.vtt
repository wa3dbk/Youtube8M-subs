hi I'm Julie Ellison gear editor of
climbing<00:00:02.220> magazine<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:02.970> I'm<00:00:03.179> going<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.419> show

climbing magazine and I'm going to show

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.300 
climbing magazine and I'm going to show
you<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.929> guide<00:00:04.110> tip<00:00:04.440> for<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.710> issue<00:00:04.950> which

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
you the guide tip for this issue which

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.400 
you the guide tip for this issue which
is<00:00:05.430> how<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.580> make<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.850> backpack<00:00:06.180> coil<00:00:06.690> when

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
is how to make a backpack coil when

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.780 
is how to make a backpack coil when
you're<00:00:07.529> coiling<00:00:07.919> from<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.250> middle<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.639> the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
you're coiling from the middle of the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.120 
you're coiling from the middle of the
rope<00:00:08.970> so<00:00:09.690> if<00:00:09.870> your<00:00:10.019> rope<00:00:10.200> has<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.530> middle<00:00:10.889> mark

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
rope so if your rope has a middle mark

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.830 
rope so if your rope has a middle mark
you<00:00:11.490> can<00:00:11.639> obviously<00:00:11.910> just<00:00:12.120> start<00:00:12.630> right<00:00:12.809> there

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
you can obviously just start right there

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.379 
you can obviously just start right there
if<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.769> doesn't<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.639> find<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.210> middle

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
if it doesn't you can find the middle

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.750 
if it doesn't you can find the middle
pretty<00:00:15.690> easily<00:00:15.929> by<00:00:16.500> starting<00:00:16.920> with<00:00:17.039> two<00:00:17.279> ends

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
pretty easily by starting with two ends

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.109 
pretty easily by starting with two ends
and<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.470> coiling<00:00:19.470> or<00:00:19.859> flaking<00:00:20.580> as<00:00:20.939> you

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and just coiling or flaking as you

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.820 
and just coiling or flaking as you
normally<00:00:21.300> would<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.990> then<00:00:22.080> eventually

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
normally would and then eventually

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.460 
normally would and then eventually
you'll<00:00:23.279> come<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.789> middle<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:25.170> since<00:00:25.380> I

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
you'll come to the middle so since I

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.810 
you'll come to the middle so since I
have<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> middle<00:00:25.830> mark<00:00:26.099> I'm<00:00:26.310> going<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.550> start

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
have a middle mark I'm going to start

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.410 
have a middle mark I'm going to start
there<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.510> one<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.380> benefits<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.859> this

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
there and one of the benefits of this

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.880 
there and one of the benefits of this
coiling<00:00:30.420> technique<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.439> when<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> start

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
coiling technique is that when you start

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.340 
coiling technique is that when you start
from<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> middle<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:33.450> flake<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.079> way

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
from the middle and you flake this way

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.580 
from the middle and you flake this way
you<00:00:34.860> actually<00:00:35.309> move<00:00:35.550> kinks<00:00:36.149> out<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:37.380> rope

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you actually move kinks out of the rope

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.319 
you actually move kinks out of the rope
instead<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.280> into<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> middle<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> rope

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
instead of into the middle of the rope

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.880 
instead of into the middle of the rope
so<00:00:40.079> what<00:00:40.200> we're<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.440> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.770> we're

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
so what we're going to want to do we're

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.020 
so what we're going to want to do we're
going<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.040> start<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.670> our<00:00:41.790> first

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
going to start with this is our first

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.990 
going to start with this is our first
coil<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.710> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.860> coil<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.309> your<00:00:44.460> hand<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
coil and you can coil in your hand you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.850 
coil and you can coil in your hand you
can<00:00:45.030> coil<00:00:45.270> over<00:00:45.600> your<00:00:45.719> neck<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> coil

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
can coil over your neck I like to coil

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.410 
can coil over your neck I like to coil
over<00:00:47.070> my<00:00:47.219> neck<00:00:47.280> because<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:47.940> small<00:00:48.180> hands

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
over my neck because I have small hands

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.850 
over my neck because I have small hands
so<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.719> hard<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:48.960> me<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.170> hold<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> rope<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
so it's hard for me to hold the rope a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.119 
so it's hard for me to hold the rope a
tip<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:50.910> girls<00:00:51.210> -<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.899> your<00:00:51.989> hair<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.530> know<00:00:52.920> my

tip for girls - for your hair I know my

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.779 
tip for girls - for your hair I know my
hair<00:00:53.340> sometimes<00:00:53.730> gets<00:00:53.940> caught<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.989> try<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
hair sometimes gets caught so I try and

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.970 
hair sometimes gets caught so I try and
put<00:00:56.789> my<00:00:56.910> foot<00:00:57.180> up<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.570> helmet<00:00:58.440> works<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.800> same

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
put my foot up a helmet works the same

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.000 
put my foot up a helmet works the same
way<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.989> I'm<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.199> go<00:01:01.260> ahead<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.680> coil

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
way so I'm going to go ahead and coil

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.770 
way so I'm going to go ahead and coil
you<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:02.789> your<00:01:02.879> coils<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.300> got<00:01:03.390> two<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you want your coils to be got two and a

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.780 
you want your coils to be got two and a
half<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.199> three<00:01:04.229> feet<00:01:04.739> I'm<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.010> little<00:01:05.309> shorter

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
half to three feet I'm a little shorter

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.880 
half to three feet I'm a little shorter
so<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> keep<00:01:06.689> short<00:01:07.049> coils<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.710> way

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
so I like to keep short coils that way

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.980 
so I like to keep short coils that way
when<00:01:08.130> I'm<00:01:08.250> sliding<00:01:08.520> down<00:01:08.939> I'm<00:01:09.240> not<00:01:09.390> dragging

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
when I'm sliding down I'm not dragging

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.719 
when I'm sliding down I'm not dragging
big<00:01:10.200> coils<00:01:10.560> behind<00:01:10.890> me<00:01:11.040> or<00:01:11.430> getting<00:01:11.580> them

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
big coils behind me or getting them

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.210 
big coils behind me or getting them
stuck<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.150> trees<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.229> what<00:01:13.380> you'll<00:01:13.530> also<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:14.070> is

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
stuck on trees so what you'll also do is

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.370 
stuck on trees so what you'll also do is
you'll<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.640> develop<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.360> spot<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.259> your

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
you'll kind of develop a spot on your

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.230 
you'll kind of develop a spot on your
body<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.100> coil<00:01:17.310> -<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:17.880> me<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
body that you can coil - for me it's a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.660 
body that you can coil - for me it's a
little<00:01:18.360> bit<00:01:18.479> below<00:01:18.659> my<00:01:18.930> hip<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.340> I'm<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
little bit below my hip so I'm going to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210 
little bit below my hip so I'm going to
start<00:01:20.850> coiling<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.710> they<00:01:22.710> don't<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> be

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
start coiling and they don't have to be

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.880 
start coiling and they don't have to be
perfectly<00:01:23.640> even<00:01:24.470> but<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:25.770> them

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
perfectly even but you want them

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.170 
perfectly even but you want them
somewhat<00:01:26.310> even

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.690 

and<00:01:31.630> obviously<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.320> longer<00:01:32.680> your<00:01:32.860> rope<00:01:33.100> the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
and obviously the longer your rope the

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:58.280 
and obviously the longer your rope the
more<00:01:33.910> coils<00:01:34.180> you'll<00:01:34.540> have

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.200 

as<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.190> see<00:01:59.370> I'm<00:01:59.520> getting<00:01:59.820> kind<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.120> to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
as you can see I'm getting kind of to

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.210 
as you can see I'm getting kind of to
the<00:02:00.300> end<00:02:00.480> of<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:00.780> rope<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.800> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.040> see

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
the end of the rope and so you can see

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.300 
the end of the rope and so you can see
these<00:02:02.340> kinks<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.910> as<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.390> flake<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.870> out<00:02:04.310> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
these kinks in it as I flake it out the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.690 
these kinks in it as I flake it out the
kinks<00:02:05.610> will<00:02:05.820> move<00:02:05.970> out<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.420> rope<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> I've

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
kinks will move out of the rope so I've

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.950 
kinks will move out of the rope so I've
gotten<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.149> point<00:02:09.180> where<00:02:09.570> I<00:02:09.600> have<00:02:09.780> about

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
gotten to the point where I have about

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.410 
gotten to the point where I have about
15<00:02:10.560> feet<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.950> rope<00:02:11.130> left<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.970> that's<00:02:12.180> when<00:02:12.390> I

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
15 feet of rope left so that's when I

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.570 
15 feet of rope left so that's when I
want<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> start<00:02:12.870> doing<00:02:13.080> my<00:02:13.320> wraps<00:02:13.560> I'm<00:02:14.370> going

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
want to start doing my wraps I'm going

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.340 
want to start doing my wraps I'm going
to<00:02:14.640> take<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.030> rope<00:02:15.210> off<00:02:15.420> my<00:02:15.660> shoulders

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
to take the rope off my shoulders

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.370 
to take the rope off my shoulders
very<00:02:17.190> carefully<00:02:17.790> kind<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.870> go<00:02:18.990> in<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.200> middle

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
very carefully kind of go in the middle

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.400 
very carefully kind of go in the middle
and<00:02:21.050> then<00:02:22.310> want<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.400> even<00:02:23.670> them<00:02:23.760> up<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:25.290> they're

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
and then want to even them up so they're

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.860 
and then want to even them up so they're
going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> hang<00:02:25.860> evenly<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.670> then<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.690> want

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
going to hang evenly and then you want

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.780 
going to hang evenly and then you want
to<00:02:27.960> start<00:02:28.200> wrapping<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.950> you're<00:02:29.610> going<00:02:29.730> to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
to start wrapping and you're going to

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.970 
to start wrapping and you're going to
want<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.030> start<00:02:30.330> from<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.720> bottom<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.320> work

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
want to start from the bottom and work

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.020 
want to start from the bottom and work
your<00:02:32.010> way<00:02:32.310> up<00:02:34.100> so<00:02:35.100> going<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.280> get<00:02:35.400> one<00:02:35.580> wrap<00:02:35.820> in

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
your way up so going to get one wrap in

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.620 
your way up so going to get one wrap in
there<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.480> then<00:02:36.780> I'm<00:02:36.900> going<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.110> move<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.410> down

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:03:14.750 

and<00:02:42.630> again<00:02:42.840> try<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.230> keep<00:02:43.320> them<00:02:43.470> pretty<00:02:43.620> even

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.520 

so<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.819> want<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.120> do<00:03:16.240> about<00:03:16.480> 10<00:03:16.840> or<00:03:16.990> 12<00:03:17.020> wraps

so you want to do about 10 or 12 wraps

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.120 
so you want to do about 10 or 12 wraps
and<00:03:18.100> then<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.150> have<00:03:19.330> about<00:03:19.950> seven<00:03:20.950> or<00:03:21.040> eight

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
and then and I have about seven or eight

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.380 
and then and I have about seven or eight
feet<00:03:21.459> left<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.980> next<00:03:24.220> move<00:03:24.459> I'm<00:03:25.060> going<00:03:25.300> to

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
feet left so the next move I'm going to

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.360 
feet left so the next move I'm going to
take<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.990> strands<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.709> run<00:03:27.190> them<00:03:27.340> through

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
take the strands and run them through

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.580

going<00:03:34.240> to<00:03:34.300> take<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.600> strands<00:03:34.900> again<00:03:35.400> I'm

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
going to take the strands again I'm

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.770 
going to take the strands again I'm
going<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:36.850> run<00:03:36.970> them<00:03:37.090> through<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.600> bite

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.790

coil against my back I'm going to lift

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.320 
coil against my back I'm going to lift
it<00:03:53.200> really<00:03:53.560> high<00:03:53.769> I<00:03:54.190> got<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.760> wrong<00:03:54.880> coils

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
down a little bit I'm going to lean

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.479 
down a little bit I'm going to lean
forward<00:04:06.480> back<00:04:07.860> across<00:04:08.860> the<00:04:09.130> rope<00:04:09.600> like<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:11.489> and

sliding down rocks to get down they

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.630
