all right now I have a needle in the
opposition<00:03:24.430> there's<00:03:25.239> going<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.510> needle

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
opposition there's going to needle

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.670 
opposition there's going to needle
currently<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.379> the<00:03:26.469> machine<00:03:27.599> up<00:03:28.599> and<00:03:28.989> down<00:03:29.230> so

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
currently in the machine up and down so

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.670 
currently in the machine up and down so
is<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.980> fiber<00:03:30.430> holder<00:03:30.750> last<00:03:31.750> patent<00:03:32.469> date<00:03:32.650> on

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
is the fiber holder last patent date on

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.720 
is the fiber holder last patent date on
this<00:03:32.950> machine<00:03:33.159> is<00:03:33.519> 1910<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.099> belt<00:03:36.370> comes

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
this machine is 1910 so the belt comes

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.940 
this machine is 1910 so the belt comes
off<00:03:37.030> simply<00:03:37.450> by<00:03:37.719> moving<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:39.489> piece<00:03:40.650> then<00:03:41.650> the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
off simply by moving this piece then the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.089 
off simply by moving this piece then the
