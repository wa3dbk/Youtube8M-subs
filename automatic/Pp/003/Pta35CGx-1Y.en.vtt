I<00:00:15.379> heard<00:00:16.379> about<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.740> gravity<00:00:17.190> training

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
I heard about the gravity training

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.880 
I heard about the gravity training

about<00:00:24.600> gravity<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.470> you're<00:00:25.890> not<00:00:26.099> using

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
about gravity is that you're not using

schedule<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.390> unpredictable<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.710> I'm<00:01:28.979> taking

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
schedule is unpredictable and I'm taking

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.760 
schedule is unpredictable and I'm taking
different<00:01:29.670> classes<00:01:30.390> different<00:01:30.960> hours<00:01:31.380> and

different classes different hours and
sees<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> group<00:01:32.369> exercise<00:01:32.640> offer<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:34.020> many

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
sees a group exercise offer so many

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.039 
sees a group exercise offer so many
gravity<00:01:34.820> classes<00:01:35.820> I'd<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.180> able<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.750> take

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
gravity classes I'd be able to take

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.080 
gravity classes I'd be able to take
sometimes<00:01:37.650> at<00:01:37.860> lunch<00:01:38.100> sometimes<00:01:38.640> during<00:01:38.970> the

the<00:02:00.390> gravity<00:02:00.750> sessions<00:02:01.400> encouraged<00:02:02.400> me<00:02:02.580> to

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
the gravity sessions encouraged me to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.080 
the gravity sessions encouraged me to
introduce<00:02:03.780> myself<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.320> more<00:02:04.820> people<00:02:05.820> here<00:02:06.000> on

gravity play X on the roll with my

gravity play X on the roll with my
social<00:02:26.490> connection<00:02:27.210> because<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.660> find

social connection because I find

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.130 
social connection because I find
probably<00:02:28.950> 15<00:02:29.910> friends<00:02:30.240> who<00:02:30.690> I'm<00:02:30.810> really

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
probably 15 friends who I'm really

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
connected and we're actually becoming

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.090 
connected and we're actually becoming
best<00:02:33.990> friends<00:02:34.140> I've<00:02:34.650> been<00:02:34.770> doing<00:02:34.980> their

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
best friends I've been doing their

best friends I've been doing their
gravity<00:02:35.370> sessions<00:02:35.790> for<00:02:36.030> on<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.080> off<00:02:37.140> for

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
gravity sessions for on and off for

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.410 
gravity sessions for on and off for
about<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.560> year<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.460> always<00:02:38.700> notice<00:02:39.150> a

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
about a year and I always notice a

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.930 
about a year and I always notice a
change<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.650> muscle<00:02:40.800> definition<00:02:41.070> outside<00:02:41.850> of

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
change in muscle definition outside of

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.300 
change in muscle definition outside of
class<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.390> really<00:02:42.750> enjoy<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.320> go<00:02:43.440> running<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.160> I

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
class I really enjoy to go running and I

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.730 
class I really enjoy to go running and I
think<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.760> gravity<00:02:45.060> sessions<00:02:45.480> helps<00:02:45.840> me<00:02:46.050> with

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
think the gravity sessions helps me with

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.300 
think the gravity sessions helps me with
my<00:02:46.770> my<00:02:47.520> running<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:48.030> feel<00:02:48.600> strong<00:02:49.110> all<00:02:49.500> over<00:02:50.040> I

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
my my running I feel strong all over I

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.240 
my my running I feel strong all over I
feel<00:02:50.850> like<00:02:51.120> gravity<00:02:51.930> really<00:02:52.290> requires<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.100> lot

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
feel like gravity really requires a lot

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.070 
feel like gravity really requires a lot
of<00:02:53.430> core<00:02:53.790> strength<00:02:54.060> even<00:02:54.420> when<00:02:54.690> you're<00:02:54.840> doing

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
of core strength even when you're doing

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.660 
of core strength even when you're doing
other<00:02:55.200> exercises<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.070> would<00:02:56.220> recommend<00:02:56.610> this

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
other exercises I would recommend this

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.520 
other exercises I would recommend this
program<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.210> my<00:02:57.360> friends<00:02:57.780> because<00:02:58.110> it's<00:02:58.290> fun

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
program to my friends because it's fun

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.790 
program to my friends because it's fun
and<00:02:58.970> it's<00:02:59.970> great<00:03:00.360> strength<00:03:00.720> training<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.320> you

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
and it's great strength training and you

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.160 
and it's great strength training and you
feel<00:03:02.010> great
