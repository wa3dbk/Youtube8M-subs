00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.129
 but 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.990
 so supply 6 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.619
 literally through a lawyer 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:11.150
 I was able to install 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.529
 wheelbarrow reaping 4 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.640
 byron naturally 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.659
 Generally actually installing a sensor 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.699
 Well done 2500 I donâ€™t remember how exactly he is 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.939
 years at sea network 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.109
 pipets I tried everything there when 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.509
 I learned that the bola modem 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.180
 normal car fun 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.820
 with him good detonator 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.150
 in two megabytes to four channels well yes 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.990
 three 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.210
 sometimes four or even drink and that 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.780
 was really 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.430
 much needed to private owners half an hour 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.360
 hour 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.360
 cost dearly in general here and so 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.650
 at the same time, what about the river? 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.130
 point even bring boom bike which 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.100
 looked very cool 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.480
 trucks every general me shorter there 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.929
 mesh replaced 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.250
 some suffered just because what 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.830
 that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.590
 first thumbnail 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.890
 but then when I found out that these pains are cool 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.000
 there will be a leader and then summer glasses i 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.130
 asked 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.910
 the new one standing there was stitched like this for 70 each 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.290
 chtoli polygons 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.070
 and here to wait 4 looked and found 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.550
 there 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.390
 one example 600 thousand polygons 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.040
 know everything how it slows down 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.130
 but no then i don't know before 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.829
 as it was such a time for almost all 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.829
 cars of china how many polygons 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.620
 had to stop the patch 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.660
 1 0 4 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.710
 no 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.400
 format but generally not at all 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.350
 diminished 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.159
 exactly the same brake everything left 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.049
 flight 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.990
 although it will help about this 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.450
 patches newspaper 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.700
 near 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700
 they should decrease 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.670
 since horse racing became something 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.450
 incomprehensible kim model heavily mined 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.120
 water that we had to reach and 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.430
 water meter 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.549
 first time try life for 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.109
 waiting tried 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.439
 pancakes are beautiful of course bastard 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.549
 From study pralno convocation floor clearly 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.549
 default cars understandably 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.969
 Chao try to call something else 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:30.819
 I did not immediately understand that two times a day to press 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.189
 so that the phone goes out first on 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.229
 the planning meeting leaves and it is impossible to export 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.489
 dublin how to put music into action 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.950
 Convenience with them money is written and in the second 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.950
 once aspen reap then all together 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.469
 steam percentage there percentage 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.469
 gone a 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.490
 and my match 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.459
 my matches 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.129
 all movies in my 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.439
 odd actually models for wait 4 not 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.709
 very much at one time any network 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.559
 100 more help was still looked 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.999
 on a pair of top three sites 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.889
 who had not many in the general model in fact 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.889
 business 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.409
 but of course with the whole class and the classroom 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.409
 there are points 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:28.909
 but nonetheless 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.909
 In general, I want fun that the courts can 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.809
 buy a model comes new 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:35.529
 network than I here really liked 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:38.409
 the fact that the game itself turned out as if 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.719
 the graph is dumb and the mega sensor graph 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:43.679
 Segedsky just super 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:45.569
 for the time she just damn 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.609
 unsurpassed because this model 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.099
 these things Lenin 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.309
 how they wanted what kind of detail 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:53.129
 they made it special on it 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.379
 there was no limit so there behera 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.269
 polygons it is mega super looked 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.209
 but the texture of these was not particularly but all 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.219
 just looked gorgeous 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.739
 and at the same time the world looked like Paul both 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.999
 brushes like 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:09.259
 and let him with such a dissonance 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.499
 too sharp 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:13.209
 so then when I started playing san 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.539
 Andreas, I immediately said that I did not 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:17.060
 I will set the beat 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.999
 this is to default 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.150
 as if 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.900
 the game had its 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.260
 primeval let's say so great 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.790
 Alushta cars that are there like 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.510
 all leaders fit on 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.930
 China's scale is not good enough 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.500
 detailed but they sort of invest 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.479
 style of play 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.089
 here to discuss 4 is even better to become kachkina 

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:39.039
 anyway rather clumsy as i already 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.969
 Spoke matches 26 thousand all the same better 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.389
 default 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.400
 it helps here that most points 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.090
 suitcases square conrad of course hard 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.189
 to draw 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:55.199
 and it kind of saves in general 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.170
 However 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.210
 radd so basically 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.160
 especially those that are on the roof and cars 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.279
 it is clear that they are 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.379
 misha is good avt SUVs like 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:08.819
 generally pipets here this SUV ruble 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.819
 clumsy to conscience so on 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.090
 plus although I knew I was buying up 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.400
 even if so may batch 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400
 but he just sort of 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.069
 Well, as usual clumsy tseysky like that all 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:26.469
 done 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:29.469
 all cars have their own prototypes 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.589
 conquered we made to fail there 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:36.589
 so not to pay 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:41.959
 There is also a Lamborghini campaign for the villageâ€™s husband 

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:45.419
 and a lot of things can be seen here so much 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.689
 But this of course all enough karyala 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:49.639
 but when such sensors contributed 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.749
 that already 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:53.030
 more harmoniously will bring such here 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.419
 yes man 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.619
 cool let's say so 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:58.789
 read the edge there is room for improvement 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.789
 but still very decent 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:07.089
 blocking is very thought 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:08.990
 with 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.310
 part
