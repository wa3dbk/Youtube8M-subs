and then we just started working on them
and<00:00:25.470> trying<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.980> why<00:00:26.279> don't<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.490> try<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.670> e

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
and trying it why don't you try to e

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.759 
and trying it why don't you try to e
minor<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.359> instead<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.779> scene<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.650> know

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
minor here instead of the scene you know

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.130 
minor here instead of the scene you know
maybe<00:00:28.920> try<00:00:29.340> doing<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.119> three<00:00:30.900> four

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
maybe try doing it and three four

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:47.299 
maybe try doing it and three four
instead<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.590> four<00:00:31.830> forward<00:00:38.960> I<00:00:44.750> think<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.309> think

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
instead of four forward I think I think

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.840 
instead of four forward I think I think
that's<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.700> strong<00:00:49.190> we<00:00:50.190> realized<00:00:50.610> there<00:00:50.820> are
