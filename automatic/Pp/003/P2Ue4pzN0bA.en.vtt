feeling<00:01:17.670> driving<00:01:18.150> his<00:01:18.270> action<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.869> that's

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
feeling driving his action and that's

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.870 
feeling driving his action and that's
the<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:19.799> tough<00:01:19.950> thing<00:01:20.159> about<00:01:20.220> animation

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the really tough thing about animation

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.700 
the really tough thing about animation
because<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.540> most<00:01:21.630> live-action<00:01:22.080> performers

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
because for most live-action performers

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.350 
because for most live-action performers
the<00:01:22.860> goal<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.549> put<00:01:23.850> yourself<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
the goal is to put yourself in the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.390 
the goal is to put yourself in the
moment<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.439> react<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> things<00:01:26.280> that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
moment and just react to the things that

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.980 
moment and just react to the things that
are<00:01:26.490> happening<00:01:26.580> around<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.330> whereas<00:01:27.960> if

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
are happening around you whereas if

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.899 
are happening around you whereas if
animation<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> think<00:01:29.369> about<00:01:29.579> all

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
animation you have to think about all

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.370 
animation you have to think about all
those<00:01:30.210> little<00:01:30.479> thoughts<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.079> are<00:01:31.170> going

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
those little thoughts that are going

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.109 
those little thoughts that are going
through<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> character's<00:01:32.040> head<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.520> find<00:01:32.759> some

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
through a character's head and find some

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.300 
through a character's head and find some
way<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.570> them<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.840> screen<00:01:34.020> now<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:35.159> how

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
way to get them on screen now as for how

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.859 
way to get them on screen now as for how
you<00:01:35.369> actually<00:01:35.670> show<00:01:36.060> those<00:01:36.329> beasts<00:01:36.659> it's

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
you actually show those beasts it's

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.330 
you actually show those beasts it's
going<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.259> different<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.740> every<00:01:37.920> shot

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
going to be different in every shot

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.880 
going to be different in every shot
depending<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.000> context<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.780> instance<00:01:40.740> if

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890

react<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.920> face<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.729> body

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
react then the face and then the body

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.330 
react then the face and then the body
this<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.049> also<00:01:55.320> good<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.920> habit<00:01:56.130> of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
this is also good to get in the habit of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.520 
this is also good to get in the habit of
because<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.119> character<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.750> doing<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.229> big

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
because if a character is doing a big

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.980 
because if a character is doing a big
dramatic<00:01:58.860> move<00:01:59.460> the<00:02:00.180> audience<00:02:00.540> will<00:02:00.719> be<00:02:00.869> able

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
dramatic move the audience will be able

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.620 
dramatic move the audience will be able
to<00:02:01.110> see<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.560> face<00:02:01.799> change<00:02:02.700> unless<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.420> body

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
to see the face change unless the body

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.230 
to see the face change unless the body
is<00:02:03.840> fairly<00:02:04.079> still<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.100> move<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> face<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.090> a

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
is fairly still so move the face just a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.670 
is fairly still so move the face just a
couple<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.689> frames<00:02:06.930> earlier<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
couple of frames earlier and the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.080 
couple of frames earlier and the
audience<00:02:08.009> will<00:02:08.129> be<00:02:08.220> able<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.520> register<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
audience will be able to register the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.240 
audience will be able to register the
emotion<00:02:09.539> without<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.349> getting<00:02:10.470> lost<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:11.129> that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
emotion without it getting lost in that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.900 
emotion without it getting lost in that
big<00:02:11.520> physical<00:02:11.849> move

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
big physical move

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.490 
big physical move
the<00:02:13.060> timing<00:02:13.450> can<00:02:13.600> also<00:02:13.750> be<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.050> big<00:02:14.290> factor

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
the timing can also be a big factor

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.530 
the timing can also be a big factor
notice<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.310> these<00:02:15.430> examples<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.270> longer

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
notice in these examples that the longer

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.350 
notice in these examples that the longer
the<00:02:16.810> anticipation<00:02:17.410> is<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.490> more<00:02:18.760> deliberate

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
the anticipation is the more deliberate

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.780 
the anticipation is the more deliberate
the<00:02:19.510> jump<00:02:19.750> feels<00:02:20.080> but<00:02:20.710> when<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.040> anticipation

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
the jump feels but when the anticipation

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.490 
the jump feels but when the anticipation
is<00:02:21.910> short<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.540> feels<00:02:22.870> like<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.170> ball<00:02:23.320> is

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
is short it feels like the ball is

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.410 
is short it feels like the ball is
surprised<00:02:23.950> like<00:02:24.310> he's<00:02:24.520> just<00:02:24.700> reacting<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.390> a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
surprised like he's just reacting to a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.360 
surprised like he's just reacting to a
loud<00:02:25.630> noise<00:02:25.840> or<00:02:26.110> something<00:02:26.440> everything<00:02:27.190> else

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
loud noise or something everything else

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.980 
loud noise or something everything else
is<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.580> same<00:02:27.610> it's<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.450> amount<00:02:28.600> of<00:02:28.720> time

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
is the same it's just the amount of time

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.720 
is the same it's just the amount of time
we're<00:02:29.260> giving<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.770> anticipation<00:02:30.370> move

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
we're giving to that anticipation move

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.180 
we're giving to that anticipation move
one<00:02:31.630> last<00:02:31.900> cool<00:02:32.110> thing<00:02:32.350> is<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.770> amount

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
one last cool thing is that the amount

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.280 
one last cool thing is that the amount
of<00:02:33.340> anticipation<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.420> use<00:02:34.690> can<00:02:34.960> really

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
of anticipation that you use can really

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.260 
of anticipation that you use can really
help<00:02:35.410> convey<00:02:35.860> how<00:02:36.190> much<00:02:36.400> effort<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.910> character

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
help convey how much effort a character

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.120 
help convey how much effort a character
is<00:02:37.360> putting<00:02:37.510> into<00:02:37.750> something<00:02:38.260> for<00:02:38.920> instance

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
is putting into something for instance

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.830 
is putting into something for instance
if<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.430> had<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.580> fat<00:02:39.880> character<00:02:40.420> trying<00:02:40.720> to

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
if you had a fat character trying to

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.170 
if you had a fat character trying to
jump<00:02:41.080> over<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.350> fence<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:42.310> might<00:02:42.520> have<00:02:42.760> him<00:02:42.940> go

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
jump over a fence you might have him go

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.680 
jump over a fence you might have him go
way<00:02:43.750> down<00:02:44.050> but<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.530> jump<00:02:44.740> won't<00:02:44.980> go<00:02:45.130> as<00:02:45.280> high

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
way down but the jump won't go as high

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.760 
way down but the jump won't go as high
the<00:02:46.690> flip<00:02:46.900> side<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.440> can<00:02:47.590> make<00:02:47.740> a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
the flip side is that you can make a

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.830 
the flip side is that you can make a
character<00:02:48.130> feel<00:02:48.490> really<00:02:48.880> strong<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.300> nimble

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
character feel really strong and nimble

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.440 
character feel really strong and nimble
by<00:02:50.080> using<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.620> very<00:02:51.010> slight<00:02:51.370> anticipation<00:02:52.090> with

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
by using a very slight anticipation with

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.870 
by using a very slight anticipation with
a<00:02:52.480> big<00:02:52.870> resulting<00:02:53.440> action<00:02:53.860> see<00:02:54.460> how<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.670> one

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
a big resulting action see how the one

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.970 
a big resulting action see how the one
on<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.030> right<00:02:55.090> feels<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.840> fit<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.260> energetic

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
on the right feels so fit and energetic

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.380 
on the right feels so fit and energetic
but<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.400> one<00:02:57.550> on<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.700> left<00:02:57.910> feels<00:02:58.120> like<00:02:58.270> he's

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
but the one on the left feels like he's

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.030 
but the one on the left feels like he's
working<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.750> lot<00:02:58.900> harder<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.410> jump<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.800> same

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
working a lot harder to jump the same

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.910 
working a lot harder to jump the same
