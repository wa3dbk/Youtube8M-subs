sometimes if i'm dealing with amna

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.880 
sometimes if i'm dealing with amna
galore<00:01:24.810> i'm<00:01:24.930> playing<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.380> bunch<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.650> noobs

galore i'm playing with a bunch of noobs

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.320 
galore i'm playing with a bunch of noobs
or<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> feel<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.060> people<00:01:27.150> are

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
or I feel like a lot of people are

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.210 
or I feel like a lot of people are
getting<00:01:27.479> killed<00:01:27.600> by<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> Wizards<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.560> will<00:01:29.040> use

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
getting killed by the Wizards I will use

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.550 
getting killed by the Wizards I will use
the<00:01:29.369> suppressor<00:01:29.759> grenade<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:31.380> is

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the suppressor grenade and that is

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.160 
the suppressor grenade and that is
because<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.340> stops<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.180> Wizards<00:01:33.600> from<00:01:33.840> using

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
because it stops the Wizards from using

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.510 
because it stops the Wizards from using
their<00:01:34.290> abilities<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.829> can't<00:01:35.070> shoot<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:35.400> you

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
their abilities they can't shoot at you

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.640 
their abilities they can't shoot at you
for<00:01:35.759> literally<00:01:35.970> 30<00:01:36.299> seconds<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> really

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
for literally 30 seconds it's a really

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.810
