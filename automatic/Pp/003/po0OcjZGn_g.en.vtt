is<00:05:09.070> is<00:05:10.070> a<00:05:10.130> slight<00:05:10.640> crack<00:05:11.150> in<00:05:11.510> the<00:05:11.990> clip<00:05:12.230> on<00:05:12.410> I

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
is is a slight crack in the clip on I

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.520 
is is a slight crack in the clip on I
need<00:05:13.250> to<00:05:13.340> get<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.610> boy<00:05:13.790> replaced<00:05:14.300> because

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
need to get that boy replaced because

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.020 
need to get that boy replaced because
it's<00:05:15.530> not<00:05:15.680> exactly<00:05:16.100> a<00:05:16.190> hundred<00:05:16.550> percent<00:05:16.610> tight

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
it's not exactly a hundred percent tight

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.280 
it's not exactly a hundred percent tight
on<00:05:17.210> there<00:05:17.419> it<00:05:17.540> gives<00:05:17.690> a<00:05:17.810> little<00:05:17.930> wiggle<00:05:18.169> room

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
on there it gives a little wiggle room

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.210 
on there it gives a little wiggle room
if<00:05:18.470> we<00:05:18.500> put<00:05:18.710> it<00:05:18.770> under<00:05:18.950> some<00:05:19.100> stress<00:05:20.980> bar<00:05:21.980> end

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
if we put it under some stress bar end

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.590 
if we put it under some stress bar end
mirrors<00:05:22.310> I<00:05:22.730> like<00:05:22.910> that<00:05:23.060> when<00:05:23.210> it<00:05:23.300> only<00:05:23.419> came

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
mirrors I like that when it only came

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.470 
mirrors I like that when it only came
with<00:05:23.750> one<00:05:24.820> would<00:05:25.820> like<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.030> put<00:05:26.150> another<00:05:26.330> one

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
with one would like to put another one

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.990 
with one would like to put another one
on<00:05:26.540> here<00:05:27.050> I<00:05:27.230> need<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.250> change<00:05:28.460> this<00:05:28.580> grip<00:05:28.820> out

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
on here I need to change this grip out

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.370 
on here I need to change this grip out
though<00:05:29.120> I<00:05:29.150> do<00:05:29.300> kind<00:05:29.660> of<00:05:29.720> like<00:05:29.870> this<00:05:30.080> grip

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
though I do kind of like this grip

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.740 
though I do kind of like this grip
honestly<00:05:30.860> because<00:05:31.010> it<00:05:31.250> allows<00:05:32.240> you<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.480> get<00:05:32.720> a

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
honestly because it allows you to get a

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.790 
honestly because it allows you to get a
little<00:05:32.840> bit<00:05:33.020> more<00:05:33.140> control<00:05:33.410> over<00:05:33.500> the

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
little bit more control over the

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.950 
little bit more control over the
throttle<00:05:34.340> never<00:05:35.030> actually<00:05:35.270> seen<00:05:35.660> one<00:05:35.690> like

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
throttle never actually seen one like

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.080 
throttle never actually seen one like
that

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.310 

and<00:05:39.720> I<00:05:40.260> think<00:05:40.710> that<00:05:40.800> pretty<00:05:40.980> much<00:05:41.100> covers<00:05:41.370> it

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
and I think that pretty much covers it

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.870 
and I think that pretty much covers it
so<00:05:43.320> maybe<00:05:43.620> get<00:05:43.770> a<00:05:43.830> fork<00:05:44.130> brace<00:05:44.280> for<00:05:44.610> up<00:05:44.699> front

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
so maybe get a fork brace for up front

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.930 
so maybe get a fork brace for up front
since<00:05:45.180> he<00:05:45.300> removed<00:05:45.570> the<00:05:45.660> front<00:05:45.900> fender

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
since he removed the front fender

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.280 
since he removed the front fender
honestly<00:05:47.940> I'm<00:05:48.180> not<00:05:48.210> sure<00:05:48.600> I<00:05:48.630> kind<00:05:49.020> of<00:05:49.050> like<00:05:49.199> the

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
honestly I'm not sure I kind of like the

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.680 
honestly I'm not sure I kind of like the
look<00:05:49.410> of<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.590> bike<00:05:49.710> without<00:05:49.919> a<00:05:50.510> fender<00:05:51.510> on<00:05:51.540> the

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
look of the bike without a fender on the

00:05:51.690 --> 00:06:00.770 
look of the bike without a fender on the
front<00:05:52.080> so<00:05:53.720> well<00:05:54.720> no<00:05:56.990> but<00:05:57.990> i<00:05:58.260> think<00:05:59.300> i'll<00:06:00.300> do<00:06:00.600> it

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
front so well no but i think i'll do it

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.130 
front so well no but i think i'll do it
for<00:06:03.620> my<00:06:04.620> first<00:06:04.889> motorcycle
