00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi everyone today where is 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.779
 find for my first video that goes 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.820
 talk about the command slash effect then 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.860
 it's very simple it allows you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.620
 to add a potion effect on a 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.680
 player there are 20 years all so 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.690
 for that you do that effects the name 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.890
 player 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.260
 the idea of the effect so I'm going to you 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.570
 explain that later on the time in 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 seconds of attention and the power of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.550
 the leaves on the other hand a strange thing 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.769
 if you put 0 it's going to do one if you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.620
 put one it's going to do 2 2 it'll do 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.620
 three times it's weird so our 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.489
 first and speed what will we do 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.030
 speed up but I think that's 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.610
 logic 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.090
 so I want to drink milk for them 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.920
 quickly and that paula there I am less 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.610
 quick 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.059
 that's it you 're gonna fuck me and more 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.059
 quickly 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:08.540
 so you see I put the most 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:12.270
 quickly while then if they play 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.140
 this feminine game tired you see well 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.670
 the difference where it looks like it's 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.950
 hard idle but watch the jump that's 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.400
 epic who had lots of zombies who 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:32.190
 burn textron to these beasts day had 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.100
 need now for that in fact that you 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.780
 raised in a choir by level 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.479
 always guys that means without 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.790
 this throne if I type by hand that makes 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.740
 serve five hours of damage with 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.690
 stran staff and 1.5 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.450
 it's not bad then a stand alone end 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.740
 it's hard to pronounce so that you do 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.869
 added that the coming this year 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.550
 besides funny things if you put 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.530
 that's not me fifty seconds you 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.720
 are practically invincible because 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.200
 you will have lava and instant full 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.229
 finally every 50 seconds but it's 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.750
 same for the moment picture so 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.700
 I would have done that it's pretty fun if 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.530
 you do that 20 seconds and you 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.660
 have resistance show you face more 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.760
 later the screen starts to move like that 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.500
 it's finally me i booster it makes you 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.459
 jump higher but that I believe that 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.350
 you guessed it is very useful for 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.959
 the courses and I just saw myself and 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.690
 a super easy thing it's totally 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.750
 epic 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.239
 yeah I'm having fun it's great then 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.340
 what else do we have after 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.340
 nausea a year and panels to 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.450
 and there you are stuffed it's beer 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.090
 in minecraft 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.489
 I spoke of the ephebe the low milk 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:05.370
 so generations easy to guess 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.230
 resistance it decreases by 20% every 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.989
 damage you receive by neither do you 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.260
 means that resistant 5 or more you 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.390
 makes invincible so what do we 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.290
 have other fire resistance and water 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.319
 brazil fire resistance that immunizes you 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.940
 against fire and water browsing that you 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.819
 immunizes against drowning 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.620
 you see I do not drown that that's 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.239
 well 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:38.090
 so what do we have others then 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:41.599
 wait this is very useful this command 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.459
 invisibility what makes you obviously 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.590
 invisible we play my helmet and my 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.720
 glass of wine empty heaps 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.349
 so it's easy to notice that I 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:56.910
 Coconut'm here what we are others 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:04:00.660
 ok blanes you see nothing anymore finally that 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.430
 not so much night view by 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.310
 against that allows you to see in the 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:13.260
 night if I go finally see you in the 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:15.659
 night a guy that you that in a pinch 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:21.359
 it's like you're eating from the pulpit 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:23.130
 of witness 7 zombies decreases from 0 to 25 years 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.710
 damage winner all your attacks 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.789
 by level so much to say that whitney 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.190
 127 I do not think you'll be very 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:35.539
 strong poison 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:40.830
 obviously it does that to you and weezer 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:44.699
 so wait I will I drink them 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.320

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.659
 and so here I showed you the wines 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.060
 effect believe that you do not have very 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:53.430
 well seen the whizzer your hearts become 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.390
 blacks and you slowly lose out of life 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:01.320

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.840
