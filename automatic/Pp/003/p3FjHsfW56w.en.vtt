00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.660
 [Music] 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.000
 well now we are 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.680
 the installation of the game so rendezvous 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.540
 in the description just below the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.060
 video where you will find the different 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.529
 links to be able to download micro 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.660
 torrent so you click on 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.619
 download for those who have not already 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.349
 need to download it or be you 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.790
 update if necessary 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.280
 then you will download daemon tools 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.130
 light it is free also as 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.530
 micro torrent and you will click on 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.480
 download and be careful not to 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.220
 pay license check at the time of 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.450
 the installation but to check well they 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.880
 are free 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.070
 because many of you are going too much 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.350
 quickly when they install software 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.570
 because I got a lot of message 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.120
 about this software so does very 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.320
 attention was saying well and these 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.020
 will work nickel 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.150
 then go on the pirate bay 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.619
 where you will click on getty stoehr n 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.470
 to have the time is of the game so he 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.380
 is 2 gigas where it will go very very 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.149
 quickly at the download 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.710
 normally then for those who 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.749
 live in belgium are the pirate bay 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.249
 closed by the government you have got 

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:19.170
 meets at this point as judge and redone 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:22.740
 the procedure you saw we have access 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.329
 as if we were on the site so 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.729
 to be made one day do precedent 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.649
 you have search bar site so 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.229
 you take the link at the top makes you 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.090
 copy and where does it stick here so I 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.670
 already put and you do but have you 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.899
 wait a few seconds and this 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.149
 will appear as if you were on the 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.039
 site the pirate bay because the site is 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.709
 closed by the government in belgium 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.359
 so that's for this little trick so 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.130
 about the rayman patch is not there 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.299
 need as wanted said in the video 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.429
 test it is already in French at the base 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.189
 so once it's over we can 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:02:00.359
 remove these so me as I you 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.279
 usually says it but my records 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.670

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:08.250

 normally it is with everything damon 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.710
 default weight so sign dad if this 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.910

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.460
 you open with 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.130
 damon the lights and if it does not appear 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.620
 among the three there you choose the 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.140
 default program and you narrate it and 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.910
