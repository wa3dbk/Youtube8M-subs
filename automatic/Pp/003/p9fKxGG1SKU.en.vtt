here's<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.450> last<00:01:33.780> thing<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:33.990> I've<00:01:34.229> always

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
here's the last thing that I've always

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.740 
here's the last thing that I've always
been<00:01:34.619> notorious<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.430> playing<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.820> I'm

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
been notorious for for playing in it I'm

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
been notorious for for playing in it I'm
playing<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.170> way<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.350> last<00:01:38.040> four<00:01:38.220> minute<00:01:38.430> was

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
playing one way so last four minute was

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.780 
playing one way so last four minute was
a<00:01:38.549> lot<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:39.710> monster<00:01:40.710> destruction<00:01:41.310> based<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
a lot more monster destruction based and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.850 
a lot more monster destruction based and
this<00:01:42.450> formats<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.930> lot<00:01:43.079> slower<00:01:43.259> I'm<00:01:43.619> thinking

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
this formats a lot slower I'm thinking

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.800 
this formats a lot slower I'm thinking
about<00:01:43.920> taking<00:01:44.159> out<00:01:44.340> wise<00:01:44.549> 04<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.509> format

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
about taking out wise 04 this format
