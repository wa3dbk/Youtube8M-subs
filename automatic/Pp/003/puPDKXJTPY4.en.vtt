you just get three lights you don't get
the<00:00:17.710> hard<00:00:17.890> drive<00:00:18.100> light<00:00:18.310> I've<00:00:18.940> pulled<00:00:19.180> the

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
the hard drive light I've pulled the

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.040 
the hard drive light I've pulled the
hard<00:00:19.480> drive<00:00:19.660> out<00:00:19.810> and<00:00:20.080> it<00:00:20.410> acts<00:00:20.590> just<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:21.160> same

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
hard drive out and it acts just the same

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.840 
hard drive out and it acts just the same
it<00:00:23.050> won't<00:00:23.230> get<00:00:23.410> past<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:23.830> buy<00:00:23.980> off<00:00:24.160> screen<00:00:24.580> I

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
it won't get past the buy off screen I

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.910 
it won't get past the buy off screen I
pulled<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:25.750> RAM<00:00:25.900> a<00:00:25.930> swap<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.620> RAM<00:00:26.740> out

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
pulled the RAM a swap the RAM out

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.950 
pulled the RAM a swap the RAM out
nothing<00:00:27.250> will<00:00:27.490> happen

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
down you can hold down for six seven you

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.040 
down you can hold down for six seven you

little bar off right here I slid the
keyboard<00:01:18.340> out<00:01:18.490> fold<00:01:19.299> it<00:01:19.479> out<00:01:19.600> there's<00:01:19.930> a

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
keyboard out fold it out there's a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.140 
keyboard out fold it out there's a
million<00:01:20.500> different<00:01:20.680> connectors<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:21.760> you<00:01:21.820> got

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
million different connectors and you got

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.240 
million different connectors and you got
to<00:01:22.210> undo<00:01:22.450> each<00:01:22.600> one<00:01:22.869> you<00:01:23.500> got<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.799> undo<00:01:24.070> some

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
to undo each one you got to undo some

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.350 
to undo each one you got to undo some
more<00:01:24.400> screws<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:25.470> then<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.820> can<00:01:28.000> take<00:01:28.210> the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
more screws and then you can take the

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.240 
more screws and then you can take the
board<00:01:28.630> out<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.080> flip<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.500> board<00:01:29.710> over<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:30.100> and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
board out and flip the board over it and

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.800 
board out and flip the board over it and
then<00:01:30.549> in<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.729> video<00:01:30.909> it<00:01:31.210> looked<00:01:31.479> like<00:01:31.570> it<00:01:31.689> was

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
then in the video it looked like it was

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.200 
then in the video it looked like it was
a<00:01:31.869> tiny<00:01:32.140> little<00:01:32.320> battery<00:01:32.860> on<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.100> top<00:01:33.310> and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
a tiny little battery on the top and

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.969 
a tiny little battery on the top and
either<00:01:34.479> I'm<00:01:34.720> thinking<00:01:35.380> I<00:01:35.439> need<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.619> reset<00:01:35.950> the

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
either I'm thinking I need to reset the

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.440 
either I'm thinking I need to reset the
BIOS<00:01:36.570> because<00:01:37.570> it<00:01:37.869> won't<00:01:38.020> post<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:39.610> will<00:01:40.240> not

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
BIOS because it won't post it will not

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.020 
BIOS because it won't post it will not
even<00:01:40.810> show<00:01:41.619> a<00:01:42.310> screen<00:01:43.770> I've<00:01:44.770> done<00:01:45.310> all<00:01:45.520> the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
even show a screen I've done all the

00:01:46.030 --> 00:02:02.100 
even show a screen I've done all the
troubleshooting<00:01:46.630> I<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:49.210> possibly<00:01:49.780> think<00:01:49.869> up

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.990 

if<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.380> saw<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.740> hard<00:02:04.009> drive<00:02:04.220> light<00:02:04.369> flashing<00:02:04.820> I

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
if I saw the hard drive light flashing I

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.109 
if I saw the hard drive light flashing I
would<00:02:05.570> think<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.289> screen<00:02:06.680> went<00:02:06.920> out<00:02:07.119> but

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
would think that the screen went out but

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.150 
would think that the screen went out but
the<00:02:08.239> hard<00:02:08.420> drive<00:02:08.599> light<00:02:08.780> does<00:02:08.959> not<00:02:08.989> flash<00:02:09.410> even

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
the hard drive light does not flash even

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.330 
the hard drive light does not flash even
with<00:02:10.340> another<00:02:10.550> hard<00:02:10.789> drive<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:12.340> saw

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
with another hard drive in it and saw

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.790 
with another hard drive in it and saw
the<00:02:13.370> rams<00:02:13.700> fault<00:02:14.300> either<00:02:14.540> it's<00:02:15.349> just<00:02:15.620> not

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
the rams fault either it's just not

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.610 
the rams fault either it's just not
