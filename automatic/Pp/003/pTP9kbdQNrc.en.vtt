 with one-third off tax breaks on during 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.340
 the installation is completely normal 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.470
 that could change over time 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.760
 the computer operated 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.999
 4 always though so since Ann Arbor USA out 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:41.110
 Neustadt 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.110

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.440
 because they could secure 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.430
 brakes Klava Steinkamp 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.640

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.750
 Percent to 11 percent 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.070

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.980
 Smith 7 8 or so begins 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.070
 if better internal it means you can 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.970
 so here 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.890
 however, he added network
