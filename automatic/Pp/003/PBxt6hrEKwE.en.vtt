00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.080
 everyone sounds the idea that 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.350
 a large meteorite of about 10 kilometers 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.360
 of size ended with the reign of 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.820
 dinosaurs on the earth 65 ago 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.770
 millions of years the idea is not new without 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.890
 But since it was formulated it has been 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.650
 submitted to a rigorous analysis by the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.510
 researchers and has had to compete 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.850
 with another series of theories that also 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.950
 they were trying to give an explanation to one of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.200
 the extinctions of life on the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.860
 land greater than all that has 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.590
 been 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.570
 in fact 65 million years ago in the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.390
 time limit between the period 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.310
 cretaceous and the immediately following 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.880
 which is the tertiary is the limit kt 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.940
 say the scientists something happened 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.830
 that ended in very little time with the 70 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.410
 percent of all living species 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.680
 of the planet 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.390
 then back then those many 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.030
 of those species both on land and in 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.940
 sea or air were dinosaurs in the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.280
 saurians had us dinosaurs 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.570
 reptilian terrestrial dinosaurs 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.540
 dinosaurs marine dinosaurs 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.850
 flying the world for 80 long 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.060
 million years was dominated by the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.060
 dinosaurs 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.870
 the researchers that are the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.650
 fossils are digging in different layers 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.330
 in different strata and go 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.970
 unearthing the past they know they know 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.280
 can calculate how many years each 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.619
 layer as it deepens and results 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.720
 that just in the limit kt 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.330
 that is 65 million years ago 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.820
 where the Cretaceous ends the remains of 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.810
 dinosaurs that in the upper layers 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.369
 they are very abundant they disappear 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.259
 directly disappear below 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.810
 that limit is practically no longer 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.840
 none is missing in all and 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.970
 between the two just between the area 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.070
 of rock that belongs to the Cretaceous and the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.400
 which belongs to the tertiary there is a fine 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.519
 black layer a very few millimeters 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.130
 a layer of black powder the analysis of 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.820
 that black dust that surrounds the whole earth 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:24.780
 it is very proves that it is very rich in two 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.830
 kinds of things are a few small cells 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.870
 minerals that are called tectites and that 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.040
 only occur when one falls a 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.379
 meteorite and 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.510
 the temperatures are so huge that 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.040
 they melt the rocks they form drops and 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.409
 when those drops solidify they are 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.209
 those tektitas and iridium that is a 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.340
 material that on earth there is no 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.709
 natural way and that everyone we have 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.709
 in the earth comes from meteorites 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.099
 in 1980 you have to go back a 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.659
 American university researcher 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.420
 of berkeley called luis álvarez and 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.480
 his son called walter discovered 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.760
 this layer of iridium and wondering if 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.940
 would be general or a local phenomenon were 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.790
 to drill in different areas of the world 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.310
 to it the same stratum is to say 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.959
 limit kt to see if there too there 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.750
 I found that strange video layer and 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.060
 it turns out that everywhere in all the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.099
 world there is that video layer that 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.560
 surrounded the planet then they said well 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:29.190
 if this is extraterrestrial material something 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.489
 it must have happened for a body 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.890
 alien will leave a layer of dust 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.370
 that covered the entire entire planet should 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.500
 be something very big started looking 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.859
 the culprit of that and that guilty 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.750
 it turned out to be found was in the 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.760
 Gulf of Mexico just off the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.890
 Yucatan coasts and appeared a few years 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.069
 later due to some prospections 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.380
 oil fields found the crater in a 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.700
 180 km crater and compatible 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.459
 with the fall of an object 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.580
 of 10 kilometers in diameter was the 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.709
 guilty that was needed to kill 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.709
 as dinosaurs of the dinosaurs 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.720
 during the previous million years 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.100
 they also happened on earth another 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.280
 type of catastrophes between them 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.130
 gigantic volcanic eruptions 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.200
 we have as an example between 68 and 70 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.380
 millions of years the gigantic eruption 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.750
 of the decán valley in india are 550 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.240
 thousand square kilometers of laundry 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.720
 lava and the thickness of the laundry is two 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.870
 and three kilometers to receive must be 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.820
 monstrous the researchers all this 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.120
 story was to get to this 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.690
 conclusion they have always doubted that the 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.160
 moment of meteorite fall and the 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.500
 moment of the extinction of the 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.510
 dinosaurs coincided in the time of 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.360
 fact was very difficult to calculate 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.370
 and to make the two dates know if 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.290
 indeed they were contemporaneous or if 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.820
 on the contrary the dinosaurs when 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.590
 the meteorite fell they had already 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.350
 extinguished or if they became extinct 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.940
 time later then now again in 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.070
 team at berkeley university has 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.130
 got for the first time ditch that of 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.840
 our discussion and demonstrate that the 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.169
 two events the fall of 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.300
 meteorite 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.569
 and the disappearance of the dinosaurs are 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.560
 contemporaries the date is 66 million 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:26.419
 38 thousand years and is valid for both 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.039
 causes for both things both for the 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.520
 death of the dinosaurs as for the 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.409
 meteorite fall now well those 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.360
 other causes that we mentioned before 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.249
 do not rule out the 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.189
 probably and that's what they think 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:41.659
 scientists nowadays something 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:43.999
 began to change on earth there was 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:47.749
 climatic changes changed the levels 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:50.169
 of the sea many ecosystems remained 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:52.249
 uncovered water and could finish 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.409
 there are probably clues of a 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:56.029
 Acidification of the oceans 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.009
 they produced these large eruptions 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:00.259
 volcanic is to say things are 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.680
 they made it difficult for scientists 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:06.289
 more and more are thinking that the 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.469
 cause of the great extinction of the Cretaceous 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.060
 is multiple is multiple but without 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:13.009
 no doubt as he has shown 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.199
 this investigation the fall of the 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:18.230
 meteorite was the trigger we say 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:22.030
 the last blow to life 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.030
 during that distant hot
