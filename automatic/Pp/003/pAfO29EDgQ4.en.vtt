00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.460 
this it's like it's basically a two hand
weapon<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.760> has<00:03:26.000> pretty<00:03:26.630> stats<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.230> don't

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
weapon it has pretty stats I don't

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.320 
weapon it has pretty stats I don't
we<00:03:27.590> have<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.739> 22<00:03:28.340> damage<00:03:28.700> in<00:03:28.820> one<00:03:28.970> minute<00:03:29.209> and

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
we have a 22 damage in one minute and

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.970 
we have a 22 damage in one minute and
actresses<00:03:29.690> that's<00:03:29.989> stuff<00:03:30.320> really<00:03:30.530> good<00:03:30.769> for

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
actresses that's stuff really good for

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.800 
actresses that's stuff really good for
anything<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.519> think<00:03:32.030> it's<00:03:32.180> mainly<00:03:32.450> just<00:03:32.630> a

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
anything I think it's mainly just a

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.229 
anything I think it's mainly just a
cosmetic<00:03:33.310> like<00:03:34.310> weapon<00:03:34.640> item<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:37.239> that's

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
cosmetic like weapon item and that's

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.800 
cosmetic like weapon item and that's
pretty<00:03:39.170> much<00:03:39.320> all<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:40.850> I<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.180> can<00:03:41.540> show

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
pretty much all of it I you can show

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.810 
pretty much all of it I you can show
them<00:03:41.959> in<00:03:42.080> four<00:03:42.230> seats<00:03:42.440> as<00:03:42.560> well<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.920> also<00:03:43.489> think

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
them in four seats as well I also think

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.740 
them in four seats as well I also think
you<00:03:44.000> can<00:03:44.680> convert<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:47.330> beans<00:03:47.600> to

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
you can convert the the beans to

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.120 
you can convert the the beans to
experience<00:03:48.410> but<00:03:48.590> I'm<00:03:48.650> not<00:03:48.739> completely<00:03:48.950> sure
