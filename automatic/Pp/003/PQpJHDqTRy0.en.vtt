00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:20.080
 house together here is babel and today 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.360
 it's about an objective what I am now 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.590
 got to know me and what I like very much 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:30.490
 it has agreed to the sigma 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.930
 fixed focal length 35 mm aperture 14 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.500
 the go and above all acs that is one 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.060
 new lens from the house siekmann and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.320
 yes, I have to say so honestly me 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.060
 was a bit surprised because it 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.230
 you can already see the objective ones 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:51.790
 and done that very differently 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.760
 First of all, it feels very solid 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.730
 on and very good workmanship 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.800
 I immediately saw the sigma 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.880
 Objectives sometimes become in China 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.340
 assembled 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.830
 that is not the case here that is one 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.979
 Objective directly from Japan is also available 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.470
 On it you also believe it and on 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.740
 every case a very good workmanship 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.619
 as an objective metal gummierung 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.159
 is very tight very nice so the 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.840
 first impression is great we have yes 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.490
 also the lens hood the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.859
 We also have the carrycot I have 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.539
 but left home because we are 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.350
 not here in kindergarten now 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.030
 want us on the essential 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.210
 concentrate so that's now the lens 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.759
 even there are already several objective ones 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.259
 from the series I will later 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.329
 also test out 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.389
 but now we concentrate first 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.710
 on this lens what we need 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:53.170
 at all these 35 millimeters 1.4 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.420
 that's fine if we're somewhere 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.799
 So street photographers are on the way 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.420
 someone knows that we also have the tektur 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.130
 take a picture 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.899
 so for marco, too, is that 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.729
 I can not stand it 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.649
 measured but not read 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.950
 that's not very marco but that's the way it is 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.490
 about 40 to 50 centimeters works 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.190
 quite well 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.950
 and what makes me totally objective about this 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.780
 That's okay effect one has impressed 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.840
 can take pictures with open aperture 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.439
 and that looks just awesome I'll 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.870
 now the objective on the nikon d 610 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.800
 Fix that was a car or now 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.440
 plane 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.800
 so no matter now have nikon the 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.610
 610 there is this objective of course 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.200
 also for know 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.290
 but well we have the nikon now 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.440
 execution and I will now too 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.050
 try it out here 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.770
 so very important that we have everything now 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.890
 connect properly so that fits 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.650
 very good and I have it here now 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.630
 synonymous corresponding motives so where me 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.250
 Now I'm on a castle you can 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.690
 very good with this lens 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.360
 can photograph details 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.730
 take pictures and we can also do that 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.040
 taking pictures I'm watching now 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.790
 Something we take for attitudes 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.340
 we now take iso 160 or even on 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.410
 100 goes well then we take now 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.760
 Just blindfold 28 I do that 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.460
 now deliberately good now I have to 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.210
 Of course I'm going down with Jesus 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.490
 I now have iso 100 aperture 28 and we 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.130
 I have some branches here 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.920
 take a picture now 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.400
 then we look like that with the ok 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.250
 Effect looks like but I have to 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.820
 say the same with the ok effect 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.459
 Do not be very busy right now because of it 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.040
 must be very close to the photographer 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.640
 something is ok then effect too 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.780
 to get 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.390
 especially the flowers or the first one 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.830
 the bremer in front of the buildings is quite effective 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.910
 Well 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.920
 that's why I would do that on others 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.810
 photograph motives and do it now 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.239
 I just took a few shots now 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.330
 to look like that's the objective 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.489
 behaves especially in such difficult 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.320
 light conditions if who are light in the 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.850
 photograph back light like this and then 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.840
 Of course, I will also be a few 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.640
 take shots in the other direction 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.720
 and to look at the landscape like that 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.950
 Whole affects in any case 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.840
 Focusing is very fast 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.300
 So there are often rumors on the internet 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.660
 yes some objective focus just 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.310
 bad 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.350
 I have to honestly say mine 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.530
 I do not have photographic practice yet 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.710
 Objective had what bad focused 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.190
 maybe I am lucky 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.500
 or I can handle it easily 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.270
 definitely to focus use 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.370
 I somebody is a middle point that 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.890
 for me it's always the most important thing 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.260
 very tangible yes I focus 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.720
 then I hold the trigger lightly 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.580
 pressed and then it fits then yes 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.950
 I move the view as I do 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.000
 that would like and can actually 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.210
 nothing goes wrong 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.100
 Well, there is a lot going on in production 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.600
 So there are some objective ones 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.130
 maybe not quite as well adjusted 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.920
 but there exists a us blog for 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.520
 sigma objective because there I have now 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.670
 not there 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.400
 cost 50 euros you can buy extra and 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.590
 With this pressure you can adjust the adjustment 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.970
 of the lens itself at the computer 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.130
 carry out 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.350
 I will show that in some video 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.060
 if I pass such a dock meters on 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.550
 In any case, I think that's the one 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.220
 very good solution because you do not have to 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.260
 the workshop but can the 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.670
 corrections then even at home or in the 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.240
 perform studio 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.270
 okay, let's see what's objectively 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.550
 everything still offers the focal length 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.590
 even so I look then that is 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.480
 in principle quite good 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.840
 that's not a zoom you have to do a bit 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.520
 But running around doing quite well you 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.950
 you will stay athletic and in 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.290
 movement and therefore therefore with 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.830
 This is also very nice 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:09.560
 to take pictures so you stay in 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.050
 motion and edge the picture too 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.940
 build up if I say okay now so 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.450
 For example, I want these two towers 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.130
 to have 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.870
 you have to go back a bit and 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.230
 I even have a small plane 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.570
 in the picture had in it if I now closer 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.880
 of course , then, of course, too 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.750
 be careful that the object is complete 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:33.590
 I have some image in it and that 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:37.040
 also works quite well what 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.720
 So on the subject of close-up photos, that's it 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.430
 Of course, money is fine, too 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.280
 I have this for example now 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:46.040
 telescope that works very well 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.070
 nice and will be like me now 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.420
 Here we can enter this pipe 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.350
 Just look like that 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.810
 page 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.750
 yes that's about the distance now 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.490
 of about 40 cm 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.990
 that works quite well try a bit 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.990
 get closer 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:14.030
 yes, yes it works so well 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:17.000
 practically him very close in the macro area 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.020
 We can also do a lot with this lens 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.810
 work well 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.300
 pictures have already looked so the 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.120
 Distortion is consistently good 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.460
 So we have very good on the edge 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.710
 Sharpness in the middle anyway on everyone 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.470
 case the lens makes a very good impression 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.030
 and now if the prices compare 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.960
 So we're kind of involved now 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:41.510
 street price so around the 750 to 800 euro 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.330
 So that's not bad in comparison 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:47.620
 to original lenses and canon and 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:50.270
 nikon can save a lot here 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.670
 Okay, I'm leaving now 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:54.500
 few already enjoy this beautiful pictures 

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.790
 objectively and I think so for 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.310
 photographers dealing with street 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.260
 busy photography and otherwise very 

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.670
 like to shoot with fixed focal length 

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.920
 So 35 mm 

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.370
 specifically this objective is none 

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.370
 bad choose
