00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
they're actually quite fun so my

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.759 
they're actually quite fun so my
question<00:02:53.579> would<00:02:54.389> be<00:02:54.449> since<00:02:54.989> there<00:02:55.199> has<00:02:55.560> been

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
question would be since there has been

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.740 
question would be since there has been
some<00:02:55.980> confirmation<00:02:56.370> about<00:02:56.819> monsters<00:02:57.599> in

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
some confirmation about monsters in

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.009 
some confirmation about monsters in
titanfall<00:02:58.189> and<00:02:59.189> I<00:02:59.400> would<00:02:59.609> go<00:02:59.639> about<00:03:00.449> that<00:03:00.719> in<00:03:00.900> a

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
titanfall and I would go about that in a

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.530 
titanfall and I would go about that in a
second<00:03:01.319> do<00:03:01.919> you<00:03:02.010> guys<00:03:02.189> think<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:02.819> there

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
second do you guys think that there

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.289 
second do you guys think that there
might<00:03:03.900> be<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.590> kind<00:03:05.069> of<00:03:05.189> zombie<00:03:05.400> or<00:03:05.730> survival

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
might be a kind of zombie or survival

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.939 
might be a kind of zombie or survival
mode<00:03:06.480> added<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.930> tighten<00:03:07.230> for<00:03:07.349> maybe<00:03:07.530> not<00:03:07.739> with

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:07.949 
mode added to tighten for maybe not with

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.089 
mode added to tighten for maybe not with
Eve<00:03:08.159> like<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.120> DD<00:03:09.659> launch<00:03:10.079> game<00:03:10.439> the<00:03:10.980> maybe

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
Eve like the DD launch game the maybe

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.879 
Eve like the DD launch game the maybe
with<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> DLC<00:03:11.909> or<00:03:11.939> yeah<00:03:12.659> well<00:03:13.199> maybe<00:03:13.409> even<00:03:13.709> with

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
with a DLC or yeah well maybe even with

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:14.990 
with a DLC or yeah well maybe even with
the<00:03:13.980> launch<00:03:14.159> game<00:03:14.340> i<00:03:14.370> have<00:03:14.579> no<00:03:14.699> idea<00:03:14.819> i

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
the launch game i have no idea i

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.349 
the launch game i have no idea i
probably<00:03:15.299> don't<00:03:15.540> think<00:03:15.659> so<00:03:15.959> but<00:03:16.139> i'm<00:03:16.290> just

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
probably don't think so but i'm just

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.399 
probably don't think so but i'm just
thinking<00:03:18.359> about<00:03:18.509> possibilities<00:03:19.109> that<00:03:19.290> they

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
thinking about possibilities that they

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.349 
thinking about possibilities that they
might<00:03:19.560> be<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:19.829> cuz<00:03:20.009> it's<00:03:20.699> pretty<00:03:20.790> obvious<00:03:21.329> that

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
might be in cuz it's pretty obvious that

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.469 
might be in cuz it's pretty obvious that
they<00:03:21.659> kind<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.799> want<00:03:23.189> to<00:03:23.280> kill<00:03:23.519> don't<00:03:24.209> want<00:03:24.359> to

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
they kind of want to kill don't want to

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.780 
they kind of want to kill don't want to
kill<00:03:24.659> coal<00:03:24.840> city<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.229> they<00:03:25.889> they<00:03:26.519> want<00:03:26.549> to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
kill coal city but they they want to

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.390 
kill coal city but they they want to
show<00:03:26.939> them<00:03:27.180> how<00:03:27.509> it's<00:03:27.689> done<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.079> yeah<00:03:28.829> they're

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
back to the monsters so I'm there s been

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.999 
back to the monsters so I'm there s been
months<00:03:39.120> we<00:03:39.750> are<00:03:39.900> how<00:03:40.049> should<00:03:40.259> put<00:03:40.379> us<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:41.009 
months we are how should put us and

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:42.469 
months we are how should put us and
there<00:03:41.220> are<00:03:41.280> monsters<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.579> titanfall<00:03:41.970> on<00:03:42.269> some

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
there are monsters in titanfall on some

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.599 
there are monsters in titanfall on some
maps<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.259> on<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> beta<00:03:43.829> maps<00:03:44.069> we<00:03:44.280> haven't<00:03:44.519> had

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
maps so on the beta maps we haven't had

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.429 
maps so on the beta maps we haven't had
monsters<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.209> there<00:03:45.959> are<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.079> couple<00:03:46.259> of

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 
monsters and there are a couple of

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.189 
monsters and there are a couple of
different<00:03:46.919> monsters<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.609> I<00:03:48.000> suppose<00:03:48.449> one<00:03:49.169> of

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
different monsters and I suppose one of

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.110 
different monsters and I suppose one of
them<00:03:49.470> would<00:03:49.709> be<00:03:49.739> just<00:03:50.069> like<00:03:50.400> sitting<00:03:50.970> around

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
them would be just like sitting around

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.210 
them would be just like sitting around
on<00:03:51.449> the<00:03:51.540> map<00:03:51.720> doing<00:03:51.959> nothing<00:03:52.349> and<00:03:52.560> as<00:03:52.889> long<00:03:53.069> as

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
on the map doing nothing and as long as

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.189 
on the map doing nothing and as long as
you're<00:03:53.489> not<00:03:53.519> attacking<00:03:53.939> them<00:03:54.299> they<00:03:54.599> won't<00:03:54.930> be

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
you're not attacking them they won't be

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.349 
you're not attacking them they won't be
attacking<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.829> so<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.430> think<00:03:56.759> it<00:03:56.939> could<00:03:57.180> be

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
attacking you so I think it could be

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.789 
attacking you so I think it could be
kind<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.569> interesting<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:58.049> trick<00:03:58.349> your<00:03:58.469> enemy

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
kind of interesting to trick your enemy

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.399 
kind of interesting to trick your enemy
into<00:03:59.159> fighting<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.759> big<00:04:00.359> monsters<00:04:00.810> or<00:04:01.049> just

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
into fighting the big monsters or just

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:02.689 
into fighting the big monsters or just
to<00:04:01.530> trick<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.859> monster<00:04:02.189> and<00:04:02.310> fighting<00:04:02.669> the

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
to trick the monster and fighting the

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.599 
to trick the monster and fighting the
your<00:04:03.269> enemies<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:04.379> help<00:04:04.769> you<00:04:04.919> win<00:04:05.099> the<00:04:05.219> game<00:04:05.400> or

your enemies to help you win the game or

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
just to have like I think they're also

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.219 
just to have like I think they're also
kind<00:04:08.189> of<00:04:08.250> aggressive<00:04:08.519> monsters<00:04:09.060> there<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:10.049> i

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
I'm I just can feel the dizzy

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.230 
I'm I just can feel the dizzy
I<00:04:19.090> don't<00:04:19.419> know<00:04:19.480> why<00:04:19.600> but<00:04:20.160> yep<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.639> I<00:04:21.669> think<00:04:21.760> that

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
I don't know why but yep so I think that

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.240 
I don't know why but yep so I think that
some<00:04:22.870> of<00:04:22.930> them<00:04:23.050> are<00:04:23.200> also<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.860> aggressive

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
some of them are also the aggressive

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.820 
some of them are also the aggressive
type<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.610> they<00:04:24.820> just<00:04:25.150> are<00:04:25.720> straight<00:04:26.320> going

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
type and they just are straight going

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.200 
type and they just are straight going
straight<00:04:27.040> for<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.280> attack<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.820> they're<00:04:28.000> just

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
straight for the attack and they're just

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.790 
straight for the attack and they're just
going<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.450> attack<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.750> right<00:04:28.900> away<00:04:29.110> and

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
going to attack you right away and

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.129 
going to attack you right away and
straight<00:04:30.040> away<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.460> yeah<00:04:30.970> I<00:04:31.210> think<00:04:31.510> that

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
straight away and yeah I think that

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.080 
straight away and yeah I think that
besides<00:04:32.710> having<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.160> nice<00:04:33.430> addition<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:33.940> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
besides having a nice addition to the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.330 
besides having a nice addition to the
multiplayer<00:04:34.510> maps<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:34.990> think<00:04:35.320> for<00:04:35.889> some<00:04:36.130> maps

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
multiplayer maps I think for some maps

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.220 
multiplayer maps I think for some maps
it<00:04:36.490> could<00:04:36.669> work<00:04:37.030> really<00:04:37.270> really<00:04:37.660> well<00:04:37.900> and

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
it could work really really well and

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.500 
it could work really really well and
four<00:04:38.530> hours<00:04:38.760> probably<00:04:39.760> might<00:04:40.150> just<00:04:40.360> be

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
four hours probably might just be

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.090 
four hours probably might just be
annoying<00:04:40.780> we<00:04:41.139> think<00:04:41.530> we'll<00:04:41.650> have<00:04:41.770> to<00:04:41.919> wait<00:04:42.040> and

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
annoying we think we'll have to wait and

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.800 
annoying we think we'll have to wait and
see<00:04:42.280> although<00:04:43.090> i<00:04:43.120> really<00:04:43.450> like<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.750> idea

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
see although i really like the idea

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.960 
see although i really like the idea
because<00:04:44.290> yet<00:04:45.070> again<00:04:45.100> this<00:04:45.430> is<00:04:45.520> just<00:04:45.700> another

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
because yet again this is just another

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.120 
because yet again this is just another
feature<00:04:46.330> how<00:04:47.230> they're<00:04:47.410> trying<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.980> add

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
feature how they're trying to add

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.610 
feature how they're trying to add
diversity<00:04:48.790> atlas<00:04:49.450> at<00:04:49.990> least<00:04:50.230> from<00:04:50.320> my<00:04:50.410> point

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
diversity atlas at least from my point

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.530 
diversity atlas at least from my point
of<00:04:50.710> view<00:04:50.770> i<00:04:50.919> mean<00:04:51.130> you<00:04:51.669> got<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:51.940> titans<00:04:52.270> you

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
of view i mean you got the titans you

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.530 
of view i mean you got the titans you
got<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:53.290> pilots<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.919> got<00:04:54.419> cloaking<00:04:55.419> for

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
got the pilots you got cloaking for

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.879 
got the pilots you got cloaking for
example<00:04:55.840> right<00:04:55.930> here<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.229> got<00:04:56.380> wall<00:04:56.620> running

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
example right here you got wall running

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.879 
example right here you got wall running
they're<00:04:57.700> just<00:04:57.729> so<00:04:58.150> many<00:04:58.389> possibilities<00:04:58.720> and<00:04:59.470> i

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
they're just so many possibilities and i

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.980 
they're just so many possibilities and i
think<00:05:00.280> with<00:05:00.490> a<00:05:00.520> full<00:05:00.790> game<00:05:01.000> i<00:05:01.270> also<00:05:01.660> really

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
think with a full game i also really

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.420 
think with a full game i also really
hope<00:05:02.110> that<00:05:02.320> in<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.860> last<00:05:02.979> video<00:05:03.130> where<00:05:03.370> i

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
hope that in the last video where i

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.159 
hope that in the last video where i
showed<00:05:03.669> you<00:05:03.700> the<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.300> website<00:05:04.810> will<00:05:04.930> be<00:05:04.990> in

weapons that there are available or if
they're<00:05:10.270> coming<00:05:10.450> more<00:05:10.780> with<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.050> DLCs<00:05:11.500> or

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.980 
they're coming more with the DLCs or
something<00:05:12.150> but<00:05:14.070> that's<00:05:15.070> my<00:05:15.370> only<00:05:15.550> am<00:05:15.990> critique

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
something but that's my only am critique

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.659 
something but that's my only am critique
point<00:05:17.440> right<00:05:17.740> now<00:05:17.770> because<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.400> seems<00:05:18.610> like

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
point right now because it seems like

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.610 
point right now because it seems like
the<00:05:18.970> wet<00:05:19.360> memory<00:05:19.600> or<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:19.900> attachments<00:05:20.350> might

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
the wet memory or the attachments might

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.219 
the wet memory or the attachments might
actually<00:05:20.800> be<00:05:21.100> a<00:05:21.130> little<00:05:21.460> bit<00:05:21.610> too<00:05:21.820> few<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.240> keep

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
actually be a little bit too few to keep

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.980 
actually be a little bit too few to keep
up<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:23.500> interest<00:05:23.830> or<00:05:23.950> just<00:05:24.160> to<00:05:24.460> and<00:05:24.850> offer<00:05:25.390> a

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
up the interest or just to and offer a

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.500 
up the interest or just to and offer a
more<00:05:26.710> variety<00:05:27.220> but<00:05:27.729> yet<00:05:27.850> again<00:05:27.940> i'm<00:05:28.240> adding

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
more variety but yet again i'm adding

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.330 
more variety but yet again i'm adding
more<00:05:28.660> stuff<00:05:28.930> is<00:05:29.169> hard<00:05:29.380> to<00:05:29.530> balance<00:05:29.680> and<00:05:30.160> i

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
more stuff is hard to balance and i

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.130
