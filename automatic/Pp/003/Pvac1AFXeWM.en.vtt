00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.560
 DDR4 is the latest synchronous DRAM technology 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.600
 This memory technology is used in most electronic devices that people use. 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.940
 Such as a desktop computer, laptop or game console 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.220
 Even some important devices that we donâ€™t normally reach can use this technology, such as web servers. 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.580
 And services like Facebook and Dropbox. 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.100
 From the appearance, DDR4 memory does not seem to have anything special, but it is still nuanced with other memory. 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.940
 DDR4 memory is no longer backward compatible with DDR3 motherboards, and vice versa 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.180
 So the memory gap has moved, avoiding accidentally inserting the wrong model memory. 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.960
 Further, there are memory DDR4, pins 288, 240 to replace the previous 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.739
 Finally, in order to improve the strength and electrical contact of the memory, a little arc is added to the bottom of the memory PCB. 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.259
 In addition to the difference in appearance, DDR4 technology is also different 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.260
 Then the fourth generation of DDR which features more than DDR3 it? 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.320
 Here are a few new features of DDR4 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.369
 First, the memory speed has increased dramatically. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.940
 DDR4 starting frequency of 2133 MHz, which is already quite high for DDR3 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.940
 And DDR4 also plans to increase the speed to more than 3200 MHz 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.000
 And each module's working voltage is only 1.2V 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.500
 This also illustrates its second benefit - reducing power consumption 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.900
 DDR4 is more energy efficient than DDR3, reducing power consumption by up to 40% 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.000
 This doesn't seem to be a big deal for desktop computers. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.180
 But it can change the battery life of the laptop 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.000
 Every change is important for mobile devices 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.380
 DDR4 storage capacity has also increased dramatically 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.260
 Because DDR4 supports higher density chips and stacked package technology, in the near future 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.900
 A single memory capacity of up to 256 GB, or even 512 GB 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.560
 DDR4 takes its superior performance to new heights 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.520
 And greatly improved stability 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.800
 DDR4 features improved cyclic redundancy check, onboard "command and address" transmission parity 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.000
 And enhanced signal integrity, making it the most reliable DDR available today. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 This also makes Kingston's HyperX Predator memory performance pre-optimized. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.469
 Enable XMP profiles with a single setting 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:34.991
 These memories are optimized for Intel's latest X99 platform, so they work seamlessly with the new six- or eight-core Core i7 processor 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.749
 Finally, the memory is also equipped with a black heat sink marked with HyperX logo 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:43.849
 Works perfectly with any X99 series motherboard 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.120
 Thank you for watching this DDR4 technology video 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.220
