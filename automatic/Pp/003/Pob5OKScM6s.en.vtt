00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:37.409
 happened you did today was 

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:40.139

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.799
 10 rubles is not written how much it costs 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.039

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.839
 how are you doing me today i have three 

00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:53.699
 purple weapons are probably somewhere in 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:54.929
 total call directly factory 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:57.929
