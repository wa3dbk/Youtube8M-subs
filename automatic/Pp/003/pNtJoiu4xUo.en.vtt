fans<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.550> at

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
fans so at

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.090 
fans so at
and<00:02:17.940> which<00:02:18.330> distance<00:02:19.140> they<00:02:19.530> are<00:02:19.710> from<00:02:20.040> each

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
and which distance they are from each

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.180 
and which distance they are from each
other<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.580> like<00:02:21.480> one<00:02:21.690> log<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.080> mill<00:02:22.260> 3<00:02:22.950> in

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
other and like one log in the mill 3 in

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.610 
other and like one log in the mill 3 in
this<00:02:23.730> direction<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.510> then<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.170> next<00:02:25.200> fence

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
this direction and then the next fence

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.910 
this direction and then the next fence
so<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.330> think<00:02:27.330> that's<00:02:27.630> pretty<00:02:27.930> clear<00:02:28.170> also

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
so I think that's pretty clear also

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.000 
so I think that's pretty clear also
those<00:02:29.250> fences<00:02:29.790> are<00:02:30.060> at<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.750> height<00:02:30.990> of<00:02:31.140> 12

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
those fences are at the height of 12

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.140 
those fences are at the height of 12
blocks<00:02:32.670> actually<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:34.100> for<00:02:35.100> better<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.520> say<00:02:35.700> if

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
blocks actually so for better to say if

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.760 
blocks actually so for better to say if
you're<00:02:36.360> building<00:02:36.750> up<00:02:36.840> on<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.170> water<00:02:37.350> channels

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
you're building up on the water channels

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.690 
you're building up on the water channels
those<00:02:38.340> are<00:02:38.640> 10<00:02:38.910> land<00:02:39.270> so<00:02:39.510> 10<00:02:40.260> lakhs<00:02:40.530> or<00:02:40.860> 12

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
those are 10 land so 10 lakhs or 12

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.290 
those are 10 land so 10 lakhs or 12
depends<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.510> from<00:02:43.110> where<00:02:43.320> you're<00:02:43.500> going<00:02:43.950> so

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
depends on from where you're going so

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.810 
depends on from where you're going so
next<00:02:45.300> thing<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.200> hang<00:02:46.410> up<00:02:46.530> your<00:02:46.590> cows<00:02:47.040> like

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
next thing you hang up your cows like

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.360 
next thing you hang up your cows like
that<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.660> would<00:02:49.380> recommend<00:02:49.680> just<00:02:49.980> having<00:02:50.250> them

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
that I would recommend just having them

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.420 
that I would recommend just having them
stand<00:02:50.610> down<00:02:51.030> here<00:02:51.360> take<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.110> leash<00:02:52.440> pull<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.130> and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
stand down here take a leash pull up and

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.000 
stand down here take a leash pull up and
put<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.270> that<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.140> don't<00:02:55.500> have<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.830> do<00:02:55.980> that

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
put on that so you don't have to do that

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.090 
put on that so you don't have to do that
very<00:02:56.730> often<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.420> once<00:02:57.690> or<00:02:57.990> maybe<00:02:58.380> if<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.740> fly

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
very often just once or maybe if you fly

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.640 
very often just once or maybe if you fly
through<00:02:59.370> there<00:02:59.700> it's<00:03:00.180> like<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.630> hat<00:03:01.200> maybe

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
through there it's like a hat maybe

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.130 
through there it's like a hat maybe
you'll<00:03:01.920> kill<00:03:02.220> one<00:03:02.490> but<00:03:03.120> doesn't<00:03:04.110> really

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
you'll kill one but doesn't really

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.440 
you'll kill one but doesn't really
happen<00:03:04.560> normally<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:07.010> basically<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.730> it

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
happen normally so basically that is it

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.430 
happen normally so basically that is it
for<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.960> cows<00:03:10.230> now<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.980> will<00:03:11.670> go<00:03:11.970> into<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.690> free

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
for the cows now I will go into the free

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.840 
for the cows now I will go into the free
that<00:03:13.650> down<00:03:13.860> there<00:03:15.800> now<00:03:16.800> this<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.190> actually<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
that down there now this is actually the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.960 
that down there now this is actually the
breeder<00:03:18.330> you'll<00:03:18.570> see<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.470> um<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:20.130> just<00:03:20.430> build<00:03:20.850> it

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
breeder you'll see so um I just build it

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.830 
breeder you'll see so um I just build it
once<00:03:21.240> again<00:03:21.540> right<00:03:21.840> here<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:23.150> I'll<00:03:24.150> just<00:03:24.540> go

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
once again right here and I'll just go

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.620 
once again right here and I'll just go
through<00:03:25.290> how<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.680> works<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.370> let<00:03:27.360> me<00:03:27.450> just

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
through how it works so let me just

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.560 
through how it works so let me just
owning<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.650> cow<00:03:29.070> here<00:03:29.520> once<00:03:30.000> again<00:03:30.150> to

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
owning a cow here once again to

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.590 
owning a cow here once again to
demonstrate<00:03:31.100> what<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.820> whole<00:03:33.030> thing<00:03:33.420> is

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
demonstrate what the whole thing is

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.010 
demonstrate what the whole thing is
doing<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.410> um<00:03:34.830> we<00:03:35.400> hit<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.670> button<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.660> lights

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
doing so um we hit the button it lights

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.720 
doing so um we hit the button it lights
up<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.350> cow<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.850> will<00:03:38.850> crush<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:40.730> now

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
up the cow and will crush it and now

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.630 
up the cow and will crush it and now
died<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.570> also<00:03:43.170> added<00:03:43.500> in<00:03:43.709> some<00:03:43.739> hoppers<00:03:44.340> here

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
died I also added in some hoppers here

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.140 
died I also added in some hoppers here
and<00:03:45.770> we<00:03:46.770> got<00:03:46.950> some<00:03:47.130> meat<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.310> here<00:03:47.550> also<00:03:47.820> this

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
and we got some meat in here also this

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.360 
and we got some meat in here also this
has<00:03:48.480> obviously<00:03:48.750> not<00:03:49.410> been<00:03:49.620> from<00:03:49.830> this<00:03:50.040> one

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
has obviously not been from this one

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.900 
has obviously not been from this one
single<00:03:50.910> cow<00:03:51.120> but<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:52.050> get<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.290> idea<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:53.130> mmm

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
single cow but you get the idea so mmm

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.510 
single cow but you get the idea so mmm
how<00:03:54.300> does<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.810> work<00:03:55.500> you're<00:03:56.280> probably

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
how does that work you're probably

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.120 
how does that work you're probably
asking<00:03:56.820> yourself<00:03:57.330> now<00:03:57.420> well<00:03:58.200> it's<00:03:58.800> pretty

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
asking yourself now well it's pretty

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.300 
asking yourself now well it's pretty
simple<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.670> just<00:04:00.180> have<00:04:01.140> rats<00:04:01.470> on<00:04:01.739> line<00:04:02.070> behind

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
simple you just have rats on line behind

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.180 
simple you just have rats on line behind
that<00:04:02.550> button<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.510> goes<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.530> repeater<00:04:04.920> this

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
that button it goes to a repeater this

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.490 
that button it goes to a repeater this
way<00:04:05.370> into<00:04:05.700> repeated<00:04:06.180> us<00:04:06.330> that<00:04:06.780> way<00:04:06.989> so<00:04:07.050> we'll

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
way into repeated us that way so we'll

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.550 
way into repeated us that way so we'll
serve<00:04:07.800> with<00:04:08.070> this<00:04:08.310> one<00:04:08.580> which<00:04:09.360> powers<00:04:09.810> block

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
serve with this one which powers block

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.979 
serve with this one which powers block
for<00:04:11.459> torch<00:04:11.730> on<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.239> whenever<00:04:12.450> we<00:04:12.810> hit<00:04:12.959> that

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
for torch on and whenever we hit that

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.240 
for torch on and whenever we hit that
button<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:14.370> actually<00:04:15.209> unpause<00:04:16.080> or<00:04:16.380> turns<00:04:16.950> that

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
button it actually unpause or turns that

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.449 
button it actually unpause or turns that
one<00:04:17.489> off<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:18.690> one<00:04:18.900> on<00:04:19.080> which<00:04:19.980> will<00:04:20.220> go<00:04:20.400> to

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
one off and this one on which will go to

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.850 
one off and this one on which will go to
redstone<00:04:21.000> line<00:04:21.359> right<00:04:21.660> here<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.680> this

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
redstone line right here to this

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.980 
redstone line right here to this
dispenser<00:04:23.310> now

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
dispenser now

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.770 
dispenser now
in<00:04:24.560> that<00:04:24.949> dispenser<00:04:25.610> we<00:04:25.759> got<00:04:25.940> flint<00:04:26.419> and<00:04:26.569> steel

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
in that dispenser we got flint and steel

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.010 
in that dispenser we got flint and steel
to<00:04:27.410> light<00:04:27.680> up<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:27.979> cows<00:04:28.190> so<00:04:28.639> that's<00:04:29.509> the<00:04:29.780> first

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
to light up the cows so that's the first

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.070 
to light up the cows so that's the first
mystery<00:04:30.830> which<00:04:31.520> we<00:04:31.940> already<00:04:32.180> saw<00:04:32.630> fright<00:04:32.930> now

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
mystery which we already saw fright now

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.430 
mystery which we already saw fright now
so<00:04:33.349> we'll<00:04:34.310> get<00:04:34.550> to<00:04:34.729> another<00:04:35.030> repeater<00:04:35.509> i'll

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
so we'll get to another repeater i'll

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.770 
so we'll get to another repeater i'll
let<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:36.770> have<00:04:36.889> another<00:04:37.250> look<00:04:37.430> on<00:04:37.639> that<00:04:37.819> yeah

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
let you have another look on that yeah

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.950 
let you have another look on that yeah
actually<00:04:39.229> enough<00:04:39.680> so<00:04:40.009> um<00:04:40.460> next<00:04:41.300> repeater<00:04:41.720> on

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
actually enough so um next repeater on

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.260 
actually enough so um next repeater on
the<00:04:42.139> last<00:04:42.349> setting<00:04:42.830> here<00:04:43.069> goes<00:04:43.669> into<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.030> block

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
the last setting here goes into a block

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.689 
the last setting here goes into a block
with<00:04:44.539> a<00:04:44.569> red<00:04:44.840> support<00:04:45.319> here<00:04:45.560> which<00:04:45.889> was<00:04:46.400> the

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
with a red support here which was the

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.110 
with a red support here which was the
signal<00:04:47.240> and<00:04:47.770> I'm<00:04:48.770> going<00:04:49.039> pretty<00:04:49.550> fast<00:04:49.849> here

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
signal and I'm going pretty fast here

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.020 
signal and I'm going pretty fast here
but<00:04:50.330> I<00:04:50.419> think<00:04:50.449> you<00:04:50.780> know<00:04:51.050> what<00:04:51.229> I<00:04:51.259> mean<00:04:51.880> then<00:04:52.880> we

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
but I think you know what I mean then we

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.600 
but I think you know what I mean then we
got<00:04:53.210> redstone<00:04:53.690> line<00:04:53.900> running<00:04:54.259> up<00:04:54.470> here<00:04:54.650> going

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
got redstone line running up here going

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.600 
got redstone line running up here going
into<00:04:55.789> this<00:04:56.120> this<00:04:56.389> this<00:04:56.960> repeater<00:04:57.470> here<00:04:57.620> also

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
into this this this repeater here also

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.899 
into this this this repeater here also
on<00:04:58.729> last<00:04:59.030> adding<00:04:59.569> and<00:05:00.470> we<00:05:00.889> got<00:05:01.039> some<00:05:01.250> sticky

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
on last adding and we got some sticky

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.029 
on last adding and we got some sticky
pistons<00:05:02.270> right<00:05:02.479> in<00:05:02.599> front<00:05:02.750> of<00:05:02.840> that<00:05:03.050> which<00:05:03.710> is

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
pistons right in front of that which is

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.469 
pistons right in front of that which is
our<00:05:04.550> crusher<00:05:05.060> so<00:05:05.569> if<00:05:06.409> we<00:05:06.470> hit<00:05:06.710> it<00:05:06.770> again<00:05:07.479> it

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
our crusher so if we hit it again it

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.730 
our crusher so if we hit it again it
just<00:05:08.539> um<00:05:09.310> past<00:05:10.310> those<00:05:10.669> two<00:05:11.120> now<00:05:11.840> that's

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
just um past those two now that's

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.779 
just um past those two now that's
basically<00:05:13.430> it<00:05:13.550> now<00:05:14.139> why<00:05:15.139> do<00:05:15.620> we<00:05:15.770> use<00:05:15.800> laughs<00:05:16.370> so

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
basically it now why do we use laughs so

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.680 
basically it now why do we use laughs so
yeah<00:05:17.509> it<00:05:17.750> just<00:05:18.020> burns<00:05:18.530> and<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:19.759> gives<00:05:20.090> it<00:05:20.389> in

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
yeah it just burns and it gives it in

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.140 
yeah it just burns and it gives it in
some<00:05:21.259> more<00:05:21.289> damage<00:05:21.949> here<00:05:22.190> so<00:05:22.550> that<00:05:22.909> you

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
some more damage here so that you

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.420 
some more damage here so that you
actually<00:05:23.630> have<00:05:24.259> cooked<00:05:24.620> meat<00:05:24.919> in<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.310> end

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
actually have cooked meat in the end

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.290 
actually have cooked meat in the end
zone<00:05:25.520> map<00:05:26.150> cows<00:05:26.569> die<00:05:27.020> when<00:05:27.319> they<00:05:27.349> burn<00:05:27.770> now<00:05:28.669> the

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
zone map cows die when they burn now the

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.529 
zone map cows die when they burn now the
hoppers<00:05:29.479> only<00:05:30.440> thing<00:05:30.710> you<00:05:30.860> gotta<00:05:31.099> just<00:05:31.539> pay

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
hoppers only thing you gotta just pay

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.510 
hoppers only thing you gotta just pay
attention<00:05:32.659> to<00:05:33.139> is<00:05:33.289> that<00:05:33.500> you<00:05:33.889> connect<00:05:34.280> them<00:05:34.370> in

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
attention to is that you connect them in

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.959 
attention to is that you connect them in
the<00:05:34.610> right<00:05:34.789> way<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:35.530> they<00:05:36.530> have<00:05:36.710> to<00:05:36.860> face<00:05:37.130> each

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:37.969 
the right way so they have to face each

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:39.730 
the right way so they have to face each
other<00:05:38.180> a<00:05:38.360> little<00:05:38.570> bit<00:05:38.719> I'll<00:05:38.900> just<00:05:39.199> dig<00:05:39.590> out

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
other a little bit I'll just dig out

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.520 
other a little bit I'll just dig out
that<00:05:39.770> so<00:05:40.520> we<00:05:40.580> can<00:05:40.759> see<00:05:41.000> mcnair<00:05:41.719> and<00:05:41.990> here

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
that so we can see mcnair and here

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.310 
that so we can see mcnair and here
that's<00:05:43.280> gonna<00:05:43.460> be<00:05:43.520> the<00:05:43.729> case<00:05:43.759> so<00:05:44.180> I<00:05:44.509> learn<00:05:44.990> that

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
that's gonna be the case so I learn that

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.950 
that's gonna be the case so I learn that
it's<00:05:45.770> pretty<00:05:46.159> simple<00:05:46.460> I<00:05:46.789> think<00:05:47.389> you<00:05:47.509> can<00:05:47.719> build

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
it's pretty simple I think you can build

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.020 
it's pretty simple I think you can build
that<00:05:48.280> once<00:05:49.280> again<00:05:49.460> I<00:05:49.520> might<00:05:49.849> show<00:05:50.180> you<00:05:52.030> that

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
that once again I might show you that

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.939 
that once again I might show you that
they<00:05:53.240> fall<00:05:53.599> down<00:05:53.870> into<00:05:54.319> you<00:05:54.440> from<00:05:54.620> water

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
they fall down into you from water

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.080 
they fall down into you from water
channels<00:05:55.400> which<00:05:56.180> you<00:05:56.419> don't<00:05:56.569> know<00:05:57.490> you<00:05:58.490> may<00:05:58.669> be

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
channels which you don't know you may be

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.740 
channels which you don't know you may be
don't<00:05:59.360> know<00:05:59.569> but<00:05:59.780> probably<00:06:00.050> you<00:06:01.039> will<00:06:01.250> um<00:06:01.750> so

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
don't know but probably you will um so

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.770 
don't know but probably you will um so
this<00:06:03.560> is<00:06:03.710> the<00:06:03.860> water<00:06:04.099> channel<00:06:04.610> it<00:06:04.759> goes<00:06:05.449> a

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
this is the water channel it goes a

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.339 
this is the water channel it goes a
blocks<00:06:06.319> whoops<00:06:06.740> flow<00:06:07.430> a<00:06:07.729> fluent<00:06:08.360> cow<00:06:08.750> down<00:06:08.990> and

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
blocks whoops flow a fluent cow down and

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.370 
blocks whoops flow a fluent cow down and
up<00:06:09.560> there<00:06:09.800> so<00:06:10.039> anyway<00:06:10.400> it<00:06:11.210> goes<00:06:11.419> on<00:06:11.750> foot<00:06:11.900> here

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
up there so anyway it goes on foot here

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.950 
up there so anyway it goes on foot here
so<00:06:12.770> those<00:06:13.639> are<00:06:13.669> eight<00:06:14.000> blocks<00:06:14.240> and<00:06:14.599> then<00:06:14.810> you

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
so those are eight blocks and then you

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.110 
so those are eight blocks and then you
dig<00:06:15.169> down<00:06:15.349> this<00:06:15.590> one<00:06:15.800> dick<00:06:16.490> down<00:06:16.669> another<00:06:16.940> one
