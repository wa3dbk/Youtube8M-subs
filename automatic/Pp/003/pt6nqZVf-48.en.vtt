00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.190
 well, it happens that one of the 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.580
 The most impressive themes are when 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.280
 one asks a human being what 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.070
 you move yourself then a 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.439
 person is surprised and says how in what 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.730
 environment tell me a little how is your 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.550
 environment in your home 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.039
 and the person starts trying to put 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.029
 in his words what is his environment 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.759
 of the home but remember that from very 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.610
 Very young girls told us tell me with 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.440
 who are you and I will tell you who you are in the 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.350
 home one are more or less careful 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.400
 because obviously normal mom and dad 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.400
 is that what you are telling me generous 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.400
 that are loving but sometimes one does not 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.510
 find the same energy or disposition 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.190
 between the brothers 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.289
 Sometimes there is a lot of competition between 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.199
 brothers or that in an average home 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.570
 a very loving home you receive love from 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.430
 mom dad and brothers but there are homes 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.789
 where dad and mom get that love 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.530
 but among the brothers there are sometimes 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:10.010
 counterpoint discomfort 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.280
 and it happens that a child begins to form his 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.409
 self-acceptance his image that he thinks of 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.080
 himself or herself is from those 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.700
 from those early stages then 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.369
 tell me who you are with and I'll tell you who 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.080
 you are many times a fighting person 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.600
 combative is that he had brothers 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.190
 combative tell me who are you with 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.940
 my brothers and if they are combative 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.670
 they end up in a confrontational attitude 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.259
 of counterpoint at all times with life or 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.910
 be that one does not have to leave the 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:43.580
 house to become who you are 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:47.600
 Many years ago, not many, some 15 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.810
 or 20 years an American architect and 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.899
 also great philosopher of life the lord 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.420
 christopher alexander wrote several 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.929
 books where he said when one observes 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.530
 a city or a town one sees in the 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.590
 architecture that there are certain molds like 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.630
 things that are repeated the way they are 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.570
 sidewalks built 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.270
 if there is a small park the little park 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.790
 environment has what kind of people 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.000
 they inhabit that park or they pass it by 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.390
 where is the restaurant or where 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.940
 it is if the church has the town where 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.550
 are the public services there or not 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.770
 there are trees then one starts to look 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.680
 from the small towns and villages 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.350
 even the big cities like things 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.020
 repetitive that one begins to see and what 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.050
 curious step has been said 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.120
 each city has its own feeling 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.400
 when you go to caracas 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.200
 caracas-venezuela a city that i love 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.810
 deeply also because I have 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.570
 great friends there not only at the level 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.640
 personal friends of the soul but also 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.820
 colleagues in the oil industry who 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.540
 we have the possibility to accompany your 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:06.380
 Once you're in a poor neighborhood, 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.480
 painted with bright colors are beautiful 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.950
 then you study what is this so 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.640
 curious 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.670
 there is a soul to color 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.430
 life even if we do not have the neighborhood anymore 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.489
 rich 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.010
 and one says here there is something powerful here 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.689
 there is a pattern the soul of the people are 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.879
 is still manifesting in architecture 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:33.849
 Now you go to other cities and you will notice 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:38.579
 example that the dominant color is the 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:40.989
 adobe color the cooked mud color 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.379
 then you say this city is rather 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:48.310
 reddish there are other cities that like 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.639
 much to cover the let's say the facades of 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.909
 buildings and houses in other ways 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:58.480
 everything is giving us a hint of 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:01.870
 what is it that brings the collective soul of 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.090
 that city this is of importance 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.209
 tremendous because christopher alexander 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:12.590
 one of the things he said was in his 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:15.650
 observations of life is is tremendous 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.780
 the only environment is conditioning the 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.450
 people to be more somber or happier 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.620
 the single environment makes people be 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.660
 more expressive or more reserved and when 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.810
 a person is going to live in another city 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.139
 note that there is a change of environment not 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.990
 only physical not only cement not only 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:41.980
 of avenues and trees but the way 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.290
 of being of the people this led us to 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.380
 a very important study that started it 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.800
 Some time ago, TomÃ¡s Leonardi, one of my 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.960
 teachers and one of the promoters of the 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.870
 modern coaching and then followed by 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.090
 dave back 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.470
 there is something that is very important and we are going to 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.780
 keep in mind and I want you to put it 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.990
 in your heart be very careful 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:08.770
 environment always wins 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.780
 as well the environment is so powerful that 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.910
 unless one has very clear things 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.960
 in his heart it is very likely that the 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.540
 modify it to one and we have 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.630
 to be very clear about what kind of 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.820
 environments are we going to allow 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.250
 surround us because that environment is going to 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.500
 end up winning over our spirits the 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.810
 environment can crush them or you can 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.430
 help us get ahead and that's what 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.430
 let's see in the next segment
