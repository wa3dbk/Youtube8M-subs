I<00:00:00.089> was<00:00:00.539> thinking<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:00.930> lot<00:00:01.050> about<00:00:01.110> no<00:00:01.650> man's<00:00:01.920> sky

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
it looks gorgeous and the idea of

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.410 
it looks gorgeous and the idea of
exploring<00:00:04.500> billions<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.310> planets<00:00:05.490> sounds

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
exploring billions of planets sounds

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.810 
exploring billions of planets sounds
awesome<00:00:06.720> but<00:00:07.200> what's<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.069> point<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.700> this

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
awesome but what's the point to this

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.290 
awesome but what's the point to this
game

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
game

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.330 
game
apparently<00:00:10.260> it's<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.620> reach<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.980> center<00:00:11.250> of

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
apparently it's to reach the center of

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.850 
apparently it's to reach the center of
the<00:00:11.429> galaxy<00:00:11.580> but<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.840> an<00:00:12.990> arbitrary<00:00:13.530> goal

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
the galaxy but is that an arbitrary goal

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.039 
the galaxy but is that an arbitrary goal
is<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.460> even<00:00:14.700> possible<00:00:15.000> with<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.570> galaxy

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
is that even possible with the galaxy

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.680 
is that even possible with the galaxy
being<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.500> big<00:00:16.800> will<00:00:17.640> players<00:00:18.029> be<00:00:18.180> able<00:00:18.359> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
being so big will players be able to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.150 
being so big will players be able to
make<00:00:19.170> their<00:00:19.470> own<00:00:19.500> fun<00:00:24.560> let's<00:00:25.560> say<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.800> can

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
make their own fun let's say you can

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.560 
make their own fun let's say you can
reach<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> center<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.880> galaxy<00:00:27.000> because

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
reach the center of the galaxy because

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.480 
reach the center of the galaxy because
that's<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.349> they<00:00:28.439> say<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.830> goal<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.369> we

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that's what they say the goal is so we

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.130 
that's what they say the goal is so we
can<00:00:29.609> assume<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.359> possible

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
can assume that it is possible

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.049 
can assume that it is possible
well<00:00:31.380> users<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:31.920> more<00:00:32.160> fun<00:00:32.430> exploring<00:00:32.969> the

well users have more fun exploring the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.670 
well users have more fun exploring the
world<00:00:33.300> than<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:33.690> would<00:00:33.899> completing<00:00:34.590> the

goal defined by the game this is

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.240 
goal defined by the game this is
something<00:00:37.140> hello<00:00:37.350> game<00:00:37.620> certainly<00:00:37.920> hopes

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
something hello game certainly hopes

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.950 
something hello game certainly hopes
there's<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.820> limitless<00:00:39.180> amount<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.570> exploring

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
there's a limitless amount of exploring

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.270 
there's a limitless amount of exploring
to<00:00:40.020> be<00:00:40.110> done<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.530> could<00:00:40.739> potentially<00:00:41.010> be

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
to be done so you could potentially be

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.860 
to be done so you could potentially be
playing<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.670> game<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.149> years<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.629> years

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
playing this game for years and years

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.770 
playing this game for years and years
this<00:00:43.620> got<00:00:43.860> me<00:00:44.010> thinking<00:00:44.040> what<00:00:44.940> other<00:00:45.120> games

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
this got me thinking what other games

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.529 
this got me thinking what other games
don't<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.559> point<00:00:46.950> or<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:48.000> other<00:00:48.180> games

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
don't have a point or what other games

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.840 
don't have a point or what other games
are<00:00:48.780> more<00:00:48.960> fun<00:00:49.320> when<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.649> ignore<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.579> goal

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
are more fun when you ignore the goal

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.270 
are more fun when you ignore the goal
that<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> game<00:00:51.539> defines<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.680> for

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that the game defines for you for

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.279 
that the game defines for you for
example<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.239> Grand<00:00:54.480> Theft<00:00:54.629> Auto<00:00:54.809> games<00:00:55.140> have

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
example the Grand Theft Auto games have

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.840 
example the Grand Theft Auto games have
a<00:00:55.379> main<00:00:55.559> story<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> personally<00:00:56.460> didn't
