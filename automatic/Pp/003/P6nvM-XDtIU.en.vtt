00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello to all friends and they are klaus and they are 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.359
 today returned with this new one 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.550
 video fita we are back after a couple of 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.650
 weeks with the road to drink team 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.929
 for those who didn't know what a series is about 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.009
 fifa where exactly a large car is a 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.929
 I think only the strong player 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.119
 or ronaldo all the others are i 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.949
 bronzini that we will then replace 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.660
 with time, in fact, in the last he saw 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.070
 we did a lot and based on the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.140
 score we did we have 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.820
 accumulated a budget that was about one 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.650
 million and the use of that million 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.900
 in fact you have chosen I have done 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.140
 choose between those who buy age cross the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.030
 fesr benzema SEAF and benzema doing the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.040
 double the votes in the comments then 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.110
 here it was, I bought benzema assif 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.250
 which is a very good attacker I already have 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.840
 tried a few times 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.520
 in this video every goal we will make 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.350
 will be worth 30,000 credits if instead 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.260
 let's make a special goal or at least a 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.510
 goal from distance launches 60,000 and finally in 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.250
 case of victory and more than 10 thousand and if then 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.180
 here we have another 30 thousand 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.449
 so let's look for ours immediately 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.449
 opponent 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.359
 here then obviously the opponent we have 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.729
 I spent half an hour finding it, I swear to you 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:16.649
 is doing so much time at one 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.189
 so random bracket similar to 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.979
 our 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.600
 hopefully having his ass because he had to 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.969
 do the many of those goals to buy 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.549
 I do not know another ronaldo is my first 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.920
 game of the day so if I play badly 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.200
 it is not because I am scarce but because I am 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.049
 primary of the day then online 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.049
 we have benzema karim benzema 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:49.500
 reality or I saw you romy ronnie go 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.509
 go on go ronnie va and ronnie o 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.439
 this lag is what st wright 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:00.360
 no no no no no no no no no no no 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:04.319
 what is this lager no boys 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.659
 no no so no, but what was that lager from 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:11.180
 yara goldberg 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:18.780
 but so he cannot flood, but he is dyer karim 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:23.069
 karim oe I do not see pulling is now pulling the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.640
 fuck i know or pull or goal with 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.150
 on the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.150
 com 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.600
 it also stops the karim benzema lag 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.569
 Thus begins his career in ours 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.020
 road to dream team 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.850
 viber nova kronig kronig please for 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.850
 please please 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.020
 ronaldo this is not a good sign I think 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.600
 purchased is not the connection is 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.560
 purchased because I was a zero 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:05.840
 so now we're going to do another 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.320
 found the found rega after 24 hours ha 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.530
 found the game rega I swear you stop 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.140
 fuck, but everyone bugged gives us you 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.810
 I swear a day has passed has not found 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.319
 no other game and let's have the ball 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.319
 benzema 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.340
 to 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:36.280
 provence 66 or go like that with the one two 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:42.980
 paia ronaldo vai and ronaldo ronnie ronnie 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:44.870
 ronnie is not like that and we go and go 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.500
 so with the first goal in the tenth minute 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:57.310
 hopefully not so oh my God 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:04:01.070
 together benzema karim and let's go e 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.170
 let's go and let's go though if we go 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.570
 if we play twitters like blue fats 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.540
 where we are already two goals we try to do 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.060
 some goals a little more articulated 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:16.880
 or maybe a little more like Eurogol or these 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:20.320
 things here and mary that my mom that 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.320
 defenders we have 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.650
 oh my God, why another ronaldo then 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.380
 the upside is that this is too easy 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.570
 but it is so too part 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.260
 three to zero at the twentieth minute 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.980
 this here this not fifth here is a 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.740
 man and a man and we do it makes a goal 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.480
 we want to make him a goal 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.210
 no it is no however it is an important thing 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.820
 that I finally learned there is peter 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.320
 I improved the way of defense because 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.890
 you ca n't defend yourself first 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:01.750
 now but don't be a little bit for 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:04.120
 to defend as not said to berica 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:12.250
 three shawl to a shawl ie it smells 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:14.740
 empire he no longer touches the ball or 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.330
 I told you I didn't touch you ball 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.270
 said he doesn't touch them ball though 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:25.690
 said friend you are 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:30.220
 here is rigor here but so it goes look I would like 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:32.140
 find it we pull with pull with wind e 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:38.290
 that to 39 of shooting 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:41.270
 let's try it from the so much random era 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:49.910
 ready random radio 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:55.550
 when therefore 41 or 46 a role however 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:06:02.650
 to the goals of god my god 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:04.880
 fuck that goal cross leads my mom 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:09.050

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.430
 gentlemen that ronaldo's goals this applies 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.820
 twice 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:17.240
 the beauty is that out of the way then v 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.520

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.490
 boy and not let go is it means that 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.310
 we have to do another goal, though, it's fucking 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:29.060
 to red and red red by the referee 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:34.880
 so here I am 11 how many meters am I 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:37.490
 to put sticazzi on we pull a lot of 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.160
 so bad call we make goals 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:43.640
 okay the direction there was maybe 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:49.180
 reduced by a stronger coat but does not 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:54.410
 nothing because the goal was a sin 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:56.750

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.030
 is over here the game we say that 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.730

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.200
 cassarÃ  vo maybe we win 51 but there 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:22.010
