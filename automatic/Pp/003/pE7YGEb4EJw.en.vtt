the<00:00:00.810> science<00:00:01.199> behind<00:00:01.310> airbags<00:00:04.460> ever<00:00:05.460> since

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
the science behind airbags ever since

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.820 
the science behind airbags ever since
the<00:00:05.970> airbags<00:00:06.359> were<00:00:06.569> created<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.319> added<00:00:07.560> to

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
the airbags were created and added to

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.280 
the airbags were created and added to
cars<00:00:08.160> with<00:00:08.460> seatbelts<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.719> death<00:00:09.960> rate<00:00:10.260> has

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
cars with seatbelts the death rate has

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.680 
cars with seatbelts the death rate has
decreased<00:00:11.599> 24%

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.750 

so<00:00:15.690> now<00:00:15.870> let's<00:00:16.260> say<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.529> get<00:00:16.770> into<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> terrible

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
so now let's say you get into a terrible

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.630 
so now let's say you get into a terrible
giant<00:00:18.360> crash<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.590> only<00:00:19.800> takes<00:00:20.130> 40

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
giant crash it only takes 40

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.190 
giant crash it only takes 40
milliseconds<00:00:20.970> for<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> airbag<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.320> deploy

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
milliseconds for the airbag to deploy

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.720 
milliseconds for the airbag to deploy
now<00:00:25.200> let's<00:00:25.500> take<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> different<00:00:25.920> look<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.520> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
now let's take a different look in the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.990 
now let's take a different look in the
steering<00:00:27.119> wheel<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.540> as<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.740> see<00:00:29.000> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
steering wheel and as you can see the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.920 
steering wheel and as you can see the
steering<00:00:30.330> wheel<00:00:30.480> consists<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:31.890> airbag

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
steering wheel consists of one airbag

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.460 
steering wheel consists of one airbag
filled<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:34.079> nitrogen<00:00:35.630> to<00:00:36.630> crash<00:00:36.899> sensors

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
filled with nitrogen to crash sensors

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.850 
filled with nitrogen to crash sensors
and<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:38.489> inflator<00:00:39.380> during<00:00:40.380> those<00:00:40.500> forty

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and one inflator during those forty

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.950 
and one inflator during those forty
milliseconds<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.880> crash<00:00:42.300> sensor<00:00:42.660> sends

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
milliseconds the crash sensor sends

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.500 
milliseconds the crash sensor sends
crash<00:00:43.440> sends<00:00:44.130> an<00:00:44.250> electrical<00:00:44.760> shock<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
crash sends an electrical shock to the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.200 
crash sends an electrical shock to the
inflator<00:00:46.020> which<00:00:46.320> inflates<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> airbag<00:00:47.210> so

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
inflator which inflates the airbag so

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.450 
inflator which inflates the airbag so
now<00:00:48.390> who<00:00:48.719> invented<00:00:49.199> this<00:00:49.350> awesome<00:00:49.890> idea<00:00:50.010> of

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
