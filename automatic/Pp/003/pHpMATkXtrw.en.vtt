00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello to you are very welcome for one more 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.859
 victim the lesser wilson cardoso this is a 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.650
 home math channel 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.130
 Today I 'm going to teach you to understand a 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.160
 little about the scale of a 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.390
 framework for you to better understand scale 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.760
 equal length in the drawing on the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.359
 real 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:32.120
 there are three types of scales 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:01:16.530
 natural can be represented by is sc 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:01:31.079
 can be written by actual size or 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:39.350
 so be it in the drawing 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:43.770
 it means that the actual size 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:54.210
 but when an object is too small 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:02:00.220
 the scale of three 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:03.220
 that is a drawing 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.630
 full size 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:11.440
 for you to understand a little better batch 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:16.620
 30 meters long on the east plan 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.620
 north has three sense of length 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:03:00.360
 was the scale used is equal to equal years 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.910
 33 thousand divided by them 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.910
 therefore the scale used 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.489
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.620
 lesson and peace the gentleness of channel 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:22.110
 Thank you very much 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.110
 AndrÃ© is in the arm and until the next
