00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and stop harder after cyclic inputs it

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.930 
and stop harder after cyclic inputs it
also<00:00:34.410> makes<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> helicopter<00:00:35.219> more<00:00:35.399> stable<00:00:35.820> in

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.470 
increased the tail will be more
aggressive<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.040> following<00:02:20.730> your<00:02:21.060> inputs

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
aggressive and following your inputs

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.990 
aggressive and following your inputs
when<00:02:21.630> moving<00:02:21.930> away<00:02:22.020> from<00:02:22.290> Center<00:02:22.740> as<00:02:22.980> well<00:02:23.940> as

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
when moving away from Center as well as

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.850 
when moving away from Center as well as
they'll<00:02:24.390> be<00:02:24.480> more<00:02:24.660> aggressive<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.260> stopping

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
they'll be more aggressive in stopping

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.650 
they'll be more aggressive in stopping
the<00:02:25.980> tail<00:02:26.190> when<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.730> return<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.450> rudder

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
the tail when you return the rudder

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.330 
the tail when you return the rudder
stick<00:02:27.900> back<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.380> center<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:28.980> makes<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
stick back to center so this makes the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.720 
stick back to center so this makes the
tail<00:02:29.550> stop<00:02:29.880> harder<00:02:30.330> when<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.750> tell<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.440> to

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
tail stop harder when you tell it to

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.150 
tail stop harder when you tell it to
however<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:34.080> tail<00:02:34.260> dynamic<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.770> too<00:02:34.980> high

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
however if the tail dynamic is too high

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.920 
however if the tail dynamic is too high
what<00:02:35.430> you'll<00:02:35.610> find<00:02:35.820> is<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.300> tail<00:02:36.720> will

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
what you'll find is that the tail will

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.600 
what you'll find is that the tail will
have<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.080> bounce<00:02:37.440> back<00:02:37.740> at<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.070> end<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.460> a

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
have a bounce back at the end of a

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.230 
have a bounce back at the end of a
pirouette<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.300> command<00:02:39.720> as<00:02:40.190> well<00:02:41.190> as<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.880> get

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
pirouette in command as well as you get

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.660 
pirouette in command as well as you get
into<00:02:42.360> switching<00:02:42.840> pier<00:02:43.650> wedding<00:02:43.950> maneuvers

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
into switching pier wedding maneuvers

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.250 
into switching pier wedding maneuvers
going<00:02:45.030> from<00:02:45.210> left<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.480> right<00:02:45.750> right<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.080> left

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
going from left to right right to left

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.540 
going from left to right right to left
you'll<00:02:46.650> find<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.070> tell<00:02:47.280> us<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.430> little

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
you'll find that the tell us a little

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.050 
you'll find that the tell us a little
bit<00:02:47.700> sponging<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.950> flip<00:02:50.190> side<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.460> that<00:02:50.640> if

bit sponging on the flip side of that if

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
the totemic is too low you'll find that

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.640 
the totemic is too low you'll find that
the<00:02:53.340> tail<00:02:53.550> is<00:02:53.760> imprecise<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.930> will<00:02:55.230> take<00:02:55.410> a
