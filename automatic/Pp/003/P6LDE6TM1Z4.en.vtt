00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
together until it's thick because this

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.970 
together until it's thick because this
is<00:02:37.769> what<00:02:37.950> you're<00:02:38.129> gonna<00:02:38.250> put<00:02:39.410> into<00:02:40.410> your<00:02:40.739> wet
