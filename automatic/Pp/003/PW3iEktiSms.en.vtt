screen the LCD isn't connected at the
moment<00:00:13.230> it's<00:00:13.710> happened<00:00:14.219> during<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.450> damaged

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
moment it's happened during the damaged

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.870 
moment it's happened during the damaged
screen<00:00:17.010> being<00:00:17.250> changed

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
screen being changed

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.519 
screen being changed
they<00:00:18.330> said<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> damaged<00:00:18.869> screen<00:00:19.199> on<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.470> you

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
they said the damaged screen on it you

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.040 
they said the damaged screen on it you
can<00:00:19.650> see<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> sort<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.130> cracks<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.760> there<00:00:21.060> but

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
can see the sort of cracks on there but

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.509 
can see the sort of cracks on there but
say<00:00:22.230> yeah<00:00:22.439> that's<00:00:22.650> when<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> damages

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
say yeah that's when the damages

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.420 
say yeah that's when the damages
happened<00:00:24.650> so<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:25.859> I'm<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.099> do<00:00:26.250> with

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
happened so what I'm going to do with

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.030 
happened so what I'm going to do with
this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:27.890> get<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.429> motherboard<00:00:30.000> disconnected

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
this is get the motherboard disconnected

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.190 
this is get the motherboard disconnected
so<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.430> access<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.200> then

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
so that we can get access to it then

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.700 
so that we can get access to it then
we'll<00:00:34.350> remove<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.610> connector<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.750> fitting

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
we'll remove this connector and fitting

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.190 
we'll remove this connector and fitting
you<00:00:37.829> what<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.520> for<00:00:39.059> moved<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
you what we have for moved on with the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.030 
you what we have for moved on with the
repair<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:41.160> we've<00:00:41.280> got<00:00:41.430> done<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:43.040> removing

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
repair what we've got done is removing

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.340 
repair what we've got done is removing
the<00:00:44.489> connector<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> remains<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the connector the remains of the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.310 
the connector the remains of the
connector<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.489> those<00:00:47.910> sort<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.020> you've

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
connector all those sort of here you've

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.650 
connector all those sort of here you've
got<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.760> contacts<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.030> parts<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> body

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
got the contacts and parts of the body

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.020 
got the contacts and parts of the body
of<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.739> connector<00:00:52.980> now<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.670> way<00:00:53.820> we've<00:00:54.000> done

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
of the connector now the way we've done

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.590 
of the connector now the way we've done
that<00:00:54.270> really<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.870> by<00:00:55.020> breaking<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.800> away<00:00:56.600> now

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
that really just by breaking it away now

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.840 
that really just by breaking it away now
the<00:00:57.660> reason<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.280> make<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> safe

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the reason we do that is to make it safe

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.410 
the reason we do that is to make it safe
for<00:01:00.239> all<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.680> solder<00:01:02.250> joints<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.180> path

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
for all the solder joints the path

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.380 
for all the solder joints the path
they're<00:01:03.780> still<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.729> suppose<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.180> little

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
they're still that suppose a little

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.539 
they're still that suppose a little
stress<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.080> them<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.409> possible<00:01:07.920> also<00:01:08.159> not

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
stress on them as possible also not

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.090 
stress on them as possible also not
using<00:01:08.970> heat<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.479> makes<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.840> safer<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
using heat so it makes it safer for the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.880 
using heat so it makes it safer for the
surrounding<00:01:11.580> areas<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> mainboard<00:01:12.890> but

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
surrounding areas of the mainboard but

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.030 
surrounding areas of the mainboard but
now<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.400> we<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.880> left<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:19.500> sort<00:01:19.979> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
now what we have left is the sort of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.990 
now what we have left is the sort of
remained<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:22.070> contacts<00:01:23.070> still<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.700> those

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
remained the contacts still on those

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.210 
remained the contacts still on those
solder<00:01:24.390> pads<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:27.439> on<00:01:28.439> D

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
solder pads so we're going to on D

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.210 
solder pads so we're going to on D
solder<00:01:29.640> make<00:01:30.570> sure<00:01:30.869> everything's<00:01:31.229> ok<00:01:31.770> then

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
solder make sure everything's ok then

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.550 
solder make sure everything's ok then
we'll<00:01:32.579> get<00:01:32.880> everything<00:01:33.360> tied<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
we'll get everything tied it up for a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.679 
we'll get everything tied it up for a
new<00:01:35.009> connector<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.790> soldered<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
new connector to be soldered it up and

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.499 
new connector to be soldered it up and
the<00:01:36.960> new<00:01:37.110> connector<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.390> can

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the new connector is going in as you can

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.270 
the new connector is going in as you can
see<00:01:39.659> we've<00:01:39.810> got<00:01:39.840> exactly<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.619> place<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.130> we've

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
see we've got exactly in place and we've

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.630 
see we've got exactly in place and we've
just<00:01:41.659> soldered<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.750> down<00:01:42.990> at<00:01:43.320> each<00:01:43.619> end<00:01:43.950> at<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
just soldered it down at each end at the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.940 
just soldered it down at each end at the
moment<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> keep<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.380> still<00:01:46.619> while<00:01:46.829> we

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
moment just to keep you still while we

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.069 
moment just to keep you still while we
saw<00:01:47.159> during<00:01:47.399> everything<00:01:48.060> else<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.659> why

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
saw during everything else know why

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.950 
saw during everything else know why
that's<00:01:49.229> exactly<00:01:49.439> what<00:01:49.829> I'm<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.960> now

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that's exactly what I'm going to do now

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.090 
that's exactly what I'm going to do now
the<00:01:52.020> way<00:01:52.170> we're<00:01:52.290> going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> do<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.829> by

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the way we're going to do it is by

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.540 
the way we're going to do it is by
soldiering<00:01:53.729> in

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
soldiering in

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.550 
soldiering in
we're<00:01:54.820> out<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:55.030> pennies<00:01:55.300> first<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:55.990> then<00:01:56.290> this

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
we're out of pennies first and then this

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.800 
we're out of pennies first and then this
row<00:01:56.890> once<00:01:57.610> that's<00:01:57.850> all<00:01:58.060> done<00:01:58.090> we'll

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
row once that's all done we'll

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.210 
row once that's all done we'll
reassemble<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.410> archive<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.890> get<00:02:00.040> totally

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
reassemble the archive and get totally

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.470 
reassemble the archive and get totally
where<00:02:00.550> we<00:02:00.820> have<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.540> first<00:02:02.080> side<00:02:03.270> solver<00:02:04.270> down

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
where we have the first side solver down

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.600 
where we have the first side solver down
all<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.110> Ferengi<00:02:05.740> can<00:02:05.980> see<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.160> difference

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
all the Ferengi can see the difference

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.440 
all the Ferengi can see the difference
in<00:02:06.820> them<00:02:07.000> now<00:02:07.830> with<00:02:08.830> all<00:02:09.520> those<00:02:09.760> good<00:02:10.090> strong

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
in them now with all those good strong

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.380 
in them now with all those good strong
solder<00:02:10.900> joints<00:02:11.200> there<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:12.550> turn<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.060> around

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.410 

see<00:02:17.010> contacts<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.280> none<00:02:18.550> of<00:02:18.580> our<00:02:18.820> solder<00:02:19.300> are

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
see contacts and none of our solder are

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.040 
see contacts and none of our solder are
all<00:02:20.140> pretty<00:02:20.440> much<00:02:20.620> waiting<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.970> be<00:02:22.150> fixed<00:02:22.900> in

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
all pretty much waiting to be fixed in

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.930 
all pretty much waiting to be fixed in
we'll<00:02:23.320> get<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.560> done<00:02:23.620> next<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.400> then<00:02:24.670> like

is gonna go down nice and flat in

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.190 
is gonna go down nice and flat in
exactly<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.890> right<00:02:51.040> place<00:02:51.430> which<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.200> so

yeah well it's a screen LCD screen which
is<00:03:13.540> been<00:03:14.260> served<00:03:14.620> by<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.890> connector<00:03:15.370> would

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
is been served by the connector would

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.030 
is been served by the connector would
just<00:03:15.730> solve<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.600> in<00:03:16.720> he<00:03:17.560> could<00:03:17.680> see<00:03:17.770> there's<00:03:17.950> no

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
just solve it in he could see there's no

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.680 
just solve it in he could see there's no
problems<00:03:18.430> with<00:03:18.550> it<00:03:18.610> at<00:03:18.760> all<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.330> what<00:03:19.570> we're

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
problems with it at all so what we're

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.300 
problems with it at all so what we're
going<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.840> do<00:03:19.989> now<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.410> just<00:03:20.620> stick<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.010> screen

testing we've got it connected to our
wireless<00:03:47.760> no<00:03:48.090> one<00:03:48.300> Kol<00:03:48.750> are<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:49.020> testing

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
wireless no one Kol are you testing

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
wireless no one Kol are you testing
these<00:03:50.280> cameras<00:03:51.090> as<00:03:51.420> well<00:03:51.450> as<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.190> rear-facing

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.050 

there<00:03:56.490> we<00:03:56.610> go

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
there we go

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.100 
there we go
so<00:03:57.630> that's<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.670> hold<00:03:59.670> up

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
so that's that hold up

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.740 
so that's that hold up
