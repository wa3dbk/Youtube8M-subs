00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
so the mission here is to get everything

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.490 
so the mission here is to get everything
up<00:01:16.890> off<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> floor<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.820> use<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.780> walls<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.320> lot

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
up off the floor and use the walls a lot

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.130 
up off the floor and use the walls a lot
and<00:01:19.799> then<00:01:20.220> use<00:01:20.490> smart<00:01:21.119> solutions<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.869> store

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and then use smart solutions to store

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.749 
and then use smart solutions to store
everything<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.189> everything's<00:01:23.490> got<00:01:23.640> its

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
everything so that everything's got its

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.429 
everything so that everything's got its
place<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.390> got<00:01:24.720> plenty<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.049> room<00:01:25.140> left<00:01:25.350> to

place and you got plenty of room left to
work<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.890> think<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.460> focus<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:27.000> any<00:01:27.150> working

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
work I think the focus of any working

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.350 
work I think the focus of any working
garage<00:01:28.049> space<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.280> work<00:01:29.490> surface<00:01:29.729> itself

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
things out of the way

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.620 
things out of the way
so<00:04:45.430> they<00:04:45.550> came<00:04:45.729> up<00:04:45.880> with<00:04:45.910> this<00:04:46.150> tire<00:04:46.360> rack

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
so they came up with this tire rack

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.960 
so they came up with this tire rack
system<00:04:47.080> but<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.830> idea<00:04:48.160> of<00:04:48.220> our<00:04:48.430> system<00:04:48.850> that

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
system but the idea of our system that

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.850 
system but the idea of our system that
is<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.210> telescope's<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.080> way<00:04:50.199> we<00:04:50.350> developed

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
is the telescope's the way we developed

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.100 
is the telescope's the way we developed
it<00:04:51.009> so<00:04:51.190> conversion<00:04:51.850> we<00:04:52.090> fit<00:04:52.270> any<00:04:52.449> wheel<00:04:52.810> or

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
it so conversion we fit any wheel or

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.960 
it so conversion we fit any wheel or
tire<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:53.710> wheel<00:04:53.919> combination

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
tire and wheel combination

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.460 
tire and wheel combination
certain<00:04:55.300> things<00:04:55.419> are<00:04:55.600> just<00:04:55.660> hard<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.110> store

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
certain things are just hard to store

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.980 
certain things are just hard to store
because<00:04:56.949> they're<00:04:57.160> a<00:04:57.190> weird<00:04:57.460> shape<00:04:57.960> take<00:04:58.960> a

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
because they're a weird shape take a

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.439 
because they're a weird shape take a
look<00:04:59.169> at<00:04:59.289> this<00:04:59.470> buffer<00:04:59.949> holder<00:05:00.310> if<00:05:01.030> you<00:05:01.150> spent

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
look at this buffer holder if you spent

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.600 
look at this buffer holder if you spent
time<00:05:01.660> polishing<00:05:02.349> cars<00:05:02.590> doing<00:05:02.949> detail<00:05:03.370> work

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
time polishing cars doing detail work

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.760 
time polishing cars doing detail work
you've<00:05:04.090> got<00:05:04.270> a<00:05:04.300> buffer<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:04.960> they<00:05:05.440> don't<00:05:05.590> fit

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
you've got a buffer and they don't fit

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.320 
you've got a buffer and they don't fit
in<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:05.889> toolbox<00:05:06.310> very<00:05:06.610> well<00:05:06.820> and<00:05:07.060> they've<00:05:07.150> got<00:05:07.300> a

in a toolbox very well and they've got a

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.779 
in a toolbox very well and they've got a
core<00:05:07.660> they're<00:05:07.930> kind<00:05:08.080> of<00:05:08.139> gangly<00:05:08.500> so<00:05:09.190> pit<00:05:09.610> pal

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
core they're kind of gangly so pit pal

the way there are certain tools that

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.279 
the way there are certain tools that
kind<00:05:31.210> of<00:05:31.330> go<00:05:31.449> together

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
kind of go together

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.379 
kind of go together
you'll<00:05:32.650> never<00:05:32.800> use<00:05:33.099> an<00:05:33.370> air<00:05:33.520> truck<00:05:33.849> unless<00:05:34.300> you

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
you'll never use an air truck unless you

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.360 
you'll never use an air truck unless you
have<00:05:34.510> an<00:05:34.599> air<00:05:34.750> hose<00:05:34.960> to<00:05:35.169> connect<00:05:35.440> it<00:05:35.560> to<00:05:35.710> so

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
have an air hose to connect it to so

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.860 
have an air hose to connect it to so
they<00:05:36.520> came<00:05:36.669> up<00:05:36.729> with<00:05:36.909> a<00:05:36.970> bracket<00:05:37.449> that<00:05:37.630> not

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
they came up with a bracket that not

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.080 
they came up with a bracket that not
only<00:05:37.990> keeps<00:05:38.320> your<00:05:38.500> air<00:05:38.710> hose<00:05:38.740> tidy<00:05:39.699> and<00:05:39.909> out<00:05:40.000> of

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
only keeps your air hose tidy and out of

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.370 
only keeps your air hose tidy and out of
the<00:05:40.150> way<00:05:40.270> but<00:05:40.510> it's<00:05:40.599> got<00:05:40.720> a<00:05:40.750> cool<00:05:40.960> little<00:05:41.050> slot

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
the way but it's got a cool little slot

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.710 
the way but it's got a cool little slot

it<00:07:38.569> took<00:07:38.690> to<00:07:38.750> flip<00:07:39.080> it<00:07:39.229> up<00:07:39.349> this<00:07:39.800> way<00:07:40.009> if<00:07:40.400> you

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:40.699 
it took to flip it up this way if you
