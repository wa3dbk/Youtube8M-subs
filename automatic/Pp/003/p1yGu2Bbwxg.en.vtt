00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.070
Rub 'n Restore® is a professional
waterborne system that allows you to

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.160
recolor leather and vinyl with a sponge.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.660
We will be changing this loveseat from
dark green to a beautiful tan.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.690
Let's begin by wiping the surface with a
cleaner like 409® or Greenworks® to remove

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.450
any loose dirt, grease, or oil. Exhaustive
cleaning is not necessary.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.730
That's what Rub 'n Restore® Color is for. We will be using a cellulose sponge to

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.260
apply the dye. Dampen the sponge with
water so that it doesn't drip when

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.600
squeezed. Keep a spray bottle of water
handy to periodically moisten the sponge.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.879
Thoroughly stir your Rub 'n Restore® Color until evenly dispersed.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.579
This can take up to two full minutes.
Pour a small amount of Rub 'n Restore®

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.559
Color directly onto your sponge or the
working surface. Spread it evenly across

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.249
the area, massaging into cracks and wrinkles. Notice how little dye we pour onto our sponge,

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.579
maybe a tablespoon at a time.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.480
Don't worry if Rub 'n Restore® Color looks streaky and transparent.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.940
The first layer is always the most work, because it primes the surface for the following coats of dye.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.800
Remember that many thin layers are
better than a few thick layers.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.960
If any coat of Rub 'n Restore® Color is applied too heavily, you may notice small cracks

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.500
form as the dye dries and cures. Thoroughly dry

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.580
each coat with a hair dryer before
applying another layer, but avoid getting

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.030
the surface too hot.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.939
The color will darken as it dries. It
will take several coats to do a dramatic

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.200
color change like this one. Second and
third layers will get better coverage

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.049
but may still look streaky or uneven. Any
additional coats should remedy this and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.179
leave you with a professional result.

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.070
You be the judge. Just let the entire
process be fast and easy

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.120
Don't spend too much time or use too
much

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.969
Rub 'n Restore®&nbsp;Color on any one area.

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.569
It took five coats of dye to color
change this sofa which is demonstrated

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.510
on this cushion. Surfaces with lots of wrinkles and folds, like this one, will use more

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.610
volume of Rub 'n Restore® Color.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.050
We did the tops and sides of the love seat with just under 8 oz. but we

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.740
did not dye the undersides of the
cushions or the back of the loveseat

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.690
which are not visible.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.730
We usually would recommend 16 oz. to

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.480
perform a dramatic color change such as this.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.790
However, using a color similar to your
surface will achieve the same great

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.160
results with far less volume of Rub 'n Restore® Color. For more luster and to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.410
deepen the color, you can apply our Clear Glosser. It also provides an extra layer

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.540
of protection from the elements.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.020
Apply it the same way, with a damp sponge, ideally the following day.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.680
Your surface is ready for use as soon as Rub 'n Restore® Color is dry.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.900
It will not rub off on clothing. Allow 48
hours for the dye to cure to its full strength.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.740
During this time avoid getting it wet, as water or other liquids will reactivate the dye.
