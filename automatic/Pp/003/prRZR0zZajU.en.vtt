00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.200 
today's first episode will be player
volts<00:00:12.690> by<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> DRT<00:00:13.620> shock<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.820> was<00:00:15.120> looking

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
volts by a DRT shock so I was looking

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.140 
volts by a DRT shock so I was looking
for<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> plug<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.680> replace<00:00:16.920> lwc<00:00:17.760> because<00:00:18.119> I

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
for a plug in to replace lwc because I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.580 
for a plug in to replace lwc because I
don't<00:00:18.449> want<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.750> too<00:00:18.900> much<00:00:19.020> storage<00:00:19.289> when

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
don't want to have too much storage when

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.140 
don't want to have too much storage when
it'll<00:00:19.770> WC<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.250> therefore<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> lot<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.760> inactive

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
it'll WC and therefore a lot of inactive

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.630 
it'll WC and therefore a lot of inactive
players<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:22.619> was<00:00:22.859> thinking<00:00:23.130> virtual

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
players and I was thinking virtual

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.519 
players and I was thinking virtual
chests<00:00:24.000> would<00:00:24.240> basically<00:00:24.600> accomplish<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
chests would basically accomplish the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.740 
chests would basically accomplish the
exact<00:00:26.039> same<00:00:26.220> thing<00:00:26.460> even<00:00:27.000> more<00:00:27.180> protected

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
exact same thing even more protected

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.169 
exact same thing even more protected
even<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.039> more<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.429> better<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:30.090> will

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
even the more the better it will

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.060 
even the more the better it will
actually<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:31.050> more<00:00:31.170> accessibility<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
actually the more accessibility the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.030 
actually the more accessibility the
better<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.899> let's<00:00:33.899> jump<00:00:34.260> off<00:00:34.410> right<00:00:34.829> into<00:00:34.920> this

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
better so let's jump off right into this

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.490 
better so let's jump off right into this
plugin<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> permission<00:00:37.170> space

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
plugin so this is a permission space

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.650 
plugin so this is a permission space
plugin<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.550> lot<00:00:38.910> how<00:00:39.090> many<00:00:39.300> chests

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
plugin so you a lot how many chests

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.799 
plugin so you a lot how many chests
you're<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.200> give<00:00:40.320> someone<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.809> these

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you're going to give someone and these

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.690 
you're going to give someone and these
plug<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.320> permission<00:00:43.980> base<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.489> work

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
plug this permission base can work

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.840 
plug this permission base can work
between<00:00:45.239> 1<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.750> 9<00:00:45.960> people<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:47.190> 1<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.700> 9

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
between 1 to 9 people I know 1 to 9

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.150 
between 1 to 9 people I know 1 to 9
chests<00:00:48.450> actually<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.440> let<00:00:49.739> me<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:49.950> go<00:00:50.010> ahead

and show you so I don't mess it up ok so

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.319 
and show you so I don't mess it up ok so
normally<00:00:53.219> let's<00:00:53.399> say<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> chest<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
normally let's say I have a chest and I

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.020 
normally let's say I have a chest and I
can<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> locket<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:55.710> lwc<00:00:56.520> or<00:00:56.699> some<00:00:56.879> other

can have a locket or lwc or some other
virtual<00:00:57.510> chest<00:00:57.750> plugin<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.739> would<00:00:58.890> be

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
virtual chest plugin and this would be

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.889 
virtual chest plugin and this would be
locked<00:00:59.250> under<00:00:59.430> my<00:00:59.699> name<00:00:59.940> now

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
locked under my name now

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.529 
locked under my name now
instead<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.430> plug-in<00:01:02.609> does<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
instead what this plug-in does is it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.679 
instead what this plug-in does is it
introduces<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:04.140> virtual<00:01:04.619> chest<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.610> let's<00:01:06.450> say

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
introduces a virtual chest so let's say

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.640 
introduces a virtual chest so let's say
I<00:01:06.720> did<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> PV<00:01:07.830> one<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.180> access<00:01:09.600> my<00:01:09.810> my

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
I did a PV one it so access my my

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.580 
I did a PV one it so access my my
virtual<00:01:11.070> chest<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.460> first<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:13.020> can

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
virtual chest my first one so I can

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.679 
virtual chest my first one so I can
store<00:01:13.830> an<00:01:13.950> item<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.310> there<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.670> let's<00:01:15.479> say<00:01:15.659> I

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
store an item in there and let's say I

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.660 
store an item in there and let's say I
don't<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.259> I'll<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:17.130> go<00:01:17.280> ahead<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.580> kill

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
don't know I'll just go ahead and kill

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.330 
don't know I'll just go ahead and kill
myself<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:19.820> there<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:20.909> go<00:01:20.939> now<00:01:21.380> let's<00:01:22.380> say<00:01:23.310> I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
myself so there we go now let's say I

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.859 
myself so there we go now let's say I
respawn<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:24.150> I'm<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.390> quite<00:01:24.450> sure<00:01:24.570> where

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
respawn here I'm not quite sure where

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.420 
respawn here I'm not quite sure where
this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.189> did<00:01:26.340> /p<00:01:27.299> v1<00:01:28.280> here's<00:01:29.280> my

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
this is but if I did /p v1 here's my

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.060 
this is but if I did /p v1 here's my
stuff<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.320> this<00:01:31.320> plugin<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.740> very<00:01:31.890> practical

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
if you do not want in raid and I think

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.359 
if you do not want in raid and I think
it's<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.600> fantastic<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:37.369> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
