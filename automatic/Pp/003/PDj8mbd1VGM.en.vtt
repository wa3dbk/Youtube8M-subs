00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
right now vibes origin connects to dark

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.329 
right now vibes origin connects to dark
side<00:00:53.239> so<00:00:53.839> when<00:00:53.989> he's<00:00:54.110> in<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.440> flash<00:00:54.619> TV<00:00:54.650> series

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
side so when he's in the flash TV series

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:56.590 
side so when he's in the flash TV series
which<00:00:55.580> I'm<00:00:55.699> guessing<00:00:55.879> is<00:00:56.059> gonna<00:00:56.239> be<00:00:56.330> a<00:00:56.390> few

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
which I'm guessing is gonna be a few

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.820 
which I'm guessing is gonna be a few
episodes<00:00:56.720> and<00:00:57.229> they'll<00:00:57.350> have<00:00:57.470> a<00:00:57.500> reason<00:00:57.799> for

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
episodes and they'll have a reason for

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.789 
episodes and they'll have a reason for
him<00:00:58.100> leaving<00:00:58.369> I<00:00:59.049> really<00:01:00.049> can't<00:01:00.350> make<00:01:00.470> them

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
him leaving I really can't make them

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.229 
him leaving I really can't make them
like<00:01:01.280> they<00:01:01.400> probably<00:01:01.580> won't<00:01:01.729> even<00:01:01.850> touch<00:01:02.089> on

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
like they probably won't even touch on

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.090 
like they probably won't even touch on
the<00:01:02.360> origin<00:01:02.750> if<00:01:02.930> it's<00:01:03.379> going<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.589> be<00:01:03.710> like<00:01:03.830> new

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
the origin if it's going to be like new

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.250 
the origin if it's going to be like new
52<00:01:04.460> related<00:01:04.820> because<00:01:04.970> they<00:01:05.659> mentioned<00:01:06.049> dark

dark side to the TC TV universe honestly

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.700 
dark side to the TC TV universe honestly
I<00:01:28.009> can't<00:01:28.399> see<00:01:28.609> him<00:01:28.700> entering<00:01:29.179> flash<00:01:29.630> or<00:01:30.020> the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
I can't see him entering flash or the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.529 
I can't see him entering flash or the
like<00:01:31.189> arrow<00:01:31.429> to<00:01:31.700> be<00:01:31.820> serious<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.329> really

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
like arrow to be serious it really

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:33.789 
like arrow to be serious it really
doesn't<00:01:32.749> make<00:01:32.840> sense<00:01:33.049> and<00:01:33.289> if<00:01:33.590> they're<00:01:33.679> going

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
doesn't make sense and if they're going

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:34.959 
doesn't make sense and if they're going
to<00:01:33.920> connect<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.219> to<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.399> Cinematic<00:01:34.939> Universe

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
to connect it to the Cinematic Universe

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.190 
to connect it to the Cinematic Universe
it's<00:01:35.450> still<00:01:35.719> when<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:35.929> would<00:01:36.020> make<00:01:36.170> sense

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
it's still when it would make sense

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.109 
it's still when it would make sense
because<00:01:36.619> if<00:01:37.009> they're<00:01:37.640> going<00:01:37.789> to<00:01:37.880> talk<00:01:38.030> about

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
because if they're going to talk about
