like<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.310> bathtub<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.540> could<00:02:03.689> get<00:02:03.780> into<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
like a bathtub you could get into and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.929 
like a bathtub you could get into and
just<00:02:04.619> go<00:02:04.710> down<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.979> mountain<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.430> bathtub
