did you make it look so easy a sharp saw
and<00:02:03.539> a<00:02:03.630> good<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.110> produces<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.950> billet<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:05.819> the

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
and a good I produces a billet and the

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.789 
and a good I produces a billet and the
potential<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.069> continues<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.250> take<00:02:08.519> shape

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
potential that continues to take shape

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.340 
potential that continues to take shape
but<00:02:10.799> where<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.160> billets<00:02:11.580> become<00:02:12.150> bats<00:02:12.480> well

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
but where do billets become bats well

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.890 
but where do billets become bats well
for<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.920> happen<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.459> have<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:15.000> go<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.780> the
