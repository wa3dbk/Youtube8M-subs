00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.740
 stars and meteorites black holes 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.960
 active road how are you welcome 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.299
 again to my channel today I bring you a 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.640
 new video and it's really a new 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.090
 section in the channel how to make up 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.880
 without looking and today's video is cool and 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.890
 jean-marc without looking emo and obviously 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.339
 does not want to offend if we have any emo 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.689
 out there but I mean certain dodge 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.689
 to serious about how there are colors 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.740
 dark and look like gothika or some 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.960
 urban 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.670
 similar to that of your senama 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.670
 this section of how Martians with 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.280
 pastel colors without looking sick and 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 all those things so I delighted up 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.110
 and comment me if you like this kind of 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.940
 section and leave me your idea of â€‹â€‹a 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.890
 makeup has been without looking like shawn 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.930
 and also invited guest to be 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.790
 subscribe to my channel of blocks the last 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.830
 real video we scream and cry with 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.900
 mime we laugh at it all, so 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.880
 down the arch the links and they also go to 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.890
 be the links of my social networks 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.400
 with my instagram 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.850
 my facebook twitter 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.820
 so we go with the video and I hope that 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.200
 I like it 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.420
 obviously we are going to start with our 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.060
 moisturizer because the skin 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.380
 hydrated is equal to pierre linda and not 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.560
 forget the neck we do not want to be 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.840
 some old wrinkled the first thing that 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.270
 we have to do is apply a first or 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.250
 a white pencil this time pencil yogurt 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.710
 white because I like it more if you look with 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.479
 what speed diffuses the color like this 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.579
 they have to do it fast fast 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.619
 and we have to apply a dark color 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.840
 I am using my friend the lord 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.789
 cardboard to guide me can you 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.329
 do with a neckline or with a ribbon 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.280
 adhesive as you make more comfortable 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.229
 he applied with little touches the dark color that 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.509
 in this case it is a pretty nice little green 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.939
 and I start it the way I want 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.240
 that has and the part more inside the eye 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:04.179
 only a little color comes with 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.000
 the blur can not see and I am 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.979
 blurring very very well was that I do not know 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.079
 I did not have a brand and be the cutest 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.349
 possible we can make a makeup 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:17.250
 super cute with only one color and if 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.500
 you are too parks like that 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.019
 they have to make it darker obviously 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.230
 so so that we do not risk the 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:29.829
 black in such a way we're going to apply the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.069
 navy blue color and we're going to mark all 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:35.069
 the edges the basin that was all good 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.069
 marked 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.400
 and I'm going to combine the purple color because 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.140
 beginning with the same navy blue for 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.660
 be able to delineate the sector below my 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.129
 eyes and I'm going to stretch it to join it 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.430
 also with the shadow above and that 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.319
 be just a line if you find 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.420
 that is still very marked can follow 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.930
 blurring and replacing the 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.030
 cartoncito where we put at the beginning 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.040
 I had forgotten to put in my eyes so 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.080
 I put on any other lip balm 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.569
 now with a white color we are going to 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.760
 illuminate the arch of the eyebrow that gives 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.400
 much more and luminosity the pores and 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.799
 obviously we are not going to skip the step 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.440
 that comes that is to illuminate the tear 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.599
 that makes the look look much more 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.800
 I really wake up this step what 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.660
 we go 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.180
 this step really can not miss and it is 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.400
 our delineated let's go for the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.980
 cat tail and making a little triangle 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.860
 and extending it inside the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.990
 eye does not matter if your eyeliner does not fit 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.880
 with the edge of the shadow that 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.530
 we did at the beginning if you want what 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.550
 you can obviously do the line but if 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.550
 no, no problem 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.510
 and now that we have our eyes ready 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.670
 we're just going to apply the base or 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.239
 corrector this time I'm using 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.250
 a typical cream that they say 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.230
 which is for clear skin but it seems that 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.659
 they think that among all of us we are black and 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.680
 I'm pretty darn good 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:13.420
 national camera but I was very toasted and 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.269
 be very careful not to pass 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.750
 take with what we did on the edge of 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.750
 our eyes 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.990
 normally I do not use powders because 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.150
 I have quite dry skin but now 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.749
 use one to lower the tone a little 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.749
 from the base 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.090
 and every time I'm more in love with 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.889
 contour of truth I love the effect 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.479
 that gives us the face I can be without 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.479
 term but without outline 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.960
 Now I'm going to apply a bit of 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.110
 illuminator in the high areas of my 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.110
 face 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.469
 and I'm going to start drawing my lips very 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.629
 well and we're going to use a color 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:14.120
 dark so we do not want to put the 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:14.120
 lips are all shivering and deformed 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.160
 remember to moisturize your lips very well or 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.160
 otherwise the color will create us 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.440
 Do not disturb me 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.759
 Hello 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.620
 and I'm sorry it did not look too perfect, I do not know 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:51.960
 worry because with any brush 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:56.180
 delgadito can be solved a 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.180
 little bit of mask and we are ready 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.930
 then they put a little black since 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.580
 I was very pink and well this is the 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.760
 final result I hope you have 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.940
 liked this video and many good kisses 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.940
 day
