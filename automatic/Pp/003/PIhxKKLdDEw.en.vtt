bands were essentially they came in
about<00:00:36.219> 15<00:00:36.640> years<00:00:36.880> ago<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:38.170> principle<00:00:39.010> of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
about 15 years ago and the principle of

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.190 
about 15 years ago and the principle of
it<00:00:39.160> is<00:00:39.280> is<00:00:39.489> when<00:00:39.730> you<00:00:40.239> get<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.450> blowout<00:00:40.809> or

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.100 
rapidly displace and essentially the dip
in<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.760> middle<00:00:45.880> of<00:00:46.090> your<00:00:46.270> rim<00:00:46.510> which<00:00:46.750> allows

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
in the middle of your rim which allows

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.350 
in the middle of your rim which allows
the<00:00:47.380> tire<00:00:47.590> to<00:00:47.800> be<00:00:47.920> removed<00:00:48.310> for<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:48.880> placement

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
the tire to be removed for a placement

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
the walls of the tire essentially the

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.790 
the walls of the tire essentially the
beads<00:00:51.760> drop<00:00:52.360> into<00:00:52.720> that<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:53.320> time<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:53.650> then

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
beads drop into that the time it then

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.890 
beads drop into that the time it then
actually<00:00:54.070> removes<00:00:54.370> itself<00:00:54.790> off<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.450> rim<00:00:55.660> and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
actually removes itself off the rim and

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.050 
actually removes itself off the rim and
what<00:00:56.500> you<00:00:56.590> then<00:00:56.770> do<00:00:57.010> is<00:00:57.040> your<00:00:57.250> your<00:00:57.550> rim<00:00:57.850> then

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
what you then do is your your rim then

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.700 
what you then do is your your rim then
runs<00:00:58.270> on<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.510> road<00:00:58.660> so<00:00:59.020> you<00:00:59.079> lose<00:00:59.410> all

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
runs on the road so you lose all

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.710 
runs on the road so you lose all
traction<00:01:00.100> on<00:01:00.340> one<00:01:00.520> side<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.060> that's<00:01:01.420> where

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
traction on one side and that's where

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.840 
traction on one side and that's where
the<00:01:01.900> caravan<00:01:02.320> are<00:01:02.500> fitted<00:01:02.829> to<00:01:02.980> be<00:01:03.550> is<00:01:03.610> out<00:01:03.790> of

tire is fitted as we can see here and

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.599 
tire is fitted as we can see here and
that<00:01:13.420> prevents<00:01:14.140> this<00:01:14.500> bead<00:01:14.770> going<00:01:15.310> in<00:01:15.429> there

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
that prevents this bead going in there

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.300 
that prevents this bead going in there
which<00:01:16.149> prevents<00:01:16.749> the<00:01:17.259> bead<00:01:17.469> coming<00:01:18.039> off<00:01:18.130> the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
once you've fitted them they stay there

and what kind of damage can be done when

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.230 
and what kind of damage can be done when
you<00:02:11.860> have<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.100> blowout<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.640> when<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.910> the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
you have a blowout and when the the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.730 
you have a blowout and when the the
rubber<00:02:13.480> rips<00:02:13.780> completely<00:02:14.230> off<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.350> rim<00:02:14.620> of

rubber rips completely off the rim of

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.500 
rubber rips completely off the rim of
your<00:02:14.770> Caravan<00:02:15.250> wheel<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:16.060> principle<00:02:16.480> of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
your Caravan wheel the principle of

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.840 
your Caravan wheel the principle of
keeping<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.990> rubber<00:02:17.200> on<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.500> rim<00:02:17.730> means<00:02:18.730> you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
keeping the rubber on the rim means you

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.000 
keeping the rubber on the rim means you
maintain<00:02:19.240> grip<00:02:19.540> that's<00:02:19.930> really<00:02:20.590> as<00:02:20.680> simple<00:02:20.950> as

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
maintain grip that's really as simple as

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.830 
maintain grip that's really as simple as
that<00:02:21.070> once<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.910> rubber<00:02:22.120> has<00:02:22.270> removed<00:02:22.570> from

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
that once the rubber has removed from

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.350 
that once the rubber has removed from
the<00:02:23.200> rim<00:02:23.620> your<00:02:23.860> grip<00:02:24.100> goes<00:02:24.310> down<00:02:24.580> by<00:02:24.760> some<00:02:25.210> 80

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
the rim your grip goes down by some 80

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.570 
the rim your grip goes down by some 80
percent<00:02:25.560> which<00:02:26.560> means<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:27.070> then<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.370> just

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
percent which means that then you just

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.040 
percent which means that then you just
you<00:02:27.730> lose<00:02:27.970> traction<00:02:28.360> because<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.750> have<00:02:28.870> more

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
you lose traction because you have more

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.180 
you lose traction because you have more
grit<00:02:29.260> one<00:02:29.440> side<00:02:29.650> than<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.890> other

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
grit one side than the other

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.300 
grit one side than the other
naturally<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.270> unit<00:02:32.020> wants<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.770> twist<00:02:33.040> and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
naturally the unit wants to to twist and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.920 
naturally the unit wants to to twist and
that's<00:02:33.790> where<00:02:34.000> suddenly<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.480> then<00:02:34.690> get<00:02:34.810> this

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
that's where suddenly you then get this

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.960 
that's where suddenly you then get this
out<00:02:35.080> controlling<00:02:35.710> it<00:02:35.800> all<00:02:35.890> goes<00:02:36.430> horribly<00:02:36.670> out

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
out controlling it all goes horribly out

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.550 
out controlling it all goes horribly out
of<00:02:37.090> shape<00:02:37.300> I've<00:02:37.810> actually<00:02:38.020> had<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> blowout

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
of shape I've actually had a blowout

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.770 
of shape I've actually had a blowout
with<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.890> tire<00:02:39.100> tire<00:02:39.580> on<00:02:39.730> fitted<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.330> only<00:02:40.630> way

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
with a tire tire on fitted the only way

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.210 
with a tire tire on fitted the only way
I<00:02:40.810> actually<00:02:41.050> knew<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.620> because<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:41.860> noticed<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
I actually knew is because I noticed the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.700 
I actually knew is because I noticed the
caravan<00:02:42.610> go<00:02:42.760> slightly<00:02:43.420> sideways<00:02:43.960> and<00:02:44.230> that's

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
caravan go slightly sideways and that's

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.990 
caravan go slightly sideways and that's
that<00:02:44.980> was<00:02:45.130> just<00:02:45.280> because<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.550> tires<00:02:45.760> gone

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
that was just because the tires gone

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.930 
that was just because the tires gone
flat<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.740> very<00:02:48.100> good<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.640> if<00:02:48.790> your

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
flat so it is very good and if your

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.120 
flat so it is very good and if your
Caravan<00:02:49.270> tire<00:02:49.480> has<00:02:49.690> blown<00:02:49.900> out<00:02:50.110> how<00:02:50.650> long<00:02:50.890> can

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
Caravan tire has blown out how long can

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.130 
Caravan tire has blown out how long can
you<00:02:51.190> keep<00:02:51.340> towing<00:02:51.880> if<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.630> want<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.020> have

you keep towing if you want to have

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.540

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
these run flat bands you would have to

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.650

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
in the first place but certainly you

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.900 
in the first place but certainly you

20 miles an hour 25 miles an hour and

20 miles an hour 25 miles an hour and

services to the next safe place that you

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.590 
services to the next safe place that you
can<00:03:20.650> pull<00:03:20.830> over<00:03:20.950> which<00:03:21.250> gets<00:03:21.520> you<00:03:21.730> off<00:03:21.970> the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
can pull over which gets you off the

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.180 
can pull over which gets you off the
main<00:03:22.840> carriageway<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.620> out<00:03:23.830> and<00:03:24.040> out<00:03:24.130> of

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
main carriageway and out and out of

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.550 
main carriageway and out and out of
danger<00:03:24.459> these<00:03:25.209> can<00:03:25.510> do<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.170> they<00:03:26.530> don't

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
danger these can do that so they don't

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.830 
danger these can do that so they don't
have<00:03:26.980> only<00:03:27.190> one<00:03:27.610> mile<00:03:27.910> before<00:03:28.180> they<00:03:28.480> will<00:03:28.630> stop

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
have only one mile before they will stop

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.270 
have only one mile before they will stop
functioning<00:03:29.020> they<00:03:29.709> will<00:03:29.860> continue<00:03:30.130> to

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
functioning they will continue to

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.890 
functioning they will continue to
function<00:03:30.550> all<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.300> time<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.660> still<00:03:31.840> have

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
function all the time you still have

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.110 
function all the time you still have
rubber<00:03:32.260> on<00:03:32.380> this<00:03:32.590> wall<00:03:32.800> so<00:03:33.400> essentially

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
rubber on this wall so essentially

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.570 
rubber on this wall so essentially
that's<00:03:34.360> how<00:03:34.630> far<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:35.050> can<00:03:35.290> go<00:03:35.560> but<00:03:35.830> certainly

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
that's how far you can go but certainly

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.280 
that's how far you can go but certainly
the<00:03:36.730> idea<00:03:36.850> is<00:03:37.209> to<00:03:37.360> get<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.870> next<00:03:38.050> lay

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
the idea is to get you to the next lay

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.080 
the idea is to get you to the next lay
by<00:03:38.500> get<00:03:38.769> you<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.070> next<00:03:39.340> exit<00:03:39.700> get<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:39.970> to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
by get you to the next exit get you to

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.390 
by get you to the next exit get you to
the<00:03:40.209> next<00:03:40.420> services<00:03:40.989> out<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:41.680> danger<00:03:42.100> in

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
the next services out of danger in

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:50.400 
the next services out of danger in
change<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.209> over

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.470
