00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
what the thing is my old computer wasn't

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.570 
what the thing is my old computer wasn't
able<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.050> render<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.949> very<00:00:23.130> high<00:00:23.279> quality

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
because i had horrible horrible ram on

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.070 
because i had horrible horrible ram on
that<00:00:27.060> computer<00:00:27.359> if<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.630> guys<00:00:27.779> don't<00:00:27.930> know

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
that computer if you guys don't know

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.339 
that computer if you guys don't know
what<00:00:28.170> ram<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:28.890> basically<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.730> memory

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
what ram is it's basically the memory

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.830 
what ram is it's basically the memory
the<00:00:31.349> amount<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.710> memory<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.219> hat<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.840> it's

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the amount of memory the hat that it's

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.110 
the amount of memory the hat that it's
called<00:00:34.079> random<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.559> random<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:35.700> not<00:00:35.820> random

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
called random is random it's not random

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.720 
called random is random it's not random
assorted<00:00:36.630> memories<00:00:36.989> random<00:00:37.730> random

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
assorted memories random random

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.369 
assorted memories random random
something<00:00:39.239> memory<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.750> something<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.140> an<00:00:40.230> A

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
something memory and something with an A

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.580 
something memory and something with an A
obviously<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.690> it<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.140> small<00:00:43.530> on

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
obviously but like it was so small on

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.200 
obviously but like it was so small on
that<00:00:43.950> computer<00:00:44.250> i<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.700> was<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:44.850> half

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
that computer i think it was like half

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.380 
that computer i think it was like half
it<00:00:45.539> was<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> half<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.469> half<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.399> kit<00:00:47.610> half<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.059> gig<00:00:48.239> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it was a half a half a kit half a gig of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.660 
it was a half a half a kit half a gig of
memory<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.899> basically<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.399> my<00:00:50.520> new

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
memory and basically with my new

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.810 
memory and basically with my new
computer<00:00:50.820> i<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.300> four<00:00:51.600> gigs<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.460> ram<00:00:53.460> which<00:00:53.670> is

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
computer i got four gigs of ram which is

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.779 
computer i got four gigs of ram which is
fucking<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.510> ridiculous<00:00:55.110> there<00:00:55.699> well<00:00:56.699> it's

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
fucking it's ridiculous there well it's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
not ridiculous it's kind of average for

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.170 
not ridiculous it's kind of average for
a<00:00:58.530> new<00:00:58.710> computer<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.370> come<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.609> i<00:00:59.670> spent<00:01:00.000> like

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
a new computer but come on i spent like

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.930 
a new computer but come on i spent like
this<00:01:01.020> was<00:01:01.289> i<00:01:01.500> would<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.949> say<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.609> good

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
this was i would have to say it's a good

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.310 
this was i would have to say it's a good
computer<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.110> good

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
computer like it's a really good

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.920 
computer like it's a really good
computer<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.489> kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.909> budget<00:01:06.630> i<00:01:06.780> have

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
computer but it's kind of budget i have

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.780 
computer but it's kind of budget i have
to<00:01:07.110> say<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.619> not<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:08.760> of

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
to say like it's not it's not one of

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.130 
to say like it's not it's not one of
these<00:01:08.939> supercomputers<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.840> you're<00:01:10.020> going

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
these supercomputers that you're going

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.350 
these supercomputers that you're going
to<00:01:10.229> see<00:01:10.380> people<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.890> doing<00:01:11.520> crazy<00:01:11.820> shit<00:01:12.060> like

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
to see people like doing crazy shit like

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.950 
to see people like doing crazy shit like
playing<00:01:12.750> 18<00:01:13.260> games<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.799> crisis<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.610> know

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
playing 18 games of crisis on you know

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.660 
playing 18 games of crisis on you know
it<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.680> an<00:01:16.799> average<00:01:17.100> computer<00:01:17.430> you

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
it so it's just an average computer you

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.460 
it so it's just an average computer you
know<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.060> graphics<00:01:18.900> card<00:01:19.110> isn't<00:01:19.380> that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
know the the graphics card isn't that

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.800 
know the the graphics card isn't that
great<00:01:19.650> i<00:01:19.710> think<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.130> called<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.430> 420<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.180> 40<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
great i think it's called a 420 at 40 to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.060 
great i think it's called a 420 at 40 to
50<00:01:22.229> integrated<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.850> IP<00:01:24.650> graphics<00:01:25.650> card<00:01:25.890> those

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
50 integrated I a IP graphics card those

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.980 
50 integrated I a IP graphics card those
those<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> who<00:01:26.820> know<00:01:26.970> computer<00:01:27.450> specs<00:01:27.780> you

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
those of you who know computer specs you

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.170 
those of you who know computer specs you
know<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.320> that's<00:01:28.470> not<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.710> very<00:01:28.920> good<00:01:29.180> that's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
know that that's not a very good that's

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.080 
know that that's not a very good that's
not<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> very<00:01:30.600> good<00:01:31.189> what's<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.280> column<00:01:32.520> that's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
not a very good what's a column that's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.640 
not a very good what's a column that's
not<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> very<00:01:33.450> good<00:01:33.570> graphics<00:01:34.079> card<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.500> there

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
not a very good graphics card like there

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.440 
not a very good graphics card like there
are<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.100> many<00:01:35.340> better<00:01:35.640> graphic<00:01:36.119> art<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
are so many better graphic art and

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.850 
are so many better graphic art and
graphic<00:01:36.570> cards<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.110> there<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.470> you're

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
graphic cards out there and you're
