00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.560
 today's recipe is a delight was 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.260
 dying to eat there 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.330
 I enjoyed and recorded and I'm eating 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.550
 Of course I already ate everything and I do not have to show 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.929
 for you and sweet pumpkin recipes 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.759
 with coconut 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.950
 I love but everyone comes from pumpkin 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.590
 I do not like the river 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.360
 and then I did it was him who is 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.410
 Once and for all I spotted 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.390
 as cars window much of that pain then 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.920
 to see that revenue continues 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.390
 watching the ingredients are a pound 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.120
 of pumpkin is cut into cubes 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:45.540
 small and washed 400 grams of sugar 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.690
 preferably a whole body crystal 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.440
 ldu did not have it and I ended up using it a bit 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.000
 more than one packet of grated coconut 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.510
 I have placed an amount 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.510
 so and cinnamon stick August too 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:08.920
 now in a pan we'll put the 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.950
 pumpkin cinnamon and clove sugar 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.870
 Now we're gonna mix it up and take it to the fire. 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.510
 You do not have to put water because the ball goes 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.900
 Come back a lot of water still but we go. 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.010
 always stir until all pumpkin 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.200
 dismantling 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.030
 will look like dropping enough water is 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.860
 super easy to do but needs to have a 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.090
 A little patience, because it takes time. 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.010
 to get ready 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.100
 have to stir the pot for a good deal 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.810
 time now mouth already also from machadinho 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.369
 And the part that is not, I'm giving 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.580
 spent with the spoon because I like it 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.910
 well stained and when you have 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.650
 so we're going to add coconut 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.320
 mix well and leave the mash another 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.360
 little 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:58.759
 now it's good sweet so I 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:02.080
