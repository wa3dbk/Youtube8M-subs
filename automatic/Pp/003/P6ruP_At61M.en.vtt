 as if we had cut into my brain 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.730
 to let in the opening 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.510
 of mind in fact 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.550

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.930

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.750
 nobody before judging her 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.010
 it's too beautiful it's my home but the 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.419
 secret actually that you told me everything to 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.010
 time is not only for that 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.260
 it's not with you there are several 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.810
 pits present around this asset so 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.419
 my favorite game to be for example 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:13.880
 rock-paper-scissors match for you 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:15.919
 help and scissors and that's it or even ben 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.940
 we could say that I have yes yes I 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.110
 studied in fashion but we could say that 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.250
 that's why or when I remembered 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.780
 I do it myself it depends on 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.000
 who you meet you see there you pass 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.040
 I pass in front of the camera so you say 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.110
 necessarily the shelter and even von hebel before 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.880
 but we agree that in this bar is 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:35.270
 diminished because I'm a hairdresser 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.490
 this is not bad room I think we 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.360

 know more and more in Quebec and 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.530

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:04.510
