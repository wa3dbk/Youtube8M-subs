00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.530
 we have two popular ones here 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.480
 Samsung appliances are hands on then 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.250
 just on the market but now have it 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.570
 chance chance to get them at the next 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.160
 each other and that is natural 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.650
 it is very interesting both 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.820
 just interesting loo and phones and 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.190
 is of course the question use him you 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.500
 to buyer this is the samsung galaxy s 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.030
 it is now 2 years old 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.770
 These are Samsung Galaxy S2 which they 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.210
 through a year old he bites in between 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.980
 are still available with the devices 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.060
 still sell very well and this one 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.529
 videos will show the differences again 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.000
 tell and tell what content 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.949
 can buy the best 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.320
 samsung galaxy s2 is therefore the successor to 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.909
 the samsung galaxy s so go do that already 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.129
 suspect that samsung galaxy s2 what 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:43.480
 is better than its predecessor 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.399
 that is indeed where we can 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.319
 tell in advance and name in this video 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.929
 fire that work out a bit further 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:51.760
 samsung galaxy and the galaxy s2 that 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.499
 we are quite similar to each other 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.179
 at the and not very inspiring 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:56.889
 design do we find the first two which 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.589
 nicer is 2 that has a matte finish 

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:01.629
 that anyway is neat 2 that feel that 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.280
 just a little firmer, what solid he has 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.540
 slightly more own identity than the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.520
 samsung galaxy case 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.010
 just pretty true actually on one 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.590
 iphone 3gs seems that speed time 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.600
 since it came out that's about 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.460
 the time for this evoque comes out 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.570
 is just a bit newer but it is 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.180
 just a little older device 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.500
 he is still sold a lot and we 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.360
 just don't find the very pretty ones 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.890
 smartphone therefore affects what is cheaper 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.560
 in that respect the 1st wins 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.330
 a few screens is the difference 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.030
 also a big one is 2 that has one 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.220
 legia resolution they mean that 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.740
 that simply name has better resolution 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.300
 the screen is 3.7 inches so with it 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.550
 with a greater than that of the galaxy 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.980
 as three and a half inches and the galaxy 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.740
 it has a resolution of name avg yes 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.900
 yes VGA resolution at three and half inches 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.180
 quite a bit little at first so we 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.610
 we regard the race 2 as normal 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.930
 name it have much better screen both 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 is really a bit pixelated 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.860
 animation just not very nice 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.150
 with the first 2 it is already a lot better 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.430
 So she said that it was also a big advantage 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.659
 of this samsung galaxy s2 in terms of colors 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.640
 The screens are quite together 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.380
 Be bold with the TV panels with no 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.880
 the best colors are also among the best 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.229
 what to be under the surface 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.420
 viewing angle is also not very good 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.430
 but that is in itself for this segment 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.930
 logical because both of them have been 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.630
 I also look a little better with the first two 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.070
 clothes is perhaps just about anything 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.960
 it is especially resolution has 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.060
 two that is higher and therefore simply after 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.070
 is a lot sharper and well that is 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.120
 of course nice 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.520
 both devices run on android 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.590
 gingerbread right now is the one that is 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.120
 released with android froyo still on that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.980
 moment but that is running now it is just 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.430
 To get a deeper it will no longer be updates 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.680
 to get 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.170
 this galaxy s2 will get that will 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.580
 if all goes well this month or else 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.890
 probably an update next month 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.550
 get to android 4 point a jelly 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.500
 bean 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.700
 4 on a jelly bean also has project 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.780
 better a project must be bitter 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.730
 make smartphones more flexible 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.540
 run so that will speed up this 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.310
 e2 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.110
 probably some increase in 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.300
 anyway he is the e2 duo can argue 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.010
 is 2 that has a dual core processor 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.030
 opposite a single core processor from 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.240
 the galaxy one 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.310
 DCS has the 830 Elies first 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.900
 800 has me, but I do too 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.120
 processes of e2 will be really significant 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.980
 better than in the chorus process of i daisy 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.150
 a projection is pretty slow 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.160
 smartphone 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.140
 that is not very pleasant 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.030
 galaxy s2 I already very fit 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.070
 in daily use with them 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.960
 just pretty fast most things that 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.310
 handles it just fast enough and we 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.440
 that concerns the device works and nice 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.180
 and you already have a good contemporary 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.430
 smartphone in hands with once two it 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.720
 being able or the galaxy is not saying 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.330
 camera of the device is with the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.980
 5 megapixels both are the best 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.540
 good of a 5 megapixel camera and 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.430
 just suddenly is a bit less 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.140
 who is not there is not one of the best 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.340
 five megapixel cameras on the market 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.020
 that is perhaps the 1st 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.430
 case is those photos from the 1st they still 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.170
 slightly better but that is not great 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.220
 The difference between these two handsets 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.170
 we can say the first two 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.660
 just really is better in every way than 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.150
 its predecessor the is the is 2 that does 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.000
 just fine in terms of screen in terms of performance 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.230
 build improved camera is better and better 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.430
 software gets this 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.400
 jelly beans are really big 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.780
 advantages with respect to the galaxy is 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.850
 of course the galaxy s2 is the successor 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.709
 the galaxy is also a little more expensive catchy 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.240
 tablespoons yet again 190 euros loose it 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.459
 moment the galaxy is ours 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.200
 about 140 euros so they 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.120
 price difference of 50 euros 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.740
 in our opinion that is not worth 2 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.140
 is really good for a 190 euros 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.470
 smartphone to you first which is from 140 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.090
 a little on the minimum of the euro 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.710
 specifications of smartphones that before 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.300
 get that prize and get to the first 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.949
 is just so much in daily use 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.870
 less pleasant than the e2 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.100
 That we in all cases for the first time 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.539
 two will go 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.400
 of course if you have the 50 euros 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.630
 if you really have a budget for that 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.669
 less than one hundred ninety euros 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.470
 then the has two naturally falls outside 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.150
 your budget but then it still is 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.789
 it might be wise to continue 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.620
 then look at this galaxy case diet chase 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.120
 the beat just not the best things 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.680
 for the price you paid for this 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.199
 moment it must have been especially of 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.150
 popularity that we now do not have so much 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.039
 message and we should respect it 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.810
 we are definitely going for the first two or if 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.960
 your budget is low so go further 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.960
 look
