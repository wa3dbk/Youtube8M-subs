00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
side to make it nice and smooth as so

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.760 
side to make it nice and smooth as so
so<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:14.000> did<00:02:14.450> use<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.690> little<00:02:15.050> bit<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.260> Shaving<00:02:15.620> to

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
so I did use a little bit of Shaving to

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.300 
so I did use a little bit of Shaving to
the<00:02:15.860> vein<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.790> keep<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.180> from<00:02:17.420> being<00:02:17.690> too<00:02:18.310> full

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
the vein to keep it from being too full

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.090 
the vein to keep it from being too full
and<00:02:19.930> basically<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:21.020> started<00:02:21.440> with<00:02:21.590> one<00:02:21.770> row<00:02:21.980> at

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
and basically I started with one row at

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.400 
and basically I started with one row at
the<00:02:22.220> back<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.730> did<00:02:23.030> my<00:02:23.180> back<00:02:23.450> about<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:24.110> much

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
the back I did my back about that much

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.940 
the back I did my back about that much
from<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.310> NAP<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.670> my<00:02:26.000> hair<00:02:26.560> when<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.590> got<00:02:27.770> to

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
from the NAP of my hair when I got to

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.210 
from the NAP of my hair when I got to
the<00:02:28.070> top<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.700> started<00:02:29.860> going<00:02:30.860> like<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.070> little

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
the top I started going like a little

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.270 
the top I started going like a little
maybe<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:32.000> little<00:02:32.300> half<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.630> moon<00:02:32.890> when<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:33.920> got<00:02:34.130> to

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
maybe a little half a moon when I got to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.700 
maybe a little half a moon when I got to
about<00:02:34.340> right<00:02:34.640> here<00:02:34.930> started<00:02:35.930> going<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.410> half

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
about right here started going to a half

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.310 
about right here started going to a half
a<00:02:36.830> moon<00:02:37.010> shape<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.670> didn't<00:02:38.600> get<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.870> this<00:02:39.020> top

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
a moon shape I didn't get to this top

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.250 
a moon shape I didn't get to this top
here<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.400> started<00:02:40.730> going<00:02:41.000> half<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.840> moon<00:02:41.990> to

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
here and I started going half a moon to

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.380 
here and I started going half a moon to
the<00:02:42.410> top<00:02:42.680> which<00:02:43.520> not<00:02:44.060> make<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.570> so<00:02:44.870> full<00:02:45.590> and

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
the top which not make it so full and

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.250 
the top which not make it so full and
especially<00:02:47.390> if<00:02:47.570> you're<00:02:47.660> wearing<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:48.020> in<00:02:48.140> your

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
especially if you're wearing it in your

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.080 
especially if you're wearing it in your
face<00:02:48.700> once<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.850> got<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.180> top<00:02:50.270> I<00:02:50.750> did<00:02:52.090> just

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
face once I got to the top I did just

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.350 
face once I got to the top I did just
maybe<00:02:53.360> finger<00:02:53.750> length<00:02:54.050> across<00:02:55.030> until<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.090> got

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
maybe finger length across until I got

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.780 
maybe finger length across until I got
to<00:02:56.600> about<00:02:56.720> right<00:02:57.020> here<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.680> that's<00:02:58.550> when<00:02:58.760> I

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
to about right here and that's when I

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.450 
to about right here and that's when I
started<00:02:59.360> with<00:02:59.690> I'm<00:03:00.080> making<00:03:00.830> them<00:03:00.920> little<00:03:01.130> half

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
started with I'm making them little half

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.500 
started with I'm making them little half
moons<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:02.290> around<00:03:03.290> here<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.730> closure<00:03:05.090> you

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
moons in around here the closure you

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.330 
moons in around here the closure you
will<00:03:05.690> have<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.140> cut<00:03:06.470> but<00:03:06.980> you're<00:03:07.130> going<00:03:07.280> to

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
will have to cut but you're going to

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.640 
will have to cut but you're going to
have<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.520> make<00:03:07.640> sure<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:08.150> cut<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.650> where

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
have to make sure that you cut it where

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.520 
have to make sure that you cut it where
it<00:03:10.010> does<00:03:10.250> not<00:03:10.430> show<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.750> as<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.050> can<00:03:12.170> see<00:03:12.380> if<00:03:12.440> a

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
it does not show so as you can see if a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.930 
it does not show so as you can see if a
painting<00:03:12.830> close<00:03:13.160> enough<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:13.580> is<00:03:13.640> the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
painting close enough this is the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.770 
painting close enough this is the
closure<00:03:14.210> that<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:14.780> normally<00:03:15.080> use<00:03:15.320> um<00:03:16.750> like<00:03:17.750> a

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
closure that I normally use um like a

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.010 
closure that I normally use um like a
glue<00:03:18.230> like<00:03:18.740> a<00:03:18.770> bonding<00:03:19.610> glue<00:03:19.730> for<00:03:20.120> quick<00:03:20.570> waves

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
glue like a bonding glue for quick waves

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.500 
glue like a bonding glue for quick waves
I<00:03:21.110> mean<00:03:21.380> lace<00:03:21.710> front<00:03:21.980> wigs<00:03:22.190> but<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.180> really

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
I mean lace front wigs but I really

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.940 
I mean lace front wigs but I really
didn't<00:03:23.660> have<00:03:23.780> time<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:23.990> do<00:03:24.230> all<00:03:24.350> that<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:24.710> I<00:03:24.740> did

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
didn't have time to do all that so I did

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.660 
didn't have time to do all that so I did
use<00:03:25.100> that<00:03:25.130> closure

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
use that closure

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.670 
use that closure
I<00:03:25.790> just<00:03:26.300> cut<00:03:26.570> until<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:26.990> made<00:03:27.200> it<00:03:27.350> square<00:03:28.600> okay

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
I just cut until it made it square okay

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.290 
I just cut until it made it square okay
and<00:03:30.680> basically<00:03:30.830> that's<00:03:31.310> it

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
and basically that's it

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.480 
and basically that's it
minimum<00:03:32.930> style<00:03:33.200> like<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.380> say<00:03:33.560> time<00:03:34.070> on<00:03:34.340> this

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
minimum style like I say time on this

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.900 
minimum style like I say time on this
hair<00:03:34.700> will<00:03:34.880> be<00:03:34.970> about<00:03:35.150> two<00:03:35.510> weeks<00:03:35.830> tops<00:03:36.830> if<00:03:37.280> you

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.340 
hair will be about two weeks tops if you
take<00:03:38.120> care<00:03:38.330> of<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.660> I<00:03:39.940> also<00:03:41.110> normally<00:03:42.110> use<00:03:42.320> a

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350
