00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:55.910
 version in the same fight of the last game that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.910

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.650

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.650
 the attack happened there 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:22.040
 the pope does the economics of economics that is 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.040
 there since the first game 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.549
 Oh my God 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.740
 Ok, how can you see the combos in this game? 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.740
 so much more absurd 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.789
 I passed the hand of the mother is not that they work 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.439
 here o 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:56.049
 she has a transport network does not 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.950
 but the actor's body does not smell like 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:05.100
 left because there's that game thing 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.689
 total Gaucho team was made 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.519
 people 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:17.830
 Ok, now, that's what they watch. 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:20.280
 also entered the match well now 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:25.150
 watch the team too 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:30.160
 Good thing there is the item round now my 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.430
 god al down due to persistent 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.430
 Jorge 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.379
 There he got the drug. 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:09.359
 the party is so it is 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.359
 ué but ended up burying three new ones 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:18.810
 33 and john changes in the game system 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:32.609
 kaká got to know that this game continues 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:40.680
 being completely the spectacle is not 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:45.579
 business is absurd powers that I played 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:53.379
 I do not know, I do not know why. 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:55.180
 go with apparently to that what 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.530
 It's apparently you can change now. 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.530
 also in sport 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.530
 ae 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.590
 The panel hurt. 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:25.600
 there the party 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:30.810
 opa opa 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.810
 I do not know what you're going to find either. 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:45.849
 on a map 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:45.849
 I think it was good to see the last harvest 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.550
 rita 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:08.160
 so only one interesting factor is the same 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.780
 level of naro all the china but did not leave 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.440
 the index also how to exchange more 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.320
 apparently the towel but then that's it 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.660
 there was some of the gameplay of naruto one 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.390
 shortly afterwards the bag is not expected but 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:26.100
 there is also of the think-side 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:28.290
 and terrible threat is good tone and 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.940
 Now I've been waiting there, too. 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.330

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.330
 game
