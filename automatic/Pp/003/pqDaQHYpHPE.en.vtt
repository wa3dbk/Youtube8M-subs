 clear repetition because we are looking 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.500

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.129

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.260
 school every day 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.430
 in the heart 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:08.680
 and so many people do not raise their hands 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.680
 this is the cabal 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.200
 here is a perfect 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.770
 more over let's take this moment 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.480
 after turning there are very few people 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.480
 they are told that it is not ready 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.540
 so the director is pinching me 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.400
 this layer the pressure I'm saying that 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.500

 beto please the music 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.530
 as I was saying so that we 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.530
 music arrives subject to music 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:01.290
 and goal of love since I met you 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:07.260
 when we started talking a lot in July 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.890
 and well I wanted to ask if I wanted 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.890

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.959
 that is, he is forgetting the oil that 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.209
 effort this man has the 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.660
 well- fitting pants as he says 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.660
 the moon 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:29.670
 strong 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:33.160
 today is for tomorrow to play like this 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.720
 and is that in person of very different 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.390
 here in desire and the most clear 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.830
 perfect pretty let's play and we're going to 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.880
 wait here and answer a way 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.680
 amazing 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.760
 this is a round of applause that you give to the public 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.760
 play the caretaker 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.910
 we only have contacts with the 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.610
 participants therefore not communicate 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:57.310
 with it it's ready and it 's very good 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.970
 from now on then concentrate 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.970
 already 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.690
 very well 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.810
 this whole transpiration of one gets 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.810
 nervous 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.210
 nicole are you 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:32.290
 how are you nicole apologize that you 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:35.850
 bother what I was doing was 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.850
 watching the program that good 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.690
 we go up the front 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.100
 if I was watching the program you heard 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.190
 the declaration of love that he made 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:49.720
 cristóbal and it's a request too 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.700
 important before they tell me is 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.290
 as for somber not any man 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.130
 comes to sit the television to a country 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:06:00.220
 whole and it throws him well with 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:03.409
 mine that we always have to reject 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:09.110
 nicolás I would like you to hear this 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:13.330
 here there is a lot of something in this program 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.330
 to say everything he felt put 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:21.360
 expedition should first of all for 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:24.900
 exterior 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.900
 and make it public 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.920
 I imagine that this should start the 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.920
 complicated tomorrow 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:41.460
 he says that tomorrow 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.800
 I like people in love 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.000
 and when one is in this position in the 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.520
 school 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.960
 it's difficult then I would like that I 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.450
 I know there are things that one should keep 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.670
 low key and all that but I would like 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:02.090
 suddenly a floor and a window 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.740
 Maybe something that opened up because I know 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.370
 that you go along with the recording of 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.370
 fourth half 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.190
 and something has to be because if not how 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.190
 they will go together 

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.510
 I imagine it must be difficult for you 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.780
 but 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:32.000
 is there any possibility of wondering with 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.740
 the heart and really a date some 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.300
 chance you can converse you like 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.300
 cristóbal something 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:45.349
 but no 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.070
 I need time you're good 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.780

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.750
 somebody answered the phone 

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.750
 telemetry 

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:10.380
 and a time 

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.259
 I like it when it comes as soon as I 

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:15.150
 feel to the program that attitude with the 

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:18.050
