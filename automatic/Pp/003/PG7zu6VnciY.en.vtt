00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
interesting though how this game-mode

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.120 
interesting though how this game-mode
was<00:01:48.149> created<00:01:48.659> off<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.079> mods<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.770> shows<00:01:49.979> you

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
was created off of mods and it shows you

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.609 
was created off of mods and it shows you
the<00:01:50.189> whole<00:01:50.490> potential<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.899> black<00:01:52.110> ops<00:01:52.470> 2

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the whole potential of what black ops 2

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.260 
the whole potential of what black ops 2
zombies<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:53.159> capable<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.030> now<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> think

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
zombies is capable of and now I think

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.030 
zombies is capable of and now I think
they<00:01:54.540> locked<00:01:54.869> us<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.320> here<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.590> don't<00:01:55.740> know<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
they locked us in here I don't know if I

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.010 
they locked us in here I don't know if I
could<00:01:56.189> actually<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.579> out<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.850> here<00:01:57.030> my

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
could actually get out of here my

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.480 
could actually get out of here my
current<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.560> current<00:01:58.860> health<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> door

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
current the current health on the door

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.270 
current the current health on the door
is<00:01:59.700> 35<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> basically<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:01.799> when<00:02:02.219> you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
is 35 so I basically I think when you

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.370 
is 35 so I basically I think when you
knife<00:02:02.549> someone<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.420> hundred<00:02:03.689> sort<00:02:04.290> of

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
knife someone that's a hundred sort of

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.410 
knife someone that's a hundred sort of
damage<00:02:04.860> points<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.700> way<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.240> were<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
damage points in a way so if I were to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.660 
damage points in a way so if I were to
get<00:02:06.540> knifed<00:02:06.780> right<00:02:07.049> now<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.409> would<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:08.039> dead<00:02:08.310> so

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
get knifed right now I would be dead so

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.300 
get knifed right now I would be dead so
that's<00:02:08.879> not<00:02:09.149> necessarily<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.869> good<00:02:10.080> idea<00:02:10.890> my

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that's not necessarily a good idea my

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.520 
that's not necessarily a good idea my
aim<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.550> shit<00:02:12.060> guys<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.599> I'm<00:02:12.780> not<00:02:12.959> even<00:02:13.170> gonna
