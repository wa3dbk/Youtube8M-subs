obtain<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:01.140> on<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.160> floor<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.550> only<00:03:02.700> said

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
obtain it on the floor of it only said

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000 
obtain it on the floor of it only said
about<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.510> staff<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.989> Moses<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:04.590> not<00:03:04.769> about<00:03:04.950> a

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
about the staff of Moses but not about a

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.710 
about the staff of Moses but not about a
burn<00:03:05.310> staff<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:05.910> I'm<00:03:06.000> not<00:03:06.090> sure<00:03:06.269> about<00:03:06.390> that

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
burn staff so I'm not sure about that

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.440 
burn staff so I'm not sure about that
and<00:03:07.320> as<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.769> demonstrated<00:03:08.280> it's<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.670> same<00:03:08.970> but

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
and as I demonstrated it's the same but

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.740 
and as I demonstrated it's the same but
with<00:03:09.600> lava<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.769> doesn't<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.160> as<00:03:11.310> big

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
with lava and it doesn't have as big

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.509 
with lava and it doesn't have as big
proportions<00:03:12.750> like<00:03:12.840> God<00:03:13.200> doesn't<00:03:13.650> go<00:03:13.769> 64

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
proportions like God doesn't go 64

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.470 
proportions like God doesn't go 64
blocks<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:17.250> burn<00:03:17.430> step<00:03:17.670> also<00:03:18.000> works<00:03:18.239> with

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
blocks and the burn step also works with

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.199 
blocks and the burn step also works with
water<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.950> same<00:03:20.280> as<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.700> staff<00:03:21.000> of

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
water and it's the same as the staff of

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.199 
water and it's the same as the staff of
Moses<00:03:21.870> with<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.320> water<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.459> bird<00:03:23.700> step<00:03:24.000> is

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
Moses with the water so the bird step is

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.460 
Moses with the water so the bird step is
kind<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.690> better<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.320> think<00:03:25.610> yeah<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.820> do<00:03:26.940> think

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
kind of better I think yeah I do think

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.650 
kind of better I think yeah I do think
so<00:03:28.470> let<00:03:28.920> me<00:03:29.010> actually<00:03:29.519> try<00:03:29.850> if<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.330> wouldn't

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
so let me actually try if I wouldn't

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.870 
so let me actually try if I wouldn't
just<00:03:30.840> throw<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.320> yeah<00:03:31.830> there<00:03:32.040> we<00:03:32.130> go<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.700> that's

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
just throw it yeah there we go so that's

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.240 
just throw it yeah there we go so that's
how<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.030> make<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.600> here's<00:03:34.200> throw<00:03:34.560> normal<00:03:34.980> staff

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250

whatever<00:03:38.580> disappears<00:03:39.239> for<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.450> second<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:39.840> it

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
whatever disappears for a second so it

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.130 
whatever disappears for a second so it
doesn't<00:03:40.230> like<00:03:40.709> burn<00:03:41.010> away<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.959> can<00:03:43.110> just

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
doesn't like burn away and you can just

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.870 
doesn't like burn away and you can just
grab<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.799> let<00:03:44.010> me<00:03:44.130> let<00:03:44.400> me<00:03:44.459> actually<00:03:44.580> try<00:03:44.850> it

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
grab it so let me let me actually try it

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.210 
grab it so let me let me actually try it
again<00:03:45.030> see<00:03:45.410> yeah<00:03:46.410> there<00:03:46.620> we<00:03:46.709> go<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:47.010> that's

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
again see yeah there we go that that's

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.220 
again see yeah there we go that that's
how<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.459> works<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.790> gonna<00:03:47.940> throw<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.360> take<00:03:49.080> it

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
how it works you gonna throw it take it

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.520 
how it works you gonna throw it take it
no<00:03:50.160> dang<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.970> but<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.300> you<00:03:51.569> saw<00:03:51.870> how<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.260> works

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
no dang it but you you saw how it works

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.790 
no dang it but you you saw how it works
so<00:03:53.130> that's<00:03:53.190> kind<00:03:53.490> of<00:03:53.550> risky<00:03:53.670> but<00:03:54.120> it's

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
so that's kind of risky but it's

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.340 
so that's kind of risky but it's
well<00:03:55.340> worth<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:56.270> when<00:03:56.660> you're<00:03:56.780> dead<00:03:56.960> doubting

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
well worth it when you're dead doubting

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.710 
well worth it when you're dead doubting
