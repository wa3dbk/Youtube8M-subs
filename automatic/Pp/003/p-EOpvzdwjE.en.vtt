going to be a huge benefit using Windows
8<00:03:33.870> ok<00:03:34.870> so<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:35.500> already<00:03:35.800> went<00:03:36.040> ahead<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.550> ran

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
8 ok so I already went ahead and ran

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.900 
8 ok so I already went ahead and ran
through<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:37.350> basic<00:03:38.350> setup<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:39.190> Acer<00:03:39.610> gives

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
through the basic setup that Acer gives

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.580 
through the basic setup that Acer gives
you<00:03:40.120> before<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:40.600> get<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.989> actually<00:03:41.350> start

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
you before you get to actually start

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.320 
you before you get to actually start
running<00:03:41.800> Windows<00:03:42.130> so<00:03:42.910> we're<00:03:43.180> going<00:03:43.270> to

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
running Windows so we're going to

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.900 
running Windows so we're going to
restart<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.900> computer<00:03:44.020> now<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:45.489> we<00:03:45.670> can<00:03:45.790> just

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
restart the computer now so we can just

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.930 
restart the computer now so we can just
