00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Hello dear spectators today I would like 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.160
 show you how to get the apps you like 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 downloaded through the stores too 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.210
 can install on ios apps 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.120
 You need the jailbreak for that 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.219
 so on ios six once the status 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.160

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.690
 version how they can get you 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.420
 is in the video description and the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.560
 iphone box that the download is thick 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.039
 Of course, in the video description 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.810
 available 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.489
 First of all, of course, you need one 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.099
 app on the iphone or ipod 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.500

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.480
 scoreless and choose your app through this 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.329
 function or by categories 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.670
 I now have the apps displayed 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.960
 I'm censored so I'm not advertising 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.720

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.610
 Anyway, you get problems 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.949
 then go to the page of the app and choose 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.699
 your download provider of in which their 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.320

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.530

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.390

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.160

 go over and start the iphone box 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.300
 You should not keep a note 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.330
 on the magnet icons during downloads 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.610
 So these are going to mine now 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.700
 information about the torrent download 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.260
 and if you want to know why 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.030
 so dangerous about torrents 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.190
 You are welcome to download 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.290

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.570
 Description done after you get the app 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.729

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:51.720
 wait for your ipad or iphone 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.630

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.090
 then you see many categories like camera 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.720
 Etc 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.740
