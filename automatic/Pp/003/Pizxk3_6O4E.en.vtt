it's<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:57.780> really<00:00:57.989> expanding<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.710> think

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it's really really expanding I think

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.430 
it's really really expanding I think
even<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.820> recession<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:01.109> only<00:01:01.289> thing

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
even in the recession the only thing

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
even in the recession the only thing
that<00:01:01.590> really<00:01:01.739> did<00:01:01.949> expand<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
that really did expand in this on a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.390 
that really did expand in this on a
world<00:01:03.809> was<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> men's<00:01:04.439> fashion<00:01:04.799> industry<00:01:05.250> so

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
world was the men's fashion industry so

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.280 
world was the men's fashion industry so
there<00:01:05.790> was<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> lot<00:01:06.090> more<00:01:06.240> jobs<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.600> LeFort<00:01:06.960> for

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
there was a lot more jobs out LeFort for

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.020 
there was a lot more jobs out LeFort for
us<00:01:07.350> guys<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.310> problem<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.880> is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
us guys but the problem with that is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.359 
us guys but the problem with that is
again<00:01:09.479> there's<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.750> lot<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:10.080> competition<00:01:10.380> so

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
again there's a lot more competition so

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.250 
again there's a lot more competition so
you<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.060> kind<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> comes<00:01:12.780> hand<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.080> hand

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you know it kind of comes hand in hand

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.109 
you know it kind of comes hand in hand
so<00:01:13.470> I'd<00:01:13.619> say<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:14.909> it

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
so I'd say with that one you know it

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.850 
so I'd say with that one you know it
makes<00:01:15.270> no<00:01:15.390> difference<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:16.140> men<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.590> women

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
makes no difference really men and women

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.190 
makes no difference really men and women
this<00:01:17.180> competition<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.270> equal<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.110> know

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
this competition is equal and you know

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.679 
this competition is equal and you know
the<00:01:19.259> opportunities<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> say<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> same<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.210 

think<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.320> best<00:01:28.530> thing<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.070> better

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
think the best thing to do is do better

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280 
think the best thing to do is do better

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
is huge in London you know it's one of

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.280 
is huge in London you know it's one of
the<00:02:18.970> best<00:02:19.150> places<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.569> be<00:02:19.690> there's<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.170> much

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
the best places to be there's so much

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.260 
the best places to be there's so much
opportunity<00:02:20.800> out<00:02:20.830> there<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.760> yeah<00:02:21.910> I'd<00:02:22.060> say

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
opportunity out there so yeah I'd say

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.150 
opportunity out there so yeah I'd say
linens<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.750> perfect<00:02:23.110> place<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.290> be<00:02:23.560> but<00:02:23.800> also<00:02:23.980> I

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
linens a perfect place to be but also I

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.540 
linens a perfect place to be but also I
think<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.700> does<00:02:25.180> depend<00:02:25.480> on<00:02:25.600> your<00:02:25.750> look

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
think it does depend on your look

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.710 
think it does depend on your look
whether<00:02:27.550> what<00:02:27.790> country<00:02:28.209> you're<00:02:28.390> going<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.660> be

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
whether what country you're going to be

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:42.000 
whether what country you're going to be
best<00:02:28.959> suited<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.319> as<00:02:29.500> well<00:02:40.980> personally<00:02:41.980> I

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
best suited to as well personally I

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.680 
best suited to as well personally I
think<00:02:42.190> with<00:02:42.760> everybody<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.330> have<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.600> be

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
think with everybody you have to be

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.940 
think with everybody you have to be
realistic<00:02:44.019> you<00:02:44.290> have<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.470> take<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> long<00:02:44.920> hard

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
realistic you have to take a long hard

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.470 
realistic you have to take a long hard
look<00:02:45.220> in<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.459> mirror<00:02:45.550> which<00:02:45.910> obviously<00:02:46.360> we

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
look in the mirror which obviously we

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.670 
look in the mirror which obviously we
all<00:02:46.600> do<00:02:46.750> from<00:02:47.170> day<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.470> day<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.030> really<00:02:49.030> decide

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
all do from day to day and really decide

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.199 
all do from day to day and really decide
where<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.860> fit<00:02:51.130> in<00:02:51.280> within<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.970> modern

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
where you fit in within the modern

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.729 
where you fit in within the modern
industry<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.840> where<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.230> can<00:02:53.410> see<00:02:53.590> yourself

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
industry and where you can see yourself

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.460 
industry and where you can see yourself
being<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.790> for<00:02:55.000> me<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.360> would<00:02:55.780> see<00:02:55.959> I'm<00:02:56.200> slightly

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
being so for me I would see I'm slightly

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.770 
being so for me I would see I'm slightly
more<00:02:56.680> commercial<00:02:57.160> as<00:02:57.280> I'm<00:02:57.430> slightly<00:02:58.150> shorter

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
more commercial as I'm slightly shorter

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.350 
more commercial as I'm slightly shorter
than<00:02:58.810> some<00:02:59.170> models<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.160> slightly<00:03:00.670> bigger<00:03:01.030> and
