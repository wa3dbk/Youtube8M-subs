00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.690
 I agree with an excellent bubble cover that I am not just doing it 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.949
 burst but also to protect things 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:10.779
 then the processor 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.409
 we repeat, that is 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.309
 an ensemble brigands the 2000 and 100k servers 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.770
 tobacco multiplier unlocked if the processor works for leader count 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.569
 paul klee 3 4 giga breed 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.789
 for you it is the multiplier ranging from a minimum of 16 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.380
 land 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.179
 to a maximum of 57 then when 11 l ta tumbes clock ridi standard 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.660
 accent megahertz it is possible to reach the maximum theoretical frequency 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:44.730
 d5000 seven hundred thousand ezechiele I would say is not bad then as usual 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.140
 this is the heat sink 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.570
 and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.510
 live sport and what I said that absolutely to be avoided for cane corso 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.510
 years have also decreased the dissipating surface 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.130
 bless also the pasta of the thermoconductive pasta strips opens in pescara 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.540
 as you can see if it starts 1 clock 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.630
 forgive the first thing to avoid crap comments and this is the processor 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.190
 think how much technology 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.350
 in this small advice 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.490
 that the smallest 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.250
 but that even the most expensive so be careful in these things really are 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.549
 a concentrate 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.409
 of everything there is the world as will and how many fins how many micro fins 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.830
 and this 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.109
 it is an intel core 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:34.070
 to the few 2600k servers 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.130
 what we need to know about who is unique. professors 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.520
 I forgot all Mirafiori models and doors are the same 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.520
 for 2600k it's always that model 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.520
 almost all do not realize realize that they do not know that in almost 2 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.360
 overclocking 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.320
 a processor like this of parini chosen to sum the other poor 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.790
 there are professors who have a video for report editing and lower than 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.550
 other effects are processors that reach higher frequencies if there are 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.430
 they are processors that ask for a voltage at the same frequency 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.559
 minor then I understood the display cases in the den 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:14.279
 90 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.599
 d processor model actually are all different 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.049
 ef 15 practically 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.049
 bah culture boys but the substance mint luck charlie cannon processor that 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.699
 push adequately ok 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:35.619
 and these are truly ecocolordoppler in piazza corsera look at that pdf plot 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.119
 look at that on TV 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.159
 just from fear written maybe 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:45.849
 a fantastic design is a great sink too is a regards to 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.299
 ram if you are in doubt about the specifications on how to set them 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.869
 on the tracks always written all 2 3 4 gig 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:57.350
 health lottoced exemptions garzia 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.790
 The tension runs in Florence for all those who create infectious diseases website 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.899
 I'm already told that the company on google 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:10.149
 i have on wikipedia there is we are wasting time however the expectations are these 4 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:12.630
 numbers 9 10 9 27 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.880
 the most important one that the scratch that the first one in fact when I have 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.819
 sent a third-party site program 1866 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.430
 cl 9 i love refers to the first number 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.050
 the 50 times is the voltage we said you are princess designs 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.449
 recommended these 50 years 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:36.939
 photo the one I forgot about the grass manet from another time exists on 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:43.249
 issue of dual channel or tricia in the house of socket 1366 now 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:44.560
 let's not fool ourselves 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.240
 too much on the meaning of anal guaje but surely you know that you have two 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.640
 identical RAM banks that work in parallel is definitely more 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.879
 performance 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.359
 attention that these twitters depend 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.430
 unity over a always select orecchiette with large identical benches 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.069
 because they must be absolutely identical you can also combine them 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.539
 different ram sure but pay attention to you if there are no problems with 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:16.199
 incompatibility take for example I don't know veramene using six da 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.389
 1300 eng 3 the frequency of the highest drama surpasses that of the cubasat 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.099
 so let's take care that they sell these kits on purpose 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:30.900
 on purpose it was once not to create these types of incompatibility accounts ok ehm 

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:32.559
 ranma pearls 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.559
 let's say that it is all bravery livestream 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.039
 over the world. 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.270
 umbrellas 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.680
 look at the two discrete video cards 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.570
 in parallel is wonderful solar planets on our tables a lot and 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.330
 daisy on everyone's 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.389
 here's what random 560 ti 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.129
 it's weird video cards will tell me but why did you choose these realities 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:59.469
 only video cards 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:04.280
 on a single chip there are so many ok versions we can look at it 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.039
 for periti zoo date add us gigabyte dinner because it was really in so many types 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.110
 to receive sms select the fidelity of god and which complete version 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.570
 founder of the first of all the features 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.639
 that there are 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.400
 definitely select from 5 to 460 canon support to directx 11 and chat 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.780
 site helmet. 0 hearing also see above all from the point of view 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.160
 aesthetic that surely double Pope Saturday 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.290
 not bad 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.480
 poor collar red collar sink this event the roses but 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.420
 even the functional point of view this really looks like a card with 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.240
 an excellent dissipation we see 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.240
 here under tv tv 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.199
 this sink 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.770
 here is this heat sink heat pumps 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.930
 passive and then above all a double fan compared to the standards is 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.360
 surely a person rai stay for more heat the way way 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.300
 efficient 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.040
 evaluation cookies are 2 if the pdl ok 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.439
 harry potter chronology 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:12.729
 and lend to the hotel mirage dts video card that goes away 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:18.910
 a lesson we have 2 well indeed 4 complaints because to choose a sli 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:25.389
 surely I said it's a 560 80 to see the lyrics certainly these two 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:31.779
 together with Latin at the beach they are all overhead so if surely it will be 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:34.070
 sandra many constructions 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.099
 a connector here is the concealer 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:38.720
 speecy hayek stresso 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.830
 this is the collector where you go to enter 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.740
 davide, corrector of development 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.059
 eeeh how q5 we have 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.059
 2 db 

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:52.409
 a bg ahahah 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:55.409
 and also a hdmi 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.049
 then if the video stars and I think it's you 

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:05.029
 if you want to be a flash player. the video stars go and see that tv garba di 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.479
 more 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:07.409
 I can't say for sure 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:12.860
 3 when I say gabbana meaning. of themselves cover also the one to send away to 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.789
 check on various websites for you to enter year type performance 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:21.199
 what are the consumptions - and above all 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.839
 m 

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:27.459
 how to put on the heat here is how much heat they take away 

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:28.180
 there is 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.980
 well then we can give
