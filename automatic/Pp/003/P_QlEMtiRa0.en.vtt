00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
plastic stand that folds out and you

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.240 
plastic stand that folds out and you
know<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:18.840> sitting<00:00:19.080> up<00:00:19.140> right<00:00:19.350> now<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.920> it's

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
know it's sitting up right now and it's

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.269 
know it's sitting up right now and it's
about<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.820> don't<00:00:21.119> know<00:00:21.300> maybe<00:00:21.439> four<00:00:22.439> three

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
about I don't know maybe four three

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.279 
about I don't know maybe four three
inches<00:00:23.490> off<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.670> ground<00:00:23.820> or<00:00:24.630> from<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.960> table

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
inches off the ground or from the table

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.189 
inches off the ground or from the table
surface<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.769> you're<00:00:26.010> using<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.960> stand

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
surface that you're using so the stand

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.419 
surface that you're using so the stand
not<00:00:28.380> only<00:00:28.560> works<00:00:28.740> well<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> game

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
not only works well with the game

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.790 
not only works well with the game
because<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.510> controls<00:00:30.869> are<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> little<00:00:31.529> bit

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
because the controls are a little bit

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.490 
because the controls are a little bit
difficult<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.730> um<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.420> also<00:00:33.570> works<00:00:33.899> I've<00:00:34.200> got

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
difficult but um it also works I've got

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.560 
difficult but um it also works I've got
three<00:00:34.860> ways<00:00:35.010> other<00:00:35.640> ways<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.880> guys<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.450> use

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
three ways other ways you guys can use

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.660 
three ways other ways you guys can use
the<00:00:36.690> stand<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.950> think<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.520> could

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the stand with and I think it you could

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.840 
the stand with and I think it you could
probably<00:00:38.850> get<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> lot<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.629> use<00:00:39.750> out<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.850> so

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
probably get a lot of use out of it so

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.080 
probably get a lot of use out of it so
first<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.390> Netflix<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:44.129> isn't<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:45.000> not

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
first is Netflix and this isn't it's not

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.319 
first is Netflix and this isn't it's not
an<00:00:45.329> only<00:00:45.629> Netflix<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.710> also<00:00:47.329> intended

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
an only Netflix but it's also intended

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.819 
an only Netflix but it's also intended
video<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.239> any<00:00:51.420> other<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.750> your<00:00:51.829> III

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
video and you know any other of your III

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.069 
video and you know any other of your III
videos<00:00:53.129> from<00:00:53.309> last<00:00:53.520> year<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:53.820> well<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.960> can

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
videos from last year as well so you can

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.860 
videos from last year as well so you can
use<00:00:55.260> these<00:00:55.500> functions<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.219> I'd<00:00:57.059> say<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.690> works

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
use these functions and I'd say it works

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.139 
use these functions and I'd say it works
very<00:00:58.140> well<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.949> looking<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.730> something<00:00:59.910> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
very well I was looking for something to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.410 
very well I was looking for something to
put<00:01:00.329> my<00:01:00.510> 3s<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.190> while<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> was<00:01:02.670> watching<00:01:02.850> videos

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
put my 3s on while I was watching videos

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.289 
put my 3s on while I was watching videos
and<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.350> stand<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.979> helps<00:01:05.700> me<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.030> lot

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
and the stand just helps me out a lot

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.090 
and the stand just helps me out a lot
like<00:01:06.630> my<00:01:06.780> hands<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.260> get<00:01:07.409> cramped<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.950> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100

your<00:01:10.560> hand<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.010> long<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.970> now<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.450> have

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
your hand for that long so now you have

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.850 
your hand for that long so now you have
a<00:01:12.570> stand<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.200> that's<00:01:13.530> that's

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
a stand for that and that's that's

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590 
a stand for that and that's that's
pretty<00:01:14.070> nice<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.270> simple

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
pretty nice and that's just one simple

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.679 
pretty nice and that's just one simple
function<00:01:16.310> my<00:01:17.310> second<00:01:17.670> function<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
function my second function is as a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.140 
function my second function is as a
tripod<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.220> thing<00:01:20.400> works<00:01:20.670> very<00:01:21.030> well

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
tripod and this thing works very well

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.200 
tripod and this thing works very well
with<00:01:21.600> taking<00:01:21.990> photos<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.640> want<00:01:23.850> one

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
with taking photos if you just want one

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.399 
with taking photos if you just want one
shot<00:01:24.619> one<00:01:25.619> image<00:01:25.979> or<00:01:26.220> videos<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.270> well<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.659> it's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
shot one image or videos as well so it's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.810 
shot one image or videos as well so it's
going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.590> be<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.799> set<00:01:28.979> position<00:01:29.009> obviously

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
going to be in a set position obviously

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.429 
going to be in a set position obviously
because<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.210> can't<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.750> not<00:01:30.900> very<00:01:31.170> easy<00:01:31.290> to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
because you can't it's not very easy to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.590 
because you can't it's not very easy to
move<00:01:31.619> around<00:01:31.759> but<00:01:32.759> well<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.180> doesn't<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
move around but well it doesn't have the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.550 
move around but well it doesn't have the
rubber<00:01:33.810> feet<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.560> believe<00:01:34.700> but<00:01:35.700> um<00:01:36.290> for<00:01:37.290> taking

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
rubber feet I believe but um for taking

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.350 
rubber feet I believe but um for taking
pictures<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:38.100> your<00:01:38.189> AR<00:01:38.520> cards<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.119> such

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
pictures with your AR cards and such

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.560 
pictures with your AR cards and such
it's<00:01:39.720> pretty<00:01:40.560> darn<00:01:40.770> good<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:41.610> using<00:01:42.060> books

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
it's pretty darn good I was using books

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.410 
it's pretty darn good I was using books
again<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.979> books<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.180> stack

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
again just books you know just a stack
