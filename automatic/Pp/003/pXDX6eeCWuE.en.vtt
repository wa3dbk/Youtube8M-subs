00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
anyways we're gonna start off here with

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.100 
anyways we're gonna start off here with
Rainbow<00:00:10.950> Dash<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.490> with<00:00:11.880> Rainbow<00:00:12.210> Dash<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
Rainbow Dash and with Rainbow Dash the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.259 
Rainbow Dash and with Rainbow Dash the
hardest<00:00:13.440> part<00:00:13.650> for<00:00:13.889> her<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.059> bangs

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
hardest part for her is the bangs

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.760 
hardest part for her is the bangs
because<00:00:15.929> they<00:00:16.020> always<00:00:16.139> want<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.410> stick<00:00:16.650> up

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
because they always want to stick up

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.820 
because they always want to stick up
after<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.190> cut<00:00:17.400> them<00:00:17.580> out<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.880> certain<00:00:18.150> line

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
after you cut them out of certain line

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.460 
after you cut them out of certain line
now<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.100> need<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> do<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:21.470> take

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
now what you need to do for that is take

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.310 
now what you need to do for that is take
boiling<00:00:22.949> water<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.720> dunk<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.900> hair<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
boiling water and dunk the hair in the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.439 
boiling water and dunk the hair in the
water<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.070> just<00:00:26.099> brush<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.820> out<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.240> let<00:00:27.330> that

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
water and just brush it out and let that

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.750 
water and just brush it out and let that
sit<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.019> that's<00:00:28.349> all<00:00:28.529> got<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
sit and that's all got it like this it

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.170 
sit and that's all got it like this it
still<00:00:30.179> sticks<00:00:30.420> up<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.689> bit<00:00:31.130> but<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.460> think<00:00:32.850> it

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
still sticks up a bit but I think it

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.889 
still sticks up a bit but I think it
looks<00:00:33.210> fine<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> way<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.010> this

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
looks fine just the way it is like this

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.270 
looks fine just the way it is like this
might<00:00:36.899> play<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.559> more<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.920> future

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
might play with it more in the future

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.220 
might play with it more in the future
but<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:38.550> now<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:39.120> she<00:00:39.210> looks<00:00:39.390> fine<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.989> I

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
but for now I think she looks fine and I

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.369 
but for now I think she looks fine and I
did<00:00:40.410> borrow<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> side<00:00:41.040> part<00:00:41.280> here<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.260> to<00:00:43.260> get

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
did borrow the side part here and to get

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.810 
did borrow the side part here and to get
this<00:00:43.530> from<00:00:43.739> sticking<00:00:44.040> up<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.430> tucked<00:00:44.700> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
this from sticking up I just tucked it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.110 
this from sticking up I just tucked it
behind<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> wings<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.640> that's<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.969> with

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120

but<00:01:27.770> what<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> recommend<00:01:29.220> doing<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.790> best<00:01:30.119> way

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
but what I recommend doing the best way

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.429 
but what I recommend doing the best way
to<00:01:30.299> get<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:31.159> taking<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:32.280> finger<00:01:32.610> and

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
to get in is taking your finger and

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.890 
to get in is taking your finger and
wrapping<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> hair<00:01:34.770> around<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.220> finger

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
wrapping the hair around the finger

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.960 
wrapping the hair around the finger
before<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> need<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:38.850> all

know<00:01:48.420> why<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> tried<00:01:49.110> cold<00:01:49.320> water<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.740> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
know why but I tried cold water and it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
know why but I tried cold water and it
just<00:01:50.130> seemed<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.759> bit<00:01:50.909> harder<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.270> use<00:01:51.360> so

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
just seemed a bit harder to use so

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.469 
just seemed a bit harder to use so
anyways<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.640> wrap<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> hair<00:01:53.939> around<00:01:53.970> your

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
anyways so wrap the hair around your

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.420 
anyways so wrap the hair around your
finger<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.470> blow-dry<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.070> finger

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
finger and just blow-dry your finger

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.700 
finger and just blow-dry your finger
with<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> hair<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.320> did<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.590> for

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
with the hair on it and I did that for

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.800 
with the hair on it and I did that for
maybe<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.979> minute<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.579> then<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.390> slid<00:02:00.689> it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
maybe a minute and then I just slid it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.700 
maybe a minute and then I just slid it
off<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.590> that's<00:02:02.009> how<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.159> got<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.610> this

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
off and that's how I got it like this

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.419 
off and that's how I got it like this
that's<00:02:05.219> basically<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.509> rarity<00:02:07.429> so

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that's basically it with rarity so

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.589 
that's basically it with rarity so
anyways<00:02:08.729> next<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.840> Applejack<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:12.120> with

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.230 
anyways next we have Applejack and with
Applejack

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
Applejack

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.580 
Applejack
she<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.390> definitely<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.110> easiest<00:02:16.350> one<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
she is definitely the easiest one to

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.050 
she is definitely the easiest one to
style<00:02:16.920> there's<00:02:17.130> not<00:02:17.250> much<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.580> say<00:02:17.730> about<00:02:17.760> her

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
style there's not much to say about her

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.570 
style there's not much to say about her
because<00:02:18.570> all<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.860> really<00:02:20.070> do<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.400> put

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
because all you have to really do is put

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.570 
because all you have to really do is put
the<00:02:20.670> bangs<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:22.380> let<00:02:22.890> some<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.280> I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
the bangs and I just let some of this I

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.720 
the bangs and I just let some of this I
just<00:02:23.850> took<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.630> band<00:02:24.900> off<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.680> let<00:02:26.430> some<00:02:26.610> of

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
just took this band off and let some of

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.940 
just took this band off and let some of
this<00:02:26.790> hair<00:02:27.000> loose<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.450> cut<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.440> then<00:02:28.830> just

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
this hair loose and cut it and then just

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.080 
this hair loose and cut it and then just
place<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.700> band<00:02:29.910> back<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:31.430> however<00:02:32.430> what's

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
place the band back on however what's

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.940 
place the band back on however what's
really<00:02:33.330> hard<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.630> do<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:34.020> putting<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:34.770> back

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
really hard to do is putting this back

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.140 
really hard to do is putting this back
on<00:02:35.160> once<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.730> take<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.030> off<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:37.520> way<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.580> make

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
on once you take it off so a way to make

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.690 
on once you take it off so a way to make
it<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.450> bit<00:02:39.720> easier<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.950> make<00:02:41.460> sure<00:02:41.490> you

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
it a bit easier is just make sure you

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.160 
it a bit easier is just make sure you
wet<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.000> hair<00:02:42.150> before<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.750> then<00:02:42.840> put<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.140> back

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
wet the hair before and then put it back

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.530 
wet the hair before and then put it back

really<00:03:09.720> well<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.230> saying<00:03:10.440> she's<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.620> first

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
really well and saying she's the first

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.670 
really well and saying she's the first
one<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.100> did<00:03:12.200> now<00:03:13.200> uh<00:03:13.310> for<00:03:14.310> her<00:03:14.490> I<00:03:15.350> decided<00:03:16.350> to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
one I did now uh for her I decided to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.930 
one I did now uh for her I decided to
flat<00:03:17.040> iron<00:03:17.070> her<00:03:17.460> hair<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:20.070> gives<00:03:20.400> her<00:03:20.640> a

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
flat iron her hair so it gives her a

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.980 
flat iron her hair so it gives her a
nice<00:03:21.240> straight<00:03:21.930> effect<00:03:22.680> but<00:03:23.870> when<00:03:24.870> you're

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
nice straight effect but when you're

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.560

if<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.420> happened<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:49.110> what<00:03:49.710> I<00:03:49.740> did<00:03:50.070> is<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.660> just

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
if that happened is what I did is I just

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.080 
if that happened is what I did is I just
plugged<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.470> in<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.830> did<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.490> for<00:03:53.610> maybe<00:03:53.850> 30

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
plugged it in I did it for maybe 30

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.280 
plugged it in I did it for maybe 30
seconds<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.570> I'm<00:03:54.660> plugged<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:54.990> and<00:03:55.110> I<00:03:55.140> just

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
seconds and I'm plugged in and I just

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.600 
seconds and I'm plugged in and I just
continued<00:03:55.740> it<00:03:55.830> like<00:03:56.010> that<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.340> then<00:03:56.460> when<00:03:56.580> I

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
continued it like that and then when I

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.040 
continued it like that and then when I
got<00:03:56.760> cold<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.120> just<00:03:57.150> repose<00:03:57.630> them<00:03:57.780> back<00:03:57.900> in

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
got cold I just repose them back in

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.050 
got cold I just repose them back in
because<00:03:58.680> if<00:03:58.800> you<00:03:58.890> get<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.100> too<00:03:59.250> hot<00:03:59.280> something

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
because if you get it too hot something

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.790 
because if you get it too hot something
bad<00:04:00.180> might<00:04:00.390> happen<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:00.870> that's<00:04:01.440> definitely

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
bad might happen and that's definitely

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.000 
bad might happen and that's definitely
wouldn't<00:04:02.400> be<00:04:02.490> good<00:04:02.730> if<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.540> happened<00:04:04.110> that's

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
wouldn't be good if that happened that's

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.210 
wouldn't be good if that happened that's
basically<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.640> with<00:04:06.270> Fluttershy<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.410> last

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
basically it with Fluttershy and last

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.850 
basically it with Fluttershy and last
