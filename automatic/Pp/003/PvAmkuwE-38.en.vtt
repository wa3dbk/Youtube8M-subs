00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.310
 very cross 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.750
 Welcome to the live 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.549
 here we are in the third episode of your 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.410
 pixelar this time we are at home 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.630
 emilio in cronos and good is going to 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.279
 teach your pixelar are going to hallucinate is 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.890
 very impressive and even a pixel ar 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.740
 pretty weird the truth is not so common 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.839
 like other things and good if you do not know what 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.939
 which is the 'yellow submarine' of the 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.759
 beatles that everyone will sound to us 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.030
 the yellow submarine and good is very very 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.820
 Nailed is exactly the same and the truth 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.370
 is that it is super well done and good 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.590
 As you can see, it is quite impressive what 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.570
 has mounted with a wool cap on top 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.950
 of water and good the truth is that it has 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.990
 remained an impressive result 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.410
 even there you see the propeller the propellers and 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.970
 that are in 3-d and good is amazing 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.770
 this pixel I'm going to take a spin 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.380
 see it from the back so that 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.850
 Look good as you have done and good 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.410
 As you can see, it's completely done with 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.730
 wool and some blocks from the bottom 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.640
 also to give a touch of red 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.070
 different and there you see it is impressive 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.509
 this pixel art and good the truth is that 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.579
 it has called me a lot of attention already 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.580
 that as I say you have to install more 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.740
 common there because what is Pokemon 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.840
 super mario those little things are 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.659
 it's more common to find but for 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.829
 example this yellow submarine the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.170
 'submarine yellow' of the beatles is 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.820
 much more complicated to see and good 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.860
 it has happened to me it seemed very clever 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.630
 It caught my attention and as you see 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.060
 It's pretty nailed, you just have to go 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.590
 to google and put the image of the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.080
 'yellow submarine' of the beatles and 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.780
 you're going to see what exactly is what 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.330
 what he has done and good is a job 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.049
 spectacular at least to pass it to 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.100
 pixel to pixel artÃ©s is very interesting and 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.090
 as I say the result is pretty 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.619
 shocking there it looks whole again and 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.360
 well the truth is that very very very 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.819
 interesting I want to thank you 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.490
 especially my dear subscriber 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.560
 for teaching me no and good to say it is 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.110

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.569
 already several times and well I hope that you 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.819

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.310

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.440
 thanks to million times for teaching us 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.910
 this pixel art and good as I say 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.920
 always share the pixel art with 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.870
