bunch<00:01:36.030> we'll<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.479> how<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.290> I'll

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
bunch we'll see how they do and I'll

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.770 
bunch we'll see how they do and I'll
spawn<00:01:37.650> more<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.579> battle<00:01:38.880> goes<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.689> his

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
spawn more in as the battle goes but his

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.630 
spawn more in as the battle goes but his
regeneration<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.829> good<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.400> spawn

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
regeneration is so good I have to spawn

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.980 
regeneration is so good I have to spawn
them<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.850> very<00:01:42.090> quickly<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:42.689> start<00:01:42.899> to

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
them in very quickly if they start to

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.510 
them in very quickly if they start to
die<00:01:43.110> off<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.070> go

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
die off but here we go

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.399 
die off but here we go
and<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.909> thing<00:01:45.060> about<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> nightmare<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.990> on

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and the thing about the nightmare is on

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.780 
and the thing about the nightmare is on
the<00:01:46.530> spawning<00:01:46.920> actually<00:01:47.250> spawns<00:01:47.549> them<00:01:47.700> in

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the spawning actually spawns them in

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.789 
the spawning actually spawns them in
randomly<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.840> gum<00:01:49.049> there's<00:01:49.290> different

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
randomly like gum there's different

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.020 
randomly like gum there's different
nightmares<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.220> different<00:01:50.520> strengths<00:01:50.939> that

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
nightmares of different strengths that

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.450 
nightmares of different strengths that
from<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.479> 75<00:01:52.020> hit<00:01:52.200> points<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.500> 600<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:53.369> yeah

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
from like 75 hit points to 600 but yeah

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.679 
from like 75 hit points to 600 but yeah
here<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.640> go<00:01:53.729> hopefully<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.210> get<00:01:54.299> some<00:01:54.509> really

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
place so we need to spawn in a lot of

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.120 
place so we need to spawn in a lot of
nightmares

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
nightmares

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.059

figured this was the only way we could

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.960 
figured this was the only way we could
possibly<00:02:25.900> set<00:02:26.410> up<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.680> battle<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.250> know<00:02:27.670> so

like<00:05:18.840> this<00:05:19.140> he<00:05:19.410> actually<00:05:19.710> breaks<00:05:19.950> blocks<00:05:20.280> but

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
like this he actually breaks blocks but

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.920

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
luckily thank God this mob does not

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.110 
luckily thank God this mob does not
break<00:05:22.050> obsidian<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.860> out<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.760> open<00:05:24.030> they

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
break obsidian and out the open they

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.550 
break obsidian and out the open they
knock<00:05:24.300> him<00:05:24.450> back<00:05:24.480> so<00:05:24.840> far<00:05:25.110> I'd<00:05:25.290> just<00:05:25.440> be

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
knock him back so far I'd just be

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.110 
knock him back so far I'd just be
chasing<00:05:26.100> him<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.340> whole<00:05:26.490> time<00:05:26.730> and<00:05:26.910> it<00:05:27.000> really

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
chasing him the whole time and it really

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.880 
chasing him the whole time and it really
wouldn't<00:05:27.480> work<00:05:27.600> out<00:05:27.720> that<00:05:27.960> good<00:05:27.990> so<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:28.650> figured

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
wouldn't work out that good so I figured

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.950 
wouldn't work out that good so I figured
this<00:05:28.980> was<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.220> best<00:05:29.400> way<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.580> do<00:05:29.820> it<00:05:29.970> and<00:05:30.150> seems

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
this was the best way to do it and seems

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.590 
this was the best way to do it and seems
to<00:05:31.020> work<00:05:31.200> out<00:05:31.320> pretty<00:05:31.500> well<00:05:31.680> the<00:05:32.340> decking<00:05:33.060> with

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
to work out pretty well the decking with

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.450 
to work out pretty well the decking with
all<00:05:33.810> his<00:05:33.900> might<00:05:34.110> he's<00:05:34.200> out<00:05:34.320> of<00:05:34.410> 1600<00:05:35.070> gonna<00:05:35.340> add

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
all his might he's out of 1600 gonna add

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.720 
all his might he's out of 1600 gonna add
a<00:05:35.490> few<00:05:35.760> more<00:05:35.790> in<00:05:36.150> or<00:05:36.510> it's<00:05:36.660> gonna<00:05:36.810> take<00:05:37.080> forever

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
a few more in or it's gonna take forever

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.030 
a few more in or it's gonna take forever
all<00:05:38.730> right<00:05:38.850> here<00:05:38.940> we<00:05:39.000> go<00:05:39.350> so<00:05:40.350> he<00:05:40.440> looks<00:05:40.740> like<00:05:40.890> he

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
all right here we go so he looks like he

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.850 
all right here we go so he looks like he
is<00:05:41.070> killable<00:05:41.820> barely<00:05:42.510> how<00:05:43.200> you<00:05:43.260> do<00:05:43.620> it<00:05:43.740> and

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
is killable barely how you do it and
