which runs the length of the arm allows
a<00:00:46.780> massive<00:00:47.320> amount<00:00:48.040> of<00:00:48.130> air<00:00:48.340> to<00:00:48.489> be<00:00:48.610> flown<00:00:48.880> up

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
a massive amount of air to be flown up

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.270 
a massive amount of air to be flown up
into<00:00:49.450> the<00:00:49.540> arm<00:00:49.690> you've<00:00:50.410> got<00:00:50.559> big<00:00:50.770> adjusters

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
into the arm you've got big adjusters

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.819 
into the arm you've got big adjusters
here<00:00:51.460> so<00:00:52.360> you<00:00:52.450> can<00:00:52.600> get<00:00:52.750> those<00:00:52.899> vents<00:00:53.290> nice<00:00:53.590> and

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
here so you can get those vents nice and

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.940 
here so you can get those vents nice and
open<00:00:54.070> so<00:00:54.250> pop<00:00:54.969> stud<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:55.450> velcro<00:00:56.290> adjusters

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
open so pop stud and velcro adjusters

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.389 
open so pop stud and velcro adjusters
and<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.570> zip<00:00:58.780> works<00:00:59.350> from<00:00:59.590> both<00:00:59.770> ends<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.309> you

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
and the zip works from both ends so you

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.979 
and the zip works from both ends so you
can<00:01:00.579> get<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.969> amount<00:01:01.210> of<00:01:01.300> airflow<00:01:01.510> through

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
can get the amount of airflow through

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.049 
can get the amount of airflow through
the<00:01:02.020> arm<00:01:02.260> exactly<00:01:02.890> right<00:01:03.340> for<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.610> conditions
