00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.359 
the tooth in the second part that I need
for<00:01:39.649> sure<00:01:39.829> is<00:01:40.069> a<00:01:40.520> piece<00:01:40.880> that<00:01:41.319> you<00:01:42.319> will<00:01:42.919> a<00:01:43.130> loop

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
for sure is a piece that you will a loop

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.940 
for sure is a piece that you will a loop
at<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:43.609> top<00:01:43.729> so<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.779> can<00:01:44.990> put<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.619> cord

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
at the top so that you can put a cord

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.769 
at the top so that you can put a cord
through<00:01:46.249> there<00:01:46.459> and<00:01:47.679> that's<00:01:48.679> usually<00:01:48.950> pretty

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:49.779 
through there and that's usually pretty

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:55.899 
through there and that's usually pretty
pretty<00:01:50.779> sturdy<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:55.310> you<00:01:55.369> don't<00:01:55.609> want<00:01:55.789> this

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
pretty sturdy so you don't want this

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.340 
pretty sturdy so you don't want this
part<00:01:56.179> to<00:01:56.209> be<00:01:56.450> too<00:01:56.869> thin

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.260 

but<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:02.890> also<00:02:03.040> don't<00:02:03.310> want<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.790> be<00:02:04.060> too

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
but you also don't want it to be too

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.539 
but you also don't want it to be too
thick<00:02:05.170> because<00:02:05.380> there<00:02:05.799> again<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.189> get<00:02:06.369> real

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
thick because there again you get real

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.270 
thick because there again you get real
bulky<00:02:06.939> real<00:02:07.540> fast<00:02:07.960> fold<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.709> in<00:02:08.800> half<00:02:09.240> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
bulky real fast fold it in half and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.500 
bulky real fast fold it in half and
decide<00:02:12.280> which<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.670> front<00:02:12.940> which<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
decide which is the front which is the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.680 
decide which is the front which is the
back<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.560> back<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:16.120> I'm<00:02:16.420> going<00:02:16.630> to

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
back this is the back so I'm going to

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:29.830 
back this is the back so I'm going to
add<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:19.120> loop<00:02:19.480> on<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.230> back

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.720 

now<00:02:30.500> I'm<00:02:30.769> gonna<00:02:30.890> bring<00:02:31.160> them<00:02:31.340> over<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.700> top

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
now I'm gonna bring them over the top

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:43.119 
now I'm gonna bring them over the top
with<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:33.640> skewer<00:02:36.430> right<00:02:37.430> there<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:42.129> then

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129

with this skewer right there and then
I'm<00:02:43.340> going<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.550> wrap<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:44.150> around<00:02:46.629> and<00:02:47.629> wrap

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
that is good and attached and it

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.990 
that is good and attached and it
certainly<00:03:02.959> will<00:03:03.319> be<00:03:04.390> now<00:03:05.390> on<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.810> front<00:03:06.079> I

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
certainly will be now on the front I

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.559 
certainly will be now on the front I
