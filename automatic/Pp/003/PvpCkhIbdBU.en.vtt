00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.340
 hello to everything today we are going to make a 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.150
 zipper bracelet the end result 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.510
 will be 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.510
 efe 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.340
 for this we need a zipper 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.150
 pliers 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.280
 zippers 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.090
 a lighter 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.090
 and beads 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.270
 and these are the arms you look 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.810
 this type 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.580
 all right 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:47.200
 you sell the trinket and the pins because 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.180
 the hooks we had bought are a 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.490
 little short then to put the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:57.780
 beads and uses them 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.860
 to rents of heads and by the word 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.660
 do not worry about what we serve 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.510
 bought in Chinese set packaging 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.990
 best known is worth now we design the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.990
 process 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.310
 we continue adding with care 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.299
 we open the zipper at the tip 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.990
 we will take care of it and it will be the most 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.990
 own 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:22.810
 greenmarking the reference of privacy 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.810
 if the first question to not have me 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.910
 is 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.910
 d 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.910
 here 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:41.260
 it was necessary to round the edges 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.920
 but good to have 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.970
 it burns 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.970
 and it has the same effect 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.700
 We have a little plan with the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.700
 habitat 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.110
 we want to find a little 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.110
 surely much easier and 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.110
 we come back 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.450
 A) Yes 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.769
 squeezing 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.750
 Y 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.460
 the next step is to place the flag 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.090
 of euros and we will place it 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.629
 inside him they have wanted 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.000
 with your car that does not exhaust a bit of 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.459
 I work with what was said on the subject of 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.560
 quite small but good let's hope 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.310
 for the next time we have the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.520
 brooches a little bit bigger 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.520
 we turn to the other also 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.090
 we did 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.160
 to me 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.080
 and this day 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.080
 here 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:55.640
 with a spoon almost finished 2 and it would be 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.640
 mount the beading pins 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.220
 and the little figure 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.900
 here we have now we have already taken a 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.900
 head row 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.860
 easy 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:29.819
 we have caught a butterfly activity 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.330
 and one of the best I had for 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:35.689
 house in a drawer I have introduced the 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.689
 hake 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.090
 variety 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.070
 a few colorful beads 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.210
 it closes a little bit is turned with the 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:56.770
 alice el ganchito 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.770
 and now the time to put it 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.910
 you have several options once it would be 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.910
 place it here but I like nothing 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.130
 and so 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.160
 I hope that now go signatures I like it
