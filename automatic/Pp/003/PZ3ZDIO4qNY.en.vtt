00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.480
 The first thing I talked to them was that 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.150
 We should not be quiet 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.160
 we could despair 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.009
 I think we were playing well 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.180
 we just need to play a little 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.480
 faster from the middle forward 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.590
 take advantage of the spaces left by the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.859
 boy backstroke skirts 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.330
 perea think there are many spaces 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.070
 among others, we take advantage of 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.080
 space we win always cost by 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.170
 the Julian side that was something that 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.809
 I also told them to do and that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.449
 we press a little in defense we 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.559
 that we let receive so free 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.979
 escobar because with his speed and is already 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.390
 complicated and I think we got it 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.280
 we remove the ball is cali its very 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.960
 fast and has also said with a 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.940
 great effort in the first time and it 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.710
 they were staying physically or own 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.330
 he was going to throw only with télam 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.890
 international team because the first 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.890
 23 dates here in this room 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.210
 We can already say that at a national level 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.890
 international is accomplishing what you 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.890
 wants for him to london 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.210
 let's say the players are going 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.460
 acquiring the level what 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.820
 what makes them stop them a good 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.850
 performance from the beginning I've always 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.700
 said that with 20 30 workouts is 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.259
 very little more or less reaching 70 do 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.520
 of trainings at the club the 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.520
 ghana players wanted their 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.119
 real performance is not, they are not 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.520
 taking more than the tactical system or 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.810
 anything else is the performance of 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.759
 the players that are going up and when 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.229
 they have a team with achieving a high 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.450
 performance by using any 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.909
 system 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.250
 wilson good evening what were the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.659
 major discomforts he found 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.479
 I jumped all over the first time 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.280
 in front of the Cali sports team and how 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.289
 you're going to a real one they made a 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.659
 concept about how he goes wilder medina 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.819
 when he has a forward accompanying him 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.530
 maybe it 's more effective when I work 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.940
 little bit more prosperous than when 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.360
 grinds inside as the cali said in the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.780
 first time 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.120
 let's say in the first time and without leaving 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.530
 to present it on our court 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.540
 he gets well with order 41 andrés pérez 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.879
 there ahead of the other 4 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.409
 covering noting all the exits and each 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.120
 Once he recovers the value they attacked us 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:36.439
 fast taking advantage of the speed of 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.989
 escobar taking advantage of perea a bryant 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.040
 that was important to families that 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.129
 stories from the series of his experience 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.390
 it also complicated us a lot and that with 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.579
 what we try to correct for the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.640
 second time we needed to adjust the 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.159
 brands we made the frame I think 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.810
 that without having the forwards defined and 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.939
 not only wilder and look for them coming from 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.340
 back with bolivia and with omar we created 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:01.709
 options we create possibilities 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.850
 and there were societies at times with 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.060
 wilder and with my carlos 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.250
 in the second time when already entered 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.830
 agreement has more accompanying and 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.590
 out there the defects have to have a 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.000
 little more than 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.600
 be careful because it is not just one in 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.100
 tip but they are two but nevertheless 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.560
 condis carlos always arrives at the option of 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.060
 goal always has that possibility only 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.860
 that we are suddenly more poignant and more 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.690
 deep of the spirit the capital and 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.730
 physically in time an effort 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.310
 great we knew that he had to stay 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.090
 a little bit and that's how it was 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.250
 jefferson every opportunity he has 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.070
 had to enter 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.490
 I've always had chance of scoring by 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.550
 their speed create problems 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.850
 is finding its level things a 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.920
 little reading but you will get to santa 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.840
 faith but is finding its level and has 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.650
 tornado with important player and I think 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.830
 that up to all of which are 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.830
 important 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.349
 and what one can rescue is that 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.239
 you have to give him a necessary confidence 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.489
 so that a moment may come that 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.659
 can be a holder does not have to 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.010
 take advantage of the conditions of 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.629
 players and the speed of 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:19.039
 important versions of goal and consolation 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.039
 yes to any defense 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.350
 a while ago I was very much in a 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:36.620
 difficult situation but that for me is 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:38.840
 something very different the truth that has 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.630
 already achieved goals that have helped me 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.130
 happened in this life this year but 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.130
 Fortunately, they are fulfilling 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.280
 and the truth that that proved to be a 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.380
 goal because 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.600
 that gives me peace of mind that things 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.620
 they are doing well and the most important thing 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.620
 that the team added 3 points 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.350
 holding on 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:12.979
 well the truth is that the copy is that 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.979
 what I tell you 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.160
 of the goals I've done gives you a lot 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.930
 more confidence much more tranquility me 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.960
 I felt very calm when speaking 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.139
 of the ball 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.199
 the truth that I thank God every 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:34.389
 day that gives me recovery for playing the 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.389
 soccer again and make the most of 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.500
 and that makes it one of the parties of 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.620
 soccer sometimes many times do not you way 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.490
 too 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:54.240
 but good you have to take advantage of these 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.759
 opportunities before 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.900
 very easily so that all the 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.900
 feet of companies on earth 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.570
 as well as all the key after 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.280
 go losing we go back from this and good 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.280
 and that every day I feel much better 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.490
 good with these people 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:30.500
 efe 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.500
 all right 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:35.689
 we had been showing for many years 

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:35.689
 that I was good 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:39.469
 Thank you
