00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
know I feel like that's a little bit of

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.210 
know I feel like that's a little bit of
a<00:02:34.630> better<00:02:34.780> plan<00:02:35.050> but<00:02:35.620> they<00:02:35.709> half<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.070> field

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
a better plan but they half the field
