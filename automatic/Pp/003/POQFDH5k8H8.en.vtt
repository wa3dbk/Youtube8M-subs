 Samsung and Apple are getting more and more 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.550
 competition from phone book I think 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.219

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.660

 last time we were already quite too 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.930
 talk about the past which we call 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.590

 device is very impressed 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.579
 looked good performance though 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.320
 it just didn't come along with the top 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.110
 appliances filled with a little plastic 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.090
 that dear yes and you know slow sometimes 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.340
 but nevertheless great device 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.860
 with the p8 how actually it has 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.070
 device on all points to a higher 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.070
 raised 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.270
 I have to say it is a serious player 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.059
 that one is seriously really fun 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.250
 device to wear elmer acres conclusion 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.260

 it is it is stainless steel stainless 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.270

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.900
 that is nice, he also sees immediately 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.840
 that it is between one 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.220
 a device that is made is it 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.900
 aluminum 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.580
 the whole the whole housing is made of metal 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.300
 that is really agreeing whole 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.890
 premium 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.480
 the previous wash is made of glass and glass 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.040
 look very nice but you always have the 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.540
 fingerprint always on the cross 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.030
 very quickly this had 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.950
 yes very syria times very businesslike 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.420
 device and it fits comfortably in the hand 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.060
 the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.900
 the housing is the frame is something 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.250
 bulged 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.729
 yes you do with my easy in the hand 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.140
 he holds firmly is light in design 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.820
 really a top device 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.530
 it didn't drive that this is anything else 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.869
 then another and budget throughout this 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.060
 your real take your device for your a yes 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.430
 and that means the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.560
 cheaper than I would be your apple 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.120
 but do it so liked early yes 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.550
 that 500 euros 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.830
 that is the entry model they have then 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.780
 1000 golden rule float 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.940
 eat two versions with 60 looks and one 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.260
 with 32 give you can not stick 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.840
 you can go to brink so that is always the case 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.489
 easy tickets up to 128 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.700
 press figure there so that is 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.780
 anyway tasty but this is a 16 git 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.170
 models that come available in the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.780
 champagne colors and in gray yes 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.730
 champagne just girl like you see me 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.890
 may experience it, but I still like it 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.030
 why call it champagne but good and 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.400
 politeness above the same 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.989
 tête-a-tête about this phone and he 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.600
 said he is in terms of specs less than 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.489
 for example a samsung or an apple 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.950
 but you don't notice that in daily life 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.690
 use explainer cell of opception and this 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.190
 year yes well yes if you have the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.480
 specification list and with suit you will see 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.459
 that indeed indeed on the different 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.720
 might be a little less powerful 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.459
 then a galaxy s6 or an htc one m9 too 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.980
 the screen with the slightly lower resolution 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.390
 well before it's called but in the daily 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.519
 I just don't notice the stomach as being in it 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.019
 really going to be up pussy than your brand 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.700
 maybe that hapers a little faster 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.010
 but what is it our max cucina is 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.450
 paris games is going to run yes then if 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.920
 you have a very high frame rate 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.510
 continued and things like that but 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.030
 but multitasking but really hope so 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.660
 fast and web pages late for fast 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.290
 daily use 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.910
 ideal good ok and so for 500 euros 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.049
 you are so three four hundred whole 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.380
 cheap than at other top 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.430
 devices and run through less 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.540
 bookable 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.700
 yes that's a thing then you have to 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.010
 indeed yes you must or one steps 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.420
 yes yes to the I can and you 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.220
 conversation topic because always like me 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.260
 emerges get some people under 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.790
 the impression of the design and then she sees 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.030
 on the back are the odd neat little logo 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.799
 that yes 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.689
 yes the question is what is this yes that goes 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.370
 I just explain what he just did yes me 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.480
 now filled is just a route or I am me 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.920
 you my martini heard that 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.349
 screenshot 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.209
 that's one thing how we want you to feel 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.510
 distinguished from the competition and 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.209
 they do that through some nice fun 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.310
 add to the software 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.299
 find a home between well because I am there 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.680
 well i have a few reservations 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.360
 marine i think i'm one of the things 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.789
 what they do is a screen technology 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.260
 add that can feel the difference 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.440
 between a finger touch and a 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.180
 touch your knuckle 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.979
 ideal in theory because I will 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.660
 occur if your finger camera briefly 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.520
 to tackle 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.110
 for example you can do one then you should 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.300
 knuckles times to make up then manner 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.120
 immediately where you get a screenshot of we 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.199
 make even a whole does not marry 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.729
 super cool and save it twice 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.849
 drawing immediately made a screenshot of it 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:56.270
 a whole of your entire screen 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:58.250
 yes the problem is only that he is whole 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.849
 often do not know if it is the buttons or one 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.710
 fingers 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.229
 so we soothe the technical colony 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.400
 so i do very often when i get it 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.630
 center down notification center 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.000
 wants to pull that he then thinks it 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.500
 knuckle and then you get a blue one 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.510
 swipe your screen instead of that 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.789
 let the children pull forward it happens 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.889
 really 15 to 20 times a day 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.050
 and then it gets a bit bit 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.699
 frustrating the west likes to think about it 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.419
 after being super handy i would really like one 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:23.030
 can get used to it 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.570
 tap it on the wall at haha work 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.570
 are or 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.150
 yes and I have nowhere in the institution 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.229
 can find if shit can turn off 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.229
 and I kind of like that 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.389
 so you cannot switch off in the 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.460
 settings I want that a bit 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.880
 retailers worrying 20 pity acknowledged 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.880
 in or peer 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.419
 no it's just your finger you 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.580
 protect lies the same as one 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:53.150
 finger yes your nose is the same as 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.610
 shopping para i'm on that something else 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.570
 is another feature that is also fun 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.100
 alive 5 plus 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.620
 Yes 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.320
 the network connection is switching between 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.220
 the best connection available 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.660
 for you 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.820
 can put or different wifi 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.320
 are networks that also overlap you 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.810
 run mobile connections like that 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.100
 faster I would assures 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.750
 phone actually always a good one 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.490
 internet connection ok 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.020
 and sometimes you want to switch to the 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.340
 connections for you must log in and 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.260
 do you not then log in mind for that 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.910
 is a bit annoying but this in 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.350
 this nice they might need something more 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.980
 speak and then it is really one 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.320
 ideal function 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.790
 ok 500 euros for the device you can reach 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.710
 sting it is warm 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.210
 yes absolutely ok yes I do find one 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.320
 business you get make for your money 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.960
 you might not have the device with the 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.130
 highest specifications 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.420
 but a device that really it 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.820
 can easily join the 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.920
 top he quickly beautiful display 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.660
 camera is very good 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.270
 that may just show namely the 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.800

 seriously and from the mountain best mobile 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.930
