yet here's a nice pattern that we've
done<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.740> wall<00:00:26.269> which<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.689> crowd<00:00:27.960> of

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
done on the wall which is of a crowd of

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.820 
done on the wall which is of a crowd of
people<00:00:28.429> you<00:00:29.429> can't<00:00:29.640> see<00:00:29.990> very<00:00:30.990> well<00:00:31.470> because

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
people you can't see very well because

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.130 
people you can't see very well because
of<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.180> construction<00:00:33.180> equipment<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> way

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
of the construction equipment in the way

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.959 
of the construction equipment in the way
