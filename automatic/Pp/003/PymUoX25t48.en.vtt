00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.330
 rdg theft killing 11 committee representatives 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.550
 of name protection are mistreated 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.650
 stetten is good the first time 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.790
 that a zombie speaks to me on the ground and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.030
 generally we do not have much to 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.970
 say 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.320
 finally we take away a time you 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.090
 walk with arms stretched out towards us 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.930
 trimming it's not very engaging you 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.600
 are partly right 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.099
 the communication has not finally boosted 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.930
 short is not everything but I changed 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.760
 so if you read dying they are the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.529
 petition style not aiming to stop the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.320
 massacre of my congeners under the pretext 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.640
 our duel not believe you label 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.989
 to do that seems stunned 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.340
 dallas leads 30 of tombstones that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.110
 the other clinics will not eat me 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.860
 but the shadow of the bio you look at them 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.989
 three debates 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.250
 I do not leave them like the others in 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.520
 zombies it's not like a number 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.620
 presenting the you know more compact 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.199
 easy to hate the profile less 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.370
 aggressive yeah I'm not convinced if 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.660
 it turns out you're just a mutation 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.829
 strange that tries to put me in 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.550
 the bone no but it's not a song do 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.949
 not stay overnight 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.320
 it may be a way of speaking out 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.240
 of her but let me explain 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.590
 had not paid attention but 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.740
 knew liquid have trouble in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.740
 to convince 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.439
 go good wind and just add a 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.100
 mustache 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.350
 I did not want to put a monocle 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.360
 will make no less repulsive good and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.790
 of honor why so much contempt 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:33.210
 towards the bottom but because you are 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:36.030
 there because more and more frequent and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.960
 well it's the mind we stop playing 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.970
 on the word gossip I think that 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.250
 your rejection of the monstrosities of that the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.250
 fruit of your doors and yet they are 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:55.829
 and the teeth but you're still whose 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.090
 michel goodness or speculate and that's 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.860
 precisely because you love you are you 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.979
 risks not in pay their efforts 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.060
 the work we do not kill people 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.119
 make them swallow a spoon of 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.569
 through fucking working leather 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.970
 so attach ten others to meylan 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.580
 but I'm a bitch and not coming back so 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.580
 I am the first and me 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.680
 Oh 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:39.610
 no I think it's dead hail to 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.610
 rites
