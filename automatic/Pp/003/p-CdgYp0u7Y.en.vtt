00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.450
 good and welcome to the tasting channel 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.430
 I think it was here we are in a new 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.440
 video where we will analyze the different 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.360
 facebook pages in which it has 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.970
 been posted a 7 second video 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.890
 very but very striking but before 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.510
 start quickly I would like 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.970
 show you the last splash are that 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.390
 remained to be applied within the pp echo 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.070
 sandstorm skin that will cost 975 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.989
 riot points and obviously also 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.360
 we can get in a pack next to 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.070
 champion in terms of illustration I think 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.899
 that focus more on the whirlpool of 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.150
 sand that in the echo itself but in 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.860
 general lines is not bad and 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.860
 now we do start watching the video 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.740
 the first thing that came to mind 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.660
 after watching the video was 'jurassic park' 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.940
 but I sincerely doubt that I have 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.680
 a lot to see but who knows how 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.810
 You see the video takes place in the store 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.790
 on the red side where we see the potions 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.100
 of life and mana in addition to the object 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.170
 diabolical codex and a lot of coins 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.690
 at the end we see a shadow in which 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.460
 it passes just above the store this 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.200
 video has been published in a lot of 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.300
 official facebook pages the league 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.500
 of legends and what surprises me most are 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.479
 the phrases with which they have been 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.120
 published on the Spanish page 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.920
 they comment you have felt that the truth is 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.660
 that does not tell us much but you have to have 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.640
 consider the rest of the sentences of the 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.770
 different communities like for example 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.680
 French or Romanian in which 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.590
 we can read wait they arrive at the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.330
 French page and they come in Romanian what 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.550
 What has struck me most is that 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.380
 they speak in plural meaning they are coming 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.450
 the problem is that for now we do not know 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.490
 the one that many comment that can 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 be the yoga visual record the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.119
 which would make enough sense for the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.710
 footsteps but there are also 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.360
 other people who think that this 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.770
 video refers to the grand flange 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.720
 blanc and that the sound are the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.159
 explosions of its ultimate I do not rule out 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.049
 neither of these two options 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.880
 although I honestly do not think so 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.340
 Going back to the page sentence 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.319
 French wait they arrive we can 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.090
 stand before an invasion or an evil that 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.489
 approach the summoner's crack but 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.930
 who is or who is coming and I am sure 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.030
 that many of you will have 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.769
 hundreds of ideas so I would like that 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.910
 We will discuss this issue through the 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.590
 comments 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.540
 I honestly think that it is about 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.489
 an event although I do not rule out the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.080
 reborn visuals I do not know but there is already desire 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.819
 to know what it is and I'm sure that 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.250
 this week with the new cycle we will know 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.230
 something or that I hope so far the video 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.849
