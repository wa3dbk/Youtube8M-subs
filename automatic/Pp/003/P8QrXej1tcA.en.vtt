evidence themselves best victims ever so
that<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.519> sucks<00:03:07.880> but<00:03:08.239> uh<00:03:09.609> I<00:03:10.609> know<00:03:10.790> there<00:03:10.970> was

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
that that sucks but uh I know there was

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.490 
that that sucks but uh I know there was
a<00:03:11.090> reason<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.540> was<00:03:11.569> bringing<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.019> up<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.319> mean<00:03:12.470> I

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
a reason I was bringing that up I mean I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.900 
a reason I was bringing that up I mean I
guess<00:03:12.799> just<00:03:13.069> as<00:03:13.220> an<00:03:13.310> update<00:03:13.609> but<00:03:13.730> there<00:03:13.819> was

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
guess just as an update but there was

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.580 
guess just as an update but there was
some<00:03:14.060> way<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.180> was<00:03:14.359> gonna<00:03:14.660> segue<00:03:15.019> somewhere

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
some way I was gonna segue somewhere

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.069 
some way I was gonna segue somewhere
from<00:03:15.799> that<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:16.940> seem<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.180> have<00:03:17.299> lost<00:03:17.480> my<00:03:17.750> way

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
from that and I seem to have lost my way

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.080 
from that and I seem to have lost my way
because<00:03:18.440> I'm<00:03:18.769> stuck<00:03:19.160> there<00:03:19.340> oh<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.670> was<00:03:19.910> talk
