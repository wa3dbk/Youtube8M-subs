00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.220
 And suddenly, you also get a small guest 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.720
 and on the subject as already blessed 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.539
 for all those the left foot imprisonment is now finally on the criticism of the 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.659
 read through what - actually is 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.089
 I mean we have 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.590
 Everyone should know that we have 3 Grossman 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.690
 there are topics 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.880
 these are 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.970
 Kiel and yet users 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.450
 cover most of the part with the now released window version 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.930
 then we have the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.769
 User 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.490
 So where it fix 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.770
 Georg Barth Saint and what else is there 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.280
 now at 9 0 percent 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.650
 and then we have the NOKs users Lena it is absolutely free 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.229
 and thus for one or the other 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.129
 maybe a little netbook or something like that 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.200
 Interesting 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
 because you have no licenses to pay 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.910
 Hirschmann is sitting 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.520
 Trademark is and Julien 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.230
 and the first one or think about it when it comes to the ruins 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.160
 that's the following 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.050
 in fact 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.100
 I also have partial consequences of this k 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.100
 When i then 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.110
 AZ 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.280
 When I tried we did not discuss 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.710
 and 4 testers often after that test 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.030
 Bird just so important to push into the wall 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.410
 or me bad 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.220
 APA 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.120
 dpa 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.960
 it will 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.960
 In any case, we will be there for this site 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.500
 and around 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.620
 well 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.090
 this that i have my house 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.290
 meanwhile has 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.860
 sold though 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.800
 and all as 30 hotels as I did 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.720
 this one works all over 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.049
 Charles the store you can of course use other buttolo machens 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.749
 but Paroles just has shoes 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.529
 because I also have windows 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:27.299
 well knows over there to use quasi during the normal way now 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.209
 just draw now 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.579
 how it looks to me and indeed 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.969
 have you that according to ZAK 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.319
 Swivel over 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.479
 and that is here 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.750
 Perler Co 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.239
 he just see here 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.950
 I was in charge of this for the unit and they were squatting ++ up and running us 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.539
 program 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.279
 and this is Kubuntu now 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.959
 when I ask why this is such a weird format that's because 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.849
 that one Kubuntu 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.849
 van the man gets pretty weird resolution 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.619
 Well, if you cover it nationwide 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:07.019
 then i want to keep this fullscreen mode then you can do that too 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.469
 with as topics goes 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.169
 and Henzler 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.169
 next to it a miracle to switch mode 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.809
 but that's why I'm going to play this game here now 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.509
 and I would like to show you the team now 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:22.469
 that can be minimized 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.619
 and to get that done 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:25.929
 in Iraq 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:30.659
 Perlet Gibeau Making friends so virtual is Trier 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.959
 then I want my virtual machines here 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.959
 Here I have now I've deleted that now 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.529
 I can delete that sda 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:44.109
 Innauer Blersch 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.699
 So now I have May Bootcamp that is so enjoy Ubuntu Origin Lux 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.999
 that's what I think most of the time against Stalin and then there is 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.849
 another quorum of a coup and o cubon everyone has seen 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.389
 I need that to program c ++ 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.429
 around 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:06.209
 but how do you even click here for a nice list even 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.039
 Train region on plus 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.129
 and the parents here 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.769
 Fire in the ASV off 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.959
 for example here 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.249
 around Cook and o 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:20.669
 her son still out 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.009
 and 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.580
 Of course you can also use a bootcamp partitions and dahlias and 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.059
 However, you always have to afford enough smoke to install smoke 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.790
 b and we still have partition left a lot of disk space on it 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.830
 so he had about three gigabytes of storage space made as much as possible 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.279
 used to that's pretty good then you can click on computer 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.770
 and is the whole in English 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.059
 and 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:53.409
 Can Fanta and tried on the ground here she wants her best in Boston 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.449
 Direction Linux out of voice illogical something 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.430
 no idea but Linux 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.580
 OK, I was not there and then you can still between Take 2 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.340
 kassel 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.720
 So the choirs are the best 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.350
 Standard constellations and burglaries on Conti Mio and you will be here 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.939
 prompted to do the installation 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.559
 that's how easy it is and 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:21.490
 as soon as you have staged that 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.389
 there would have to be the normal - installation must do me now 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.120
 Do not draw shows that everyone can decide for themselves also comes 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.110
 on what services she has discovered on the Internet 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.729
 the whole thing should be a linux version the 4g 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.870
 Intel CPU is suitable 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.870
 because most netbooks, of course, have an interest Ki Moon 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.949
 big trouble she but that one percent 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.139
 not so easy 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.569
 via usb-stick as you may know it under Windows 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.099
 get a small boat where it just takes 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.259
 in there 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:57.199
 a book Skikes Linux on it 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.659
 yes on stores 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.379
 and then just a usb-stick connecting Neustadt becomes 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:06.559
 maybe holding down old and then trying out a basic boost expression 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:07.949
 and in it then Bobridge 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:09.509
 that does not work 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.710
 for that you have to get other programs and salads I have the whole thing 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.150
 I tried it unfortunately did not work out with me that has 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.729
 trimesters 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.900
 during the rehearsals 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.800
 while the boot up hung up 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.259
 the whole country probably on at the video card and around that did not have 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.150
 is working 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.930
 if it is new from a netbook has a bite the day and 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.040
 but you can use this because the MacBook easily 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.300
 like to look at the cards 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.770
 then about 2 needed the work of spe on memory on this sd card and 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.529
 then the whole thing could run on a sd-card slot 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.680
 for all those who want to follow the way I have done it, I have 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.180
 give you a little guide now the whole thing works of course 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.580
 Preliminary round with Charles and I have to say 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:03.020
 I'm currently working with stellen 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.869
 very satisfied 

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:09.049
 with a simple click one is here pressing these windows with Windows 

00:07:09.049 --> 00:07:12.439
 you can even make a nicer mode that you can just about that 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:14.699
 Window drives over it and then immediately 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:17.040
 the wound from abroad and then out again value 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.040
 Here you always have to be nonsense and the bridge 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:25.239
 as unwise advance and then you are done with the mouse again 

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:27.659
 Mac OS x 

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:31.080
 if you then repressed as 7ticks 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.060
 then the desktop is spinning and you want to find the mode in which you want 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.710
 public on the road but so can for those of you 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:39.770
 the 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.830
 always not enough then creeps - picture as on my Mac 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.339
 yes it is very easy 

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:49.139
 the easiest way - to get this year with Mac and I hope I could 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:52.110
 help you and a little bit about my experiences 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.639
 and now will inform 

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:58.749
 and the whole is over now and I wish you fun show
