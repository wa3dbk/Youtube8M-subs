00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
you know to all the effort and hard work

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.300 
you know to all the effort and hard work
that<00:01:08.289> every<00:01:09.289> member<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:09.649> team's<00:01:09.859> put<00:01:10.069> in<00:01:10.189> this

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.420 

I<00:01:18.780> think<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:20.380> circumstances<00:01:21.100> are<00:01:21.190> slightly

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
I think the circumstances are slightly

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.289 
I think the circumstances are slightly
different<00:01:22.409> last<00:01:23.409> year<00:01:23.830> we<00:01:24.760> made<00:01:24.790> lots<00:01:25.150> of

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
different last year we made lots of

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.850 
different last year we made lots of
mistakes<00:01:25.390> through<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.049> year<00:01:26.290> we<00:01:26.560> had<00:01:26.710> some

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
mistakes through the year we had some

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.280 
mistakes through the year we had some
unreliability<00:01:27.490> problems<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:29.080> or<00:01:29.200> two

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
unreliability problems one or two

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.830 
unreliability problems one or two
driving<00:01:29.590> mistakes<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.460> we<00:01:30.909> chucked<00:01:31.240> away<00:01:31.390> a

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
driving mistakes and we chucked away a

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.930 
driving mistakes and we chucked away a
lot<00:01:32.050> of<00:01:32.200> points<00:01:32.530> so<00:01:32.710> it<00:01:32.740> was<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.890> very<00:01:33.250> difficult

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
lot of points so it was a very difficult

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.660 
lot of points so it was a very difficult
year<00:01:34.240> where<00:01:34.570> we<00:01:34.690> had<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.840> quick<00:01:35.080> car<00:01:35.350> but<00:01:36.130> didn't

seem to be able to make that count at

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.660 
seem to be able to make that count at
times<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.540> result<00:01:40.869> was<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.670> sailing

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.680 
I haven't always had the fastest car but
we've<00:02:07.840> managed<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.140> keep<00:02:08.320> our<00:02:08.500> nose<00:02:08.679> ahead<00:02:08.860> and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
we've managed to keep our nose ahead and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.870 
we've managed to keep our nose ahead and
so<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:11.440> demonstrate<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:12.220> we<00:02:12.340> could<00:02:12.489> do<00:02:12.640> that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
so to demonstrate that we could do that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
so to demonstrate that we could do that
has<00:02:13.660> been<00:02:14.940> satisfaction<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.030> think<00:02:16.239> last<00:02:16.750> year

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
feel walking around the factory on

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:12.120 
feel walking around the factory on
monday<00:04:03.940> when<00:04:04.090> i<00:04:04.120> got<00:04:04.330> back<00:04:04.360> was<00:04:04.780> just<00:04:05.620> superb

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.210 

I<00:04:12.190> think<00:04:12.820> if<00:04:13.630> I<00:04:13.870> had<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:14.170> say<00:04:14.350> a<00:04:14.380> single<00:04:14.680> stand

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
I think if I had to say a single stand

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.390 
I think if I had to say a single stand
out<00:04:15.490> in<00:04:15.790> many<00:04:16.180> ways<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.600> would<00:04:16.690> be<00:04:16.840> Monza

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
out in many ways it would be Monza

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.160 
out in many ways it would be Monza
because<00:04:18.400> we<00:04:18.940> that's<00:04:19.570> not<00:04:19.840> been<00:04:20.050> a<00:04:20.080> happy

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
because we that's not been a happy

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.750 
because we that's not been a happy
hunting<00:04:20.440> ground<00:04:20.770> for<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.220> last<00:04:21.520> few<00:04:21.700> years

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
hunting ground for the last few years

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.300 
hunting ground for the last few years
and<00:04:22.030> being<00:04:22.300> off<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.600> pace<00:04:22.810> we<00:04:23.680> went<00:04:23.890> into<00:04:24.100> that

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
and being off the pace we went into that

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.240 
and being off the pace we went into that
race<00:04:24.900> fearing<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:25.930> we<00:04:26.080> would<00:04:26.380> be<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:27.220> would

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
race fearing that we would be it would

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.860 
race fearing that we would be it would
be<00:04:27.370> a<00:04:27.430> damage<00:04:27.790> limitation<00:04:27.970> race<00:04:28.570> that<00:04:28.750> we

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
be a damage limitation race that we

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.950 
be a damage limitation race that we
wouldn't<00:04:29.050> really<00:04:29.290> be<00:04:29.380> competitive<00:04:30.450> so<00:04:31.450> too<00:04:31.510> to

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
wouldn't really be competitive so too to

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.170 
wouldn't really be competitive so too to
qualify<00:04:32.140> on<00:04:32.530> pole<00:04:32.770> there<00:04:33.040> and<00:04:33.250> for<00:04:33.700> Sebastian

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
qualify on pole there and for Sebastian

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.670 
qualify on pole there and for Sebastian
to<00:04:34.470> disappear<00:04:35.470> in<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.680> race<00:04:35.830> was<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:37.680> great

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
to disappear in the race was a great

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.840 
to disappear in the race was a great
surprise<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:39.160> I<00:04:39.430> think<00:04:39.580> it's<00:04:39.670> those

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
surprise and I think it's those

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.910 
surprise and I think it's those
surprises<00:04:40.270> that<00:04:40.720> always<00:04:41.200> become<00:04:41.680> most

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
surprises that always become most

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.840 
surprises that always become most
memorable<00:04:42.840> crikey<00:04:44.220> Monza<00:04:45.220> was<00:04:45.370> very<00:04:45.580> special

memorable crikey Monza was very special

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.790

time in spa and achieve a 12 there after

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.670 
time in spa and achieve a 12 there after
the<00:05:04.210> problems<00:05:04.510> we<00:05:04.600> had<00:05:04.750> in<00:05:04.780> Istanbul<00:05:05.410> last

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
the problems we had in Istanbul last

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.070 
the problems we had in Istanbul last
year<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:06.640> go<00:05:06.790> back<00:05:07.030> and<00:05:07.240> get<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.360> 12<00:05:07.630> this<00:05:08.020> year

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
year to go back and get a 12 this year

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.230 
year to go back and get a 12 this year
in<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:09.070> manner<00:05:09.250> that<00:05:09.340> we<00:05:09.520> did<00:05:09.700> as<00:05:09.790> well<00:05:09.940> so

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
in the manner that we did as well so

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:22.500 
in the manner that we did as well so
it's<00:05:10.750> hard<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.110> hard<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:11.980> name<00:05:12.160> one

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.430 

I<00:05:22.740> think<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:24.100> key<00:05:24.580> thing<00:05:24.610> is<00:05:25.090> that<00:05:25.960> now<00:05:26.110> we<00:05:26.170> can

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
I think the key thing is that now we can

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.370 
I think the key thing is that now we can
just<00:05:26.590> go<00:05:26.770> out<00:05:26.950> and<00:05:27.190> enjoy<00:05:27.460> each<00:05:27.790> race<00:05:28.090> and<00:05:28.840> see

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
just go out and enjoy each race and see

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.160 
just go out and enjoy each race and see
how<00:05:29.530> he'd<00:05:29.740> you<00:05:30.220> know<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:31.150> results<00:05:31.300> will<00:05:31.720> be<00:05:31.750> as

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
how he'd you know the results will be as

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.380 
how he'd you know the results will be as
they<00:05:32.920> are<00:05:32.950> but<00:05:33.430> we<00:05:33.700> haven't<00:05:33.880> got<00:05:34.360> that

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
they are but we haven't got that

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.200 
they are but we haven't got that
constant<00:05:35.230> background<00:05:35.440> pressure<00:05:36.010> of<00:05:36.340> trying

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
constant background pressure of trying

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.110 
constant background pressure of trying
to<00:05:37.420> keep<00:05:38.340> thinking<00:05:39.340> of<00:05:39.400> the<00:05:39.520> championship<00:05:39.970> all

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
to keep thinking of the championship all

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.120 
to keep thinking of the championship all
the<00:05:40.150> time<00:05:40.420> we<00:05:40.600> can<00:05:40.750> just<00:05:40.930> go<00:05:41.380> out<00:05:41.560> and<00:05:41.740> enjoy<00:05:41.830> it

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
the time we can just go out and enjoy it

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.480 
the time we can just go out and enjoy it
and<00:05:42.310> if<00:05:43.000> we<00:05:43.180> win<00:05:43.360> we<00:05:43.590> win<00:05:44.590> if<00:05:44.980> we<00:05:45.130> don't<00:05:45.310> we

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
and if we win we win if we don't we

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.330 
and if we win we win if we don't we
don't<00:05:45.700> it's<00:05:46.540> it's<00:05:46.960> not<00:05:47.200> as<00:05:47.410> ki<00:05:47.680> as<00:05:47.710> the

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
don't it's it's not as ki as the

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.630 
don't it's it's not as ki as the
championship<00:05:49.140> pressure<00:05:50.280> mounting<00:05:51.280> up<00:05:51.400> over

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
championship pressure mounting up over

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.780 
championship pressure mounting up over
the<00:05:51.730> last<00:05:51.910> few<00:05:52.120> races<00:05:52.680> so<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:54.070> think<00:05:54.430> looking

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
the last few races so I think looking

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.480 
the last few races so I think looking
forward<00:05:55.360> some<00:05:55.890> purely<00:05:56.890> on<00:05:57.070> essentially

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
forward some purely on essentially

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.910 
forward some purely on essentially
enjoyment<00:05:57.760> terms<00:05:58.690> of<00:05:58.870> India<00:05:59.230> as<00:05:59.350> a<00:05:59.380> grand<00:05:59.650> prix

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
enjoyment terms of India as a grand prix

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.270 
enjoyment terms of India as a grand prix
then<00:06:00.300> always<00:06:01.300> good<00:06:02.290> to<00:06:02.470> go<00:06:02.620> to<00:06:02.680> a<00:06:02.800> new<00:06:03.010> circuit

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
then always good to go to a new circuit

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.490 
then always good to go to a new circuit
to<00:06:03.640> a<00:06:03.670> new<00:06:03.820> continent<00:06:04.390> I've<00:06:04.960> not<00:06:05.260> been<00:06:05.440> to

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
to a new continent I've not been to

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.620 
to a new continent I've not been to
India<00:06:05.860> for<00:06:06.100> some<00:06:06.340> very<00:06:07.030> much<00:06:07.270> looking<00:06:07.570> forward

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
India for some very much looking forward

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.960 
India for some very much looking forward
to<00:06:07.900> that<00:06:08.080> and<00:06:08.260> on<00:06:08.830> a<00:06:08.890> personal<00:06:08.980> note<00:06:09.430> taking<00:06:09.940> a

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
drivers have found it quite challenging

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.620 
drivers have found it quite challenging
and<00:06:22.150> enjoyable<00:06:22.510> lots<00:06:23.170> of<00:06:23.380> undulations<00:06:23.860> and

good<00:06:29.200> for<00:06:29.350> spectating<00:06:29.770> I<00:06:30.010> think<00:06:31.050> so<00:06:32.050> yes

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
good for spectating I think so yes

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.720 
good for spectating I think so yes
looking<00:06:32.950> forward<00:06:33.100> to<00:06:33.190> getting<00:06:33.280> out<00:06:33.520> there

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
looking forward to getting out there

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
think it's going to be a really good

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.110 
think it's going to be a really good
circuit<00:06:38.500> from<00:06:38.590> what<00:06:38.770> we've<00:06:38.920> seen<00:06:38.950> it's<00:06:39.910> to<00:06:40.000> be

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
circuit from what we've seen it's to be

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.840 
circuit from what we've seen it's to be
fascinating<00:06:40.570> to<00:06:40.600> go<00:06:40.750> to<00:06:40.810> India<00:06:41.070> and<00:06:42.070> yeah<00:06:42.820> I

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
fascinating to go to India and yeah I

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.670 
fascinating to go to India and yeah I
