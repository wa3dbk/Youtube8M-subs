00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.549
 brought the TV and now we want it 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.649
 hang on mount mount bought 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.740
 we have a lot of them in the shop 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.280
 spread out faith choose any i say 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.350
 so that they come up to any fit well 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.000
 as any need to see we are the opposite 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.949
 side did not even look because u 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.720
 They did not have any cost nothing 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.689
 the store is huge even connect 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.410
 it was impossible to watch TV 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.039
 see and how can we actually 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.009
 brought up 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.660
 attached to the table and all connected 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.730
 nothing else should you but they could not 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.340
 find to stick look transfer 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.950
 so watch TV in the store 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.950
 check it we waved some grabbed 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.550
 you ran away the same mount for yourself 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.350
 just so randomly took the mount and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.160
 Imagine this mount only 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.160
 which came up 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.410
 we were in Yaroslavl 120 kilometers 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.629
 drove came home and this mount 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.320
 would fit another mount she would 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.550
 didn't fit 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.140
 And we were told to choose any but now 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.080
 securing the mount ie frame 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:16.290
 I'll show you on the wall now 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:19.920
 secured and taken and fixed so here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.400
 way once and entrenched now this 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.400
 cord 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:32.720
 now see how it turns out here 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:37.880
 the flip side is this flat it 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.060
 the mount is well attached here this one 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.790
 the speakers here this part is convex fastens 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.630
 hydrochloric impossible impossible possible 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.790
 bend this side here where 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.470
 is inside the speaker and to 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.910
 It turned out all right have 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.070
 of course install these here 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:01.300
 bearings bearing here to install 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:04.640
 we will try as I will 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.950
 look like this 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.910
 twist so that the speaker does not interfere 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.910
 and no one explains anything and for some reason 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.250
 to this 0 attention to this dynamic though 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.770
 I said that there were no problems they did not 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.070
 there will be no problems 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.070
 problem 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.090
 and try to twist here rescued 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.799
 bearings there would be no bearings i don't 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:52.129
 I know and I would have to look for something 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:52.129
 but the bearings clearly fit all 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:02.300
 It turned out great for the speaker is not 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.300
 cling cool 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.880
 and so that everything is the same and now this 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.880
 side to twist 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.110
 why do not know why it happened 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.510
 Is it a mistake or something? 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:33.310
 explains nobody says project 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.310
 - bought it take and how to collect 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.950
 here 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:24.860
 it was very bad with one hand 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.190
 used to shoot a film with one hand 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:33.080
 I understand very hard all secured 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.940
 secured only with the help of these 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:41.300
 bearings do you fancy 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:43.630
 and now here so now and here it is 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.190
 little dog she screams click it all 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.000
 here instead of already have it on so 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.000
 fits okay let's go install 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 will help 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.540
 how it does not know
