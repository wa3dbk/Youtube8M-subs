00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
up but I really thought that it was the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.050 
up but I really thought that it was the
defensive<00:00:28.980> pressure<00:00:29.250> from<00:00:29.580> everybody<00:00:30.000> that

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
defensive pressure from everybody that

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.880 
defensive pressure from everybody that

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.010 
helped but though Devon Thomas nobody

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.110 
had an answer for him in this game
really<00:00:34.590> doing<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> great<00:00:35.040> job<00:00:35.100> finishing<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120

it<00:00:40.110> faster<00:00:40.469> than<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> game<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.160> he<00:00:41.610> didn't

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
it faster than the game that he didn't
