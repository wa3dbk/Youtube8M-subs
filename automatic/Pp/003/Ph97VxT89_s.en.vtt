00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.400
 Well here I bring you today a tutorial 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.799
 how to record your gameplays in 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.610
 principle would be only those who 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.279
 keep in the cinema mode 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.960
 but I think good I tried and I know 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.199
 can record live good but now 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.400
 I will explain some drawbacks that there are 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.200
 in principle it is to record the 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.570
 gameplays that you have saved in the 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.730
 cinema mode in black ops mainly in 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.070
 whites or in modern warfare is brought 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.040
 with any of them anyone who 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.860
 allow you to save 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.480
 your games in the world movies good in 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.080
 principle , all you need is the 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.960
 The page's original cable is very 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.440
 simple and in a short the tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.440
 know what 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.000
 that I have avoided searching 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.820
 internet on YouTube and it cost me the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.740
 own life and I will explain why 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.800
 some explain it to you but they do not tell you 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.920
 exactly how it goes but it's very simple 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.980
 all you need is the cable as 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.460
 You see red yellow and white the entrance 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.630
 that goes to the skin and is simply and very 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.500
 easy this 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.500
 Here we go 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.780
 normal this part we would connect it to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.640
 the back of your playstation 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.510
 or xbox 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.940
 I use a station and now I 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.530
 I explain what I have never been told 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.750
 In Internet 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.220
 look we're going behind the dvd 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.470
 recorder because this is to record it in 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:46.810
 a DVD recorder I will try to see you 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.300
 ok to see if I can focus 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.320
 but let's go up there 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.300
 put output or 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.840
 like most favre and means 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.880
 exit 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.670
 I'm not going to explain it here and here 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.450
 I can try to make it look so much better 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.940
 hd quality of a recorder for 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:14.440
 from here to yours, she puts out 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:17.890
 and you're out are also out that's not 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.950
 would go nowhere let's go to the DVD that 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.770
 is where I want to apply them for that reason here 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.430
 none of these would be worth the only 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.950
 have to look is an entry and look 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.230
 some entry that precedes and 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.050
 your to be is what is not 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.010
 they explain in most of the places you 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.400
 we turn the dvd and in this part 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.400
 down here 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.900
 if I can focus 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.910
 there you can not see but let's go there 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:57.420
 I will try to say little by little good 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:04.080
 I say it and apologizes to the quality but 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:09.420
 I do not know how to focus there, it puts av in 3 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.610
 and beige yellow red and white just like 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.490
 has a TV output for camera 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.450
 video or for other components as it 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.450
 only you have to do there 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.209
 and connect the other part of the cable 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.760
 connect and so the other part of the 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.450
 Cable yes you have to do now 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:34.880
 typical of when you change the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.430
 hdmi cable by the component cable 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.700
 you have to go to the play press the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.130
 button off for several seconds 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.690
 until it beeps twice at once 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.810
 more than I put it on or 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.240
 off and then whistle again two 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.960
 times and you'll already be in component mode 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.210
 you do not have to change it in 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.680
 the interface xv plague are 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.140
 good then the only thing that you have to 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.510
 do in my case is my dvd is a 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.460
 already old and only record that what 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.140
 tax the hard drive but we 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.120
 can you pass 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.930
 to dvd I the only thing that I use that I 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.930
 I took and dvd 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:22.830
 I put it in and it happened directly 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.580
 employ word 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.680
 now dvds messes up our homework 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.460
 ignite and logically lvd and on the 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.650
 TV screen you look for the 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.219
 connection that you have of the dvd that in my 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.349
 case by hdmi even if by hdmi and the 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:42.740
 game quality of the eyes gameplay 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.740
 alien 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.530
 a component 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.330
 I turned on the movie yesterday I had to turn on the 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.189
 TV and look on the TV where 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.129
 you have connected by dvd and the only thing that 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:59.320
 you have to do now on the dvd is 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:06.210
 exactly the same thing you would do in 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:11.410
 on a TV you will have the ub vale 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:15.790
 we focus on winpot let's go you'll only have v1 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:19.420
 v2 to v 3 and the output of as I said 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.790
 of a video camera due to a disaster or 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.650
 have to go out on the play 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.000
 and you can record your gameplay 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.550
 I also tell you that I have tried 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.420
 play at the same time because you can because you 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.260
 You see on the TV 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.630
 but it's going to happen with the catchers going 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.060
 with delay and I do not advise you not 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.889
 I advise you to do it 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.100
 with we close here I do not advise that you 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.380
 do because I'm going to go I'm going 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:51.660
 appear the worst on the planet playing 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:53.280
 white or any other games good I 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.740
 what I said is that with normally 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.360
 when it is recorded with a capturer in 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.030
 Any Youtube video you tell 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.210
 you use this these are about 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:08.289
 splitter and they tell you to use this 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.250
 to duplicate the image and in fact 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.719
 It is normally used with a 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.380
 capture to see it on the computer 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:15.290
 warmly vouchers 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.580
 and they say that you use this to duplicate 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.790
 the image and at the same time I can do it 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.860
 on the TV I can not do on the pc 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.600
 you can share the image I suppose not 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.060
 has tried if someone asks me not to 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.740
 I know how many people will visit this video if 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.220
 someone asks me what I can try 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.240
 I can prove it worth this would be to place 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.750
 in some of the departures made 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.750
 it is worth placing h for example 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:43.120
 then the sale of the dvd or see the same 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.990
 TV, what would we see here? 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:50.140
 the television 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.140
 I suppose in this case 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:57.020
 I have done one would connect to each of 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:02.310
 the red yellow blend red yellow 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:06.460
 white and here it would connect 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:09.669
 the place and the other that would go to the DVD but 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.499
 I love that and it depends on each one if the 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:12.849
 people are interested tell me what I upload 

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:16.120
 in others no problem but 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:19.300
 mainly it is very easy summarizing 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.660
 so that I do not roll more per 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.760
 cable that goes to the play vale 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.610
 the cable that leaves the play that would go to 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.280
 dvd recorder in an output any 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:33.010
 option that you put in everything you put 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:36.040
 out and have these three colors does not work 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:38.330
 do not go to see the voucher on YouTube 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.849
 an entry 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.250
 you put this and you just have to go to 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:46.590
 good dvd on the TV brand and where 

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:49.860
 you have the dvd in my case a hdmi 1 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:53.940
 and you see the dvd with the command of the dvd 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:56.760
 you change av13 any of these three 

00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:00.120
 one of those three will come out the play yo 

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.820
 I only had every one gringo dvd 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:06.300
 you give to record to facer dvd and then 

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:08.940
 what you want with the voucher according 

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.419
 you have any doubt you ask me and nothing 

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.080
 plus 

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:12.080
 come on then
