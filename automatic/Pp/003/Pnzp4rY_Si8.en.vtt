00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.060
 little video thomas august so we are sure 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.410
 this as soon as you take so if you 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.890
 spawn and where I am you go to 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.290
 right i'll you go to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.630
 right you arrived in front of this 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.399
 kind of brick table 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.050
 So I show you how to 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.970
 positions you stalled to the right of the pile of 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.500
 bricks you climb you just press 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.130
 plus and you what is the most to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.940
 right possible 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.420
 so here I show you just how that 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.979
 how how would that be so is 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.560
 once you're not complicated 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.910
 you raise your aim slightly so 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.420
 I showed you with both brands 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.179
 red 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.149
 the place that will serve as a landmark so 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.830
 it's the biggest 1 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.170
 we call that the small species 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.819
 stone pillars and the second one to 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.959
 right this concept names European No2 is going 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.090
 have to put the marker between 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.340
 two lifts a little bit and I you 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.900
 showed that the blue line it takes 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.480
 slightly raised the 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.710
 their father the tomahawk marker alas 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.010
 and his gifts you just have to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.110
 launch 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.520
 so as you may know the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.800
 fashion studios want so I had to do 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.440
 a private to sell the click for 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.790
 able to follow the path of the tomahawk who 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.890
 is pretty basic arm 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.360
 I want to clarify therefore the technique of 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.690
 rate mocking us give it works 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.430
 always 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.840
 but that's pretty special because 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.520
 the niemeyer a little more time 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.840
 so I was watching I really take 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.860
 show on the other hand is in Morocco the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.990
 time that he is better placed than his 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.360
 sniper and then here it is gift 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.700
 so I hope this little trick 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.870
 will help you one more time 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.570
 jubin of my return 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.860
 apparently it seems to be 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.390
 kills level or does normal but who 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.980
 so it makes me really happy and I 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.270
 you announce that the next spot the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.870
 miss will be on stand off 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.870
 Hello everyone
