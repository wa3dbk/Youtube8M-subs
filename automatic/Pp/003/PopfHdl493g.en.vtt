00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:09.920
 good kids Sudan for we are here 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.810
 in a new video and well I bring you 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.930
 what comes to be a review of the two 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.699
 good controls we have here this is mine and 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.050
 but it must be pointing us 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.270
 author since he has sent at the same time 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.440
 and well, I'll teach you a little bit 22 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.720
 then I will tell you how to get a 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.010
 command then need first this 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.350
 command is mine which I have been 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.560
 bought me the truth that has many 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.850
 wanting to catch a command like these from 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.100
 poker and such because it 's a game that I 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.350
 I like it a lot because I played a lot 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.140
 and the truth is that I do not know I'm cool and beats 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.710
 Friday, something that had to do with 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.749
 with power not then as you see then 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.129
 here is my name written by ever and 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.449
 Well right now it's on 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.309
 command why it comes out blue by 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.730
 example this one is in red or I do not know 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.149
 depends on web quest 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.440
 here it puts brighter but it is not seen because 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.480
 has the lighting to the maximum I think and 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.329
 then what is in the camera does not look 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.820
 but really yes it is worth it right now 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.220
 you will see it because it has a lot of lighting 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.390
 and nothing because you have sent you what 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.540
 first you can see then basically 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.560
 is the camouflage, that is, the painting of 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.410
 poker cards and such 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.930
 then the buttons and such are as is 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.890
 those on playstation 4 except this one 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.720
 analog that is from xbox 360 I think and 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.149
 Well, it is a logic that has as 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.280
 better hooking or is hooked better by 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.570
 so to say and well then this button that 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.310
 He is always running and all that because 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.070
 the truth is that you stay like this 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.229
 subject maintained more time and is more 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.759
 comfortable in that sense this then the one of 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.649
 playstation3 really none of the 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.720
 analog of playstation 4 since this one 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.369
 the team of this play 3 and well then 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.080
 this one I like more to aim and 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.759
 all that records it more accurate and this one 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.590
 It has more comfortable to have it all 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.200
 time down buttons all issues 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.119
 they are practically the same and then 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.590
 you can give we have the billets that 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.790
 they are the best I've seen until 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.190
 moment 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.500
 I do not know if it will be seen by him and he has a 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.730
 little button here here and here has a 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.980
 little button that you already know that this for 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.810
 the games of heat and such to jump and 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.700
 duck and all that faster then 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.020
 they put these levers that make it 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.970
 Eskup a command as often 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.980
 call then what I like about these 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.060
 levers with difference of for example 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.190
 I'm going to another command that I'm going to teach 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.440
 right now this is the other command that 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.030
 I have playstation, the difference is 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.920
 that this is a little button 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.960
 so what did not come to me 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.640
 convince of this because for example if 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.680
 your finger does not fall right on the button by 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.820
 example to me also I do not fall 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.890
 the fingers came out right on the button 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.750
 so it's a bit uncomfortable to have 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.820
 let's say I have to modify the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.440
 position of my hand to stay you 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.959
 that button then how good it is 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.410
 this command if you whether you explain 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.000
 here as herein here as here 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.350
 button, click on it, so it does not matter 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.790
 where your hand falls to me for example 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.950
 I fall right in the corner below 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.930
 here he put it perfectly if it was more 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.010
 big what you get here and you can 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.290
 eject perfectly in any 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.610
 position may be worth you so good 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.320
 it is a lever, so to speak 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.320
 adapted to any type of hand 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.330
 so it's perfectly fine for said then 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.310
 for that for any position that 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.510
 you are at your command so 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.180
 nothing until it is worth it because it was to teach is 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.370
 it must be we have gone together and then and 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.930
 I also wanted to catch it I was 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.040
 point of buying nor I be this color 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.599
 the base that I already have the other of 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.340
 skulls the green then this good 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.040
 and me some different and Christmas 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.260
 poker and well then how can we see this 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.060
 the truth is that he is very handsome to see if what 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.319
 we focus here 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.700
 what I like most about this command that 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.379
 has a lot of skulls like that here 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.379
 like it's super saturated and over here 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.209
 is more is not much improved this 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.160
 difference this contrast between a 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.510
 part of the command and the other later by 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.209
 here behind it is also very cool 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.829
 as you see practically everything equal you 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.709
 from in this case we do have the 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.060
 analog of playstation 4 but 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.700
 modified white color the truth is 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.900
 that we have enough Nicaraguan 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.819
 we also have the browser name for 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.019
 here like mine on my channel and 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.329
 Nothing then the truth that the two controls 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.040
 They are very cool the way to get them 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.810
 I'm going to tell you, it did not have to be 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.609
 done if you can customize 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.780
 your command as you want it said 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.060
 in previous videos but as there are many 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.319
 new people to repeat again leave in 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.209
 the description then 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.609
 and the email from the person who gave me the 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.889
 It makes good because you can either 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.569
 send your command and pay only what 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.069
 what are the modifications or also 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.900
 you can buy one more command 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.489
 modifications obviously if you have 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.530
 a command that will be cheaper than if 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.940
 you buy a control directly back already 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.259
 as you want, you can say it 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.599
 I want this, you can go back in 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.919
 your channel all the videos see them the 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.990
 paintings that you like and such and 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.090
 choose the model you want to combine 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.740
 everything as you want, you already make an order 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.699
 he has a budget so nothing 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.410
 kids, I hope you liked it 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.880
 I'm going to leave here the total of 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.729
 all my handles from here I have other 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.199
 line 2 of the project are three and this one 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.539
 is the one I have in another playstation 4 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.889
 If you like a model, some model of 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.750
 you can ask for this and if not then 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.280
 you can mix between several or as I have 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.270
 said that direct of the wins well in 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.130
 adaptable because I hope that I have 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.789
 liked that they had favorite drives 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.789
 And until next time 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:55.619
 ah 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.280
 plus
