00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 all welcome in this lesson we 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.540
 learn to restore hard with you 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.690
 drive for this we will use 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.320
 hdd regenerator program which you already 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.450
 downloaded 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.639
 or you can download the link which 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.640
 below 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.100
 we take our archive that we rocked 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.230
 first you need to get everything from there that 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.080
 there we press right-click and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.349
 using the winrar archiver, click 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.900
 extract here all the files that are there 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.070
 removed and you have a folder 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:40.350
 hdd regenerator 171 open this folder 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.350
 and in it we need to run the file h &amp; r 171 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.190
 we run it and the hdd program 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 regenerator 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.860
 start it all set 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 happens very quickly 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:01:00.449
 therefore, it has almost been established 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.640
 we have established the program do not forget 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.510
 remove the program start icon because 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.580
 what if you don't remove the program 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.500
 it starts right away and we donâ€™t need it 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.720
 click finish all program 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.680
 installed now we need to patch 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.680
 so that it becomes a license for 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.020
 of this we take click on the label which 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.140
 we got hdd regenerator find 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.540
 where is the installed folder 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 program and transfer it there 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.280
 a file called game maker all 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.130
 we threw it we start it we write 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.090
 any name 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:45.299
 preferably in English we press 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.040
 geralt key generated and we need 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.259
 press patch three times the first time we 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.700
 forge the program then 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.229
 additional application in the registry and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.899
 one more extra files 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.469
 programs all the program we have patched 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.780
 and you can run it on 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.819
 English but okay 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.379
 I'll tell you everything now where and how 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.519
 so for starters key opportunities 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:18.249
 when the program can not just 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.840
 close broken sectors she can them 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:23.659
 recover on a physical level like 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.579
 it happens it doesn't even matter to you 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.639
 what operating system are you running 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:32.060
 whether it is windows xp and windows 7 it 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:36.549
 loaded after loading BIOS immediately 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.669
 that is, you create the left button is you 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.969
 boot 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:44.629
 and usb flash drive or create a bootable cd 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:47.810
 or dvd drive after clicking on it will 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:51.680
 create a bootable flash drive or 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.419
 boot disk but it can also 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.359
 work directly in the most 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:58.569
 operating system to 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.939
 just check if you have bad sectors 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.790
 you can directly operating itself 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:08.090
 systems do it all produce and since it is 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.859
 happens you push a button you 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.739
 a window appears 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.780
 that you need to be careful because 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.870
 some programs are used 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.030
 operating system and since the program 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.540
 running the hard disk on the physical 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.259
 level 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.639
 therefore you receive a message that 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:30.079
 it is advisable to restart the computer and 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.900
 manually after that 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:37.519
 run a program that is bootable 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.310
 flash drives or boot disk but nothing 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.049
 terrible, we will start until we see 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.939
 how it all happens choose our 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.859
 HDD 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:48.859
 below you will have a list of hard drives 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.909
 usually he is one well someone is 2 and 3 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.430
 so click on it twice and 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:57.229
 the process begins 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.449
 hdd window appears before you 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:01.879
 regenerator and the program itself 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:04.340
 consists of four points that can 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:07.489
 choose by pressing the number on your 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.680
 keyboard and so the first item scans 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.840
 and repairs bad sectors 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.819
 second item scans but not 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.099
 repairs bad sectors 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.870
 that is, you can just see if 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:22.310
 they or they do not have the third item 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.630
 provide you with a view of the version and 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.480
 fourth statistic 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.890
 we don't need it we need either first or 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.170
 second point let's start 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.790
 consider the second item just be 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.300
 check if we have damaged 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.060
 sector 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.450
 click on the number 2 and then on 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.520
 Inter initially he offers us with 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.950
 what sector should we start of course 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.220
 from 0 from the beginning, press again 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.550
 Inter and begins the search for damaged 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.580
 sectors while removing it we do not need 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.340
 pressing the escape button and try 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.910
 change the mode here here is five 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.520
 points 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.440
 the first point is to continue the process 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.870
 the second item back shows 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.390
 statistics third item change 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.670
 starting sector and fourth point 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:12.080
 change mode 5 is exit program 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.550
 we will select 4 will change the mode and now we 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.190
 choose the first 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.470
 scan and restore what's here 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.460
 we can see also press enter with 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.420
 zero sector 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.790
 enter again and now the process has started 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.310
 recovery itself from below 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.280
 where sectors are scanned you can 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.670
 see the letter b English shows 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.820
 you found bad sectors letter p 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:40.910
 English shows bad sectors but 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.340
 already installed and after completion 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.050
 your hard drive will recover it 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.050
 will show how much was all bad 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.970
 sectors and how much has already been restored 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.920
 press escape and all exit 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.990
 programs 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:06:00.170
 but once again I repeat to you the best 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:02.810
 use on water now i will complete 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.940
 so that you see once again run and 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.670
 remind you once again what is best 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.970
 create bootable USB flash drive either 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:13.330
 boot disk and after reboot 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:16.070
 when you boot from a disk or flash drive 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.200
 then restore your hard 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.790
