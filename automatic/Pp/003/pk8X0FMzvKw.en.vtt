cables that are a lot bigger compared to
the<00:01:36.180> Apple<00:01:36.659> cables<00:01:37.400> so<00:01:38.400> overall<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the Apple cables so overall this is a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.100 
the Apple cables so overall this is a
really<00:01:39.840> nice<00:01:40.049> case<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:41.159> very<00:01:41.549> minimalistic

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
really nice case it's very minimalistic

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.749 
really nice case it's very minimalistic
it<00:01:43.110> doesn't<00:01:43.500> really<00:01:43.680> add<00:01:43.799> any<00:01:44.189> bulk<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.729> weight

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
it doesn't really add any bulk or weight

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.859 
it doesn't really add any bulk or weight
to<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> iPhone

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
to the iPhone

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.590 
to the iPhone
I<00:01:46.009> really<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.399> soft<00:01:47.670> touch<00:01:47.880> finish<00:01:48.240> in

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.990 
I really like the soft touch finish in
