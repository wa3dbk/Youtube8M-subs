00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
point of project Tatooine was that

traditional<00:02:20.390> games<00:02:20.630> on<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.900> iphone<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.470> lot<00:02:22.010> of

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
traditional games on the iphone a lot of

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.490 
traditional games on the iphone a lot of
them<00:02:22.220> are<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.520> focused<00:02:22.820> around<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:24.260> concept

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
them are so focused around the concept

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.380 
them are so focused around the concept
of<00:02:24.830> having<00:02:24.950> characters<00:02:25.550> on<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.820> screen<00:02:25.850> and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
of having characters on the screen and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.420 
of having characters on the screen and
you<00:02:26.750> know<00:02:26.870> basically<00:02:27.140> lick<00:02:27.650> playing<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.220> game

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
you know basically lick playing the game

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.110 
you know basically lick playing the game
through<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.240> screen<00:02:29.660> itself<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:30.790> think<00:02:31.790> one<00:02:32.090> of

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
through the screen itself I think one of

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.580 
through the screen itself I think one of
the<00:02:32.240> things<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.720> we<00:02:32.870> wanted<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.230> do<00:02:33.410> with

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
the things that we wanted to do with

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.350 
the things that we wanted to do with
this<00:02:33.770> was<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.010> kind<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.310> break<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:34.820> that

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
this was a kind of break that that

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.420 
this was a kind of break that that
that's<00:02:35.660> dry<00:02:36.020> that<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.470> lot<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:36.890> iphone<00:02:37.220> games

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
that's dry that a lot of iphone games

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.400 
that's dry that a lot of iphone games
have<00:02:37.610> been<00:02:37.730> having<00:02:38.090> recently<00:02:38.270> we<00:02:39.110> wanted<00:02:39.350> to

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
have been having recently we wanted to

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.590 
have been having recently we wanted to
actually<00:02:39.560> make<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.130> iPhone<00:02:40.580> itself<00:02:40.730> with<00:02:41.210> 11

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
actually make the iPhone itself with 11

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.920 
actually make the iPhone itself with 11
you<00:02:41.960> know<00:02:42.310> us<00:02:43.310> growing<00:02:43.700> up<00:02:43.940> we<00:02:44.240> played<00:02:44.750> with

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
you know us growing up we played with

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.090 
you know us growing up we played with
super<00:02:45.230> soakers<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.770> around<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
super soakers and around the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.710 
super soakers and around the
neighborhood<00:02:46.520> we<00:02:46.640> played<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.150> know<00:02:47.180> cops<00:02:47.480> and

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
neighborhood we played you know cops and

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.140 
neighborhood we played you know cops and
robbers<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:48.290> we<00:02:48.950> had<00:02:49.190> that<00:02:49.370> those<00:02:49.610> great<00:02:49.880> time

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
robbers and we had that those great time

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.230 
robbers and we had that those great time
still<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.770> kind<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.130> idea<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.670> this

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
still and the kind of the idea is this

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.660 
still and the kind of the idea is this
is<00:02:53.300> almost<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.900> natural<00:02:54.740> progression<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:55.430> that

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
is almost a natural progression of that

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.910 
is almost a natural progression of that
so<00:02:56.150> as<00:02:56.330> opposed<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.050> know<00:02:57.110> having<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.680> super

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
so as opposed to you know having a super

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.400 
so as opposed to you know having a super
soaker<00:02:58.070> now<00:02:58.340> we<00:02:58.400> have<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.730> iphone<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.410> what

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
soaker now we have the iphone and what

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.290 
soaker now we have the iphone and what
can<00:03:00.560> we<00:03:00.590> do<00:03:00.800> if<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.250> iphone<00:03:01.430> was<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.090> letter

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
can we do if the iphone was the letter

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.240 
can we do if the iphone was the letter
and<00:03:02.600> because<00:03:03.320> of<00:03:03.350> that<00:03:03.500> you're<00:03:03.709> able<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.040> have

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
and because of that you're able to have

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.980 
and because of that you're able to have
multiple<00:03:04.820> weapons<00:03:05.120> with<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.840> know<00:03:05.959> i

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
multiple weapons with it you know i

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.120 
multiple weapons with it you know i
think<00:03:06.320> we're<00:03:06.410> going<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.590> be<00:03:06.650> shipping<00:03:06.860> with

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
think we're going to be shipping with

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.110 
think we're going to be shipping with
about<00:03:07.370> eight<00:03:08.300> or<00:03:08.480> ten<00:03:08.920> initially<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.130> the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
about eight or ten initially and the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.620 
about eight or ten initially and the
whole<00:03:11.270> point<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.810> is<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:13.180> have<00:03:14.180> different

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
whole point of it is to have different

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.110 
whole point of it is to have different
weapons<00:03:14.900> for<00:03:15.080> different<00:03:15.350> purposes<00:03:16.120> players

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
weapons for different purposes players

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.390 
weapons for different purposes players
can<00:03:17.330> run<00:03:18.140> around<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:18.800> know<00:03:18.860> any<00:03:19.070> area

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
can run around and you know any area

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.580 
can run around and you know any area
that<00:03:19.459> they<00:03:19.670> feel<00:03:19.820> need<00:03:20.060> is<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:21.110> know<00:03:21.200> good<00:03:21.410> for

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
that they feel need is you know good for

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.650 
that they feel need is you know good for
them<00:03:21.709> to<00:03:21.860> suited<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.330> they'll<00:03:23.330> be<00:03:23.420> able<00:03:23.510> to

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
them to suited and they'll be able to

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.020 
them to suited and they'll be able to
kind<00:03:23.930> of<00:03:23.959> lift<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.260> compass<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:25.030> core

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
kind of lift the compass and the core

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.640 
kind of lift the compass and the core
location<00:03:26.209> will<00:03:26.630> be<00:03:26.660> able<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.930> point<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.380> shoot

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
location will be able to point and shoot

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.780 
location will be able to point and shoot
so<00:03:27.800> they<00:03:27.920> actually<00:03:28.040> can<00:03:28.400> choose<00:03:28.610> different

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
so they actually can choose different

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.850 
so they actually can choose different
people<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.239> attack<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.750> think<00:03:30.560> we're<00:03:30.739> also

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
people to attack I think we're also

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.030
