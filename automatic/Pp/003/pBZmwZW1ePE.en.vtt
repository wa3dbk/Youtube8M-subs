keeping their vehicle starting circuit
from<00:00:11.830> functioning<00:00:12.700> properly

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
from functioning properly

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.839 
from functioning properly
the<00:00:14.320> reason<00:00:14.740> why<00:00:14.950> that's<00:00:15.219> probably<00:00:15.610> happening

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
the reason why that's probably happening

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.650 
the reason why that's probably happening
in<00:00:16.180> your<00:00:16.330> car<00:00:16.660> is<00:00:17.650> this<00:00:18.480> underneath<00:00:19.480> your

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
in your car is this underneath your

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.350 
in your car is this underneath your
driver's<00:00:20.169> dash<00:00:20.380> panel<00:00:20.860> which<00:00:21.550> you<00:00:21.849> will<00:00:22.180> have

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
driver's dash panel which you will have

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.210 
driver's dash panel which you will have
to<00:00:22.509> take<00:00:22.660> you're<00:00:22.869> on<00:00:22.960> the<00:00:23.050> dash<00:00:23.230> down<00:00:23.500> as<00:00:23.770> you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
to take you're on the dash down as you

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.540 
to take you're on the dash down as you
can<00:00:24.369> see<00:00:24.809> in<00:00:25.809> this<00:00:25.960> vehicle<00:00:26.470> this<00:00:27.040> plastic

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
can see in this vehicle this plastic

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.269 
can see in this vehicle this plastic
cover<00:00:27.730> was<00:00:28.180> removed<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.680> that's<00:00:29.950> going<00:00:30.160> to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
cover was removed and that's going to

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.340 
cover was removed and that's going to
access<00:00:32.160> access<00:00:33.160> I<00:00:33.760> should<00:00:33.969> say<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.960> alarm

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
access access I should say the alarm

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.430 
access access I should say the alarm
system<00:00:35.800> that<00:00:35.950> there's<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.520> bypass<00:00:36.970> kit<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
system that there's the bypass kit the

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.770 
system that there's the bypass kit the
sensor<00:00:38.980> and<00:00:39.160> all<00:00:39.310> but<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.330> only<00:00:40.510> thing<00:00:40.630> that

sensor and all but the only thing that

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.870 
sensor and all but the only thing that
we<00:00:40.870> need<00:00:41.080> to<00:00:41.110> focus<00:00:41.530> in<00:00:41.680> on<00:00:41.770> right<00:00:42.550> here<00:00:42.790> in

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
we need to focus in on right here in

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.040 
we need to focus in on right here in
this<00:00:43.000> video<00:00:43.960> is<00:00:44.470> this<00:00:44.800> right<00:00:45.100> here<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:46.420> is<00:00:46.660> a

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
this video is this right here this is a

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.690 
this video is this right here this is a
relay<00:00:47.590> this<00:00:48.070> is<00:00:48.220> what<00:00:48.370> it's<00:00:48.490> going<00:00:48.579> to<00:00:48.640> look

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
relay this is what it's going to look

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.720 
relay this is what it's going to look
like<00:00:48.850> in<00:00:49.150> anybody's<00:00:49.600> car<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:51.220> writing<00:00:51.550> on<00:00:51.670> it

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
like in anybody's car the writing on it

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.580 
like in anybody's car the writing on it
may<00:00:52.060> differ<00:00:52.360> but<00:00:52.690> they're<00:00:52.900> all<00:00:53.079> pretty<00:00:53.320> much

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
may differ but they're all pretty much

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.400 
may differ but they're all pretty much
single-pole<00:00:54.280> double-throw<00:00:54.340> relays<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
single-pole double-throw relays the

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.590 
single-pole double-throw relays the
colors<00:00:56.800> may<00:00:56.980> also<00:00:57.190> vary<00:00:57.700> a<00:00:57.850> little<00:00:58.000> bit<00:00:58.150> but

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
colors may also vary a little bit but

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.650 
colors may also vary a little bit but
this<00:00:58.810> one<00:00:58.989> here<00:00:59.320> is<00:00:59.760> an<00:01:00.760> audio<00:01:01.030> vox<00:01:01.300> brand

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
this one here is an audio vox brand

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.569 
this one here is an audio vox brand
relay<00:01:02.590> and<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:02.800> can<00:01:02.950> see<00:01:03.190> that<00:01:03.340> there's<00:01:03.520> a

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
relay and you can see that there's a

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.420 
relay and you can see that there's a
diode<00:01:04.089> on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:05.350> bottom<00:01:05.649> of<00:01:05.799> it<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.070> have<00:01:06.310> an

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
diode on the bottom of it you have an

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.010 
diode on the bottom of it you have an
orange<00:01:06.760> wire<00:01:07.000> which<00:01:07.240> is<00:01:07.360> always<00:01:07.630> going<00:01:07.900> to<00:01:07.930> be

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
orange wire which is always going to be

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.719 
orange wire which is always going to be
the<00:01:08.200> case<00:01:08.350> in<00:01:08.590> just<00:01:08.830> about<00:01:09.010> any<00:01:09.220> car<00:01:09.490> alarm

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
the case in just about any car alarm

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.090 
the case in just about any car alarm
I've<00:01:09.909> ever<00:01:10.120> seen<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:11.380> orange<00:01:11.680> wire<00:01:11.860> is

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
I've ever seen and the orange wire is

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.550 
I've ever seen and the orange wire is
basically<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.640> deal<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.570> alarms<00:01:13.930> armed

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
basically the deal the alarms armed

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.200 
basically the deal the alarms armed
output<00:01:14.979> so<00:01:15.130> when<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.430> wire<00:01:15.640> gets<00:01:15.909> a<00:01:16.000> ground

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
output so when that wire gets a ground

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.750 
output so when that wire gets a ground
signal<00:01:16.479> it's<00:01:17.229> going<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.560> keep<00:01:17.740> these<00:01:18.490> two

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
signal it's going to keep these two

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.580 
signal it's going to keep these two
positions<00:01:19.299> on<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.540> relay<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.990> middle<00:01:20.320> which

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
positions on the relay the middle which

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.370 
positions on the relay the middle which
is<00:01:20.620> 87a<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.790> bottom<00:01:22.210> which<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.420> number<00:01:22.840> 30

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
is 87a and the bottom which is number 30

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.789 
is 87a and the bottom which is number 30
if<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:24.100> were<00:01:24.190> to<00:01:24.250> unplug<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:24.790> relay<00:01:25.120> socket

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
if you were to unplug this relay socket

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.899 
if you were to unplug this relay socket
which<00:01:26.799> I'm<00:01:26.950> going<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.159> try<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.370> do<00:01:27.670> one<00:01:28.090> hand

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
which I'm going to try to do one hand

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.600 
which I'm going to try to do one hand
and<00:01:30.909> it's<00:01:31.119> not<00:01:31.299> happening<00:01:31.479> I<00:01:31.810> just<00:01:32.310> I'm<00:01:33.310> not<00:01:33.340> a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
and it's not happening I just I'm not a

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.560 
and it's not happening I just I'm not a
man<00:01:33.790> today<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.990> on<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.979> relay<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:37.360> always

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
man today but on the relay it's always

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.270 
man today but on the relay it's always
going<00:01:37.659> to<00:01:37.720> be<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:38.020> middle<00:01:38.260> middle<00:01:38.770> pin<00:01:39.070> and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
going to be the middle middle pin and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.000 
going to be the middle middle pin and
the<00:01:40.240> bottom<00:01:40.570> or<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.780> two<00:01:41.170> heavy<00:01:41.409> thick<00:01:41.770> gauge

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
the bottom or the two heavy thick gauge

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.250 
the bottom or the two heavy thick gauge
cables<00:01:42.520> they're<00:01:42.640> always<00:01:42.790> going<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.030> be<00:01:43.260> 14

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
cables they're always going to be 14

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.560 
cables they're always going to be 14
gauge<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:45.460> 10<00:01:45.700> gauge<00:01:45.939> somewhere<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:46.510> that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
gauge to 10 gauge somewhere in that

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.120 
gauge to 10 gauge somewhere in that
range<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.200> can<00:01:47.290> tell<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.619> difference<00:01:47.950> that

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
range you can tell the difference that

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.359 
range you can tell the difference that
this<00:01:48.280> here<00:01:48.520> is<00:01:48.670> just<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:49.680> 18<00:01:50.680> gauge<00:01:50.890> wire<00:01:50.920> and

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
this here is just a 18 gauge wire and

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.980 
this here is just a 18 gauge wire and
you<00:01:51.430> can<00:01:51.549> see<00:01:51.670> this<00:01:51.820> one<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.119> four<00:01:52.330> times<00:01:52.600> the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
you can see this one is four times the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.050 
you can see this one is four times the
width<00:01:53.170> of<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:53.439> now<00:01:53.950> these<00:01:54.159> two<00:01:54.400> wires<00:01:54.640> are<00:01:54.939> the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
width of it now these two wires are the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.149 
width of it now these two wires are the
two<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.420> are<00:01:55.479> being<00:01:55.689> interrupted<00:01:56.159> because

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
two that are being interrupted because

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.340 
two that are being interrupted because
the<00:01:57.549> sort<00:01:57.760> of<00:01:57.820> wire<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.210> this<00:01:58.360> car<00:01:58.600> was<00:01:58.840> cut<00:01:59.140> and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
the sort of wire in this car was cut and

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.870 
the sort of wire in this car was cut and
either<00:01:59.680> side<00:01:59.979> is<00:02:00.100> going<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.400> either<00:02:00.640> one<00:02:00.850> of

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
either side is going to either one of

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.940 
either side is going to either one of
these<00:02:01.030> two<00:02:01.270> wires<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:01.900> if<00:02:02.290> this<00:02:02.500> relay<00:02:02.830> is

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
these two wires so if this relay is

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.850 
these two wires so if this relay is
either<00:02:03.130> just<00:02:04.090> stop<00:02:04.390> clicking<00:02:04.900> or<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.590> alarm

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
either just stop clicking or the alarm

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.469 
either just stop clicking or the alarm
is<00:02:05.979> holding<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.340> ground<00:02:06.580> output<00:02:07.030> or<00:02:07.150> whatever

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
is holding a ground output or whatever

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.210 
is holding a ground output or whatever
that's<00:02:08.289> what's<00:02:08.530> keeping<00:02:08.679> this<00:02:08.920> thing<00:02:09.099> from

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
that's what's keeping this thing from

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.300 
that's what's keeping this thing from
started<00:02:09.610> so<00:02:09.729> what<00:02:09.909> you<00:02:10.000> do<00:02:11.219> let's<00:02:12.219> get

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
started so what you do let's get

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.400 
started so what you do let's get
yourself<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.790> piece<00:02:12.999> of<00:02:13.120> wire

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
yourself a piece of wire

yourself a piece of wire
such<00:02:14.740> as<00:02:14.890> this<00:02:15.070> is<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.760> regular<00:02:16.240> old<00:02:16.390> piece

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
such as this is just a regular old piece

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.110 
such as this is just a regular old piece
of<00:02:16.690> 10<00:02:17.020> gauge<00:02:17.260> wire<00:02:17.530> which<00:02:18.460> I<00:02:18.610> stripped<00:02:18.940> off

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
of 10 gauge wire which I stripped off

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.150 
of 10 gauge wire which I stripped off
about<00:02:19.810> an<00:02:19.960> inch<00:02:20.140> or<00:02:20.290> cell<00:02:20.530> with<00:02:20.710> wire<00:02:20.950> on

you want to just remove it entirely of

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.760 
you want to just remove it entirely of
course<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.690> could<00:03:07.810> do<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.050> it's<00:03:08.500> entirely

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
course you could do that it's entirely

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.980 
course you could do that it's entirely
up<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.460> that's<00:03:10.330> really<00:03:10.570> all<00:03:10.780> there<00:03:10.900> is

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
up to you and that's really all there is

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.630 
up to you and that's really all there is
to<00:03:11.050> it<00:03:11.350> if<00:03:11.470> this<00:03:11.650> doesn't<00:03:11.980> solve<00:03:12.160> your<00:03:12.250> problem

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
to it if this doesn't solve your problem

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.970 
to it if this doesn't solve your problem
then<00:03:12.820> your<00:03:12.970> problem<00:03:13.270> is<00:03:13.360> is<00:03:13.590> elsewhere<00:03:14.590> and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
then your problem is is elsewhere and

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.160 
then your problem is is elsewhere and
you<00:03:15.280> could<00:03:15.400> always<00:03:15.550> verify<00:03:16.360> this<00:03:16.420> very<00:03:16.930> easily

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
you could always verify this very easily

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.100 
you could always verify this very easily
by<00:03:17.560> just<00:03:17.800> taking<00:03:17.950> your<00:03:18.450> multimeter<00:03:19.450> or<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.750> test

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
by just taking your multimeter or a test

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.200 
by just taking your multimeter or a test
light<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.560> testing<00:03:21.310> your<00:03:21.340> starter<00:03:21.730> wire<00:03:21.940> on

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
light and testing your starter wire on

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.350 
light and testing your starter wire on
the<00:03:22.420> side<00:03:22.780> if<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.800> wire<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.280> cut<00:03:24.730> this<00:03:25.000> way<00:03:25.210> and

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
the side if the wire is cut this way and

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.000 
the side if the wire is cut this way and
you<00:03:25.420> got<00:03:25.480> one<00:03:25.690> this<00:03:26.050> side<00:03:26.260> go<00:03:26.470> into<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.800> key

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
you got one this side go into the key

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.170 
you got one this side go into the key
and<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.340> get<00:03:27.460> this<00:03:27.610> like<00:03:27.790> going<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.090> the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
and you get this like going to the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.330 
and you get this like going to the
starter<00:03:28.540> side<00:03:28.720> obviously<00:03:29.110> test<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:30.070> side

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
starter side obviously test the side

starter side obviously test the side
that's<00:03:30.550> going<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.910> distort<00:03:31.240> a<00:03:31.330> motor<00:03:31.480> that's

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
that's going to distort a motor that's

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.410 
that's going to distort a motor that's
getting<00:03:32.110> 12<00:03:32.380> volts<00:03:32.650> when<00:03:32.800> you<00:03:33.060> do<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.180> crank

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
getting 12 volts when you do the crank

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.270 
getting 12 volts when you do the crank
position<00:03:34.540> you're<00:03:35.080> on<00:03:35.230> your<00:03:35.410> key<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.130> know

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
position you're on your key you know

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.400 
position you're on your key you know
that<00:03:36.460> that's<00:03:36.580> not<00:03:36.730> your<00:03:36.940> problem<00:03:37.090> but<00:03:37.510> if<00:03:38.170> in

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
that that's not your problem but if in

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.530 
that that's not your problem but if in
most<00:03:38.710> cases<00:03:38.980> if<00:03:39.370> it's<00:03:39.610> your<00:03:39.760> relay<00:03:40.060> jamming<00:03:40.420> up

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
most cases if it's your relay jamming up

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.630 
most cases if it's your relay jamming up
on<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.870> all<00:03:41.590> you<00:03:41.710> got<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:41.950> do<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.190> what<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.400> just

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
on you all you got to do is what I just

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.860 
on you all you got to do is what I just
