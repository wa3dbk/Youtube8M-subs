00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
no not only is it my Godfather's car but

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.599 
no not only is it my Godfather's car but

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
it's a last front-engine winning car in

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.740 
it's a last front-engine winning car in
1964<00:00:06.450> so<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.460> iconic<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.269> so

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
1964 so this is a this is iconic in so

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.749 
1964 so this is a this is iconic in so
many<00:00:09.870> different<00:00:10.110> ways<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.950> can<00:00:11.519> actually

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
many different ways and I can actually

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.789 
many different ways and I can actually
see<00:00:11.910> over<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> steering<00:00:12.330> wheel<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:12.799> imagine

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
see over the steering wheel so imagine

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.530 
see over the steering wheel so imagine
AJ<00:00:14.040> was<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> little<00:00:14.490> higher<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.880> don't<00:00:15.269> see<00:00:15.389> any

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
AJ was a little higher I don't see any

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.080 
AJ was a little higher I don't see any
power<00:00:15.780> steering<00:00:16.170> lines<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.220> think<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:17.970> it

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
power steering lines so I think that it

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.460 
power steering lines so I think that it
probably<00:00:18.119> had<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.990> wrestle<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.410> thing

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
probably had to wrestle this thing

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.769 
probably had to wrestle this thing
around<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.130> did<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> lot<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:20.970> sliding<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.539> lot<00:00:21.630> of

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
around and did a lot of sliding a lot of

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.900 
around and did a lot of sliding a lot of
dirt<00:00:21.930> sliding<00:00:22.320> through<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.220> corners<00:00:23.820> in

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
dirt sliding through the corners in

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.390 
dirt sliding through the corners in
Indianapolis<00:00:24.510> which<00:00:24.750> today<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.949> big<00:00:26.220> no-no

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
Indianapolis which today is a big no-no

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.550 
Indianapolis which today is a big no-no
but<00:00:27.240> um<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.750> at<00:00:27.840> least<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.050> could<00:00:28.199> always<00:00:28.320> see

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
but um but at least you could always see

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.900 
but um but at least you could always see
your<00:00:28.650> right<00:00:28.830> rear<00:00:28.949> tire<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.400> always<00:00:29.580> check<00:00:29.609> it

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
your right rear tire and always check it

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.100 
your right rear tire and always check it
out<00:00:30.650> it's<00:00:31.650> hard<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> imagine<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.579> think<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.120> we

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
out it's hard to imagine I think that we

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.990 
out it's hard to imagine I think that we
talked<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.980> talked<00:00:35.219> about<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.730> we

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
talked you know we talked about it we we

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000 
talked you know we talked about it we we
keep<00:00:36.180> thinking<00:00:36.360> about<00:00:36.600> how<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> evolution

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
keep thinking about how the evolution

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.590 
keep thinking about how the evolution
the<00:00:38.100> car<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.610> go<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.030> what's<00:00:39.450> going

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the car is going to go and what's going

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.000 
the car is going to go and what's going
to<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.780> next<00:00:40.020> trick<00:00:40.410> or<00:00:40.620> what's<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.920> to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
to be the next trick or what's going to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.880 
to be the next trick or what's going to
be<00:00:41.100> allowed<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.290> you<00:00:43.290> know<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> think<00:00:43.739> of

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
be allowed in and you know to think of

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.220 
be allowed in and you know to think of
when<00:00:44.219> they<00:00:44.250> drove<00:00:44.550> these<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.149> mean<00:00:45.329> they<00:00:45.780> had<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
when they drove these I mean they had a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.110 
when they drove these I mean they had a
hard<00:00:46.469> time<00:00:46.530> conceiving<00:00:47.129> when<00:00:47.610> they<00:00:48.090> brought

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
hard time conceiving when they brought

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.610 
hard time conceiving when they brought
the<00:00:48.420> rear-engine<00:00:48.840> car<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.469> going

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the rear-engine car that that was going

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.799 
the rear-engine car that that was going
to<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.739> better<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.969> funny<00:00:51.210> thing<00:00:51.270> about<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.719> is

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
to be better the funny thing about it is

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
to be better the funny thing about it is
after<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> Indianapolis<00:00:52.680> 500<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.340> AJ

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
after the Indianapolis 500 it AJ

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.459 
after the Indianapolis 500 it AJ
actually<00:00:54.329> took<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.660> dirt<00:00:54.840> car<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.140> sat<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
actually took a dirt car and sat on the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.069 
actually took a dirt car and sat on the
pull-up<00:00:55.680> Milwaukee<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.750> thought<00:00:57.960> that

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
pull-up Milwaukee and and I thought that

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.990 
pull-up Milwaukee and and I thought that
was<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:59.010> was<00:00:59.129> big<00:00:59.340> time<00:00:59.489> could<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.760> see<00:00:59.940> this

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000

it's just sheet metal and now we're

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.120 
it's just sheet metal and now we're
we're<00:02:48.710> covered<00:02:49.100> in<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.370> capsule<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:51.350> the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
we're covered in a capsule and and the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.590 
we're covered in a capsule and and the
safety<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:52.670> all<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:53.030> that's<00:02:53.240> so<00:02:53.450> much

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
to think that I mean they built this

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.410 
to think that I mean they built this
down<00:02:59.570> in<00:02:59.690> Texas<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.350> brought<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.800> here<00:03:01.040> and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
you know it was sort of them you know

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.090 
you know it was sort of them you know
these<00:03:05.720> are<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.990> ideas<00:03:06.320> that<00:03:06.350> I<00:03:06.530> have<00:03:06.800> and

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.320 
these are the ideas that I have and
that's<00:03:07.220> what<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:07.460> go<00:03:07.610> with<00:03:07.820> now<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.240> all

that's what you go with now it's all
done<00:03:08.540> by<00:03:08.570> computers<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.530> wind<00:03:09.710> tunnels<00:03:10.100> and

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
done by computers and wind tunnels and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.760 
done by computers and wind tunnels and
and<00:03:10.580> other<00:03:10.850> things<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:12.350> know<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.530> miss

these<00:03:12.950> days<00:03:13.190> because<00:03:13.400> everybody<00:03:13.880> had<00:03:14.090> a

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
these days because everybody had a

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.760 
these days because everybody had a
little<00:03:14.240> bit<00:03:14.570> different<00:03:14.870> idea<00:03:15.140> of<00:03:15.350> how<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.500> do

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
little bit different idea of how to do

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.440 
little bit different idea of how to do
it<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:15.950> how<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.400> how<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.730> go<00:03:16.910> fast<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.330> how<00:03:17.390> to

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
evolution of the Indy car has been they

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.219 
evolution of the Indy car has been they
taking<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.060> driver<00:04:50.330> and<00:04:50.539> taking<00:04:51.080> them<00:04:51.169> from

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
being so far forward to to keep scooting

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.620 
being so far forward to to keep scooting
them<00:04:54.200> back<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:54.919> that's<00:04:55.669> only<00:04:55.850> for<00:04:56.300> safety

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
them back and and that's only for safety

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.300 
them back and and that's only for safety
reasons<00:04:56.990> it's<00:04:57.140> not<00:04:57.289> for<00:04:57.500> performance<00:04:58.039> or<00:04:58.190> any

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
reasons it's not for performance or any

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.400 
reasons it's not for performance or any
other<00:04:58.550> reason<00:04:58.970> but<00:04:59.600> then<00:04:59.870> you<00:05:00.110> can<00:05:00.229> imagine

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
other reason but then you can imagine

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.370 
other reason but then you can imagine
Johnny's<00:05:01.240> legs<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.419> feet<00:05:02.600> were<00:05:02.630> up<00:05:02.870> here<00:05:03.140> and

Johnny's legs and feet were up here and

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.670 
Johnny's legs and feet were up here and

cars<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.740> I'm<00:05:15.800> looking<00:05:16.010> at<00:05:16.190> all<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.460> pieces

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
cars and I'm looking at all the pieces

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.909 
cars and I'm looking at all the pieces
they've<00:05:17.030> hung<00:05:17.210> off<00:05:17.419> them<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.169> at<00:05:18.800> that

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
they've hung off them and and at that

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.070 
they've hung off them and and at that
point<00:05:19.190> they<00:05:19.430> were<00:05:19.490> just<00:05:19.729> the<00:05:20.120> motor<00:05:20.690> was<00:05:20.900> an

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
point they were just the motor was an

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.170 
point they were just the motor was an
animal<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:21.620> was<00:05:21.680> it<00:05:22.190> would<00:05:22.370> produce<00:05:22.550> well<00:05:22.940> over

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
animal it was it would produce well over

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.330 
animal it was it would produce well over
a<00:05:23.210> thousand<00:05:23.690> horsepower<00:05:23.930> well<00:05:24.919> over<00:05:25.130> probably

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
a thousand horsepower well over probably

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.520 
a thousand horsepower well over probably
1,100<00:05:25.940> horsepower<00:05:26.060> and<00:05:26.600> they<00:05:27.289> were<00:05:27.410> just

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
1,100 horsepower and they were just

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
1,100 horsepower and they were just
trying<00:05:27.770> to<00:05:27.830> get<00:05:27.979> it<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.160> get<00:05:28.310> through<00:05:28.460> the

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
trying to get it to get through the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.870 
trying to get it to get through the
corner<00:05:28.880> so<00:05:29.060> they<00:05:29.180> had<00:05:30.140> pylon<00:05:30.590> as<00:05:30.740> much<00:05:30.919> when

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
corner so they had pylon as much when

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.130 
corner so they had pylon as much when
they<00:05:32.030> weren't<00:05:32.240> worried<00:05:32.479> about<00:05:32.510> drag<00:05:32.900> they

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
they weren't worried about drag they

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.300 
they weren't worried about drag they
were<00:05:33.200> just<00:05:33.350> worried<00:05:33.650> about<00:05:33.680> trying<00:05:34.100> to<00:05:34.160> get

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
were just worried about trying to get

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.040 
were just worried about trying to get
around<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.640> corners<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.180> then<00:05:35.780> I<00:05:35.870> look

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
around the corners and then I look

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.230 
around the corners and then I look
inside<00:05:36.410> and<00:05:36.650> so<00:05:37.310> many<00:05:37.490> of<00:05:37.610> these<00:05:37.669> cars<00:05:38.000> they

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
inside and so many of these cars they

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.540 
inside and so many of these cars they
have<00:05:38.450> a<00:05:38.479> lever<00:05:39.169> in<00:05:39.350> the<00:05:39.440> middle<00:05:39.710> and<00:05:39.860> I<00:05:40.280> assume

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
have a lever in the middle and I assume

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.820 
have a lever in the middle and I assume
that<00:05:40.580> that's<00:05:40.820> a<00:05:40.970> weight<00:05:41.150> jacker<00:05:41.419> just<00:05:41.990> to<00:05:42.200> to

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
that that's a weight jacker just to to

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.710 
that that's a weight jacker just to to
help<00:05:42.950> them<00:05:43.160> pump<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.789> weight<00:05:43.970> jacker<00:05:44.240> up<00:05:44.510> to

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
help them pump the weight jacker up to

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.320 
help them pump the weight jacker up to
help<00:05:45.289> it<00:05:45.440> give<00:05:45.590> you<00:05:46.550> know<00:05:46.669> during<00:05:46.820> the<00:05:46.970> race<00:05:47.180> to

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
help it give you know during the race to

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.290 
help it give you know during the race to
be<00:05:47.419> able<00:05:47.479> just<00:05:47.810> the<00:05:47.990> car<00:05:48.200> it's<00:05:48.880> you<00:05:49.880> know<00:05:50.000> today

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
be able just the car it's you know today

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.240 
be able just the car it's you know today
I<00:05:50.330> think<00:05:50.450> that<00:05:50.720> that's<00:05:50.870> really<00:05:50.990> cool<00:05:51.410> we<00:05:51.680> do<00:05:52.130> it

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
I think that that's really cool we do it

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.700 
I think that that's really cool we do it
electronically<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:53.180> hydraulically<00:05:53.720> but<00:05:54.050> you

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
electronically and hydraulically but you

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.810 
electronically and hydraulically but you
know<00:05:54.800> they<00:05:54.950> were<00:05:55.010> doing<00:05:55.250> it<00:05:55.340> back<00:05:55.460> then<00:05:55.669> but

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
know they were doing it back then but

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.150 
know they were doing it back then but
you<00:05:56.450> know<00:05:56.570> you<00:05:56.630> think<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:57.020> all<00:05:57.260> the<00:05:57.530> drag<00:05:57.860> on

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
you know you think of all the drag on

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.219 
you know you think of all the drag on
the<00:05:58.280> car<00:05:58.550> that<00:05:59.360> they<00:05:59.510> had<00:05:59.660> to<00:05:59.690> make<00:05:59.930> that<00:06:00.050> kind

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
the car that they had to make that kind

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.920 
the car that they had to make that kind
of<00:06:00.320> horsepower<00:06:00.590> just<00:06:00.919> to<00:06:00.979> go<00:06:01.240> 180<00:06:02.240> 190<00:06:02.600> miles

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
of horsepower just to go 180 190 miles

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.770 
of horsepower just to go 180 190 miles
an<00:06:03.110> hour<00:06:03.260> and<00:06:04.030> today<00:06:05.030> if<00:06:05.120> we<00:06:05.240> put<00:06:05.419> one<00:06:05.570> of<00:06:05.690> those

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
an hour and today if we put one of those

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.080 
an hour and today if we put one of those
in<00:06:05.840> that<00:06:06.740> dallara<00:06:08.470> we<00:06:09.470> go<00:06:10.010> 250<00:06:10.520> miles<00:06:10.849> an<00:06:11.000> hour

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
in that dallara we go 250 miles an hour

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.540 
in that dallara we go 250 miles an hour
probably<00:06:11.330> because<00:06:11.780> it's<00:06:11.960> just<00:06:12.020> there's<00:06:12.830> just

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
probably because it's just there's just

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.630 
probably because it's just there's just
it's<00:06:13.910> just<00:06:14.060> raw<00:06:14.720> power<00:06:14.990> and<00:06:15.260> and<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:16.280> motors

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
it's just raw power and and the motors

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.210 
it's just raw power and and the motors
bigger<00:06:16.880> and<00:06:17.210> it's<00:06:17.330> turbo<00:06:17.870> charts<00:06:18.320> and<00:06:18.590> you

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
bigger and it's turbo charts and you

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.190 
bigger and it's turbo charts and you
know<00:06:19.370> even<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:20.270> turbos<00:06:20.660> on<00:06:20.810> them<00:06:20.930> look<00:06:21.050> at<00:06:21.140> how

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
know even the turbos on them look at how

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.730 
know even the turbos on them look at how
big<00:06:21.380> it<00:06:21.530> is<00:06:21.620> it's<00:06:21.950> huge<00:06:22.910> so<00:06:23.210> yeah<00:06:24.140> I<00:06:24.169> think<00:06:24.320> that

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
big it is it's huge so yeah I think that

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.040 
big it is it's huge so yeah I think that
back<00:06:25.400> then<00:06:25.610> it<00:06:25.760> was<00:06:25.849> all<00:06:26.030> about<00:06:26.240> I<00:06:26.570> know<00:06:26.690> at<00:06:26.900> one

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
back then it was all about I know at one

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.210 
back then it was all about I know at one
point<00:06:27.080> they<00:06:27.410> even<00:06:27.590> talked<00:06:27.740> about<00:06:27.860> trying<00:06:28.190> to

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
point they even talked about trying to

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.310 
point they even talked about trying to
keep<00:06:28.400> the<00:06:28.520> rear<00:06:28.790> tires<00:06:28.970> from<00:06:29.270> spinning<00:06:29.570> you

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
keep the rear tires from spinning you

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.710 
keep the rear tires from spinning you
know<00:06:30.440> so<00:06:30.800> yeah<00:06:31.780> now<00:06:32.780> the<00:06:32.840> rules<00:06:33.139> say<00:06:33.320> the

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
know so yeah now the rules say the

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.380 
know so yeah now the rules say the
we<00:06:33.780> can't<00:06:34.020> be<00:06:34.140> that<00:06:34.260> big<00:06:34.500> and<00:06:34.740> in<00:06:35.730> Indianapolis

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
we can't be that big and in Indianapolis

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.120 
we can't be that big and in Indianapolis
you<00:06:36.630> don't<00:06:36.840> really<00:06:37.080> want<00:06:37.350> it<00:06:37.440> that<00:06:37.590> big<00:06:37.740> even

you don't really want it that big even
with<00:06:38.250> the<00:06:38.340> other<00:06:38.460> cars<00:06:38.730> because<00:06:38.940> we<00:06:39.090> make<00:06:39.270> so
