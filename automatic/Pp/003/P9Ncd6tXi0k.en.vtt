00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.359
 we could usually say young people that we are dealing with marriage or 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.550
 ix are looking for models are looking for examples and that's why 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.619
 we believe that god that we are the ones who use it as models or as 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:30.710
 examples for them 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.660
 that maybe what it could be to eat someone is that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.060
 the bible does not speak of a call to work with young people 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.810
 in fact the bible just 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.370
 speaks of a call 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.210
 and it is this min in few 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.470
 of Jesus 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.559
 or what do we do then and should I fish young or not 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.020
 Maybe that's the question 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.490
 massa de quake comes as a result of this 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.010
 I want to suggest 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.900
 what to answer the question yes I can or can not serve in the minister with 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.970
 young boys 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.300
 I must understand three things and have them there in your manual 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.390
 first thing that I think I suggest we should understand 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.460
 I must understand what he means 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.120
 inability 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.680
 that sense that comes to me many times that makes me feel 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.920
 be unable 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.860
 to do something that God has called me to be 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.930
 second principle that I think we should understand is percent 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.050
 the principle or sense that we have to have what 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.850
 what we are doing is important 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.159
 this ministry is key for the church 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.550
 we say 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.600
 percent 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.870
 the young are the future of the church 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.550
 but the reality is that they are the coliseum of the present they are the ones that move the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.530
 church and number three 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.830
 so I'd like to suggest that we have to percent percent understand that 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.110
 sense that life is punishable 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.600
 if you see yourself percent 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.040
 meditating near you and young people 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.070
 you think 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.130
 and you say 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.149
 I do not feel incapable I do not feel capable I know it is important and also 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.160
 dices 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.370
 sr I'm willing take two measurable I'm available 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.880
 I believe that if we understand these things it is very likely that God will go 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.860
 to use in a year 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.919
 great way in the youth ministry in attitude should that sir 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.169
 I can not I understand my disabilities I think it's important 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.789
 But here I am 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:21.179
 here is my life I want you that I like you 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:23.459
 for your glory title 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.890
 there is a responsibility is that I think we should understand that for that we are going to go 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.769
 for the second timoteo says well 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.229
 your place my son 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.329
 strive in the grace that is in Jesus Christ 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.959
 what has come from militants many witnesses 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.849
 this commends aom parade he is that they are apt to teach also to others 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.149
 my receipt 3 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:48.189
 you can suffer hardships like a good soldier of Jesus Christ 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:53.239
 Persian 4 none that militates entangled in the business of life in order to 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.160
 please whom 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.799
 who took it for a soldier 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.739
 and also the one who fought as an athlete is not crowned but struggles legitimately 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.479
 developer 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:04.959
 to participate in the fruits 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.649
 to work 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:10.739
 and I think that this passage was given by timoteo a pastor who was young 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.099
 the principles with the person responsible for these appointments of someone who will be working 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.850
 in 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.229
 the context the church for the ministry 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.819
 the first one we find there in the voice verse 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.360
 he says what he assumed of me before many witnesses this entrusts aon brees 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.309
 give this to you that you have learned savings 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.829
 Become a disciple I adore I think yes the first one and I know what 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.010
 he underpinned his values 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.220
 is the first papero the first responsible that we have is is the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.119
 responsible has declined circular aol cross everything told the mayor suffers 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.349
 I do not know how they are not only economically but emotionally 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.599
 percent only compass art one day the church listening to the problems that 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.720
 they have young people today 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.289
 It's enough 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:58.729
 I can not anymore I'm so tired of hearing so many problems spread the 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.549
 responsible for juvenile series and the word god tells us we're going to suffer 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:08.309
 the third responsibility I think we find there in verse 5 and 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:12.050
 also the one who fights like athletes is not crowned but struggles 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.239
 rightfully 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.219
 in three we have already given three and circulate 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.459
 suffer to fight and ended with the last month and because we are going to read witnesses from 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.289
 process 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.490
