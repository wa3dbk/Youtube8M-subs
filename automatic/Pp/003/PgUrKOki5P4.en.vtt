well definitely we don't have the
commutes<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.009> no<00:01:59.399> car<00:01:59.670> our<00:02:00.000> commute<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.540> from

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
commutes so no car our commute is from

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.170 
commutes so no car our commute is from
upstairs<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.710> downstairs<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.729> save<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> lot

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
upstairs to downstairs and we save a lot

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.120 
upstairs to downstairs and we save a lot
of<00:02:03.210> time<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.860> do<00:02:05.009> more

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
of time in that so you can do more

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
of time in that so you can do more
things<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> result<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.450> not<00:02:06.689> spending<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
things as a result of not spending the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.440 
things as a result of not spending the
time<00:02:07.380> commuting

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
time commuting

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.020

well<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.270> was<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.390> little<00:02:18.600> challenging<00:02:19.380> at<00:02:19.560> that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
well it was a little challenging at that

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.880 
well it was a little challenging at that
time<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.460> railings<00:02:21.210> were<00:02:21.390> not<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.810> was<00:02:22.590> okay

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
time the railings were not it was okay

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.620 
time the railings were not it was okay
but<00:02:22.950> gave<00:02:23.220> us<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.430> little<00:02:23.610> more<00:02:23.880> space<00:02:24.600> to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
but gave us a little more space to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.110 
but gave us a little more space to
maneuver<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.560> corners<00:02:26.070> but<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.910> is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
maneuver the corners but that is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.810 
maneuver the corners but that is
difficult<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.130> original<00:02:29.340> staircase

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
difficult this is the original staircase

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.820 
difficult this is the original staircase
is<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.570> only<00:02:30.720> thing<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.230> remains<00:02:31.530> from

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
is this the only thing that remains from

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.770 
is this the only thing that remains from
from<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> old<00:02:32.520> place<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.120> stairs<00:02:33.420> are<00:02:33.690> the

we<00:03:09.450> selected<00:03:09.900> Energy<00:03:10.410> Star<00:03:10.680> appliances<00:03:10.920> so

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
we selected Energy Star appliances so

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.790 
we selected Energy Star appliances so
and<00:03:12.030> those<00:03:12.209> run<00:03:12.540> more<00:03:12.720> efficiently<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.680> also

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
and those run more efficiently and also

there's a tax savings associated with
that<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.470> was<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.620> great<00:03:16.860> incentive<00:03:17.160> as

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
that so that was a great incentive as

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.080 
that so that was a great incentive as
well<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:19.590> mix<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:20.040> sustainable<00:03:20.670> wood<00:03:20.910> on

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
well the mix of sustainable wood on

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.510 
well the mix of sustainable wood on
whitewashed<00:03:21.780> walls<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.890> dark<00:03:23.190> stained

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.479 
whitewashed walls and the dark stained
floors<00:03:23.790> really<00:03:24.540> makes<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.959> statement<00:03:25.250> in<00:03:26.250> this

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
floors really makes a statement in this

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.130

these<00:06:07.380> high-efficiency<00:06:08.159> windows<00:06:08.550> yeah<00:06:09.150> there

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
these high-efficiency windows yeah there

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.600 
these high-efficiency windows yeah there
are<00:06:09.479> double<00:06:09.720> pane<00:06:09.900> insulated<00:06:10.229> windows<00:06:10.949> we

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
are double pane insulated windows we

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.999 
are double pane insulated windows we
actually<00:06:12.389> had<00:06:12.659> to<00:06:12.840> replace<00:06:13.199> the<00:06:13.440> windows<00:06:13.800> they

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
actually had to replace the windows they

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:15.980 
actually had to replace the windows they
were<00:06:14.070> old<00:06:14.340> but<00:06:14.669> while<00:06:14.880> we<00:06:15.030> were<00:06:15.120> doing<00:06:15.449> that<00:06:15.599> we

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
were old but while we were doing that we

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.480 
were old but while we were doing that we
thought<00:06:16.169> it<00:06:16.289> was<00:06:16.349> a<00:06:16.409> great<00:06:16.560> opportunity<00:06:17.310> to

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
thought it was a great opportunity to

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.129 
thought it was a great opportunity to
put<00:06:17.639> a<00:06:17.699> row<00:06:17.940> of<00:06:17.969> windows<00:06:18.449> to<00:06:18.630> really<00:06:18.840> bring<00:06:19.020> in

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
put a row of windows to really bring in

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:20.360 
put a row of windows to really bring in
a<00:06:19.229> lot<00:06:19.380> of<00:06:19.409> light<00:06:19.710> and<00:06:19.740> make<00:06:20.009> that<00:06:20.159> look

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
a lot of light and make that look

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.370 
a lot of light and make that look
consistent<00:06:20.729> was<00:06:21.479> a<00:06:21.509> little<00:06:21.810> difficult<00:06:21.960> though

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
consistent was a little difficult though

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.409 
consistent was a little difficult though
because<00:06:22.409> we<00:06:22.800> had<00:06:22.919> to<00:06:22.979> get<00:06:23.070> landmark<00:06:23.669> approval

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
because we had to get landmark approval

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.570 
because we had to get landmark approval
because<00:06:24.840> it<00:06:25.110> was<00:06:25.349> an<00:06:25.500> exterior<00:06:25.889> change<00:06:26.340> to<00:06:26.490> the

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
because it was an exterior change to the

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.649 
because it was an exterior change to the
building<00:06:26.729> so<00:06:27.150> that<00:06:27.180> proved<00:06:27.539> to<00:06:27.630> be

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
building so that proved to be

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.360 
building so that proved to be
challenging<00:06:27.780> but<00:06:28.590> well<00:06:28.830> worth<00:06:29.039> of<00:06:29.250> the

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
challenging but well worth of the

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.980 
challenging but well worth of the
lobbies<00:06:29.699> yeah<00:06:29.849> it<00:06:30.060> really<00:06:30.300> loves<00:06:30.479> it<00:06:30.630> it's<00:06:30.870> a
