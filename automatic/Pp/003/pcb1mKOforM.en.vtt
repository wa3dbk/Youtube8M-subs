I'm most regularly paint in the studio
but<00:00:27.590> obviously<00:00:28.590> I'll<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.950> go<00:00:29.100> out<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.760> get

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
but obviously I'll have to go out to get

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.570 
but obviously I'll have to go out to get
ideas<00:00:30.690> and<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.110> tend<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> go<00:00:31.620> out<00:00:31.650> sketching<00:00:32.400> and

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
ideas and I tend to go out sketching and

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.800 
ideas and I tend to go out sketching and
drawing<00:00:33.950> probably<00:00:34.950> once<00:00:35.520> every<00:00:35.820> two<00:00:36.780> weeks

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
drawing probably once every two weeks

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.770 
drawing probably once every two weeks
I'll<00:00:37.650> go<00:00:37.950> out<00:00:38.070> deliberately<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.540> find

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
I'll go out deliberately to find

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.650 
I'll go out deliberately to find
something<00:00:40.309> but<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.370> lot<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> time<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.300> find

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
something but a lot of the time I find

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.080 
something but a lot of the time I find
subjects<00:00:43.410> when<00:00:43.830> I'm<00:00:43.950> not<00:00:44.070> expecting<00:00:44.220> to<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
subjects when I'm not expecting to and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.570 
subjects when I'm not expecting to and
I'm<00:00:45.180> not<00:00:45.300> looking<00:00:45.710> but<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> actual<00:00:47.100> painting

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.760 
I'm not looking but the actual painting

happens in the studio from drawings and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.750 
happens in the studio from drawings and
photographs<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:54.620> come<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:56.190> into<00:00:56.490> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
photographs I come in here into the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.420 
photographs I come in here into the
studio<00:00:57.180> usually<00:00:58.170> about<00:00:58.440> 9<00:00:58.770> o'clock<00:00:58.800> and<00:01:01.400> but<00:01:02.400> I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
studio usually about 9 o'clock and but I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.700 
studio usually about 9 o'clock and but I
don't<00:01:02.730> start<00:01:03.440> immediately

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
don't start immediately

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.440 
don't start immediately
I'll<00:01:04.940> fiddle<00:01:05.940> around<00:01:06.500> washing<00:01:07.500> brushes

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
I'll fiddle around washing brushes

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.359 
I'll fiddle around washing brushes
pretending<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.570> work<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:10.979> you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
pretending to work but not really you

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.370 
pretending to work but not really you
know<00:01:11.490> getting<00:01:11.970> into<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> right<00:01:12.600> sort<00:01:13.290> of

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
know getting into the right sort of

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.200 
know getting into the right sort of
frame<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.590> mind<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:16.770> probably<00:01:17.580> usually<00:01:17.970> get

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
frame of mind and I probably usually get

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.170 
frame of mind and I probably usually get
stuck<00:01:18.930> into<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> painting<00:01:19.950> about<00:01:20.340> 10<00:01:20.940> o'clock

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
stuck into the painting about 10 o'clock

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.650 
stuck into the painting about 10 o'clock
and<00:01:21.540> then<00:01:21.690> I'll<00:01:21.810> work<00:01:22.050> right<00:01:22.380> through<00:01:23.450> if<00:01:24.450> I

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
and then I'll work right through if I

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.710 
and then I'll work right through if I
remember<00:01:25.140> our<00:01:25.320> break<00:01:25.649> for<00:01:25.890> lunch<00:01:26.479> but<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> don't

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
remember our break for lunch but I don't

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.620 
remember our break for lunch but I don't

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
quality of color and light but it's

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.509 
quality of color and light but it's
still<00:02:10.890> not<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.280> same<00:02:11.310> as<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.090> real<00:02:12.239> thing<00:02:13.519> and

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
still not the same as the real thing and

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.490

you know and that drawing the drawing

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.699 
you know and that drawing the drawing
part<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.099> is<00:02:17.340> fixing<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.090> real<00:02:18.360> thing<00:02:18.750> in

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
part of it is fixing the real thing in

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.309 
part of it is fixing the real thing in
your<00:02:20.069> mind<00:02:21.650> my<00:02:22.760> my<00:02:23.760> favorite<00:02:24.690> medium<00:02:25.140> is

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
your mind my my favorite medium is

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.210 
your mind my my favorite medium is
watercolor<00:02:25.739> that's<00:02:26.190> what<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.519> started<00:02:26.970> with

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
watercolor that's what I started with

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.400 
watercolor that's what I started with
you<00:02:29.220> know<00:02:29.400> when<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.760> was<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:29.910> youngster<00:02:30.180> when<00:02:31.140> my

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
you know when I was a youngster when my

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.479 
you know when I was a youngster when my
grandfather<00:02:32.069> gave<00:02:32.519> me<00:02:32.579> is<00:02:32.880> watercolor<00:02:33.299> box

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
grandfather gave me is watercolor box

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.000 
grandfather gave me is watercolor box
when<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.610> was<00:02:35.730> about<00:02:35.880> 14<00:02:36.180> years<00:02:36.569> old<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:37.140> think

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
when I was about 14 years old I think

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.710 
when I was about 14 years old I think
especially<00:02:38.489> with<00:02:38.849> watercolor<00:02:39.299> you<00:02:39.390> have<00:02:39.569> to

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
especially with watercolor you have to

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.940 
especially with watercolor you have to
plan<00:02:40.370> very<00:02:41.370> carefully<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.540> quite<00:02:46.079> slowly<00:02:46.410> and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
plan very carefully and quite slowly and

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.520 
plan very carefully and quite slowly and
then<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.910> have<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.120> paint<00:02:48.299> really<00:02:48.959> quite<00:02:49.260> fast

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
then you have to paint really quite fast

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.800 
then you have to paint really quite fast
and<00:02:49.950> almost<00:02:50.519> carelessly

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
and almost carelessly

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.940 
and almost carelessly
it's<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:53.190> sounds<00:02:54.180> wrong<00:02:54.390> but<00:02:54.540> that's<00:02:55.380> basically

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
it's a sounds wrong but that's basically

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.150 
it's a sounds wrong but that's basically
what<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.250> do<00:02:56.370> do<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.329> lot<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.540> planning<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.590> then

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
what I do do a lot of planning and then

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.670 
what I do do a lot of planning and then
paint<00:02:59.549> fairly<00:03:00.450> quickly<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:01.139> between<00:03:01.470> those

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
paint fairly quickly in between those

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.979 
paint fairly quickly in between those
long<00:03:02.000> planning<00:03:03.049> times<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:05.060> think<00:03:06.060> there<00:03:06.329> are<00:03:06.359> I

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
long planning times I think there are I

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.530 
long planning times I think there are I
mean<00:03:07.139> there<00:03:07.319> are<00:03:07.470> too<00:03:07.739> many<00:03:08.389> influences<00:03:09.389> to

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
mean there are too many influences to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.539 
mean there are too many influences to
mention<00:03:09.959> really<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.590> mean<00:03:10.769> any<00:03:10.980> time<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.519> I

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
mention really I mean any time that I

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.599 
mention really I mean any time that I
look<00:03:11.850> at<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.829> painting<00:03:13.829> because<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.130> do<00:03:14.190> love

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
look at a painting because I do love

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.879 
look at a painting because I do love
paintings<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.750> going<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.109> see<00:03:16.290> painting

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
paintings and going to see painting

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.370 
paintings and going to see painting
every<00:03:17.250> time<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.489> look<00:03:17.670> at<00:03:17.760> something<00:03:18.239> I'll<00:03:18.540> you

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
every time I look at something I'll you

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.690 
every time I look at something I'll you
know<00:03:19.410> I'm<00:03:19.769> looking<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.250> see<00:03:20.400> if<00:03:20.519> there's

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
know I'm looking to see if there's

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.220 
know I'm looking to see if there's
anything<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.269> can<00:03:21.540> take<00:03:22.109> from<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:23.810> my<00:03:24.810> palette

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
anything I can take from it my palette

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.069 
anything I can take from it my palette
is<00:03:25.380> fairly<00:03:25.819> limited<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:28.730> tend<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:30.380> use<00:03:31.380> either

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
is fairly limited I tend to use either

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.569 
is fairly limited I tend to use either
Windsor<00:03:34.079> blue<00:03:34.260> or<00:03:35.450> or<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.510> cobalt<00:03:37.049> blue<00:03:37.139> or<00:03:37.889> mix

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
Windsor blue or or a cobalt blue or mix

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:39.220 
Windsor blue or or a cobalt blue or mix
of<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.819> two

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
of the two

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.800 
of the two
for<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.319> Reds<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.769> really<00:03:41.639> like<00:03:41.849> cadmium<00:03:42.599> red

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
for the Reds I really like cadmium red

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.259 
for the Reds I really like cadmium red
but<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.319> don't<00:03:43.590> use<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:43.829> very<00:03:43.980> much<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.849> I<00:03:45.030> use

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
but I don't use it very much and I use

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.729 
but I don't use it very much and I use
the<00:03:45.660> alizarin<00:03:46.079> crimson<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:47.010> lot<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.930> for<00:03:48.959> the

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
the alizarin crimson a lot and for the

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.249 
the alizarin crimson a lot and for the
yellows<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.489> again<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.180> tend<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.660> use<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.049> cab

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:52.259 
yellows I again I tend to use the cab

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.589 
yellows I again I tend to use the cab
beams<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:52.859> I<00:03:52.949> use<00:03:53.190> a

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
beams and I use a

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.530 
beams and I use a
cadmium<00:03:55.599> light<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.260> cadmium<00:03:56.469> medium<00:03:57.510> but<00:03:58.510> I

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
cadmium light and a cadmium medium but I

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.890 
cadmium light and a cadmium medium but I
also<00:03:58.870> have<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.680> lot<00:04:00.219> of<00:04:00.249> the<00:04:00.700> earth<00:04:00.879> colors<00:04:01.420> I'm

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
also have a lot of the earth colors I'm

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.179 
also have a lot of the earth colors I'm
a<00:04:01.959> big<00:04:02.439> fan<00:04:02.680> of<00:04:02.709> earth<00:04:03.040> colors<00:04:03.659> ochres<00:04:04.659> and

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
a big fan of earth colors ochres and

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:17.870 
a big fan of earth colors ochres and
Amber's<00:04:06.189> and<00:04:06.579> all<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.879> those

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.570 

I<00:04:17.910> think<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.720> markers<00:04:19.650> are<00:04:19.800> brilliant<00:04:20.220> for

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
I think the markers are brilliant for

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.230 
I think the markers are brilliant for
sketching<00:04:22.220> in<00:04:23.220> our<00:04:23.400> sketching<00:04:23.760> in<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:23.970> field

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
sketching in our sketching in the field

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.090 
sketching in our sketching in the field
they're<00:04:24.690> excellent<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:26.520> sticks<00:04:27.240> are<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:28.200> think

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
they're excellent the sticks are I think

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.270 
they're excellent the sticks are I think
will<00:04:29.430> be<00:04:29.580> ideal<00:04:30.000> for<00:04:30.890> painters<00:04:31.890> who<00:04:32.070> maybe

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
will be ideal for painters who maybe

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.640 
will be ideal for painters who maybe
work<00:04:32.550> in<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.850> slightly<00:04:33.090> free<00:04:33.480> away<00:04:33.810> than<00:04:34.410> I<00:04:34.530> do

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.920 

but<00:04:37.650> they'll<00:04:37.890> you<00:04:38.100> know<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.430> its<00:04:38.700> it<00:04:39.180> always

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
but they'll you know is its it always

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.630 
but they'll you know is its it always
when<00:04:40.410> you<00:04:40.500> start<00:04:40.770> when<00:04:40.920> you<00:04:41.040> try<00:04:41.280> different

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
when you start when you try different

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.230 
when you start when you try different
materials<00:04:42.600> when<00:04:42.900> you<00:04:43.110> use<00:04:43.410> different<00:04:44.240> methods

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
materials when you use different methods

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.150 
materials when you use different methods
you<00:04:45.420> learn<00:04:46.340> new<00:04:47.340> things<00:04:48.500> with<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.620> painting

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
you learn new things with the painting

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.130 
you learn new things with the painting
that<00:04:50.430> I'm<00:04:50.550> working<00:04:50.790> on<00:04:51.150> at<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.360> moment<00:04:51.390> I<00:04:51.810> use

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
that I'm working on at the moment I use

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:58.060 
that I'm working on at the moment I use
the<00:04:52.470> sticks<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.990> get<00:04:55.200> some<00:04:55.560> extra<00:04:56.090> granulation

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
the sticks to get some extra granulation

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
the sticks to get some extra granulation
into<00:04:59.070> a<00:04:59.430> part<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.480> water<00:05:00.720> area<00:05:01.880> but<00:05:02.880> again

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
into a part of the water area but again

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.720 
into a part of the water area but again
I<00:05:03.300> found<00:05:03.660> it<00:05:03.810> it's<00:05:04.140> it's<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.770> think<00:05:05.430> you<00:05:05.550> need

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
I found it it's it's I think you need

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.370 
I found it it's it's I think you need
practice<00:05:05.970> with<00:05:06.270> all<00:05:06.570> of<00:05:06.810> these<00:05:06.930> new<00:05:06.990> materials

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
practice with all of these new materials

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.280 
practice with all of these new materials
in<00:05:08.340> order<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:08.700> find<00:05:08.970> out<00:05:09.210> their<00:05:09.480> capabilities

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
and in order to find out how you can

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.060 
and in order to find out how you can
control<00:05:13.500> them<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:14.990> was<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.200> was<00:05:16.350> told<00:05:16.530> once<00:05:16.860> that
