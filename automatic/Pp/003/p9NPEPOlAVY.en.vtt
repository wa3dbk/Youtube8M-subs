take a plain old phone and actually

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.590 
take a plain old phone and actually
unplug<00:01:33.619> your<00:01:34.340> wiring<00:01:34.820> that's<00:01:35.180> in<00:01:35.300> your<00:01:35.420> house

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
unplug your wiring that's in your house

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.109 
unplug your wiring that's in your house
and<00:01:35.990> plug<00:01:36.590> in<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.770> plain<00:01:37.070> old<00:01:37.280> phone<00:01:37.610> here<00:01:37.940> and

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
and plug in a plain old phone here and

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.660 
and plug in a plain old phone here and
check<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.200> see<00:01:39.350> if<00:01:39.410> you<00:01:39.470> have<00:01:39.560> dial<00:01:39.800> tone<00:01:40.070> if

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
check to see if you have dial tone if

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.419 
check to see if you have dial tone if
you<00:01:41.390> don't<00:01:41.600> have<00:01:41.780> dial<00:01:42.050> tone<00:01:42.320> then<00:01:42.619> then<00:01:43.220> it's

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
you don't have dial tone then then it's

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.100 
you don't have dial tone then then it's
definitely<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.910> problem<00:01:44.360> on<00:01:44.420> our<00:01:44.539> side<00:01:44.840> and

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
definitely a problem on our side and

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.719 
definitely a problem on our side and
we'll<00:01:45.530> need<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.770> come<00:01:46.009> check<00:01:46.039> it<00:01:46.280> out

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
we'll need to come check it out

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.499 
we'll need to come check it out
but<00:01:47.300> if<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:47.509> do<00:01:47.720> have<00:01:47.929> dial<00:01:48.229> tone<00:01:48.500> here<00:01:48.770> then

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
but if you do have dial tone here then

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.820 
but if you do have dial tone here then
the<00:01:50.509> problem<00:01:50.869> could<00:01:50.990> either<00:01:51.140> be<00:01:51.350> with<00:01:51.500> some<00:01:51.770> of

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
the problem could either be with some of

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.529 
the problem could either be with some of
your<00:01:51.950> wiring<00:01:52.220> in<00:01:52.640> your<00:01:52.700> house<00:01:53.060> or<00:01:53.390> outside
