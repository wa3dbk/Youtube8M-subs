00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.030
 hello guys good this time 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.759
 I come to bring this great application 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.989
 that is called repairing battery has more 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.800
 of 100,000 downloads has a 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:19.780
 valuation of 47 out of 5 that is very 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.310
 good score 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.100
 this application what will help us 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.380
 to do is to repair our battery so 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.710
 we think it does not load very well from the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.859
 battery does not last what must last and 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.199
 I really recommend it to you as you can 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:40.399
 see here today we are going to teach you 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:43.039
 all these steps when here is repaired 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.170
 battery has five comments of five 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.409
 stars in his comment the second 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.560
 comment so has 05 stars and as 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.900
 can see here come many more 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.430
 for applications to repair bacteria 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:01.430
 but not one like this one is going to open it 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.040
 I do this good video you have to try 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.990
 to make this video taking into account 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.960
 that the battery should be at 100% I do not 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.300
 I have it 100% but I have it almost 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.520
 full I'll make the video of all 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.970
 modes ending this test video will 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.430
 I will make you 100% and you try to 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.450
 do it with 100% battery please 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.729
 we are going to open the application 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.590
 we are going to give you here to start and as 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.869
 can see here are already starting by 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.539
 example the squares that are in color 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.990
 yellow is because it is in process color 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.759
 brown color coffee orange I do not know is 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.429
 because there was a problem detected there 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.000
 just detected something in red finish 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:45.939
 detect a red box and in green 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.649
 because the battery is good and this video 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.649
 long more than anything because I feel that 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.740
 my battery does not last what should last and 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.569
 that's why I do it so live not and 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.119
 the proof of nothing was rewarded because I've already 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.849
 used in other devices and I know that 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.670
 it works but that's why I do this 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:06.130
 live test so they see as if 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.599
 this battery works and that really is 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.130
 the process that is going to be the one that seeks 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:11.799
 many videos on youtube also what 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.660
 they do but it always shows them the 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.970
 drummer who is watching them teach them the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.519
 true procedure that you should do and 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.200
 Well, here we are going to wait 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.250
 end while I invite you to 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.390
 subscribe to the channel 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.490
 like comment on the video 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.220
 share for more people 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.710
 see this tutorial and see how they can 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.650
 repair your battery very can see me already 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.430
 He detected three in orange and one in 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.340
 red now we will see how how 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.810
 we should really repair it while 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.640
 let's give it here in tools 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.990
 good says he does not leave me until 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.730
 I finished 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.390
 let's wait for it to finish 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.830
 this process when they appeared to me 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.830
 225 the red ones I did not think it was so 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.550
 bad battery 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.660
 well in fact yes because it lasts me 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.430
 just two weeks ago for 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.820
 here lasts half of what really 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.990
 it lasted me but good for you to see this 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.210
 process if it is real if it is true and 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.610
 Well, I hope you can also 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.490
 help 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.880
 I remind you this I'm doing it this way 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.250
 it really is a normal test because the 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.200
 because they tested other devices 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.970
 and if it has not worked and I want it 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.300
 do so so that you really see the 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:36.820
 process how can you say in orange 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:40.260
 says low load 4 244 1% inactive that no 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.840
 it's loading two pictures have been 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.700
 and green color have been the most 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.269
 then let's see who says solution 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.269
 to problems 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.220
 let's wait for it to end it's not 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.150
 repairing the first small box and put it 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.460
 all right 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.920
 the other orange now the color red 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.980
 red color took a little longer take a 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.710
 little more in repair because I was 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.130
 inactive 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.590
 let's give it in accept 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.180
 remove advertising nothing more than this 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.080
 stays as advertised as they can 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.080
 see here at the bottom 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.230
 and is already starting the last frame 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.300
 I really hope you like the video 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.400
 and really see what is the process that 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.960
 you should continue as you can say with 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.669
 happiness formation these problems 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.210
 they were solved let's talk in 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.980
 why does it say that if I want to rate the 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.680
 of the home cancel or we are going to 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.290
 occupy and well now I'm going to make a 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.250
 quick test on this so you can see 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.250
 they are working 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:06.879
 and 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.190
 ah 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.690
 good as you can see there guys is already 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.430
 about to finish and they appeared to me 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.060
 all the squares in greens because 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.140
 It's okay to come and solve 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.060
 problems 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.880
 this is like defragmenting the hard drive 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.770
 of a computer like this one removes the 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.200
 hollow spaces so that it stops 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.470
 work so that it starts to work and 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.480
 Well, here we are simply going to do 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.250
 that now we are going to load it by 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.740
 example my cell phone in this case I'm going to 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.710
 load it one hundred percent or even a 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.210
 let it get downloaded I do not know how the 23 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.180
 percent and reload it at one hundred 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.130
 percent and so for it to be calibrated 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.680
 ok the battery and this what really 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:12.070
 does to us is that is to fragment the 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.590
 empty spaces traverse the battery as 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.330
 it must be recover the memory the battery 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.300
 and I hope you liked this 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:22.590
 video guys subscribe they share it and 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.590
 Well nothing until the next
