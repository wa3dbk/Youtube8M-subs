00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.120 
that the the paint like said that this
is<00:03:33.630> more<00:03:33.810> resident<00:03:34.319> than<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.859> you<00:03:35.040> know

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
is more resident than like you know

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.270 
is more resident than like you know
plastic<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:36.420> know<00:03:36.510> that's<00:03:36.690> why<00:03:37.190> when<00:03:38.190> it

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
plastic so you know that's why when it

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.860 
plastic so you know that's why when it
comes<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.609> skin<00:03:38.790> tone<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.180> does<00:03:39.359> look<00:03:39.630> more

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
comes to skin tone it does look more

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.770 
comes to skin tone it does look more
like<00:03:40.079> that<00:03:40.260> versus<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:41.120> you<00:03:42.120> know<00:03:42.209> save<00:03:42.450> once

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
like that versus the you know save once

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.930 
like that versus the you know save once
i<00:03:42.930> scale<00:03:43.200> figures<00:03:43.590> because<00:03:44.370> it's<00:03:44.549> different

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
i scale figures because it's different

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.300 
i scale figures because it's different
different<00:03:45.569> material<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.079> it's<00:03:46.230> more<00:03:46.709> made<00:03:47.130> to

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
different material so it's more made to

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.729
