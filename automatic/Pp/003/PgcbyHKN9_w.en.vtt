00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 a huge hello everyone i'm extremely happy 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.160
 see you and sorry for my forced 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.620
 vacation and a two-week absence to me 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.450
 even asked I did not throw my channel 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.179
 and this is incredibly nice that I have 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.560
 who are you looking and listening and waiting for my 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.150
 video but the channel works and she came up 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.260
 lots and lots and lots of things and gonna do it 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.260
 bring it to life 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.660
 we'll start with a book video review from 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.730
 ginger and panda for whether to bargain today 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.190
 talking about very controversial 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.860
 works of spiritless sergei minaev 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.260
 the fact is that it seems easy to me personally 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.789
 talk about classics because about her 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.770
 opinions already formed and you, willy-nilly 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.829
 affected by the already established 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.140
 opinions because classics are classics 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.260
 she can not not like 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:58.140
 can of course but we will assume that not 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.210
 may not like the classic and what 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.489
 concerns contemporary works then on 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.189
 today reader is ill set 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.680
 and the pros and cons of this work 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.680
 completely free and perfect 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.770
 calm because the view of the new 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.110
 about the new book and about the new author still as 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.009
 would not have developed they only form and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.560
 will be held until the year is really some 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.020
 have a glass on and opinion about the piece 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.420
 will appear and that's why the spirit of the ski is 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.240
 very controversial product with 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.189
 one side there is a huge amount 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.799
 negative reviews on the other hand have 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.530
 a lot of positive feedback 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.380
 and there are even people who reread 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.020
 this book is many many many times and I will say 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.970
 you honestly hand on heart i'm for 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.670
 I still have not decided on one hundred 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.890
 percent after all this is positive 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.670
 product or negative so 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.610
 let's understand together 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.619
 so the tale of the unreal man 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.470
 book in which are told but quite 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.899
 real top manager of a large company 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.630
 the narrative is in the first person 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.740
 this top manager talks about his 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.039
 of life 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.410
 about stupid fun about big money 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.280
 about drunkenness and drugs nothing 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.290
 reminds exactly 99 francs this river traffic 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.060
 Sergey Minayev confessed despite 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.220
 that the main character is still 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.800
 collective image book itself in 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.959
 somewhat autobiographical but 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.630
 the popularity of the book he explained by the fact that 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.420
 hit it so to speak in the stream or rather pressed 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.670
 on the sore point of modern society 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.680
 because obviously there is no name for the main one 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.299
 hero so that every reader could so 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.510
 say to frame this manifestation 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.700
 put any of your character out 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.470
 life may even be at the moment I 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.750
 remembered the work of the secular 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.810
 Russia where the main character also does not 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.130
 was the name but there is something he has been a good boy, we 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.650
 back to Sergey Minaev 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.650
 and his books where the world is depicted without love 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.920
 no friends shows fallen 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.590
 and without a spiritual society from the claim that 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.709
 it all happens here and now around 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.769
 us that everything in any rotten hopeless and 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.739
 our main character is brewed in all of this 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.260
 he seems to understand that he is looking for everything 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.959
 from here exits and he even actually 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.500
 there was one variant he himself to him 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.180
 came he yearns to somehow 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.959
 rethink yourself and break out of it 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.660
 vicious circle well what still interferes 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.750
 tell me that this book does not deserve 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.790
 read first introspection which 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.630
 deals with the main character periodically 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.630
 his rethinking of life and his place 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.090
 in this life up to be plural 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.579
 someone may seem invisible and and the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.910
 as if its wheat but in fact 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:52.519
 In fact it is and this is the whole idea of ​​the book 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.829
 at least I really hope so 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.780
 i like the same kind 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.750
 open final when you're still 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.670
 expecting that everything will be fine 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.860
 and summing up 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.220
 if you like such works as 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.040
 99 francs and 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.930
 and Russia will have this book as a discount. 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.790
 you like if you think our world 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.250
 rotted almost to its very foundation 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.709
 then this book on the one hand can 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.950
 confirm your guesses on the other 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.330
 parties may still hint that no 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.420
 everything is so bad in the Danish kingdom 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.480
 precisely thanks to the self-digging of the main 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.180
 hero and thanks to some hive but if 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.820
 you pink glasses this book will help them 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.810
 take off though as you guess what you 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.930
 masters stash 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.750
 that's a big question on besides style 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.810
 writing it can't be said to be easy 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.330
 but such newspapers on the internet magazine 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.170
 and this, too, has its advantages 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.390
 like read you watched a book 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.630

 interesting and many new ideas that 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.380
 already in the process of incarnation so
