our<00:01:12.420> differences<00:01:12.659> behind<00:01:13.110> us<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:13.970> science

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
our differences behind us for science

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.620 
our differences behind us for science
you<00:01:15.740> monster<00:01:16.740> look<00:01:17.729> who's<00:01:17.970> calling<00:01:18.240> who<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
monster we expect us to do well I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.859 
monster we expect us to do well I
suppose<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.670> could<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.240> sit<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.720> room

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
suppose we could just sit in this room

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.660 
suppose we could just sit in this room
and<00:01:25.110> glare<00:01:25.590> at<00:01:25.830> each<00:01:25.860> other<00:01:26.220> until<00:01:26.460> somebody

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
drops dead but I have a better idea it's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.010
