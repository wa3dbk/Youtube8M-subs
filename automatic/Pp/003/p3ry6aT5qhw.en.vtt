00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.969
 blusher cream versus blusher 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:11.170
 dust today I'm going to give you some tricks and 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.970
 some advices 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.710
 the blusher in cream we apply 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.810
 after the makeup base and without 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.740
 massify the face we can apply 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.930
 with a synthetic skunk style brush 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.970
 with a sponge or with hands 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.980
 effect is always very juicy and natural 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.710
 if you do it with a brush with a 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.559
 sponge first remove the excess this 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.910
 Blusher is ideal for mature skin 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:38.520
 teens and dry and we apply it 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.520
 just at the end of the iris in the center 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.180
 although lately it is very fashionable 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.980
 maybe we do not find as many shades as 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.870
 powder blushes but not 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.980
 worry because we can mix them 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.130
 to create new colors 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.130
 Y 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.670
 we can also use a lipstick already 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.980
 which has a very similar texture or goes 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.500
 to make one home with tri medra groped 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.720
 lip balm and mix it with powders 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.080
 Loose eyeshadow or blusher on 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.080
 powder 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.830
 i 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.470
 I advise you if you want to modify 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.700
 the face you use loose powder 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.700
 translucent to not kill the color 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.140
 and if you pass with the ether color after 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.150
 you have to apply a bit of base 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.979
 makeup to lower the color think 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.560
 that we can give a lot of scares to the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.250
 blusher in cream we can apply it in 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.250
 our cheeks 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.950
 on the lips 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.600
 do not 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.600
 or as eye shadow 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.960
 now let's comment a little on the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.460
 Powder blushes are ideal for 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.020
 oily skin but you can also 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.020
 use mixed skins 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.260
 we will use decent round brushes 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.330
 skunk or bevelled style think that 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.010
 we can mix more than one blush and 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.010
 how not to give more than one use 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.200
 if you use sand or toasted tones 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.200
 much better to contour the face 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.530
 and if they are pink or fruity tones, 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.980
 we will apply right in the center of the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.980
 cheek 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.930
 and if we go over and apply too much 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.430
 blusher in this case we will apply powders 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.560
 Loose or compact with one color 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.750
 and before I finish telling you that the 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.670
 Blushes in gel or in dyes is absorbed 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.569
 very fast so I do not advise 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.090
 use them in very dry skins 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.620
 and that's all, for now I hope that 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.790
