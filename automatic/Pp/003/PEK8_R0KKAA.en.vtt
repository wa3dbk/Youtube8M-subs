00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
that character is very much kind of

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.400 
that character is very much kind of
protected<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> character<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:31.019> ever

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
protected the character but if ever

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.580 
protected the character but if ever
there<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> time<00:00:31.830> when<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.309> was<00:00:32.669> seemed

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
there was a time when it was seemed

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.799 
there was a time when it was seemed
right<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.300> would<00:00:36.450> surely<00:00:36.660> be

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
right to do so it it would surely be

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.840 
right to do so it it would surely be
Fred<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> pallbearers<00:00:38.070> induction<00:00:38.340> wouldn't

Fred the pallbearers induction wouldn't

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.720 
Fred the pallbearers induction wouldn't
it<00:00:39.140> yeah<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.410> was<00:00:40.559> surprised<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.219> see<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.430> he

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it yeah I was surprised to see that he

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.119 
it yeah I was surprised to see that he
was<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.300> actually<00:00:42.899> because<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.530> thought

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
was going in actually because I thought

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.729 
was going in actually because I thought
he<00:00:44.399> had<00:00:44.730> always<00:00:44.879> said<00:00:45.360> I'm<00:00:45.930> sure<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.200> heard<00:00:46.500> this

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
he had always said I'm sure I heard this

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.529 
he had always said I'm sure I heard this
right<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.160> he<00:00:47.309> wanted<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.820> inducted<00:00:48.329> with

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
right that he wanted to be inducted with

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.680 
right that he wanted to be inducted with
the<00:00:48.690> Undertaker<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> given<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.420> didn't

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the Undertaker so given that they didn't

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.840 
the Undertaker so given that they didn't
you<00:00:52.230> know<00:00:52.350> said<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.770> didn't<00:00:53.010> manage<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.340> induct

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
you know said we didn't manage to induct

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.310 
you know said we didn't manage to induct
him<00:00:53.940> while<00:00:54.180> you're<00:00:54.329> still<00:00:54.570> alive<00:00:54.690> life<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
him while you're still alive life I

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.770 
him while you're still alive life I
figured<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.070> would<00:00:56.280> hold<00:00:56.520> off<00:00:56.730> until<00:00:57.210> they

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
figured they would hold off until they

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.709 
figured they would hold off until they
went<00:00:57.960> with<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> Undertaker<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.829> well<00:00:59.010> now<00:00:59.719> one

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
went with the Undertaker as well now one

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.470 
went with the Undertaker as well now one
possible<00:01:01.199> reason<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.800> they<00:01:02.640> might<00:01:03.270> have

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
possible reason that they might have

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.030 
possible reason that they might have
changed<00:01:03.750> plans<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.379> well<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:04.650> he<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:04.890> being

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
changed plans is well if he was being

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.410 
changed plans is well if he was being
inducted<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> same<00:01:05.909> night<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
inducted on the same night as the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.780 
inducted on the same night as the
Undertaker<00:01:06.990> than<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> Undertaker<00:01:08.100> couldn't

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
Undertaker than the Undertaker couldn't

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.429 
Undertaker than the Undertaker couldn't
be<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.360> introduce<00:01:09.510> him<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.110> obvious

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
be the one to introduce him for obvious

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.480 
be the one to introduce him for obvious
reasons<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.860> wouldn't<00:01:11.159> work<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:13.070> all<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> can

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
reasons I wouldn't work so all I can

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.800 
reasons I wouldn't work so all I can
think<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:14.970> that's<00:01:15.270> where<00:01:15.509> they're<00:01:15.659> going

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
think is that that's where they're going

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.270 
think is that that's where they're going
to<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.320> Undertaker<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to go with it and Undertaker is going to

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.740 
to go with it and Undertaker is going to
be<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> guy<00:01:17.610> who<00:01:17.670> does<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.180> now<00:01:18.299> an<00:01:18.450> obvious

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
be the guy who does it now an obvious

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.149 
be the guy who does it now an obvious
alternative<00:01:18.869> his<00:01:19.439> cane<00:01:20.930> Mick<00:01:21.930> Foley<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.530> guess

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
alternative his cane Mick Foley I guess

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.120 
alternative his cane Mick Foley I guess
yeah<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:23.909> they<00:01:24.590> will<00:01:25.590> wear<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> managed

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
yeah because they will wear a managed

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.039 
yeah because they will wear a managed
him<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.549> while<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.360> yeah<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.780> mean

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
him for a while but really yeah I mean

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.130 
him for a while but really yeah I mean
who<00:01:28.740> else<00:01:28.890> who<00:01:29.340> else<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:30.329> more<00:01:30.630> appropriate

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
who else who else is more appropriate

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.190 
who else who else is more appropriate
than<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.350> Undertaker<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.070> think

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
than the Undertaker and I think

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.690 
than the Undertaker and I think
Undertaker<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:34.409> sure<00:01:34.590> would<00:01:35.040> concede<00:01:35.490> he<00:01:35.579> has

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
Undertaker I'm sure would concede he has

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.850 
Undertaker I'm sure would concede he has
a<00:01:35.729> lot<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> his<00:01:36.450> early<00:01:37.140> career<00:01:37.320> yes<00:01:37.680> Paul

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
a lot of his early career yes Paul

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.560 
a lot of his early career yes Paul
Bearer<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.250> think<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.240> think<00:01:39.450> if

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
Bearer to think for that and I think if

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.810 
Bearer to think for that and I think if
there's<00:01:39.720> ever<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.930> time<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.520> drop<00:01:41.520> out<00:01:41.700> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
there's ever a time to drop out of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.730 
there's ever a time to drop out of
character<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:43.200> would<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> time

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
character that that would be the time

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.880 
character that that would be the time
five<00:01:44.610> minutes<00:01:45.030> remaining<00:01:45.509> well<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.619> been

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
five minutes remaining well it's been

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.819 
five minutes remaining well it's been

an<00:01:59.939> extent<00:02:00.299> they<00:02:00.360> kind<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.170> pulled

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
an extent they kind of I think I pulled

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.440 
an extent they kind of I think I pulled
it<00:02:01.500> off<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.180> what<00:02:03.299> was<00:02:03.420> really

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
it off and but what was really

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.179 
it off and but what was really
interesting<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.170> he<00:02:04.290> inducted<00:02:04.799> austin

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
interesting is that he inducted austin

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.029 
interesting is that he inducted austin
and<00:02:05.369> i<00:02:06.270> thought<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.689> was<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.380> gave<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> little

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
and i thought it was it gave a little

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.889 
and i thought it was it gave a little
bit<00:02:08.220> more<00:02:08.340> gravitas<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.330> induction

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
bit more gravitas to the induction

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.059 
bit more gravitas to the induction
because<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.349> was<00:02:10.470> somebody<00:02:10.770> who<00:02:10.890> doesn't

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
because it was somebody who doesn't

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.660 
because it was somebody who doesn't
usually<00:02:11.250> appear<00:02:11.640> who's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
usually appear who's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.699 
usually appear who's
sort<00:02:12.819> of<00:02:12.910> consciously<00:02:13.599> avoided<00:02:13.930> being<00:02:14.410> at<00:02:14.590> the

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
sort of consciously avoided being at the

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.320 
sort of consciously avoided being at the
ceremony<00:02:15.130> so<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.430> just<00:02:15.700> feel<00:02:15.970> like<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.300> would

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
ceremony so I just feel like it would

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330 
ceremony so I just feel like it would
also<00:02:16.540> be<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.810> bit<00:02:16.959> more<00:02:17.110> special<00:02:17.380> for<00:02:17.800> a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
also be a bit more special for a

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.309 
also be a bit more special for a
pallbearer<00:02:18.550> if<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.270> had<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:19.660> guy<00:02:19.930> who<00:02:19.989> was

I think the only other thing I would say

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.800 
I think the only other thing I would say
on<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:41.580> with<00:02:42.580> all<00:02:42.730> due<00:02:43.239> respect<00:02:43.269> to
