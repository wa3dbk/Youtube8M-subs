00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
them right interestingly enough I

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.590 
them right interestingly enough I
actually<00:01:37.320> haven't<00:01:38.060> worked<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.299> them<00:01:39.450> much

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
actually haven't worked with them much

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.560 
actually haven't worked with them much
because<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:40.920> all<00:01:41.220> record<00:01:41.460> separately<00:01:41.970> in

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
because they all record separately in

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.960 
because they all record separately in
essence<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.110> um<00:01:43.320> seeing<00:01:44.220> them<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:44.430> events<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
essence but um seeing them at events and

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.580 
essence but um seeing them at events and
seeing<00:01:45.180> them<00:01:45.299> at<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> premiere<00:01:45.930> was<00:01:46.170> really

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
seeing them at the premiere was really

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.960 
seeing them at the premiere was really
really<00:01:46.770> special<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.310> talking<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.759> them<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
really special and talking with them and

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.550 
really special and talking with them and
I<00:01:48.420> think<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.810> was<00:01:48.899> actually<00:01:48.960> Tim<00:01:49.290> Allen's

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
