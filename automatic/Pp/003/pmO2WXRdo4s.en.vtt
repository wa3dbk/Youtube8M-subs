00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.960
 on this occasion 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.490
 I'm going to answer one of the many questions you ask me or Canada 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.559
 to hide but a photograph 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.879
 inside a heart with this vanished act 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.009
 well first thing 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.429

 new by people 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.009
 control n 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.349
 you will not appear this window 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.480
 I'm going to use the default size of photoshop 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.860
 now we go where there is 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.960
 the rectangle tool 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.380
 we give click we hold 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.380
 and we are going to use custom form tools 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.160
 that there is common is critical 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
 here they will not seem to have wanted to look for the forms 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.590
 a state that will present here 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.590
 you can carry this heart shape where it says 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.780
 your client will appear 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.940
 this this options menu 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.240
 good we choose the heart 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.460
 pressing chic 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.630
 and dragging 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.280
 the mouse 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.280
 let's create our heart this way 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.240
 as a tool to move to center it 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.310
 now here in the layers palette 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.340
 where it says one way 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.970
 let's give a right click and let's say raster iza 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.050
 now we are going to filter 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.390
 blur 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.640
 blur 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.160
 the 'u' is not 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.770
 we are going to give it 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.760
 A rosary 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.760
 seven strikeouts 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.700
 in addition the equipment photographs and in this case 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.190
 I chose once 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.800
 of the network 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.280
 I will not put in the basilica heart 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.630
 the rake 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.630
 up photoshop 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.409
 since we have it there 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.149
 let's press 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.099
 between these two layers 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.689
 The key 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.989
 and we get this icon that is like circuits 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.089
 with a little arrow 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.749
 so that it is within 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.549
 this form added at the moment 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.909
 had a bit of moving it 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.379
 as you want 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.969
 so he left it 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.959
 and this adventure and the effect of the panel was to make it look a little better 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.379
 I'm going to unlock this background layer because you never merit and tactics 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.579

 we fill 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.899

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.899
