00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:07.140
 done that I am snipe and here you are 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.449
 I bring minecraft as you see in the title 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.529
 how to make a house pump good for 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:15.959
 I have seen this and I have not done it 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:18.090
 I've done it before so it will not last me 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.740
 a lot of the video because if it does not take me 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.860
 a lot in uploading and you're going to have a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.470
 bad quality then with this method 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.060
 which takes about 10 minutes are about 6 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.340
 minutes in doing all this then 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.010
 then when you have all this I'm going to 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.879
 explain the steps to see places an oven 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.220
 on any surface 1 point later 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.550
 Place is a piston to have been adhesive 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.540
 behind 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.820
 place a stone behind with the button 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:55.350
 adhesive next where the plate 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.879
 that is the adhesive block you place 123 to 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.180
 the left blocks that is worth 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.670
 any block then having to place 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.530
 one here or is any block here 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.649
 and a repeater and a torch of rest 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.840
 here take the rest or fill pam pam 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.860
 pam a block two blocks three blocks 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.780
 four blocks when you get to the room 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.630
 or you catch here, these will be open 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:31.320
 for here because you break here and place 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:34.380
 a torch of the rest is worth placing 6 lo 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:40.020
 that is created stays like this and continue with the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.870
 rest 1 2 3 4 5 and up here this 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.729
 we have to build it you are worth 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:49.140
 I'm going to leave a few seconds like that so 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.310
 you see worth and new you download and this has 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:58.070
 that be double under vale 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:03.360
 of 6 x 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 well I did it 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:11.690
 of 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:14.000
 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4 5 or 6 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.880
 and so it's much better because if you 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.470
 leave a site from a site to place 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.350
 better and move better 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.970
 you have to have all these objects in 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.390
 those that I have filled the bar 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.430
 take the repeaters and place them with 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.380
 a block of separation that is to say 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.310
 You are here but I am going to put it like that 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.470
 you are there 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:43.650
 and you take and put 123 on one side 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:47.220
 you leave the 123 free corner on the other 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.400
 free corner side 123 by the side 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.640
 free corner and 1 2 and 3 and free corner 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.610
 is going to stay like this without the tnt then 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.700
 you put the tnt well still this does not 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.670
 is finished you take the rest and how are you going 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:09.209
 around here you follow by the edge that 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:12.720
 you have left followed 66666 well very well 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:17.280
 Now I'm going to do this 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:21.799
 that you take earth and the same material and 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.799

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.209
 As you can see, nothing good is noticed 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.100

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.590

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.950
 we are going to cover it up well we put this 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.670
 that's how it was like this we put a block 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.350
 more and remove this and we keep doing 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.030
 as a structure of the house and it is and 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.030

 it's like this 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.240
 but let's put it in the day to be 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.240
 nicer 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.270

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.440

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.970
