00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.049
 what do you think is delicious and delicious 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.119
 good you who are expert in eating pasta 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.740
 I thought native 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.240
 Claudia, how do you like this? 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.009
 salad is not for daily passes in 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.750
 long you are looking for is a combination there 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.549
 a pasta although you can find in 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.229
 super shorgan and cost that is called 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.490
 ezequiel that by the combination of 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.229
 beads that it has becomes 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.179
 protein so for the amino acids like 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.340
 break and then it becomes protein 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.380
 in this case if they can consume it but 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.899
 if it can get to put on weight because 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.929
 you see the Italians and they 're 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.520
 very good seaweed and to descend there is no 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.140
 to take care of themselves and apart they walk 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.420
 a lot no claudia yes but then how about 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.630

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.790

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.920

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.319
 laugh if you liked that good big ya 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.090
 that the wholemeal pasta will be different 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.130
 it's a little quieter a little bit more 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.750
 thicker you need it to go through 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.670
 cooking because it can be doughy true 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.530
 exactly but that they visit us and prof 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.120

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.610

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:44.100
 the wool out there that wants it to come back 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:46.530

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.060
 something these can be so five 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.730
 separated years and come back and alone 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.590
