00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
type of coin in this case we're looking

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.130 
type of coin in this case we're looking
at<00:00:18.310> just<00:00:18.369> two<00:00:18.820> types<00:00:19.150> of<00:00:19.420> coins

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
at just two types of coins

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.440 
at just two types of coins
we've<00:00:20.560> got<00:00:20.770> Lacey<00:00:21.040> and<00:00:21.460> she's<00:00:21.790> saved<00:00:22.120> all<00:00:22.420> of

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
we've got Lacey and she's saved all of

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.150 
we've got Lacey and she's saved all of
her<00:00:22.720> quarters<00:00:23.380> and<00:00:23.770> her<00:00:24.640> dimes<00:00:24.940> in<00:00:25.540> the<00:00:25.810> jar

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
her quarters and her dimes in the jar

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.580 
her quarters and her dimes in the jar
she<00:00:27.160> has<00:00:27.280> collected<00:00:27.970> a<00:00:28.540> hundred<00:00:28.810> and<00:00:29.140> seventy

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
she has collected a hundred and seventy

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
she has collected a hundred and seventy
coins<00:00:29.890> that<00:00:30.190> are<00:00:30.340> worth<00:00:31.140> $26<00:00:32.140> we<00:00:33.070> want<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.489> know

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
coins that are worth $26 we want to know

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.200 
coins that are worth $26 we want to know
how<00:00:33.940> many<00:00:34.000> of<00:00:34.360> each<00:00:34.450> coin<00:00:34.809> she<00:00:35.110> has<00:00:35.850> well<00:00:36.850> let's

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
how many of each coin she has well let's

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.149 
how many of each coin she has well let's
think<00:00:37.629> logically<00:00:38.199> about<00:00:38.440> this

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:39.159 
think logically about this

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:41.849 
think logically about this
okay<00:00:39.550> she's<00:00:39.909> only<00:00:40.120> got<00:00:40.329> two<00:00:40.659> types<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.260> coins

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
okay she's only got two types of coins

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.849 
okay she's only got two types of coins
okay<00:00:42.640> she's<00:00:42.909> got<00:00:43.089> quarters<00:00:43.690> which<00:00:44.499> are<00:00:44.710> like

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
okay she's got quarters which are like

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.069 
okay she's got quarters which are like
25<00:00:45.429> cents<00:00:46.059> so<00:00:46.870> we<00:00:47.019> would<00:00:47.170> say<00:00:47.550> 25<00:00:48.550> cents<00:00:49.300> but<00:00:49.960> we

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
25 cents so we would say 25 cents but we

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.169 
25 cents so we would say 25 cents but we
don't<00:00:50.289> know<00:00:50.409> how<00:00:50.739> many<00:00:51.039> quarters<00:00:51.519> she<00:00:51.579> has<00:00:51.940> so

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
don't know how many quarters she has so

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.930 
don't know how many quarters she has so
we're<00:00:52.329> going<00:00:52.449> to<00:00:52.510> multiply<00:00:52.690> that<00:00:53.409> by<00:00:53.940> Q

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
we're going to multiply that by Q

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.669 
we're going to multiply that by Q
quarters<00:00:57.269> then<00:00:58.269> we're<00:00:58.449> going<00:00:58.659> to<00:00:58.870> add<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.469> that

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
quarters then we're going to add to that

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:00.930 
quarters then we're going to add to that
all<00:00:59.979> of<00:01:00.129> our<00:01:00.219> dimes

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
all of our dimes

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.020 
all of our dimes
okay<00:01:01.510> dimes<00:01:01.809> are<00:01:02.049> ten<00:01:02.289> cents<00:01:02.769> each<00:01:03.100> so<00:01:03.460> we're

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
okay dimes are ten cents each so we're

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.899 
okay dimes are ten cents each so we're
going<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.239> multiply<00:01:04.420> ten<00:01:05.080> cents<00:01:05.680> times<00:01:06.040> the

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
going to multiply ten cents times the

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.200 
going to multiply ten cents times the
number<00:01:07.299> of<00:01:07.330> dimes<00:01:07.690> that<00:01:08.080> we<00:01:08.200> have<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:10.060> we

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
number of dimes that we have here we

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.660 
number of dimes that we have here we
have<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.420> money<00:01:10.840> plus<00:01:11.230> money<00:01:11.620> problem<00:01:12.370> some

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
have a money plus money problem some

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.060 
have a money plus money problem some
money<00:01:12.940> plus<00:01:13.330> money<00:01:13.660> always<00:01:14.020> equals<00:01:14.740> more

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
money plus money always equals more

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.640 
money plus money always equals more
money<00:01:15.660> so<00:01:16.660> that<00:01:17.110> gives<00:01:17.290> us<00:01:17.440> 26<00:01:18.100> dollars<00:01:19.650> now

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
money so that gives us 26 dollars now

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.110 
money so that gives us 26 dollars now
most<00:01:20.890> of<00:01:20.980> the<00:01:21.040> time<00:01:21.250> we<00:01:21.490> don't<00:01:21.610> really<00:01:21.730> care

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
most of the time we don't really care

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.600 
most of the time we don't really care
for<00:01:22.180> working<00:01:22.990> with<00:01:23.260> decimals<00:01:23.800> so<00:01:24.100> let's<00:01:24.370> go

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
for working with decimals so let's go

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.990 
for working with decimals so let's go
ahead<00:01:24.760> and<00:01:25.210> multiply<00:01:25.750> this<00:01:26.200> equation<00:01:26.700> by<00:01:27.700> 100

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
ahead and multiply this equation by 100

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.600 
ahead and multiply this equation by 100
and<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:28.810> will<00:01:29.050> get<00:01:29.200> rid<00:01:29.440> of<00:01:29.470> all<00:01:29.920> of<00:01:30.010> our

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
and that will get rid of all of our

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.790 
and that will get rid of all of our
decimal<00:01:30.850> points<00:01:33.300> that<00:01:34.300> gives<00:01:34.540> us<00:01:34.720> 25<00:01:35.500> Q<00:01:37.800> plus

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
decimal points that gives us 25 Q plus

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:49.260 
decimal points that gives us 25 Q plus
10d<00:01:39.520> equals<00:01:43.980> 2600<00:01:47.370> okay<00:01:48.370> that's<00:01:48.670> only<00:01:48.910> one

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
10d equals 2600 okay that's only one

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.510 
10d equals 2600 okay that's only one
equation<00:01:49.720> then<00:01:50.170> I'm<00:01:50.560> gonna<00:01:50.860> hear<00:01:51.130> we'll<00:01:51.280> need

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
equation then I'm gonna hear we'll need

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.380 
equation then I'm gonna hear we'll need
this<00:01:51.730> one<00:01:51.970> anymore<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:53.350> need<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.740> find<00:01:54.010> another

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
this one anymore we need to find another

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.880 
this one anymore we need to find another
equation<00:01:55.390> or<00:01:55.600> another<00:01:56.050> number<00:01:56.350> that<00:01:56.770> we

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
equation or another number that we

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.390 
equation or another number that we
haven't<00:01:57.250> used<00:01:57.430> in<00:01:57.790> this<00:01:57.910> equation<00:01:57.970> yet<00:01:59.310> do<00:02:00.310> you

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
haven't used in this equation yet do you

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.840 
haven't used in this equation yet do you
see<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.760> hundred<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.390> seventy<00:02:01.870> coins<00:02:02.850> that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
see the hundred and seventy coins that

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.910 
see the hundred and seventy coins that
tells<00:02:04.180> us<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.630> we<00:02:04.780> have<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.260> hundred<00:02:05.740> and

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
tells us that we have a hundred and

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.290 
tells us that we have a hundred and
seventy<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:07.050> combination<00:02:08.050> of<00:02:08.259> 170<00:02:09.250> coins<00:02:09.940> that

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
seventy a combination of 170 coins that

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.080 
seventy a combination of 170 coins that
were<00:02:10.479> made<00:02:10.690> up<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:10.989> quarters<00:02:11.409> and<00:02:11.650> dimes<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.940> we

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
were made up of quarters and dimes so we

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.080 
were made up of quarters and dimes so we
could<00:02:13.270> say<00:02:13.480> all<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.750> our<00:02:14.080> quarters<00:02:14.790> plus<00:02:15.790> all

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
could say all of our quarters plus all

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.610 
could say all of our quarters plus all
of<00:02:16.390> our<00:02:16.540> dimes

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
of our dimes

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.140 
of our dimes
equals<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.980> hundred<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.610> seventy<00:02:21.940> from<00:02:22.940> here

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
equals a hundred and seventy from here

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.960 
equals a hundred and seventy from here
we<00:02:23.360> can<00:02:23.510> solve<00:02:23.750> our<00:02:23.989> system<00:02:24.440> of<00:02:24.560> equations<00:02:25.250> by

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
we can solve our system of equations by

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.229 
we can solve our system of equations by
using<00:02:26.000> either<00:02:26.750> substitution<00:02:27.739> or<00:02:27.860> elimination

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
using either substitution or elimination

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.309 
using either substitution or elimination
I'm<00:02:29.239> going<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.019> use<00:02:30.170> elimination<00:02:31.690> we<00:02:32.690> multiply
