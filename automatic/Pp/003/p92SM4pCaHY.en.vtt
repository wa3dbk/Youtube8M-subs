00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.210
 please do not let anyone tell you too much about it, that there is only one 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.670
 There are always many ways to get there 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.670
 mix in exotic cocktail because tastes different 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.160
 Shell up against Glasgow so splendid catcher times poisonous green cocktail on the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.300
 One side drinks her customer's tastes often to weigh the satellite 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.539
 it must taste too 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.589
 For getting away from the st make the customer right 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.979
 otherwise the customers will do us a good deal of justice 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.589
 I want you to be able to follow more in the view 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.680
 that is also Colin should do something for us 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.249
 This is to value our time that customers 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:46.030
 St also as something good as something positive when the time is up 

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:47.220
 They have 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.359
 that has a lot to do with her own attitude 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.210
 when they make their customers feel 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.960
 you can call me anytime i just come to you anytime 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.210
 really crisp from prospective customers 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.210
 if they feel they are always jumping right away 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.389
 she just comes over are all the time in the world 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:05.740
 then the cow will treat those interested as well 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.650
 when they make the others feel 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.340
 Also my time is precious too 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.210
 and therefore 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.310
 what specify on the phone if an appointment at all interested me 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.920
 and counts for both sides 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.290
 then that's fine 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.580
 we'll see that's easy going 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.610
 everything I tell him today 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.240
 I'm even proud that everything is completely normal in one 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.840
 compiled in a particular way tonight 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.600
 compressed anyway because of the short time because we have just 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.220
 almost three hours 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.930
 in that case I like to say but just to focus on them 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.280
 concentrate because that was what they need now 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.210
 a maximum of concentration 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.630
 a maximum of simply say I feel important now because the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.080
 Matter because it's fun 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.440
 I followed him the makers 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.480
 And then you can decide for yourself which things the best of him 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.270
 taste 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.250
 some things that taste excellent 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.320
 other things may be producing 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.130
 only when I say sellers 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.380
 I had the conversation briefly at the event yesterday 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.649
 and also the days before when I say have the courage again customers 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.689
 select 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.749
 Of course many say who can afford it 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.579
 could not afford to do anything with it 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.299
 on the contrary 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.889
 you know what that alone has for a charisma 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.829
 if they have the guts, it really takes a lot of courage in the beginning 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.310
 to behave differently 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.379
 and their customers 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.859
 to ask really qualifying questions to find out Yes he wants 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.930
 really fun the happy morning 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.930
 I called a customer back that was a great experience 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.310
 Capitano Hofert he declared himself guilty of doing some art and art 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.339
 Meier 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:42.789
 Eater Hello Mr. Meier 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.079
 thank you very much they have sent out requests a few days ago now i 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.819
 really had written a lot of half page so ideally it is important 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.169
 a lot of 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.129
 Aachen slipped what he wants 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.129
 especially a question or the train make guests 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:57.619
 good question 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.669
 should finish the production of the now remaining if, however, they consider 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:01.699
 when to do this 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.699
 and Mainz is the best time the location is on the phone 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:09.049
 Ã¶fingen he said to me that's strange but now Rome usually asked 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.299
 I say in Bochum her phone 16 seats 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.299
 that too would be their employees with us 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.889
 that would be good 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.909
 Today we have to have rough edges with the product new 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.259
 says Ohm hide we have to have courage 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.779
 to be different 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:28.319
 Top sellers are 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.540
 passionate 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.469
 are not 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.479
 and are different 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.369
 and that's a very important point we honestly have to keep getting better and better 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:36.559
 his 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:37.970
 its different 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.170
 People live and evaluate based on differences 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:46.039
 if we are for the masses are treated here as the broad 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.929
 Dimensions 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:49.290
 if we are a little bit different 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.759
 deal with customers differently i say the big headline 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:57.349
 is a very possible way of dealing with customers with great value 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.349
 Obligation I see here is hardly going to talk about them 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.790
 often misunderstood 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.079
 as jostling or as ben kindness not at all 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.750
 Commitment is something very social they show their customers exactly what 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.419
 she him 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:12.669
 like to be able to offer 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.370
 If he has the right cards on the table then she does her job 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.829
 can do well 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.469
 because the offshore technology operator Monaco will 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.819
 make a piece of offer 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:24.870
 we do not know her 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.259
 it will be great great way of working great 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.469
 great basis for discussion 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.020
 We will change that because there are beautiful questions 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.909
 and just check 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.430
 and will, however, see us long before we get into the needs assessment 

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:39.400
 go and sometimes call it classic 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.590
 we need very different things
