so<00:00:05.490> let's<00:00:05.670> talk<00:00:05.879> about<00:00:05.940> some<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.450> those

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
so let's talk about some of those

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.110 
so let's talk about some of those
factors<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.410> why<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:07.890> can't<00:00:08.189> tell<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.940> exactly

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
factors and why I can't tell you exactly

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.410 
factors and why I can't tell you exactly
how<00:00:09.809> many<00:00:10.219> chlorine<00:00:11.219> tablets<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.910> should<00:00:12.179> use

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
how many chlorine tablets you should use

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.220 
how many chlorine tablets you should use
for<00:00:12.450> your<00:00:12.870> pool<00:00:13.500> now<00:00:14.130> keep<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.460> mind<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:15.230> started

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
care of swimming pools and I can't tell

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.870 
care of swimming pools and I can't tell
you<00:00:30.449> how<00:00:31.109> many<00:00:31.170> tale<00:00:31.740> that's<00:00:31.949> exactly<00:00:32.669> your

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
you how many tale that's exactly your

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.030 
you how many tale that's exactly your
pool<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.570> use<00:00:33.809> because<00:00:34.440> there's<00:00:34.800> so

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
pool is going to use because there's so

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.760 
pool is going to use because there's so
many<00:00:35.219> factors<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.969> impact<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.469> first

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
many factors that impact it the first

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.500 
many factors that impact it the first
and<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.129> biggest<00:00:38.640> factor<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
and the biggest factor that's going to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.979 
and the biggest factor that's going to
impact<00:00:39.960> your<00:00:40.230> chlorine<00:00:40.500> use<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.980> rain<00:00:41.430> water

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
impact your chlorine use is rain water

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.660 
impact your chlorine use is rain water
every<00:00:42.989> time<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.469> rains<00:00:43.739> you're<00:00:44.040> adding<00:00:44.340> lots

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
every time it rains you're adding lots

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.850 
every time it rains you're adding lots
of<00:00:44.910> fresh<00:00:45.210> water<00:00:45.480> remember<00:00:46.170> when<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.559> talked

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
of fresh water remember when we talked

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.340 
of fresh water remember when we talked
earlier<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.520> said<00:00:47.760> well<00:00:48.030> if<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.420> put<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> lot<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
earlier we said well if you put a lot of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.389 
earlier we said well if you put a lot of
salt<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:49.980> water

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
salt in this water

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.540 
salt in this water
how<00:00:51.000> would<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.420> lower<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.989> concentration

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
how would you lower the concentration

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.189 
how would you lower the concentration
well<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.760> easiest<00:00:54.149> way<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.629> said<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:55.050> simply

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
well the easiest way we said was simply

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.160 
well the easiest way we said was simply
to<00:00:55.469> raise<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.949> water<00:00:56.070> level<00:00:56.250> add<00:00:56.610> fresh<00:00:57.090> water

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
to raise the water level add fresh water

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.260 
to raise the water level add fresh water
well<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.289> happens<00:00:58.770> every<00:00:59.430> time<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.940> rains

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
well that happens every time it rains

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.110 
well that happens every time it rains
you<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.379> fresh<00:01:01.710> water<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.309> pool<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:03.059> has

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
you get fresh water in the pool that has

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.750 
you get fresh water in the pool that has
no<00:01:03.420> chlorine<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.500> lowers<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.309> level<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
no chlorine and that lowers the level of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.130 
no chlorine and that lowers the level of
chlorine<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.360> pool<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.750> lowers<00:01:07.110> that

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
chlorine in your pool it lowers that

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.310 
chlorine in your pool it lowers that
concentration<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.420> will<00:01:09.689> impact<00:01:10.080> your

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
concentration so that will impact your

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.710 
concentration so that will impact your
chlorine<00:01:10.590> use<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.610> second<00:01:12.060> major<00:01:12.270> thing<00:01:12.659> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
chlorine use the second major thing that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.230 
chlorine use the second major thing that
impacts<00:01:13.170> chlorine<00:01:13.590> use<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.030> temperature<00:01:15.030> as

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
impacts chlorine use is temperature as

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.719 
impacts chlorine use is temperature as
the<00:01:16.110> water<00:01:16.350> temperature<00:01:16.890> comes<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.610> it

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the water temperature comes up as it

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.609 
the water temperature comes up as it
gets<00:01:17.880> into<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> summer<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.659> gets<00:01:18.689> hot<00:01:19.080> outside

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
gets into the summer it gets hot outside

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.100 
gets into the summer it gets hot outside
the<00:01:20.100> water<00:01:20.340> temperature<00:01:20.939> comes<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.420> where's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the water temperature comes up where's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.230 
the water temperature comes up where's
that<00:01:22.320> water<00:01:22.530> temperature<00:01:22.830> comes<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.640> there

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
that water temperature comes up there

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.820 
that water temperature comes up there
are<00:01:24.360> more<00:01:24.570> things<00:01:24.900> growing<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> water

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
are more things growing in the water

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.830 
are more things growing in the water
which<00:01:26.220> impact<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> chlorine<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
which impact the chlorine and the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.569 
which impact the chlorine and the
chlorine<00:01:28.259> becomes<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:28.860> active<00:01:29.100> there's

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
chlorine becomes more active there's

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.490 
chlorine becomes more active there's
more<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.049> breaks<00:01:31.350> down

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
more going on and so it breaks down

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.240 
more going on and so it breaks down
faster<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.110> rainwater<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.979> water

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
faster so rainwater the water

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.200 
faster so rainwater the water
temperature

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
temperature

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.480 
temperature
there's<00:01:36.780> also<00:01:37.020> number<00:01:37.770> three<00:01:37.979> would<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.189> bay

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
there's also number three would be bay

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.850 
there's also number three would be bay
there<00:01:38.729> load<00:01:38.939> how<00:01:39.659> many<00:01:39.869> people<00:01:40.290> are<00:01:40.380> using<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
there load how many people are using the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.920 
there load how many people are using the
pool<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.340> how<00:01:41.759> many<00:01:42.000> times<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.479> week<00:01:42.509> are<00:01:42.810> they

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
pool and how many times a week are they

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.109 
pool and how many times a week are they
using<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.439> how<00:01:44.009> often<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> pool<00:01:44.909> being

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
using it how often is the pool being

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.870 
using it how often is the pool being
used<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:46.229> remember<00:01:46.530> chlorine<00:01:47.490> attacks

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
used because remember chlorine attacks

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.210 
used because remember chlorine attacks
things<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:48.930> combine<00:01:49.170> onto<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:49.920> skin

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
things so it will combine onto your skin

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.740 
things so it will combine onto your skin
and<00:01:50.490> when<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.060> out<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> pool<00:01:51.509> you're

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
and when you get out of the pool you're

after<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:42.060> few<00:02:42.300> days<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:43.110> water<00:02:43.350> went<00:02:43.620> down<00:02:43.710> and

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
after a few days the water went down and

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.340 
after a few days the water went down and
your<00:02:44.580> second-grade<00:02:45.150> teacher<00:02:45.450> said<00:02:46.140> well

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
your second-grade teacher said well

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.890 
your second-grade teacher said well
that's<00:02:46.500> evaporation<00:02:47.430> well<00:02:48.150> what<00:02:48.780> is

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that's evaporation well what is

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.020 
that's evaporation well what is
evaporation<00:02:49.440> evaporation<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:50.790> when<00:02:50.910> you're

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
evaporation evaporation is when you're

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.060 
evaporation evaporation is when you're
taking<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.480> chemical<00:02:52.020> that's<00:02:52.110> naturally<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.800> gas

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
taking a chemical that's naturally a gas

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.450 
taking a chemical that's naturally a gas
and<00:02:53.610> let<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.910> go<00:02:54.030> up<00:02:54.210> into<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> atmosphere

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
and let it go up into the atmosphere

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.460 
and let it go up into the atmosphere
well<00:02:56.460> in<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:56.940> case<00:02:57.210> hydrogen<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.960> oxygen

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
well in this case hydrogen and oxygen

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.010 
well in this case hydrogen and oxygen
hydrogen<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.550> oxygen<00:03:00.030> are<00:03:00.120> both<00:03:00.330> gases<00:03:00.870> they

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
hydrogen and oxygen are both gases they

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.600 
hydrogen and oxygen are both gases they
go<00:03:01.200> away<00:03:01.470> they've<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.160> into<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.460> atmosphere

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
go away they've up into the atmosphere

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.020 
go away they've up into the atmosphere
and<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.300> water<00:03:03.510> level<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:03.990> less<00:03:04.290> now<00:03:05.160> why<00:03:05.970> is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
and the water level is less now why is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.360 
and the water level is less now why is
that<00:03:06.150> important<00:03:06.780> because<00:03:07.320> chlorine<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.220> its

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
that important because chlorine in its

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.540 
that important because chlorine in its
natural<00:03:08.640> state<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.810> gas<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:11.130> when<00:03:11.400> it's

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
natural state is a gas so when it's

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.690 
natural state is a gas so when it's
impacted<00:03:12.330> by<00:03:12.480> sunlight<00:03:13.020> namely<00:03:13.700> ultraviolet

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
impacted by sunlight namely ultraviolet

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.200 
impacted by sunlight namely ultraviolet
light<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.840> chlorine<00:03:16.350> will<00:03:16.950> turn<00:03:17.280> into<00:03:17.520> a<00:03:17.730> gas

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
light that chlorine will turn into a gas

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.440 
light that chlorine will turn into a gas
and<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.900> goes<00:03:19.140> away<00:03:19.470> now<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.880> prevent<00:03:21.270> that

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
and it goes away now to prevent that

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.210 
and it goes away now to prevent that
there<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.870> product<00:03:22.290> called<00:03:22.350> conditioner

July<00:03:44.310> or<00:03:44.580> August<00:03:44.610> because<00:03:45.420> you've<00:03:45.750> had<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.020> top

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
July or August because you've had to top

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.870 
July or August because you've had to top
up<00:03:46.530> your<00:03:46.710> water<00:03:46.980> periodically<00:03:47.490> from

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
up your water periodically from

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.570 
up your water periodically from
splashing<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:48.960> evaporation<00:03:49.650> can<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.400> or

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
splashing and evaporation can this or

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.160 
splashing and evaporation can this or
helps<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.910> hold<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.270> chlorine<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.960> water

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
helps to hold the chlorine in the water

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.690 
helps to hold the chlorine in the water
so<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.800> doesn't<00:03:52.830> evaporate

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
so it doesn't evaporate

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.700 
so it doesn't evaporate
now<00:03:54.330> we<00:03:54.390> recommend<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.410> have<00:03:55.560> your

you<00:04:09.720> have<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:09.930> tested<00:04:10.170> professionally<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.190> too

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
you have it tested professionally is too

pool what happens is it slows the

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.780 
pool what happens is it slows the
chlorine<00:04:16.410> down<00:04:16.710> and<00:04:17.040> keeps<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.400> from<00:04:17.549> reacting

night<00:05:46.860> all<00:05:47.099> you<00:05:47.250> forgot<00:05:47.550> or<00:05:47.789> whatever<00:05:48.120> the

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
night all you forgot or whatever the

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.329 
night all you forgot or whatever the
reason<00:05:48.449> is<00:05:48.870> you're<00:05:49.529> just<00:05:49.680> not<00:05:49.800> going<00:05:50.069> to<00:05:50.129> do<00:05:50.310> it

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:50.339 
reason is you're just not going to do it

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:52.519 
reason is you're just not going to do it
every<00:05:51.000> Sunday<00:05:51.300> and<00:05:51.569> Wednesday<00:05:51.750> it<00:05:52.110> just<00:05:52.379> won't

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:52.529 
every Sunday and Wednesday it just won't

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.439 
every Sunday and Wednesday it just won't
happen<00:05:52.710> that's<00:05:53.669> why<00:05:53.940> we<00:05:54.150> recommend<00:05:54.830> algaecide

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
happen that's why we recommend algaecide

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.689 
happen that's why we recommend algaecide
now<00:05:57.449> this<00:05:57.599> particular<00:05:57.810> algaecide<00:05:58.740> is<00:05:58.949> copper

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
now this particular algaecide is copper

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.540 
now this particular algaecide is copper
algaecide<00:06:00.289> again<00:06:01.289> there's<00:06:01.589> a<00:06:01.650> dosage<00:06:02.189> amount

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
algaecide again there's a dosage amount

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.980 
algaecide again there's a dosage amount
in<00:06:03.020> copper<00:06:04.020> algaecide<00:06:04.879> usually<00:06:05.879> two<00:06:06.449> ounces

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
in copper algaecide usually two ounces

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.769 
in copper algaecide usually two ounces
per<00:06:07.589> 10,000<00:06:08.430> gallons<00:06:08.879> once<00:06:09.659> every<00:06:10.349> two<00:06:10.620> weeks

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:11.779 
per 10,000 gallons once every two weeks

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:15.200 
per 10,000 gallons once every two weeks
algaecide<00:06:12.810> is<00:06:13.050> very<00:06:13.379> very<00:06:13.620> stable<00:06:14.210> unlike

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
algaecide is very very stable unlike

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.499 
algaecide is very very stable unlike
chlorine<00:06:15.839> it<00:06:16.050> does<00:06:16.349> not<00:06:16.560> combine<00:06:16.949> up<00:06:17.400> it<00:06:17.610> stays

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
chlorine it does not combine up it stays

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:19.429 
chlorine it does not combine up it stays
in<00:06:18.870> the<00:06:18.960> water

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:19.439 
in the water

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.519 
in the water
now<00:06:20.129> what<00:06:20.279> algaecide<00:06:20.849> does<00:06:21.210> is<00:06:21.599> its<00:06:21.870> presence

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:22.529 
now what algaecide does is its presence

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:24.649 
now what algaecide does is its presence
in<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:22.770> water<00:06:23.150> inhibits<00:06:24.150> the<00:06:24.360> growth<00:06:24.389> of

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:24.659 
in the water inhibits the growth of

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:26.809 
in the water inhibits the growth of
algae<00:06:25.050> it<00:06:25.589> just<00:06:25.800> keeps<00:06:25.979> it<00:06:26.099> from<00:06:26.279> growing<00:06:26.520> by

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 
algae it just keeps it from growing by

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:29.809 
algae it just keeps it from growing by
not<00:06:27.000> letting<00:06:27.360> it<00:06:27.449> feed<00:06:27.770> so<00:06:28.770> algaecide<00:06:29.460> will

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 
not letting it feed so algaecide will

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:33.170 
not letting it feed so algaecide will
keep<00:06:30.060> your<00:06:30.270> water<00:06:30.479> clear<00:06:31.490> simply<00:06:32.490> by<00:06:32.669> being<00:06:33.029> in

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
keep your water clear simply by being in

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.439 
keep your water clear simply by being in
the<00:06:33.270> water<00:06:33.479> so<00:06:34.379> let's<00:06:34.589> say<00:06:34.830> you<00:06:35.339> have<00:06:35.610> sunday

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
in the water your pool won't grow algae

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.650 
in the water your pool won't grow algae
it<00:06:44.010> will<00:06:44.580> stay<00:06:44.880> clear
