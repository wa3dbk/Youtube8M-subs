00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 a ticket tied to the legs for 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.520
 send messages of war or love 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.040
 many centuries ago 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.780
 today the pigeons as 5000 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.179
 years ago they are bred by humans and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.920
 they are cute pets in 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.839
 these days to freeze is possible 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.850
 spotting several are directed with 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.640
 all likely to mortar towards theirs 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.710
 nest ask for help for water and food 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.810
 not being able to procure either 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.599
 alone not being wild they are 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.980
 pets raised by humans 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.740
 they have two plates because one 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.160
 identifies the animal's date of birth 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.350
 with a code and milk identifies the race 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.540
 than a pink sail normally 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.420
 colored where they are directed from where 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.190
 arrive and are directed we say towards 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.530
 mortar because we are there, there are many 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.140
 breeders who have the passion of 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.660
 select and pigeon species 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.809
 increasingly efficient traveler and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.210
 the animal is important because it breeds 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.460
 traveling pigeon for 5000 years therefore 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.260
 it is one of the most known animals and it is 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.320
 was selected for his own 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.810
 ability to orient the judge as 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.240
 a citizen must behave if he should 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 run into a carrier pigeon 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.200
 what does it do because they appear extremely 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.830
 tired exhausted freezes is an area of 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.439
 passage for which we say it happens that yes 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.060
 they stop in the houses they approach the 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.729
 people precisely because they identify the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.670
 people people a lot if there is a person 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.009
 let's say they're used to during 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.900
 the training phase is to be said also 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.890
 that there may be a question of 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.850
 disorder that disturbs their field 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.280
 magnetic somehow a leader 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.439
 latest in recent studies in america yes 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.960
 It is discovered that the carrier pigeon 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.880
 they orient themselves with low sounds 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.880
 frequency below 20 20 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.350
 hertz the man does not perceive these sounds 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.020
 and the capacity of these sounds is that 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.920
 they can also move for mikati km 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.479
 through these infrasounds they succeed in 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.659
 find home 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.280
 an industry and for example puts a lot on 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.800
 soil inflation could create 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.200
 problems such as storms or a good one 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.980
 or such things and therefore how 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.930
 you have to behave anyway 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.840
 help them dream only in the sense of yes 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.690
 gave food that I am not able to 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.519
 alone to get it right and even 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.200
 because I am not able but also for a 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.230
 reason a mac and carrier pigeons 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.170
 they go and come back normally they train 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.480
 in one place then during the hatching yes 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.190
 takes one of the individuals and moves to 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.599
 distance and let you free 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.799
 rightfully his thoughts to return 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.450
 the nest then just an outward in 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.450
 past in ancient Rome there were the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.730
 couriers, that is, there were positions of 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.519
 training which were exchanging 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.810
 so animals could communicate either 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.810
 on the way back
