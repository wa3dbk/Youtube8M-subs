00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
as an Imagineer for a project like this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.570 
as an Imagineer for a project like this
before<00:01:19.290> any<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> our<00:01:19.710> projects<00:01:20.130> there's<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.400> lot

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
before any of our projects there's a lot

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.219 
before any of our projects there's a lot
of<00:01:20.700> challenges<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.390> face<00:01:21.600> from<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.960> design

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
of challenges that we face from a design

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.380 
of challenges that we face from a design
perspective<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:23.369> those<00:01:23.700> challenges<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.240> be

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
perspective but those challenges can be

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630 
perspective but those challenges can be
difficult<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.560> exciting<00:01:26.100> all<00:01:26.220> at<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.460> same

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
difficult and exciting all at the same

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.730 
difficult and exciting all at the same
time<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.570> case<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> Aqua<00:01:28.470> Duncan

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
time so in this case for the Aqua Duncan

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.530 
time so in this case for the Aqua Duncan
waterslide<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.700> had<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> figure<00:01:30.060> out<00:01:30.270> how<00:01:30.479> to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
waterslide we had to figure out how to

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.300 
waterslide we had to figure out how to
get<00:01:30.900> our<00:01:31.079> guests<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> very<00:01:31.829> top<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
get our guests to the very top of the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130 
get our guests to the very top of the
funnel<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.000> these<00:01:33.180> are<00:01:33.299> spaces<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.840> nobody

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
funnel and these are spaces that nobody

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.480 
funnel and these are spaces that nobody
goes<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> except<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:34.979> maintenance<00:01:35.280> purposes

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
goes to except for maintenance purposes

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.370 
goes to except for maintenance purposes
there's<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> stairway<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.259> there's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
there's not a stairway there and there's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.539 
there's not a stairway there and there's
just<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.619> ladder<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.220> there<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.460> we

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
just a ladder to get there so we

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.950 
just a ladder to get there so we
literally<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.150> create<00:01:39.360> stairs<00:01:39.659> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
literally have to create stairs and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
literally have to create stairs and
design<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> infrastructure<00:01:41.280> around<00:01:41.490> getting

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
design the infrastructure around getting

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.760 
design the infrastructure around getting
up<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.390> space<00:01:42.630> plus<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.380> design

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
up to that space plus we have to design

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
up to that space plus we have to design
the<00:01:44.340> ability<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.820> move<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.240> water<00:01:45.450> throughout

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the ability to move the water throughout

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.999 
the ability to move the water throughout
the<00:01:45.810> ship<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.259> there's<00:01:46.439> pipes<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the ship so there's pipes and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.590 
the ship so there's pipes and
electronics<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:47.880> these<00:01:48.030> things<00:01:48.240> don't<00:01:48.509> exist

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
electronics all these things don't exist

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.980 
electronics all these things don't exist
right<00:01:48.990> now<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.040> five<00:01:50.220> weeks<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.750> let<00:01:51.899> me

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
right now all in five weeks so let me

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.050 
right now all in five weeks so let me
describe<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.619> process<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.340> riding<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:53.939> the

describe the process of riding on the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.550 
describe the process of riding on the
