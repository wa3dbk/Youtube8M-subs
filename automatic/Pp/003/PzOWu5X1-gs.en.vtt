00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.640
 then when he finally stopped in front early 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.680
 the aahs and oohs are in limits 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.599
 It is the proven success formula 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.179
 also know the seventh golf generation 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.820
 some would even say excellent 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.460
 never be a win the one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.960
 new is unmistakably a gulf even so 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.670
 very much that it should be difficult for many 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.279
 the seventh straight away on the street 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.000
 but we recognize as new 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.769
 collected 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.869
 that's how it has been since the third generation 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.359
 and that never hurt the golf 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.460
 we prefer to come to the clearer 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.090
 Updates the golf is and maybe 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.920
 of course grown exactly 56 cm 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.450
 longer is he the place for 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.700
 Luggage and passengers on the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.940
 Rear seat are the 15 cm in the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.930
 trunk 30 liters more 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:52.280
 I say this very deliberately 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.879
 we made it again 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.609
 This car is the best and best 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.510
 biggest golf of all time we ever 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.400
 have built and this car is ours 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.210
 pride and joy 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.170
 for anne 520,000 colleagues 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.979
 worldwide 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.540
 and there for me personally 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.710
 pleasingly the new way around 100 kilo 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.560
 less than the old one 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.430
 along with other consumption 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.500
 optimization measures like finally one 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.210
 standard start stop system lowers 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.619
 the average consumption by up to 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.140
 to 23 percent 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.900
 the best here is the golf bluemotion the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.710
 with 3.2 liters of diesel per 100 kilometers 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.520
 to get along 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.189
 nice that the entry price with 16,000 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.409
 975 euro remains unchanged in vw lesart 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.240
 is that even a price reduction because of 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.030
 new rather offers for the money than the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.130
 predecessor 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.950
 important innovation for vw is the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.780
 Introduction of the modular crossbeam 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.020
 which makes the production more flexible and so on 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.670
 savings of up to 30 of the music 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.500
 forecast that the gulf will also be in the future 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.479
 the best selling car in germany 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.710
 it will not be too daring to stay 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.020
 vw remains true to itself 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.810
 proven continuity no wild 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.220
 experiments every vw veterans and well 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.170
 also most other car drivers 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.720
 will find application first deal in 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.899
 golf and that's kind of good too 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.899
 so
