but well first on the left here we've
got<00:00:13.830> some<00:00:14.009> floating<00:00:14.400> herbs<00:00:14.790> cool<00:00:15.690> i<00:00:15.900> cut<00:00:16.230> those

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
got some floating herbs cool i cut those

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.000 
got some floating herbs cool i cut those
out<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.800> polystyrene<00:00:17.430> foam<00:00:17.699> myself<00:00:18.560> ah<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
out of polystyrene foam myself ah the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.400 
out of polystyrene foam myself ah the
other<00:00:20.130> big<00:00:20.430> change<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.570> water<00:00:21.960> jetting

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
other big change is the water jetting

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.130 
other big change is the water jetting
back<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.949> now<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.939> actually<00:00:24.420> did<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:24.869> once

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
back in now I actually did this once

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.259 
back in now I actually did this once
already<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.859> had<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.099> redo<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.730> holes

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
already and I had to redo it the holes

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.750 
already and I had to redo it the holes
are<00:00:27.449> too<00:00:27.660> big<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.050> too<00:00:28.830> many<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.250> them<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.670> it

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
are too big and too many of them so it

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.569 
are too big and too many of them so it
really<00:00:30.090> wasn't<00:00:30.359> causing<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.219> aeration<00:00:32.219> that

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
really wasn't causing the aeration that

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.450 
really wasn't causing the aeration that
I<00:00:32.640> wanted<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.090> achieve<00:00:34.070> but<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.340> see

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

a seat of water zooming in there now
look<00:01:06.000> at<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> amount<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.479> aeration<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.170> I

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
look at the amount of aeration that I

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.560 
look at the amount of aeration that I
mean<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.130> beautiful<00:01:08.939> and

the<00:01:13.470> last<00:01:13.799> memory<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.280> think<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.689> 160

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the last memory I think it's 160

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.440 
the last memory I think it's 160
seedlings<00:01:16.409> will<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.369> able<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> carry<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.270> this

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
seedlings will be able to carry in this

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.649 
seedlings will be able to carry in this
whole<00:01:18.720> area<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.759> for<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> size<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> area

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
whole area so for the size of the area

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.749 
whole area so for the size of the area
and<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.439> produce<00:01:22.890> we're<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.640> know

units coming out now i'll get the holes

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.359 
units coming out now i'll get the holes
in<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.970> later<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.530> i'll<00:01:31.650> probably<00:01:31.950> wait

a little while before i use that one so
that<00:01:35.430> I've<00:01:35.549> got<00:01:35.820> some<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.140> green<00:01:37.470> stop

does back up down in the draining system
and<00:02:20.970> that'll<00:02:21.450> actually<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:22.590> know<00:02:22.710> be<00:02:22.830> an

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
overflow type scenario um so you can see

sure that's it don't feel ends but it's

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
there and it's flowing down here in

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
back into the pond is perfect it's

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.360 
back into the pond is perfect it's
maintaining<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.290> height<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.100> I've<00:02:59.250> been

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
maintaining that height and I've been

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.920 
maintaining that height and I've been
running<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.850> this<00:03:00.480> first<00:03:00.780> 24<00:03:01.739> 7<00:03:02.070> basically

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
running the this first 24 7 basically

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.320 
running the this first 24 7 basically
for<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.959> week<00:03:04.350> or<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:04.709> now<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:06.090> I've<00:03:06.180> got<00:03:06.300> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
for a week or so now so I've got the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.770 
for a week or so now so I've got the
flow<00:03:06.630> sorted<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.970> decided<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.150> run<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.660> know

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
flow sorted I decided to run it you know

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.280 
flow sorted I decided to run it you know
all<00:03:10.140> day<00:03:10.380> every<00:03:10.890> day<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.610> test<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:13.170> I'll

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
all day every day to test that and I'll

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.830 
all day every day to test that and I'll
be<00:03:13.410> putting<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.830> timer<00:03:14.160> back<00:03:14.459> in<00:03:14.720> we're<00:03:15.720> not

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
be putting the timer back in we're not

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.360 
be putting the timer back in we're not
going<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.050> have<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.290> as<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.410> continual<00:03:17.100> flow

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
going to have it as a continual flow

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.640 
going to have it as a continual flow
system<00:03:17.940> we<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.660> don't<00:03:18.900> need<00:03:19.200> to

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
system we we don't need to

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.280 
system we we don't need to
certainly<00:03:21.610> once<00:03:21.819> we<00:03:22.000> get<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.360> grow<00:03:22.989> beds

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
certainly once we get the grow beds

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.869 
certainly once we get the grow beds
sorted<00:03:23.799> which<00:03:23.980> we're<00:03:24.250> probably<00:03:24.519> going<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:24.819> be

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
sorted which we're probably going to be

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.449 
sorted which we're probably going to be
running<00:03:25.090> down<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.510> side<00:03:25.750> there<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:27.340> know

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
running down the side there you know

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.490 
running down the side there you know
will<00:03:27.640> operate<00:03:28.120> on<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.420> ebb<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.569> flow<00:03:28.780> system

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
will operate on the ebb and flow system

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.470 
will operate on the ebb and flow system
so<00:03:29.829> you<00:03:30.040> know<00:03:30.159> we<00:03:30.430> run<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.760> for<00:03:30.879> 15<00:03:31.269> minutes

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
so you know we run it for 15 minutes

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.920 
so you know we run it for 15 minutes
fill<00:03:31.840> up<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.220> grow<00:03:33.220> beds<00:03:33.629> and<00:03:34.629> then<00:03:34.840> the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
fill up the grow beds and then the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.899 
fill up the grow beds and then the
system<00:03:35.230> will<00:03:35.290> shut<00:03:35.379> off<00:03:35.680> for<00:03:35.860> 45<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.730> grow

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
system will shut off for 45 so the grow

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:40.380 
system will shut off for 45 so the grow
beds<00:03:37.180> drain<00:03:37.840> back<00:03:38.049> into<00:03:38.349> the<00:03:38.579> pond<00:03:39.579> and<00:03:39.849> do<00:03:40.269> the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
beds drain back into the pond and do the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.940 
beds drain back into the pond and do the
filter<00:03:40.689> bit<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.799> should<00:03:42.220> be<00:03:42.459> ok<00:03:43.000> here<00:03:43.950> if

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
filter bit and that should be ok here if

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.069 
filter bit and that should be ok here if
I<00:03:45.250> didn't<00:03:45.640> have<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:46.000> aeration<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.930> I've

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
I didn't have the aeration that I've

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.410 
I didn't have the aeration that I've
managed<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:47.890> achieve<00:03:48.069> in<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.489> water<00:03:48.700> then<00:03:49.239> I'd

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
managed to achieve in the water then I'd

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.479 
managed to achieve in the water then I'd
probably<00:03:49.720> be<00:03:50.170> worried<00:03:50.500> but<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.890> think<00:03:51.340> we're

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
probably be worried but I think we're

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.879 
probably be worried but I think we're
pretty<00:03:51.519> safe<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.239> well<00:03:52.690> hey<00:03:52.989> we<00:03:53.590> can<00:03:53.739> only

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
pretty safe and well hey we can only

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.000 
pretty safe and well hey we can only
test<00:03:54.780> okay<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:55.840> that's<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.319> update<00:03:56.680> for<00:03:56.889> now

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
test okay so that's the update for now

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.910 
test okay so that's the update for now
but<00:03:57.370> on<00:03:57.879> the<00:03:58.000> next<00:03:58.120> video<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:59.200> should<00:03:59.590> see

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
but on the next video you should see

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.259 
but on the next video you should see
well<00:04:00.190> I'll<00:04:00.310> try<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.579> get<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.760> on<00:04:00.849> video<00:04:01.120> the

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
well I'll try and get it on video the

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.940 
well I'll try and get it on video the
fish<00:04:01.420> actually<00:04:01.629> going<00:04:02.109> in<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.739> little

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
fish actually going in the little

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.099 
fish actually going in the little
fingerling<00:04:03.239> apparently<00:04:04.239> they're<00:04:04.450> four<00:04:04.989> to

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
fingerling apparently they're four to

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.559 
fingerling apparently they're four to
five<00:04:05.290> inches<00:04:05.639> we're<00:04:06.639> going<00:04:06.819> with<00:04:07.000> trout<00:04:07.299> as

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
five inches we're going with trout as

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.929 
five inches we're going with trout as
the<00:04:07.840> temperature<00:04:08.500> of<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.620> water<00:04:08.650> 13<00:04:09.519> 14

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
the temperature of the water 13 14

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.830 
the temperature of the water 13 14
degrees<00:04:10.420> too<00:04:10.989> damn<00:04:11.230> cold<00:04:11.939> our<00:04:12.939> ideal<00:04:13.299> fish<00:04:13.629> is

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
degrees too damn cold our ideal fish is

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.469 
degrees too damn cold our ideal fish is
the<00:04:14.079> silver<00:04:14.500> perch<00:04:14.799> of<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.069> barramundi<00:04:15.479> but

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
the silver perch of the barramundi but

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.319 
the silver perch of the barramundi but
that<00:04:17.380> it's<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.769> bit<00:04:17.919> cold<00:04:18.130> for<00:04:18.459> them<00:04:18.759> so<00:04:19.120> we'll

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
that it's a bit cold for them so we'll

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.719 
that it's a bit cold for them so we'll
have<00:04:19.449> to<00:04:19.570> wait<00:04:19.720> until<00:04:19.780> November<00:04:20.620> we<00:04:21.250> should

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
have to wait until November we should

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.879 
have to wait until November we should
apparently<00:04:22.120> be<00:04:22.360> able<00:04:23.169> to<00:04:23.259> have<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.590> trout

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
apparently be able to have the trout

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.810 
apparently be able to have the trout
plate<00:04:24.370> size<00:04:24.669> by<00:04:25.150> November<00:04:25.930> December<00:04:26.340> so<00:04:27.340> we'll

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
plate size by November December so we'll

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.420 
plate size by November December so we'll
certainly<00:04:28.030> do<00:04:28.270> our<00:04:28.330> best<00:04:28.889> having<00:04:29.889> never<00:04:30.070> eaten

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
certainly do our best having never eaten

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.120 
certainly do our best having never eaten
trout<00:04:30.699> and<00:04:30.910> it<00:04:31.000> could<00:04:31.270> be<00:04:31.300> interesting<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:32.410> see

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
trout and it could be interesting so see

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.419 
trout and it could be interesting so see
you<00:04:33.220> on<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.400> next<00:04:33.430> video<00:04:33.699> with<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.180> trout
