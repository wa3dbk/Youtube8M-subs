00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.650
 hello everyone my name is sam and it's 34 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.550
 online tank display 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.950
 and today I have March 8, but to express 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.989
 all see later yes and I also saw 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.150
 lay out not 8 9 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:29.259
 but be that as it may, but I want 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.870
 congratulate all the girls on the holiday 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:37.280
 good luck to you happiness and good here so 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:41.929
 so but now let's move on to the game I 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:46.250
 I think everyone knows what nifiga yourself what 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:48.410
 it's such a sudden parkour that now 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.170
 as if just the same and we have discounts 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.660
 in honor of March 8 on the Mpk and their acceleration 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.660
 Well, respectively, since I have them for a long time 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.359
 I waited very much I could not miss them in 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.230
 overall i'm very good micro pumped i 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.770
 spent all my money here's the savings 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.159
 so to speak if you are interested then 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.899
 go and see here on the bottom left in 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.750
 there is a small window 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.790
 look but there is not entirely want 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.560
 I will leave the whole summary and link 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.479
 in the description here and now let's say to 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.570
 I will spend there more than one hundred thousand 114 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.450
 well, another one thousand then spent 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.460
 On the video, well, in general, somewhere around 115 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.060
 It turns out like this so pumped 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.079
 pretty good but considering ox1 in 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.649
 Africa is cool as I make sense and quickly 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.920
 knocks the plot at all given the fact 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.329
 now everyone except light cases 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.640
 increased 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.219
 then it will be as if unnoticeable 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.909
 let's say I left again you can say 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:58.280
 that's probably even less 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.609
 equally well because besides 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.520
 hp 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:07.609
 oh damage I also pumped 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.130
 her speed and I finally hepe 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:13.810
 I have long wanted to pump Kharkov and 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.130
 used a maximum and here it all pumped 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.080
 wonderful and i don't understand a little fool 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.510
 the clowns are on me 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:28.459
 I managed to kill the Daura I managed to kill him 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.170
 beauty and where is he and here he is with someone too 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.290
 fights 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.330
 moron so okay we are very here 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.310
 we lose a lot and when I came in we 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.920
 also loses much i went here 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.140
 literally a couple of minutes ago and the battle 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.980
 short why did I even come here then 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.660
 there is well, so not the most interesting battle but 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.819
 I came here because it is very 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.980
 interesting map that is the battle may well 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.180
 Awesome map, especially since 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.660
 create and rarely 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.390
 I like her here can be cool 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.519
 fly jump and so forth true 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.350
 here by volatile and do not write down because 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.370
 that run here really no place here 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.709
 how would rather fly alone they 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.390
 never those someone runs though whom 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.150
 as a whole, you can even get it right here 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.640
 yes and here from here to run but then a 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.310
 if I haven’t run me, I’ll have it 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.590
 for the card and I try so that I later 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.450
 landed after scorching ear i mean but u 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.549
 I have a few rules there 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:31.420
 that is, the flights I leave only those in 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.010
 which I then landed on my feet and 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.840
 generally as if landed where where at all 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.299
 I didn't land either 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.209
 leave so on well there are some more 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.280
 all the rules well, and then just tell 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.109
 suddenly you thought that I always 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.540
 land on my feet no i'm not so 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.060
 forts and unfortunately just i leave 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.780
 only some double here such here 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.880
 successful call them what you like so that's 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.519
 fat man you che it for he was nifiga 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.370
 long spins up of course and he died 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.560
 He, respectively, although here I am at first 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.250
 I did not like the volcano 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.380
 how to play how to say in general I 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.989
 you would not play with him now and 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.790
 very much though I changed my point of view 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.280
 now I think it's normal 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.539
 a gun but I myself sat with him to play would not 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.240
 became here because i like to play 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:26.690
 in melee and so on fast 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.080
 enclosures but rather for heavy ones like that 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.530
 here is 0 to average even so here 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.569
 on a viking with him it will be fine even on 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.009
 hunter seems to me not very much to the Vikings 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:41.870
 still ok on dictator nothing too 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:44.509
 so he is up to my style of play 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.039
 fits but generally i changed my mind i 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.020
 I realized that this is pretty good 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.569
 gun because today I played on 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.000
 stadium and against us was such a here 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:54.919
 and the machine gun is only true m 3 but for this I 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.080
 I do not know why he will understand what but mom 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.569
 then I see him can barely have him and 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.940
 machine gun 2 and there was right m3 m3 then 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:07.909
 there are mammoth and the gun, and then he 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.240
 handed out just hellish damage no but he 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:14.509
 of course still poured grandfathers but damn it 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.360
 just terrible at all therefore but I kind of 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:20.289
 I realized that at long distances about gold 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.529
 cool at long distances 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:26.659
 he is really very very effective so 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:30.469
 thank you for not hitting me very much 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:33.259
 nice generally handsome so where where where 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:36.259
 where for some reason everyone goes to one point 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:43.719
 here it is gold here it is here 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:45.129
 will fall and you do something to create 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.900
 asshole 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.669
 Yes, I see no gold, okay, nothing 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.940
 scary anything happens especially here 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:57.379
 Such monsters were alone dictators and finally 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.360
 well, all smart people decided not to go 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:02.300
 just so from afar on hrenach and all and 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.330
 all because it would be hard here 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.960
 a goal to take really so therefore 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.110
 could i too 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.660
 not to go there but a little chance 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.539
 okay the dictator is familiar to anyone else 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:19.069
 could have been on mammoth itself 1 arrived 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.069
 well, so no 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.580
 real fast as if not talking about 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.680
 its conditions here what am I here in 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:30.060
 room at night where it is still not cold 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:33.270
 I know why, okay then it's decided now 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.220
 play out soon the battle will end and myself 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:39.150
 will be good a good card is straight 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.710
 cool pity that the cell create 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.990
 I do not understand these players 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.880
 who constantly create silence and so 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.009
 further write she snitched at us i say 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.509
 I like it very much especially 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:53.550
 eSports and everything is fine 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:58.110
 but here it really is this silence 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:00.330
 See this all need and Serpukhov wife FIG I 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.190
 it would be better to play here and on 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.250
 some very like that 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:10.440
 Rare maps here than on everyones again 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:13.139
 verse silence quieter quieter fuck i don't 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.150
 specifically the case pressed but it happens in this 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:18.090
 and hands removed then put and put not 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.909
 there is a bad person okay, nothing 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:23.280
 scary in general still letting 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:26.090
 thank you all for watching everyone good luck and 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.090
 bye everyone
