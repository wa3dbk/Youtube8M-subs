00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
cut in the abdomen to make a look kind

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:10.740

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.540 
revoltech joints in his knee you could
proceed<00:04:25.330> at<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.539> back<00:04:25.750> there's<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.889> one<00:04:27.130> and

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
proceed at the back there's the one and

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.600 
proceed at the back there's the one and
the<00:04:27.580> second<00:04:28.030> one<00:04:29.010> that<00:04:30.010> his<00:04:30.190> ankle<00:04:30.520> has

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
the second one that his ankle has

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.320 
the second one that his ankle has
revoltech<00:04:31.120> joint<00:04:31.530> so<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:33.520> hips<00:04:33.760> are<00:04:33.970> probably

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
revoltech joint so the hips are probably

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.070 
revoltech joint so the hips are probably
the<00:04:34.510> only<00:04:35.370> normal<00:04:36.370> joint<00:04:36.789> I<00:04:37.000> guess<00:04:37.300> that<00:04:37.870> there

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
the only normal joint I guess that there

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.210 
the only normal joint I guess that there
is<00:04:39.449> but<00:04:40.449> still<00:04:40.930> definitely<00:04:41.320> looks<00:04:41.740> like<00:04:41.830> he'll

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
is but still definitely looks like he'll

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.000 
is but still definitely looks like he'll
be<00:04:42.400> very<00:04:42.639> flexible<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.570> poseable<00:04:44.050> even<00:04:44.860> as

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
be very flexible and poseable even as

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.390 
be very flexible and poseable even as
the<00:04:45.639> voltaic<00:04:45.970> joints<00:04:46.389> in<00:04:46.539> his<00:04:46.570> wrists<00:04:47.560> which<00:04:48.280> i

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
the voltaic joints in his wrists which i

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.240 
the voltaic joints in his wrists which i
think<00:04:48.460> i<00:04:48.639> forgot<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:48.940> mention<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:50.010> as<00:04:51.010> far<00:04:51.190> as

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
think i forgot to mention and as far as

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.350 
think i forgot to mention and as far as
height<00:04:51.460> goes<00:04:53.099> get<00:04:54.099> you<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.280> Bracken<00:04:54.849> to<00:04:55.090> show

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
height goes get you a Bracken to show

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.170 
height goes get you a Bracken to show
you

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.720 

about<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.480> head<00:05:00.170> taller<00:05:00.410> than<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:01.250> bracket<00:05:01.610> if

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
about a head taller than the bracket if

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.090 
about a head taller than the bracket if
you<00:05:01.820> don't<00:05:01.970> count<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.270> antenna<00:05:02.740> so<00:05:03.740> maybe

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
you don't count the antenna so maybe

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.000 
you don't count the antenna so maybe
finally<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:04.970> found<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.450> figure<00:05:05.780> to<00:05:06.620> hang<00:05:06.830> with

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
finally I found a figure to hang with

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.260 
finally I found a figure to hang with
every<00:05:07.430> unit<00:05:07.700> one<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:10.490> can<00:05:10.640> see<00:05:10.670> every<00:05:11.030> unit

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
every unit one you can see every unit

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.560 
every unit one you can see every unit
one<00:05:11.420> is<00:05:11.570> not<00:05:11.830> really<00:05:12.830> in<00:05:12.920> a<00:05:13.010> standing<00:05:13.370> position

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
one is not really in a standing position

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.280 
one is not really in a standing position
we<00:05:14.570> kind<00:05:14.810> of<00:05:14.870> go<00:05:15.490> very<00:05:16.490> inaccurately<00:05:17.240> he<00:05:18.020> looks

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
we kind of go very inaccurately he looks

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.500 
we kind of go very inaccurately he looks
about<00:05:18.470> as<00:05:18.530> tall<00:05:18.830> as<00:05:19.040> a<00:05:19.130> bee<00:05:19.190> unit<00:05:19.520> one<00:05:19.670> if<00:05:20.450> you

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
about as tall as a bee unit one if you

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.930 
about as tall as a bee unit one if you
want<00:05:20.540> to<00:05:20.720> have<00:05:20.810> these<00:05:20.960> two<00:05:21.610> definitely<00:05:22.610> going

can't shoot oh I'll stand them up to the

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.220 
can't shoot oh I'll stand them up to the
side<00:05:31.000> as<00:05:32.000> we<00:05:32.180> go<00:05:32.300> over<00:05:32.600> what<00:05:32.750> else<00:05:32.900> he<00:05:33.020> comes

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230

side as we go over what else he comes
with<00:05:34.780> small<00:05:35.780> things<00:05:35.810> first<00:05:37.480> this<00:05:38.480> looks<00:05:38.750> like

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
with small things first this looks like

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.560 
with small things first this looks like
a<00:05:40.210> if<00:05:41.210> you<00:05:41.330> wanted<00:05:41.540> to<00:05:41.600> pull<00:05:41.810> out<00:05:41.990> his<00:05:43.570> that's

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
a if you wanted to pull out his that's

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.750 
a if you wanted to pull out his that's
what<00:05:44.780> this<00:05:44.900> looks<00:05:45.200> like<00:05:45.290> anyway<00:05:45.740> looks<00:05:46.700> like

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
what this looks like anyway looks like

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.010 
what this looks like anyway looks like
if<00:05:46.940> you<00:05:47.030> want<00:05:47.360> to<00:05:47.480> pull<00:05:47.600> out<00:05:47.720> one<00:05:47.870> of<00:05:47.900> the

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
if you want to pull out one of the

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.620 
if you want to pull out one of the
shoulder<00:05:48.350> pads<00:05:48.560> and<00:05:48.800> put<00:05:48.980> this<00:05:49.360> it's<00:05:50.360> kind<00:05:50.600> of

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
shoulder pads and put this it's kind of

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.510 
shoulder pads and put this it's kind of
just<00:05:50.780> like<00:05:50.900> a<00:05:50.990> cloth<00:05:51.350> piece<00:05:51.680> I<00:05:51.980> mean<00:05:52.400> obviously

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
just like a cloth piece I mean obviously

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.060 
just like a cloth piece I mean obviously
it's<00:05:52.880> plastic<00:05:53.300> but<00:05:53.510> you<00:05:53.630> know<00:05:53.750> it<00:05:54.530> would<00:05:54.650> be<00:05:54.860> a

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
it's plastic but you know it would be a

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.420 
it's plastic but you know it would be a
cloth<00:05:55.580> piece<00:05:55.850> for<00:05:56.120> his<00:05:56.240> jacket<00:05:56.750> I<00:05:57.430> think

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
cloth piece for his jacket I think

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.190 
cloth piece for his jacket I think
because<00:05:58.730> I<00:05:58.880> don't<00:05:59.510> believe<00:05:59.540> he<00:05:59.750> has<00:05:59.840> both

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
because I don't believe he has both

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.420 
because I don't believe he has both
shoulder<00:06:00.590> pads<00:06:00.800> all<00:06:00.980> the<00:06:01.100> way<00:06:01.190> through<00:06:01.400> the

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
shoulder pads all the way through the

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.520 
shoulder pads all the way through the
show<00:06:01.670> I<00:06:01.940> think<00:06:02.630> he<00:06:02.900> gets<00:06:03.050> some<00:06:03.260> you<00:06:03.500> know

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
show I think he gets some you know

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.730 
show I think he gets some you know
battle<00:06:03.980> damage<00:06:05.200> and<00:06:06.200> then<00:06:08.230> we<00:06:09.230> have<00:06:09.440> a

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
battle damage and then we have a

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.840 
battle damage and then we have a
different<00:06:10.670> forearm<00:06:11.150> piece<00:06:12.340> so<00:06:13.340> you<00:06:13.370> could<00:06:13.610> put

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
different forearm piece so you could put

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.710 
different forearm piece so you could put
where<00:06:14.840> is<00:06:14.930> this<00:06:16.150> this<00:06:17.150> might<00:06:17.330> even<00:06:17.510> be<00:06:17.630> an

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
where is this this might even be an

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.500 
where is this this might even be an
upper<00:06:18.020> arm<00:06:18.230> piece<00:06:19.030> so<00:06:20.030> you<00:06:20.090> could<00:06:20.240> swap<00:06:20.450> that

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
upper arm piece so you could swap that

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.020 
upper arm piece so you could swap that
out<00:06:20.750> and<00:06:21.110> he<00:06:21.170> would<00:06:21.320> have<00:06:21.500> a<00:06:21.880> little<00:06:22.880> more

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
out and he would have a little more

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.590 
out and he would have a little more
armor<00:06:23.390> there<00:06:24.400> it<00:06:25.400> looks<00:06:25.700> like<00:06:25.760> upper<00:06:26.390> arm

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
armor there it looks like upper arm

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.270 
armor there it looks like upper arm
piece<00:06:27.850> anyway<00:06:28.850> you<00:06:28.910> could<00:06:29.090> do<00:06:29.210> that<00:06:29.240> to<00:06:30.280> set

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
piece anyway you could do that to set

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.980 
piece anyway you could do that to set
them<00:06:31.370> off<00:06:31.460> on<00:06:31.610> the<00:06:31.640> side

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
them off on the side

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.940 
them off on the side
we<00:06:33.710> have<00:06:33.860> a<00:06:34.210> screaming<00:06:35.210> head<00:06:35.500> who<00:06:36.500> if<00:06:36.650> you<00:06:36.740> have

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950 
we have a screaming head who if you have

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.250 
we have a screaming head who if you have
him<00:06:37.160> attacking<00:06:37.610> somebody<00:06:38.090> I<00:06:38.330> thought<00:06:39.110> thought

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
him attacking somebody I thought thought
