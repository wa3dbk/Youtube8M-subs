00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
learn well and you need to practice

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.650 
learn well and you need to practice
often<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.950> wish<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.370> use<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> tomahawk<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.510> a

often if you wish to use a tomahawk in a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.560 
often if you wish to use a tomahawk in a
defensive<00:00:37.350> role<00:00:37.739> now<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.390> I'm

defensive role now as you can see I'm

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.350 
defensive role now as you can see I'm
using<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.050> wooden<00:00:40.350> analog<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.239> I

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
using a wooden analog this is one that I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.830 
using a wooden analog this is one that I
made<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> while<00:00:42.930> back<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:44.600> generally<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> would

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840

myself with the tomahawk so I'm going to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.560 
myself with the tomahawk so I'm going to
use<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.579> wooden<00:00:59.820> one<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.390> this

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
use the wooden one for this

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.310 
use the wooden one for this

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the thrust and the rake now let's break

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.459 
the thrust and the rake now let's break
each<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.280> these<00:01:17.400> down<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:18.150> turn

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.590 

the<00:01:23.469> first<00:01:23.829> hit<00:01:24.189> is<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.520> chop

the first hit is the chop

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.139 
the first hit is the chop
now<00:01:26.109> the<00:01:26.170> chop<00:01:26.590> should<00:01:26.890> be<00:01:27.039> delivered<00:01:27.579> with<00:01:28.119> a

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
because you want to grip to be solid

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.749 
because you want to grip to be solid
plus<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:38.079> want<00:01:38.409> to<00:01:38.649> position<00:01:38.950> your<00:01:39.250> hand<00:01:39.579> in

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
such a way so that you're getting the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.630 
such a way so that you're getting the
most<00:01:42.250> leverage<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:43.270> deliver<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.929> most<00:01:44.200> power

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
most leverage to deliver the most power

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.260 
most leverage to deliver the most power
into<00:01:45.640> your<00:01:45.939> opponent's<00:01:46.810> body<00:01:47.520> now<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.579> chop

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
into your opponent's body now the chop

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.410 
into your opponent's body now the chop
should<00:01:49.569> be<00:01:49.719> reserved<00:01:50.229> for<00:01:50.380> lethal<00:01:50.890> blows<00:01:51.459> the

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
should be reserved for lethal blows the

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.630 
should be reserved for lethal blows the
reason<00:01:52.780> for<00:01:52.990> this<00:01:53.109> is<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.619> should<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.009> miss

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
reason for this is is should you miss

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.839 
reason for this is is should you miss
your<00:01:55.090> chop<00:01:55.450> it's<00:01:56.140> very<00:01:56.530> difficult<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.489> recover

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:57.849 
your chop it's very difficult to recover

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.529 
your chop it's very difficult to recover
because<00:01:58.270> all<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.959> weight<00:01:59.140> is<00:01:59.409> in<00:01:59.709> the<00:01:59.739> head<00:02:00.539> so

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
because all the weight is in the head so

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.760 
because all the weight is in the head so
make<00:02:02.530> sure<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:03.219> you<00:02:03.840> soften<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.229> target

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
make sure that you soften the target

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.819 
make sure that you soften the target
before<00:02:06.219> you<00:02:06.369> deliver<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:07.030> chopping<00:02:08.019> blow<00:02:08.349> or

else you could miss and you could regret

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.750 
else you could miss and you could regret
it

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.259 

the<00:02:15.760> second<00:02:16.239> strike<00:02:16.599> is<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:17.230> cut<00:02:17.680> now<00:02:18.670> what<00:02:19.120> you

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
the second strike is a cut now what you

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
for the extended grip is with your thumb

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.970 
for the extended grip is with your thumb
out<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:32.260> tend<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.950> have<00:02:33.370> more<00:02:34.260> precision<00:02:35.260> with

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
out you tend to have more precision with

the fourth kind of hit is the one that
is<00:04:18.980> probably<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.760> most<00:04:20.019> unfamiliar<00:04:21.019> to<00:04:21.620> the

majority of tomahawk users and that is

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
majority of tomahawk users and that is
the<00:04:25.400> rake

the rake

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.480 
the rake
now<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.510> rake<00:04:26.840> is<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.200> exact<00:04:27.590> opposite<00:04:28.220> of<00:04:28.370> a

push it through your opponent in order

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.090 
push it through your opponent in order
to<00:04:35.600> create<00:04:36.140> a<00:04:36.500> shallow<00:04:37.300> fine<00:04:38.300> wound<00:04:38.990> with<00:04:39.920> the

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.110 
shallow wound now this type of wound
creates<00:04:53.660> a<00:04:54.110> lot<00:04:54.650> of<00:04:54.680> great<00:04:55.070> deal<00:04:55.250> of<00:04:55.370> pain<00:04:55.790> and

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
them and to back away so that I can then

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.159 
them and to back away so that I can then
come<00:05:44.750> down<00:05:45.430> get<00:05:46.430> a<00:05:46.460> better<00:05:46.880> grip<00:05:47.300> by<00:05:47.720> bouncing

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.969 

so<00:05:57.440> these<00:05:57.620> are<00:05:57.830> the<00:05:58.009> four<00:05:58.370> basic<00:05:58.669> types<00:05:59.330> of

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
so these are the four basic types of

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.670 
so these are the four basic types of
attacks<00:06:00.979> one<00:06:01.460> can<00:06:01.759> do<00:06:02.000> with<00:06:02.300> the<00:06:02.449> tomahawk<00:06:03.050> to

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
attacks one can do with the tomahawk to

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.659 
attacks one can do with the tomahawk to
go<00:06:03.800> over<00:06:04.099> them<00:06:04.220> again

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
go over them again

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.210 
go over them again
that's<00:06:04.849> the<00:06:05.090> chop<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:06.740> cut<00:06:07.300> the<00:06:08.300> thrust<00:06:08.780> and

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
that's the chop the cut the thrust and

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.439 
that's the chop the cut the thrust and
the<00:06:10.220> rake<00:06:11.289> now<00:06:12.289> if<00:06:12.740> there's<00:06:13.220> any<00:06:13.520> questions<00:06:14.180> or
