you're<00:00:00.750> using<00:00:00.989> pumps<00:00:01.560> in<00:00:01.650> an<00:00:01.740> area<00:00:01.979> I've<00:00:02.070> never

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
you're using pumps in an area I've never

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.860 
you're using pumps in an area I've never
heard<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.610> before<00:00:02.790> for<00:00:03.120> pumping<00:00:03.480> liquid

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
heard of before for pumping liquid

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.570 
heard of before for pumping liquid
nitrogen<00:00:04.259> what's<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.740> application<00:00:05.339> here

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580

well<00:00:06.509> there<00:00:06.810> are<00:00:06.870> several<00:00:07.020> applications<00:00:07.290> if

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
well there are several applications if

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.740 
well there are several applications if
the<00:00:08.460> main<00:00:08.610> application<00:00:09.120> we<00:00:09.210> use<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.510> for<00:00:09.540> is

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
the main application we use it for is

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.459 
the main application we use it for is
purging<00:00:10.469> services<00:00:11.040> but<00:00:11.429> we<00:00:11.550> also<00:00:11.700> use<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.269> for

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
purging services but we also use it for

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.169 
purging services but we also use it for

is your customer base our customer base

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.019 
is your customer base our customer base
is<00:00:23.430> mainly<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.150> EPC<00:00:24.630> contractors<00:00:25.640> but<00:00:26.640> during

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
is mainly the EPC contractors but during

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.599 
is mainly the EPC contractors but during
periods<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.660> shutdowns<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.710> also<00:00:28.859> use<00:00:29.189> liquid

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
periods of shutdowns we also use liquid

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.759 
periods of shutdowns we also use liquid
nitrogen<00:00:29.910> pumps<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.720> NoCs

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
nitrogen pumps for the NoCs

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.600 
nitrogen pumps for the NoCs
and<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> IOC<00:00:32.430> s<00:00:32.640> also<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.160> do<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.190> understand

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and the IOC s also and do I understand

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.310 
and the IOC s also and do I understand
correctly<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.270> addition<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.750> pumping

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
correctly that in addition to pumping

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.229 
correctly that in addition to pumping
liquid<00:00:37.649> nitrogen<00:00:38.010> you're<00:00:38.190> also<00:00:38.430> gasifying<00:00:39.030> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
liquid nitrogen you're also gasifying it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.810 
liquid nitrogen you're also gasifying it
at<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> same<00:00:39.629> time<00:00:39.739> yeah<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.010> concept<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
at the same time yeah the concept the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.639 
at the same time yeah the concept the
way<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.570> unit's<00:00:42.870> work<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.350> takes

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
way that the the unit's work it takes

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.590 
way that the the unit's work it takes
liquid<00:00:44.190> nitrogen<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.899> at<00:00:45.899> minus<00:00:46.440> 196<00:00:47.250> degrees

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
liquid nitrogen in at minus 196 degrees

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.790 
liquid nitrogen in at minus 196 degrees
Celsius<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.899> liquid<00:00:49.379> at<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.910> pumps<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
Celsius as a liquid at it pumps it and

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.770 
Celsius as a liquid at it pumps it and
gasifier<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.160> discharges<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.480> hot

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
gasifier and discharges it as a hot

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.380 
gasifier and discharges it as a hot
nitrogen<00:00:55.320> gas<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.120> say<00:00:57.270> about

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
nitrogen gas so what can you say about

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.580 
nitrogen gas so what can you say about
the<00:00:57.510> actual<00:00:57.719> pump<00:00:57.930> itself<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the actual pump itself is it a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.049 
the actual pump itself is it a
centrifugal<00:00:59.070> pump<00:00:59.430> or<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> positive

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
centrifugal pump or a positive

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.389 
centrifugal pump or a positive
displacement<00:01:00.359> pump<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.320> both<00:01:01.559> actually<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
displacement pump it's both actually the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.100 
displacement pump it's both actually the
the<00:01:02.760> inlet<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.300> pump<00:01:03.600> has<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> small

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the inlet to the pump has a small

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.410 
the inlet to the pump has a small
centrifugal<00:01:04.559> unit<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.909> then<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.180> feeds

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
centrifugal unit but then it feeds

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.149 
centrifugal unit but then it feeds
through<00:01:06.659> into<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> positive<00:01:07.950> displacement

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
through into a positive displacement

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.170 
through into a positive displacement
pump<00:01:09.049> it's<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.409> fed<00:01:10.740> further<00:01:11.130> into<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.909> heat

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
pump it's then fed further into a heat

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.539 
pump it's then fed further into a heat
exchanging<00:01:12.810> pot<00:01:13.380> if<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.400> that's

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
exchanging pot if you like and that's

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.350 
exchanging pot if you like and that's
where<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> hot<00:01:15.509> nitrogen<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.530> discharged<00:01:17.360> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
where the hot nitrogen is discharged and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.149 
where the hot nitrogen is discharged and
what<00:01:18.540> are<00:01:18.630> some<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> safety<00:01:19.439> issues<00:01:19.799> when

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
what are some of the safety issues when

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.030 
what are some of the safety issues when
pumping<00:01:20.670> liquid<00:01:20.970> nitrogen<00:01:21.500> well<00:01:22.500> when<00:01:22.920> you're

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
pumping liquid nitrogen well when you're

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.359
