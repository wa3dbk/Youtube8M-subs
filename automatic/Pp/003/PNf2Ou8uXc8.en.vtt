00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
but it's a really cool smooth

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.709 
but it's a really cool smooth
functionality<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.329> opens

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
functionality that just you know opens

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.840 
functionality that just you know opens
and<00:00:51.899> closes<00:00:52.110> really<00:00:53.039> easily<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:55.640> right<00:00:56.640> now<00:00:56.820> i

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
and closes really easily and right now i

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
and closes really easily and right now i
have<00:00:57.270> i<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.600> redstone<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
have i have redstone here going to the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.880 
have i have redstone here going to the
switch<00:00:59.219> but<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.809> wanted<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.289> well<00:01:01.710> first

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
switch but if you wanted to well first

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.579 
switch but if you wanted to well first
of<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.090> obviously<00:01:03.180> use<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
of all you can obviously use just a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.250 
of all you can obviously use just a
button<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.189> want<00:01:05.689> which<00:01:06.689> will<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.020> open

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
button if you want which will just open

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.350 
button if you want which will just open
and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:07.770> close<00:01:07.799> immediately<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:09.180> that's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and then close immediately so that's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.539 
and then close immediately so that's
great<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.170> trapdoor<00:01:10.590> because<00:01:11.159> it'll<00:01:11.369> just

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
great for a trapdoor because it'll just

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.230 
great for a trapdoor because it'll just
trap<00:01:11.939> whoever<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.450> down<00:01:12.720> there<00:01:14.240> but

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
trap whoever it is down there but

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.109 
trap whoever it is down there but
alternately<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.439> want<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.909> you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.060> just

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
alternately if you want to you can just

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.480 
alternately if you want to you can just
do<00:01:18.390> away<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:19.250> altogether<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.110> just

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
do away with this altogether and just

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.060 
do away with this altogether and just
fill<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.210> right<00:01:24.780> there<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:25.830> put

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
fill this in right there and then put

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.789 
fill this in right there and then put
your<00:01:26.100> switch<00:01:26.430> right<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.500> there<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.619> go

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
your switch right there and there you go

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.149 
your switch right there and there you go
it'll<00:01:29.250> open<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.670> close<00:01:30.500> without<00:01:31.500> any<00:01:31.890> visible

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
it'll open and close without any visible
