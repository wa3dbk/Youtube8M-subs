00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.110 
announced the cast of Phantom Menace and
it<00:03:30.540> was<00:03:30.630> just<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.930> lot<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.290> big<00:03:31.590> stars<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:33.000> me

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
it was just a lot of big stars and to me

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.240 
it was just a lot of big stars and to me
I<00:03:33.150> did<00:03:33.720> have<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:33.989> like<00:03:34.170> wow<00:03:34.500> it's<00:03:34.739> like<00:03:34.859> this

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
I did have that like wow it's like this

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.890 
I did have that like wow it's like this
is<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.459> chance<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.940> introduce<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.630> bunch<00:03:36.780> of

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
is a chance to introduce a bunch of

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.650 
is a chance to introduce a bunch of
fresh<00:03:37.230> new<00:03:37.410> faces<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:38.519> this<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.000> galaxy<00:03:39.450> yeah

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
fresh new faces to this the galaxy yeah

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.990 
fresh new faces to this the galaxy yeah
and<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.560> think<00:03:40.769> that's<00:03:40.920> what<00:03:41.040> JJ<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.430> doing<00:03:41.790> he's

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
and I think that's what JJ is doing he's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.970 
and I think that's what JJ is doing he's
like<00:03:42.180> taking<00:03:42.569> that<00:03:42.660> approach<00:03:42.930> even<00:03:43.769> down<00:03:43.950> to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
like taking that approach even down to

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.740 
like taking that approach even down to
the<00:03:44.160> photo<00:03:44.489> they<00:03:44.760> released<00:03:45.030> it's<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.299> black<00:03:45.540> and

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
the photo they released it's a black and

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.199 
the photo they released it's a black and
white<00:03:45.840> photo<00:03:46.760> initially<00:03:47.760> when<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:47.940> was<00:03:47.970> reading

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209
