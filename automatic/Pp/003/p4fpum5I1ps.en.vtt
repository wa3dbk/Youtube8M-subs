00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.040
 salve salve personal who talks boy 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.900
 beauty out there 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:21.300
 so I'll also make a current video, right? 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:23.850
 It's about the Indian beat to help, huh? 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.410
 I updated it and downloaded it again. 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.650
 it is current there has been a merger between 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.980
 below that of the bronx which is one of the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:43.170
 England's leading bookmakers 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:47.010
 It was good to have this market so that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.879
 the aabb here can have a better 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.739
 competition with betfair and with 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.399
 this entity is launching some 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:03.270
 promotions né that is the percentage 0 né 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:06.210
 for a while then she goes 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.900
 having a maximum of 5% commission does not 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:14.700
 This is not going to happen until the 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:17.580
 betfair that depends on the amount you 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.060
 reach a certain time you go 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.320
 pay 35% and then you pay one 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.619
 nonsense 60% to 35% is incidentally 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.250
 And absurd obesity is also with 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.020
 promotion of 200 euros I think she already 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.920
 doubles this value for you to work on 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.500
 Marketplace 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.579
 Ok, that's it, I'll show it to you 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.909
 Software has not changed at all, right? 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:49.110
 only the platform some rules to which it was 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.549
 imposed by the truth is not to be 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.050
 used here with beige and sound rule 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.590
 since it is what is imposed in the uti 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.230
 'for which it is impossible for the front and faith 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.850
 But you just have to control it, right? 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.400
 staff a lot and not abuse 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.700
 that the small is what the staff who 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.670
 has less banking and is not affected is okay 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.660
 even a balance in that much part 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:26.690

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.690

 which is blocked right? 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.910
 So you choose the game, right? 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.650

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.100
 Relax here, huh? 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.170

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.200
 We had to go on this shortcut. 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.970

 How is this here? Is it complete? 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.970
 chose this market to work 20 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.709
