00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.089 
this chapter we got to talk about the
rank<00:00:10.290> functions<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.599> new<00:00:13.099> compatibility

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
rank functions and the new compatibility

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.950 
rank functions and the new compatibility
functions<00:00:14.519> now<00:00:14.880> rank<00:00:15.150> functions<00:00:15.599> are<00:00:15.780> great

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
functions now rank functions are great

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.200 
functions now rank functions are great
because<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.320> can<00:00:16.440> take<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.880> bunch<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.000> numbers

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
because it can take a bunch of numbers

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.730 
because it can take a bunch of numbers
and<00:00:18.510> rank<00:00:18.660> biggest<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.140> smallest<00:00:19.170> or<00:00:19.710> smallest

start<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> rank<00:00:33.870> sheet<00:00:34.860> here<00:00:35.340> alright

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
start on the rank sheet here alright

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.010 
start on the rank sheet here alright
rank<00:00:37.770> well<00:00:38.520> here's<00:00:38.969> some<00:00:39.180> sales<00:00:39.390> data<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:39.840> can

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
rank well here's some sales data we can

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.229 
rank well here's some sales data we can
clearly<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.070> biggest<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.000> if<00:00:42.090> we

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
clearly see this is the biggest so if we

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.380 
clearly see this is the biggest so if we
want<00:00:42.480> biggest<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.500> first<00:00:44.210> second<00:00:45.210> biggest

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
want biggest to get first second biggest

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.920 
want biggest to get first second biggest
to<00:00:45.660> get<00:00:45.809> third<00:00:46.170> second<00:00:47.210> then<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.539> use<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
to get third second then we can use the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.450 
to get third second then we can use the
rank<00:00:49.200> function<00:00:50.180> equals<00:00:51.180> ra<00:00:51.829> NK<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:53.129> name

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
rank function equals ra NK they name

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.689 
rank function equals ra NK they name
this<00:00:53.789> function<00:00:54.420> smartly<00:00:54.960> now<00:00:55.739> look<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.430> this

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
this function smartly now look at this

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.630 
this function smartly now look at this
we<00:00:57.449> saw<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.989> our<00:00:58.079> last<00:00:58.289> video<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.770> that

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
we saw this in our last video to that

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.970 
we saw this in our last video to that
little<00:01:00.059> triangle<00:01:00.660> gold<00:01:01.260> triangle<00:01:01.829> there

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
little triangle gold triangle there

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.490 
little triangle gold triangle there
means<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> compatibility<00:01:03.600> function

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
means this is a compatibility function

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.340 
means this is a compatibility function
this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.369> an<00:01:05.549> older<00:01:06.090> function<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.200> was

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
this is an older function that was

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.120 
this is an older function that was
around<00:01:07.650> before<00:01:07.890> Excel<00:01:08.540> 2010<00:01:09.540> these<00:01:10.229> two<00:01:10.740> new

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
around before Excel 2010 these two new

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.090 
around before Excel 2010 these two new
ones<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.030> top<00:01:12.060> are<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:13.200> ones<00:01:13.229> they<00:01:13.710> want

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
ones at the top are the ones they want

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.140 
ones at the top are the ones they want
you<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.729> use<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.020> all<00:01:17.150> compatibility

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
you to use now this all compatibility

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.210 
you to use now this all compatibility
functions<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.869> an<00:01:19.020> equivalent<00:01:19.470> new

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
functions have an equivalent new

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.109 
functions have an equivalent new
function<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.840> rank<00:01:22.560> dot<00:01:23.310> EQ<00:01:23.909> means

there's<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.819> tie<00:02:28.120> for<00:02:28.420> second<00:02:28.750> place<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:29.049> each

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
there's a tie for second place so each

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.000 
there's a tie for second place so each

person gets second place and then third

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.670 
person gets second place and then third
which<00:02:33.459> is<00:02:33.640> not<00:02:33.790> really<00:02:34.030> third<00:02:34.209> because<00:02:34.680> second

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
which is not really third because second

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.080 
which is not really third because second
third<00:02:36.250> got<00:02:36.549> used<00:02:36.790> up<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.180> that's<00:02:37.329> fourth<00:02:37.870> place

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
third got used up so that's fourth place

the tomb now for some situation this is

the tomb now for some situation this is

perfect other situations it's not like
for<00:03:45.920> example<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.580> used<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.270> build<00:03:47.420> spreadsheets

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
for example I used to build spreadsheets

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.040 
for example I used to build spreadsheets
for<00:03:48.520> boomerang<00:03:49.520> tournaments<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.390> scoring

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
for boomerang tournaments the scoring

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.560 
for boomerang tournaments the scoring
systems<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.830> when<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.070> get<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.280> tie<00:03:52.610> you<00:03:53.330> have

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
systems and when you get a tie you have

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.890 
systems and when you get a tie you have
to<00:03:53.780> add<00:03:53.960> two<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.340> three<00:03:56.000> together<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.450> divide

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
to add two and three together and divide

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.710 
to add two and three together and divide
by<00:03:56.930> two<00:03:57.170> so<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.460> score<00:03:58.970> here<00:03:59.210> should<00:03:59.390> be<00:03:59.510> two

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
by two so the score here should be two

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.810 
by two so the score here should be two
point<00:03:59.960> five<00:04:00.110> and<00:04:00.380> boom<00:04:01.010> that's<00:04:01.190> exactly<00:04:01.700> what

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
point five and boom that's exactly what

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.280 
point five and boom that's exactly what
the<00:04:01.940> average<00:04:02.270> function<00:04:02.420> this<00:04:02.750> is<00:04:02.780> actually<00:04:03.230> a

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
the average function this is actually a

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.320 
the average function this is actually a
great<00:04:03.740> new<00:04:04.070> function<00:04:04.520> because<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.910> formula

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
great new function because the formula

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.120 
great new function because the formula
we<00:04:05.480> used<00:04:06.080> to<00:04:06.290> have<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.890> do<00:04:07.070> was<00:04:07.340> big<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:07.910> nasty

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
we used to have to do was big and nasty

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.340 
we used to have to do was big and nasty
all<00:04:10.130> right<00:04:10.250> I'm<00:04:10.370> gonna<00:04:10.489> do<00:04:10.670> rank<00:04:11.020> average<00:04:12.020> the

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
all right I'm gonna do rank average the

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.910 
all right I'm gonna do rank average the

hours<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:43.400> of<00:04:43.490> course<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:44.240> faster<00:04:44.720> well<00:04:45.020> in

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
hours so of course the faster well in

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.710 
hours so of course the faster well in
this<00:04:45.770> case<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.190> faster<00:04:46.610> we<00:04:46.730> do<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.419> better

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
it will be so I have my number and

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.870 
it will be so I have my number and
reference<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.919> order<00:04:52.310> is<00:04:52.430> simply<00:04:52.580> going

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
reference and the order is simply going

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.400
