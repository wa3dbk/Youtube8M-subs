00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:17.700
 we are in the wind farm daxweiler on the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.739
 campus build here two enercon e 101 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:25.660
 at 149 meters hub height with a new one 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:31.080
 sl 2800 of the company ericsson 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:34.000
 Configuration is 153 12 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.510
 that means a lot of heavy equipment in the 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.220
 moving difficult terrain 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.680
 this construction site is for the construction of the 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.449
 Crane very modest 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.390
 We have two camps with about eight to 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.730
 build ten meters in height 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.920
 basically practically the cantilever over 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.660
 one day there is more and more 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.550
 wind farms in wooded area 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.350
 it will be built for the crane 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.690
 operator in advance increasingly 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.350
 more demanding to plan the construction sites 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.040
 we have several up here 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 sightseeing because the local 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.630
 circumstances were very modest 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.990
 On the one hand, it must not be cleared 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.290
 will build something in the forest yes 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.970
 bigger problems is the biggest drawback 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.740
 and then had to stay here with the operators 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.189
 find reasonable medium between 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.049
 effort and use and therefore have two 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.440
 make bulges for the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.250
 for the help plan 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.870
 the two camps was imperative 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.870
 in that the free before up to 76 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.930
 meters can be done and then the crane 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.370
 must be filed for the first time 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.660
 Here we have two hills in the 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.320
 build landscape 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.660
 was the construction company and one day Blazed 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.820
 with two dredgers and four trucks was here 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.880
 on the spot and have the terrain something 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.580
 so we raised five to six 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.100
 meter height to build from regions 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.050
 despite the difficult conditions plays 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.420
 the factor security for the team of 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.950
 Stone works the decisive role 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.800
 yes up here comes in any case the 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.320
 fall protection really to bear 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.410
 because we are eight to ten meters tall 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.390
 must overcome the professionals drive the 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.840
 tip of the boom further and further 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.210
 ahead 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.340
 up to the required use amount of 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.010
 at least twelve meters above hub height 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.610
 the plant 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.200
 We are not yet 153 +12 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.819
 At the end of the device sg still six meters 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.500
 more 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.819
 but the susceptibility to wind then 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.819
 already clearly noticeable 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.980
 even with this extremely large plant 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.230
 we have here diameter of about 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.930
 seven meters at eight machines 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.970
 meters the machine house and 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.870
 clearly wins attack surface and 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.690
 of course, the transferring 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.220
 gusts of wind are transmitted by the device 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.250
 serenity among those involved 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.170
 achieve readiness for service on schedule 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.330
 the actual great example are in the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.580
 Comparison to the construction of the giant crane 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.120
 routines for the team of stein 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.120
