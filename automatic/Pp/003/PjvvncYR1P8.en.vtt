gives back to you so the more you the
more<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.140> use<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.680> more<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.490> understand

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
more you use it the more you understand

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.670 
more you use it the more you understand
it<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.240> more<00:02:26.450> almost<00:02:27.260> feels<00:02:27.440> like<00:02:27.500> the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
it the more almost feels like the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.500 
it the more almost feels like the
machine<00:02:27.950> understands<00:02:28.520> you<00:02:28.640> because<00:02:29.000> because

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
machine understands you because because

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.120 
machine understands you because because
you<00:02:29.750> get<00:02:29.900> really<00:02:30.080> it's<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.380> reveal<00:02:30.650> feedback

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
you get really it's a reveal feedback

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.290 
you get really it's a reveal feedback
from<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.430> machine<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:31.940> tells<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.270> what

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
from the machine it tells you what

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.810 
from the machine it tells you what
you're<00:02:32.570> doing<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:34.040> know<00:02:34.220> pretty<00:02:34.550> really

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
you're doing you know pretty really

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
from a dislocated shoulder which is

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.110 
from a dislocated shoulder which is
horrible<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:42.650> lost<00:02:43.250> all<00:02:43.520> my<00:02:43.580> strength<00:02:43.940> in

gone to the gym or if I'd gone to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.960 
gone to the gym or if I'd gone to
physical<00:02:48.680> therapist<00:02:49.070> should<00:02:49.610> we<00:02:49.730> could<00:02:49.880> have

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
physical therapist should we could have

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.430 
physical therapist should we could have
done<00:02:50.120> something<00:02:50.390> but<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.810> didn't<00:02:51.140> know<00:02:51.200> exactly

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
done something but I didn't know exactly

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.490 
done something but I didn't know exactly
how<00:02:51.739> much<00:02:51.860> strength<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.820> had<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.840> when<00:02:53.989> I<00:02:54.020> got<00:02:54.260> on

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
how much strength I had so when I got on

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.810 
how much strength I had so when I got on
the<00:02:54.680> machine<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.100> was<00:02:55.190> actually<00:02:55.489> pretty<00:02:55.520> cool

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
the machine it was actually pretty cool

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.640 
the machine it was actually pretty cool
because<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.209> got<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.600> you<00:02:56.840> know<00:02:57.350> when<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.560> was

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
because I got to you know when I was

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.530 
because I got to you know when I was
doing<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.980> push<00:02:58.250> push<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.820> was<00:02:58.940> able<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.360> really

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
doing a push push I was able to really

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.520 
doing a push push I was able to really
see<00:03:00.370> where<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.430> was<00:03:01.700> lacking<00:03:01.910> strength<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.690> I

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
see where I was lacking strength and I

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.180 
see where I was lacking strength and I
didn't<00:03:04.209> go<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.450> put<00:03:05.690> another<00:03:05.930> brute<00:03:06.620> force<00:03:06.950> in

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
didn't go and put another brute force in

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.949 
didn't go and put another brute force in
it<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.459> just<00:03:07.730> did<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:07.970> really<00:03:08.239> naturally<00:03:08.810> in<00:03:08.900> the

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
it I just did it really naturally in the

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.600 
it I just did it really naturally in the
beginning<00:03:09.110> with<00:03:09.530> with<00:03:10.070> very<00:03:10.310> low<00:03:10.489> resistance

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
beginning with with very low resistance

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.380 
beginning with with very low resistance
and<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.660> just<00:03:11.930> want<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.170> feel<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.980> see<00:03:13.820> where<00:03:14.150> my

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and I just want to feel and see where my

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.729 
and I just want to feel and see where my
strengths<00:03:14.660> wasn't<00:03:14.959> slowly<00:03:15.200> I'm<00:03:15.380> just<00:03:15.560> putting

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
strengths wasn't slowly I'm just putting

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.620 
strengths wasn't slowly I'm just putting
to<00:03:15.920> start<00:03:16.160> putting<00:03:16.310> more<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.640> more<00:03:16.940> strength

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
to start putting more and more strength

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.290 
to start putting more and more strength
into<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.640> when<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.670> know<00:03:19.910> two<00:03:19.970> weeks

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
into it and when you know two weeks

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.800 
into it and when you know two weeks
later<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.600> was<00:03:20.660> racing<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.440> I<00:03:21.530> did

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
later I was racing and I did

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.880 
later I was racing and I did
I<00:03:21.840> did<00:03:22.050> really<00:03:22.200> well<00:03:22.319> so<00:03:23.480> for<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:25.680> was

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
I did really well so for that it was

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.309 
I did really well so for that it was
really<00:03:26.250> really<00:03:26.989> helpful<00:03:30.170> actually<00:03:31.170> one<00:03:31.290> of

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
really really helpful actually one of

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.630 
really really helpful actually one of
the<00:03:31.500> favorite<00:03:31.800> things<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:32.099> like<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.280> do<00:03:32.430> with<00:03:32.580> it

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
the favorite things I like to do with it

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.339 
the favorite things I like to do with it
is<00:03:33.270> to<00:03:33.630> feel<00:03:33.810> really<00:03:34.290> really<00:03:34.530> low<00:03:34.800> make<00:03:35.010> a

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
is to feel really really low make a

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.660 
is to feel really really low make a
feedback<00:03:37.349> you<00:03:37.620> know<00:03:37.739> just<00:03:37.920> put<00:03:38.160> very<00:03:38.459> very

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
feedback you know just put very very

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.520 
feedback you know just put very very
little<00:03:38.910> strength<00:03:39.180> on<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.360> because<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.319> makes

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
little strength on it because it makes

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.770 
little strength on it because it makes
it<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:40.920> challenging<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.760> it's<00:03:42.360> really<00:03:42.660> about

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
it so challenging and it's really about

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.850 
it so challenging and it's really about
constant<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:43.380> really<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.830> concentrate

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
constant you really have to concentrate

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.820 
constant you really have to concentrate
on<00:03:44.370> your<00:03:44.550> whole<00:03:44.790> core<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.690> it's<00:03:46.319> it's<00:03:46.620> not

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
on your whole core and it's it's not

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.150 
on your whole core and it's it's not
about<00:03:47.010> strength<00:03:47.370> it's<00:03:47.730> about<00:03:48.120> it's<00:03:48.599> not<00:03:48.690> about

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
about strength it's about it's not about

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.830 
about strength it's about it's not about
brute<00:03:50.160> force<00:03:50.489> it's<00:03:50.849> about<00:03:50.940> internal<00:03:51.569> strength

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
brute force it's about internal strength

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.570 
brute force it's about internal strength
and<00:03:52.080> that's<00:03:52.950> what<00:03:53.099> I<00:03:53.130> like<00:03:53.280> about<00:03:53.340> this

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
and that's what I like about this

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.400 
and that's what I like about this
machine<00:03:53.850> that's<00:03:54.239> what<00:03:54.420> I<00:03:54.450> that's<00:03:54.989> what<00:03:55.200> i<00:03:55.260> use

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
machine that's what I that's what i use

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.590 
machine that's what I that's what i use
the<00:03:55.440> most<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.980> that's<00:03:56.940> why<00:03:57.090> we<00:03:57.120> need<00:03:57.330> every

like<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.410> most<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.739> doing<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.340> then

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
like the most is doing it and then

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.509 
like the most is doing it and then
staying<00:04:06.360> hold<00:04:07.200> understand<00:04:07.799> that<00:04:07.980> so<00:04:08.160> can<00:04:08.489> I

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
staying hold understand that so can I

brand you know as you get better with
the<00:04:10.920> mission<00:04:11.190> in<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.340> beginning<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.849> was<00:04:12.030> what

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
the mission in the beginning I was what

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.360 
the mission in the beginning I was what
wasn't<00:04:12.630> able<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.170> do<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.440> pushing<00:04:13.890> for<00:04:14.160> I

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
wasn't able to do the pushing for I

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.699 
wasn't able to do the pushing for I
couldn't<00:04:14.910> do<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.690> was<00:04:15.810> hard<00:04:16.079> just<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.560> just

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
couldn't do it it was hard just you just

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.370 
couldn't do it it was hard just you just
can't<00:04:17.519> after<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.269> while<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.959> start

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
can't after a while you start

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.659 
can't after a while you start
understanding<00:04:19.650> how<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.220> machine<00:04:20.430> works

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
understanding how the machine works

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.550 
understanding how the machine works
start<00:04:21.510> understanding<00:04:21.720> how<00:04:22.079> your<00:04:22.200> body<00:04:22.470> works

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
start understanding how your body works

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.219 
start understanding how your body works
and<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.729> become<00:04:24.150> one<00:04:24.450> with<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.630> machine<00:04:25.050> and

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
and you become one with the machine and

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.430 
and you become one with the machine and
now<00:04:25.590> i<00:04:26.210> only<00:04:27.210> do<00:04:27.479> push<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:27.900> pull<00:04:28.050> almost

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
now i only do push and pull almost

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.350 
now i only do push and pull almost
because<00:04:28.800> it's<00:04:28.950> really<00:04:29.460> about<00:04:29.729> you<00:04:30.240> know

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
because it's really about you know

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.990 
because it's really about you know
putting<00:04:30.600> your<00:04:31.050> your<00:04:31.919> body<00:04:32.130> in<00:04:32.310> space<00:04:32.340> and

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
putting your your body in space and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.719 
putting your your body in space and
losing<00:04:33.510> your<00:04:33.630> balance<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:35.400> that's

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
losing your balance and and that's

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.190 
losing your balance and and that's
really<00:04:36.090> what<00:04:36.270> makes<00:04:36.510> it<00:04:36.600> interesting<00:04:36.660> for<00:04:36.990> me

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
really what makes it interesting for me

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.440 
really what makes it interesting for me
in<00:04:37.560> my<00:04:37.620> sport<00:04:38.400> that's<00:04:38.970> what<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.150> makes<00:04:39.330> it

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
in my sport that's what it makes it

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.270 
in my sport that's what it makes it
interesting<00:04:39.660> because<00:04:40.140> we're<00:04:41.130> always

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
interesting because we're always

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.610 
interesting because we're always
changing<00:04:41.669> always<00:04:42.090> changing<00:04:42.780> direction<00:04:42.900> is

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
changing always changing direction is

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.980 
changing always changing direction is
moving<00:04:43.919> forward<00:04:44.190> backwards<00:04:45.180> side<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.960> side

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
moving forward backwards side to side

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.760 
moving forward backwards side to side
lots<00:04:46.590> of<00:04:46.710> g-force<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.780> really<00:04:49.020> that's<00:04:49.229> the

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
lots of g-force so really that's the

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.620 
lots of g-force so really that's the
best<00:04:50.130> is<00:04:51.050> really<00:04:52.050> for<00:04:52.260> that<00:04:52.289> we<00:04:52.950> need<00:04:53.479> so<00:04:54.479> much

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
best is really for that we need so much

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.090 
best is really for that we need so much
coordination<00:04:54.960> because<00:04:55.560> when<00:04:55.830> you're<00:04:55.950> going

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
coordination because when you're going

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.490 
coordination because when you're going
to<00:04:56.370> animal<00:04:56.700> are<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.240> you<00:04:57.750> gotta<00:04:57.930> make<00:04:58.080> split

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
to animal are and you gotta make split

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.410 
to animal are and you gotta make split
this

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
this

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.640 
this
split-second<00:05:00.420> decisions<00:05:00.810> all<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.080> time<00:05:01.200> and

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
split-second decisions all the time and

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.860 
split-second decisions all the time and
you're<00:05:02.310> doing<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:02.790> our<00:05:03.000> race<00:05:03.270> and<00:05:03.600> you're<00:05:03.750> just

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
you're doing to our race and you're just

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.190 
you're doing to our race and you're just
you<00:05:04.470> feel<00:05:04.770> fatigued<00:05:05.220> although<00:05:05.870> this<00:05:06.870> machine

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
you feel fatigued although this machine

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.570 
you feel fatigued although this machine
was<00:05:07.260> able<00:05:07.530> to<00:05:07.650> really<00:05:07.770> bring<00:05:08.040> your<00:05:08.190> love<00:05:08.370> of

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
was able to really bring your love of

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.350 
was able to really bring your love of
coordination<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.660> balance<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:11.180> because<00:05:12.180> the

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
coordination and balance and because the

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.030 
coordination and balance and because the
fact<00:05:12.630> of<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.900> oscillating<00:05:13.440> platform<00:05:13.919> is

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
fact of the oscillating platform is

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.010 
fact of the oscillating platform is
always<00:05:14.280> moving<00:05:14.520> never<00:05:14.850> know<00:05:15.630> what<00:05:15.750> he's<00:05:15.870> going

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
always moving never know what he's going

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.620 
always moving never know what he's going
to<00:05:16.110> change<00:05:16.350> because<00:05:17.010> can<00:05:17.310> be<00:05:17.430> random<00:05:17.669> and<00:05:18.030> it

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
to change because can be random and it

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.900 
to change because can be random and it
just<00:05:18.810> kind<00:05:19.620> of<00:05:19.650> throws<00:05:19.980> you<00:05:20.130> off<00:05:20.160> balance<00:05:20.250> and

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
just kind of throws you off balance and

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.080 
just kind of throws you off balance and
that's<00:05:21.240> what<00:05:21.540> really<00:05:21.810> for<00:05:22.500> me<00:05:22.680> it<00:05:23.100> was<00:05:23.730> a<00:05:23.790> huge

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
that's what really for me it was a huge

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.830 
that's what really for me it was a huge
help<00:05:24.270> in<00:05:24.540> that<00:05:24.840> sense<00:05:25.200> because<00:05:26.480> because<00:05:27.480> our

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
help in that sense because because our

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.379 
help in that sense because because our
track<00:05:28.500> changes<00:05:28.830> every<00:05:29.310> lap<00:05:29.490> every<00:05:29.700> lab<00:05:30.180> there

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
track changes every lap every lab there

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.670 
track changes every lap every lab there
could<00:05:30.510> be<00:05:30.540> someone<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:31.020> crash<00:05:31.260> and<00:05:31.500> you<00:05:31.530> have

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
could be someone to crash and you have

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.460 
could be someone to crash and you have
to<00:05:31.770> avoid<00:05:31.860> them<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:32.460> you<00:05:33.300> you<00:05:33.960> know<00:05:34.080> you<00:05:34.110> have

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
to avoid them in the last minute and

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.140 
to avoid them in the last minute and
it's<00:05:37.890> it<00:05:38.370> was<00:05:38.520> so<00:05:38.790> helpful<00:05:39.150> for<00:05:39.480> that<00:05:39.660> because

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
it's it was so helpful for that because

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.290 
it's it was so helpful for that because
it's<00:05:42.470> it's<00:05:43.470> just<00:05:43.620> about<00:05:44.010> you<00:05:44.580> know<00:05:44.880> making
