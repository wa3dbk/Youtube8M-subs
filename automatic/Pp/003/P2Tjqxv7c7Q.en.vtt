00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.010 
about them specifically they've got the
over<00:04:28.240> top<00:04:29.610> velcro<00:04:30.610> rather<00:04:31.060> than<00:04:31.270> some<00:04:31.870> of<00:04:31.960> the

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
over top velcro rather than some of the

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.630 
over top velcro rather than some of the
more<00:04:32.229> Thai<00:04:32.380> gloves<00:04:32.710> from<00:04:32.860> Everlast<00:04:33.310> you'll
