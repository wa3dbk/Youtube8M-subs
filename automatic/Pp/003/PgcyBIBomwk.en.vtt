00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.119
 so now something completely different Munich 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.130
 we present the news for 2013 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.900
 I found this here what is that 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.669
 why do you need that looks a bit 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.189
 strange from something like that 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.329
 Jerrycan something completely different 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.469
 namely a kind of mobile 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.719
 high pressure cleaner 

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:31.149
 You can do that for a lot 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:33.190
 So of course, use it for everyone 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.649
 offer anyway caravan and 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.840
 but of course for everyone 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.430
 biker also interesting that you just 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.829
 after the trail then sometimes can say 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.370
 okay I do my advice accordingly 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.370
 clean 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.109
 before I pack up to the trunk or 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.969
 also in any competition where i am 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:52.569
 in between times in the wheel times clean 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.339
 So a few things that is now 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.839
 here with a battery version is a 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.809
 Lithium ion battery in it 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.690
 and this lithium ion battery in total 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.909
 he is hidden in here and stops if 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.700
 the fully charged is about an hour 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.159
 can I clean it then 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.510
 here is a big water tank on it 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.250
 are water tank I can now here 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:18.190
 and can do all this comfortably for 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.450
 put faucet on it again 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.430
 then I do not want the whole device 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.650
 dragging is also a direct 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.880
 six meters long hose with his 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:34.660
 quick coupling above and below 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.810
 carry handle up here in the water can 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.490
 is directly integrated into the sieve 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.750
 means I can sometimes on the river or 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.850
 Take the same water out and that 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.500
 leaves and so on little sips 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.810
 not even in the water tank 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.580
 come in 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.590
 I thought it was great because it gives you that 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.970
 possibility and therefore stands the justus 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.650
 four times as reder quite short 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.210
 clean and clean 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.260
 I show that justus me now 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.730
 hope you do not mind if 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.440
 now I can get a bit wet 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.450
 So you can set the ray so I can 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.810
 but that even so also make high pressure 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.159
 up to 7 bar and can handle it accordingly 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.800
 go in the justus was dirtbiker drives 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.569
 however, downhill and told me 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.730
 just will make sense after 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.190
 few download track 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.140
 then accordingly to be so before 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.239
 this with the mother in the trunk 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.110
 is laid because that's probably always there 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.799
 otherwise problems 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:37.260
 I think it's great thanks justus the first 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.260
 was allowed to do and still wish football
