dsi browser because loading speed is
slightly<00:02:34.720> faster<00:02:35.110> i<00:02:35.350> would<00:02:35.650> i<00:02:35.890> would<00:02:35.980> give<00:02:36.280> it

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
slightly faster i would i would give it

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.390 
slightly faster i would i would give it
about<00:02:36.900> twenty<00:02:37.900> percent<00:02:37.930> faster<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:39.250> not

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
about twenty percent faster it's not

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.310
