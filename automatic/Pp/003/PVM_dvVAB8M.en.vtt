00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.379 
now it's all of a sudden it's starting
to<00:00:13.740> make<00:00:13.860> knocking<00:00:14.309> noises<00:00:14.490> sound<00:00:14.969> spark

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389

related<00:00:17.180> running<00:00:18.180> real<00:00:18.359> good<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.750> then<00:00:18.869> all

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
related running real good and then all

of<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.199> sudden<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.590> seems<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:19.949> it's<00:00:20.070> losing

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279

power<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.880> went<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.930> hooked<00:00:22.050> up<00:00:22.260> timing<00:00:22.740> light

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
power I went and hooked up timing light

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.240 
power I went and hooked up timing light
to<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.490> with<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> capacitance<00:00:24.390> meter<00:00:24.689> I

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
to it and with the capacitance meter I

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.470 
to it and with the capacitance meter I
went<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.340> checked<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.789> see<00:00:26.939> when<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> points

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
went and checked to see when the points

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.050 
went and checked to see when the points
would<00:00:27.599> open<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.160> in<00:00:29.160> order<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.519> get<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.789> S<00:00:29.849> on

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
would open and in order to get the S on

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.609 
would open and in order to get the S on
the<00:00:30.179> flywheel<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:31.019> into<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> center<00:00:31.500> of

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the flywheel to get into the center of

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.350 
the flywheel to get into the center of
the<00:00:31.769> hole<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> had<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.219> set<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> points<00:00:32.880> all<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the hole I had to set the points all the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.170 
the hole I had to set the points all the
way<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.620> 25<00:00:34.620> thousands<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.489> an<00:00:35.610> inch<00:00:35.700> opening

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
way to 25 thousands of an inch opening

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.760 
way to 25 thousands of an inch opening
and<00:00:37.309> when<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:39.230> you<00:00:40.230> know<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.590> get

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
and when I do that you know I can get

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.740 
and when I do that you know I can get
the<00:00:41.390> s<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> timing<00:00:43.110> light<00:00:43.469> kind<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the s on the timing light kind of in the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.040 
the s on the timing light kind of in the
lower<00:00:46.110> quarters<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.219> hole<00:00:50.660> now<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> give<00:00:51.930> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
lower quarters of the hole now I give it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
lower quarters of the hole now I give it
start<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.590> run<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.100> sounds<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.789> somehow

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
start and run but it sounds like somehow

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.229 
start and run but it sounds like somehow
you<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.800> timing<00:00:55.800> has<00:00:56.100> been<00:00:56.129> off<00:00:56.579> tooth

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you do that timing has been off tooth

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.569 
you do that timing has been off tooth
the<00:00:57.449> whole<00:00:57.600> time<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.829> skipped<00:00:59.280> which<00:00:59.460> I

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
the whole time or it's skipped which I

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.680 
the whole time or it's skipped which I
don't<00:00:59.640> see<00:00:59.789> how<00:00:59.940> that's<00:01:00.090> possible

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
don't see how that's possible

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.709 
don't see how that's possible
gear<00:01:01.170> drive<00:01:01.969> gear<00:01:02.969> driven<00:01:03.120> cam<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
gear drive gear driven cam and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.020 
gear drive gear driven cam and
everything<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.589> give<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> start<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
everything so give it a start up and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:02:24.410 
everything so give it a start up and
we'll<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.540> how<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.930> goes

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.980 

no<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.590> starts<00:02:26.010> fine<00:02:26.310> now<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.880> runs<00:02:27.030> decent

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
no it starts fine now it runs decent

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.110 
no it starts fine now it runs decent
it's<00:02:28.650> got<00:02:28.800> good<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:29.370> got<00:02:29.580> good<00:02:29.730> polling

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
it's got good it's got good polling

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.970 
it's got good it's got good polling
power<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.720> when<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.230> points<00:02:31.560> are<00:02:31.620> set<00:02:31.830> this

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
power and when the points are set this

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.900 
power and when the points are set this
far<00:02:32.220> open<00:02:32.550> but<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.530> just<00:02:34.709> has<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.250> horrid

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
far open but and it just has this horrid

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.460 
far open but and it just has this horrid
knock<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.840> know<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.080> just<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:37.410> you

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
knock to it you know it's just so you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.150 
knock to it you know it's just so you
could<00:02:37.590> hear<00:02:37.860> it

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
could hear it

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.220 
could hear it
it<00:02:38.730> almost<00:02:38.880> sounds<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.660> from<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
it almost sounds like it's from the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.490 
it almost sounds like it's from the
actual<00:02:40.560> connecting<00:02:41.340> rod<00:02:41.520> but<00:02:42.380> when<00:02:43.380> you

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
actual connecting rod but when you

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.040 
actual connecting rod but when you
adjust<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.010> points<00:02:44.430> either<00:02:45.060> way<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.930> know

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
adjust the points either way you know

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.940 
adjust the points either way you know
the<00:02:46.200> knot<00:02:46.380> goes<00:02:46.620> away<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:48.620> one<00:02:49.620> off<00:02:49.740> just

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the knot goes away so one off just

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.300 
the knot goes away so one off just
coincidence<00:02:50.580> somehow<00:02:50.940> maybe<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:52.070> cam<00:02:53.070> is

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
coincidence somehow maybe the cam is

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.880 
coincidence somehow maybe the cam is
either<00:02:54.060> advance<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.900> tooth<00:02:55.110> or<00:02:55.350> retarded<00:02:55.800> a

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
either advance the tooth or retarded a

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.940 
either advance the tooth or retarded a
tooth<00:02:56.069> I'm<00:02:56.250> not<00:02:56.400> sure<00:02:56.610> yet<00:02:56.910> Oh

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
tooth I'm not sure yet Oh

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.740 
tooth I'm not sure yet Oh
hoping<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.910> get<00:03:00.090> some<00:03:00.270> opinions<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:03.660> know

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
hoping to get some opinions on you know

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.390 
hoping to get some opinions on you know
the<00:03:04.080> sound<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.500> performance<00:03:05.070> with<00:03:05.220> that

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
the sound of the performance with that

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.960 
the sound of the performance with that
with<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.060> 25,000<00:03:07.019> points<00:03:07.260> gap<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.970> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
with the 25,000 points gap and the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.170 
with the 25,000 points gap and the
valves<00:03:09.239> are<00:03:09.360> set<00:03:09.510> correctly<00:03:10.820> made<00:03:11.820> sure<00:03:12.000> that

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
valves are set correctly made sure that

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.210 
valves are set correctly made sure that
the<00:03:12.420> exhaust<00:03:13.050> valve<00:03:13.320> was<00:03:13.530> set<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:13.980> know<00:03:14.070> what

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
the exhaust valve was set you know what

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.670 
the exhaust valve was set you know what
the<00:03:14.340> compression<00:03:15.000> release<00:03:15.300> down<00:03:15.680> so

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
the compression release down so

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.080 
the compression release down so
hopefully<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:20.220> know<00:03:20.250> it's<00:03:20.519> something<00:03:20.850> simple

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
hopefully you know it's something simple

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.229 
hopefully you know it's something simple
so<00:03:21.690> I'll<00:03:21.750> have<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.959> take<00:03:22.019> poll<00:03:22.260> engine<00:03:22.560> apart

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
so I'll have to take poll engine apart

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.600 
so I'll have to take poll engine apart
