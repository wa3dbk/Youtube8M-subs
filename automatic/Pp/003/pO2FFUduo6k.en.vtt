00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
holding spray onto her hair to make it

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.809 
holding spray onto her hair to make it
tighter<00:02:33.909> and<00:02:34.329> to<00:02:35.200> grip<00:02:35.519> because<00:02:36.519> sometime

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
tighter and to grip because sometime

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.539 
tighter and to grip because sometime
when<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.060> have<00:02:37.209> very<00:02:37.480> silky<00:02:37.840> hair<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:39.400> go

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
when you have very silky hair and you go

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:46.470 
when you have very silky hair and you go

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.479 
to braids and loosens up some begin to
start<00:02:46.750> braiding<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.980> you<00:02:54.099> don't<00:02:54.250> have<00:02:54.370> to

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
start braiding and you don't have to

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.849 
start braiding and you don't have to
brave<00:02:54.700> really<00:02:55.209> really<00:02:55.540> tight<00:02:55.930> because<00:02:56.769> you

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
brave really really tight because you

want a great firm where else stay this

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.569 
want a great firm where else stay this
braid<00:03:01.209> is<00:03:01.390> where<00:03:01.599> we're<00:03:01.750> going<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.430> start<00:03:03.430> to

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
braid is where we're going to start to

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.960 
braid is where we're going to start to
sew<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:06.069> what<00:03:06.250> I'm<00:03:06.370> going<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.549> do<00:03:06.640> I'm<00:03:06.819> going

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
sew and what I'm going to do I'm going

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.319 
sew and what I'm going to do I'm going
to<00:03:07.030> braid<00:03:07.390> all<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.959> way<00:03:08.079> to<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.500> very<00:03:08.739> back

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
to braid all the way to the very back

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.000 
to braid all the way to the very back
and<00:03:10.329> I'm<00:03:10.510> gonna<00:03:10.690> stop<00:03:11.079> right<00:03:11.590> in<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.859> back<00:03:12.099> and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
and I'm gonna stop right in the back and

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.559 
and I'm gonna stop right in the back and
then<00:03:15.010> I'm<00:03:15.129> gonna<00:03:15.220> start<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.519> new<00:03:15.549> braid<00:03:16.030> on<00:03:16.269> this

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
then I'm gonna start a new braid on this

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:17.129 
then I'm gonna start a new braid on this
side

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
side

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.339 
side
I<00:03:17.169> don't<00:03:17.709> braid<00:03:18.099> all<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.459> way<00:03:18.700> around<00:03:19.349> because

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
I don't braid all the way around because

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.339 
I don't braid all the way around because
the<00:03:20.470> hair<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.709> so<00:03:21.069> long<00:03:21.359> that<00:03:22.359> if<00:03:22.599> I<00:03:22.780> braid<00:03:23.169> it

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
the hair is so long that if I braid it

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.039 
the hair is so long that if I braid it
all<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.620> way<00:03:23.919> around<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:25.540> braid<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:25.989> hangs

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
all the way around the braid that hangs

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.920 
all the way around the braid that hangs
out<00:03:26.500> it's<00:03:26.739> gonna<00:03:26.950> it's<00:03:27.250> gonna<00:03:27.810> have<00:03:28.810> to

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
out it's gonna it's gonna have to

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.440 
out it's gonna it's gonna have to
overlap<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.950> then<00:03:30.519> sew<00:03:30.879> and<00:03:31.150> it's<00:03:31.269> gonna

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
overlap it and then sew and it's gonna

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.030 
overlap it and then sew and it's gonna

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
start sewing from here and to this point

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.140 
start sewing from here and to this point
here<00:03:52.949> then<00:03:53.949> I'm<00:03:54.069> gonna<00:03:54.190> take<00:03:54.370> this<00:03:54.549> braid<00:03:54.940> and

here then I'm gonna take this braid and

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.089 
here then I'm gonna take this braid and
pull<00:03:55.510> over<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:56.049> overlap<00:03:56.470> on<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:56.859> side

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
pull over it and overlap on this side

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.729 
pull over it and overlap on this side
and<00:03:57.400> I'm<00:03:57.849> gonna<00:03:58.090> take<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.989> thread<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.319> I'm

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
and I'm gonna take the thread and I'm

swell it will not pop you will have to

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:18.570 
swell it will not pop you will have to
cut<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.560> out<00:05:10.440> so<00:05:11.440> it<00:05:11.650> will<00:05:11.800> last
