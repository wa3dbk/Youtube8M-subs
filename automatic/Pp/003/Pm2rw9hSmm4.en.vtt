don't know it's different it's more
volumizing<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.270> would<00:02:28.690> compare<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.890> if<00:02:30.250> you

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
volumizing I would compare it to if you

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.240 
volumizing I would compare it to if you
were<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.970> take<00:02:31.270> tarts<00:02:31.959> volumizing<00:02:32.830> brow

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
getting it gives you a little more

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.150 
getting it gives you a little more
volume<00:02:40.690> it's<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.050> little<00:02:41.200> more<00:02:41.380> natural<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:42.070> a
