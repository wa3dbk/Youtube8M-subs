00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
the area with the water currents if you

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.450 
the area with the water currents if you
just<00:01:07.310> float<00:01:07.610> off<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.030> side<00:01:08.240> like<00:01:08.480> that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
just float off to the side like that

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.980 
just float off to the side like that

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
jellyfish what you need to do is grab

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.630 
jellyfish what you need to do is grab

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
your hook and take the little air

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.060 
your hook and take the little air

bubbles and put them underneath the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:30.350 
bubbles and put them underneath the
jellyfish

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.490 

it's<00:01:31.360> a<00:01:31.420> little<00:01:31.720> tricky<00:01:32.050> to<00:01:32.080> get<00:01:32.260> them<00:01:32.410> in

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
it's a little tricky to get them in

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:50.850 
it's a little tricky to get them in
position<00:01:32.620> just<00:01:33.160> right<00:01:33.280> but

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.030 

area<00:01:51.850> once<00:01:52.180> you<00:01:52.330> get<00:01:52.480> them<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.620> jellyfish

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
area once you get them and the jellyfish

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.910 
area once you get them and the jellyfish
he'll<00:01:54.250> float<00:01:54.430> up<00:01:54.690> allowing<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.990> float<00:01:56.740> in

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
he'll float up allowing you to float in

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.790 
he'll float up allowing you to float in
there<00:01:57.160> and<00:01:57.430> pick<00:01:57.790> up<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:58.000> second<00:01:58.270> upgrade<00:01:58.800> the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
there and pick up the second upgrade the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.580 
there and pick up the second upgrade the
third<00:01:59.980> upgrade<00:02:00.160> is<00:02:00.930> pretty<00:02:01.930> early<00:02:02.020> in<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.410> ice

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
third upgrade is pretty early in the ice

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:10.980 
third upgrade is pretty early in the ice
so<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:09.580> pretty<00:02:09.910> out<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.180> open<00:02:10.479> not<00:02:10.720> very

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
so it's pretty out in the open not very

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.710 
so it's pretty out in the open not very
hard<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.230> want<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.410> find<00:02:12.120> fourth<00:02:13.120> one<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.480> also

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
hard to want to find fourth one is also

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:30.040 
hard to want to find fourth one is also
in<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.140> ice<00:02:14.260> zone<00:02:14.610> about<00:02:15.610> halfway<00:02:15.910> into<00:02:16.420> it

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:40.000 

turning<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:30.890> around<00:02:30.980> these<00:02:31.250> enemies<00:02:39.010> right

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
turning it around these enemies right

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.610 
turning it around these enemies right
you<00:02:40.280> float<00:02:40.550> up<00:02:40.580> there<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.660> there's<00:02:42.380> the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
you float up there and there's the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.390 
you float up there and there's the
fourth<00:02:42.860> upgrade<00:02:47.650> fifth<00:02:48.650> one<00:02:48.800> is<00:02:48.950> also<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.280> nice

grab onto these purple blocks with and

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.559 
grab onto these purple blocks with and
actually<00:05:52.160> pull<00:05:52.580> yourself<00:05:52.970> through<00:05:53.000> the<00:05:53.360> water

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
actually pull yourself through the water

00:05:53.569 --> 00:06:10.320 
actually pull yourself through the water
current

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.870 

and<00:06:11.330> once<00:06:11.630> you<00:06:11.750> get<00:06:11.900> through<00:06:12.080> that<00:06:12.610> just<00:06:13.610> keep

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
and once you get through that just keep

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.659 
and once you get through that just keep
swimming<00:06:14.120> up<00:06:14.360> top

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669
