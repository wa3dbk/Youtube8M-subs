00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
we've pretty much tried to just have a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.640 
we've pretty much tried to just have a
really<00:00:15.960> large<00:00:16.349> sound<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.520> try<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.470> spill<00:00:19.470> out

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
really large sound so I try to spill out

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:37.670 
really large sound so I try to spill out
as<00:00:20.340> much<00:00:20.580> space<00:00:20.910> as<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.270> can

steels<00:00:41.260> what<00:00:41.560> would<00:00:41.650> be<00:00:41.740> the<00:00:41.860> equivalent<00:00:42.100> of

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
steels what would be the equivalent of

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.870

suppressor I used to decimator - I love
it<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.300> doesn't<00:01:33.480> affect<00:01:33.870> my<00:01:34.080> tone<00:01:34.320> at<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.620> but

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
it it doesn't affect my tone at all but

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.220 
it it doesn't affect my tone at all but
it<00:01:34.980> really<00:01:35.130> helps<00:01:35.460> make<00:01:36.000> our<00:01:36.150> stops<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.080> our

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
it really helps make our stops and our

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.930 
it really helps make our stops and our
breaks<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.680> lot<00:01:37.830> cleaner<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.400> then<00:01:38.550> I<00:01:38.580> go<00:01:38.730> into

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
breaks a lot cleaner and then I go into

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.620 
breaks a lot cleaner and then I go into
