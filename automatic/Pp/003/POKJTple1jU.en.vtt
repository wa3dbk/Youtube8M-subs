00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:20.380
 Henault president intervened 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.369
 and hello to all and the blond of his 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.169
 sisters and today we find ourselves 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.300
 for a special video 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.189
 since I'm going to present you a 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.590
 application to speed up his 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.239
 smartphone and above all remove all 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.340
 unnecessary files lying around in the 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.820
 phone so this application this is 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.050
 a master so we could see symbol 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.750
 two balls and a little bit to clean 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.980
 we do like that we love 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.480
 the problem is that with this 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.399
 application is Canetois the map 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.420
 memory or finally the nestois is the 4 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.219
 memory be there when the phone is not going 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.030
 both at the same time 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.059
 So I show them some principle 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.250
 so there's the task manager 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.119
 it's going to be all the applications we 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.399
 installs and that's it in backup 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.039
 it's going to be all the applications that 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.770
 backing up pretty heavy things if 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:14.679
 we want to remove them we can 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.570
 and finally we also optimized optimized 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.679
 memory so that's the RAM 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.450
 you can close all 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.880
 applications they where unnecessary 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.110
 to win here even when it's 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.539
 propose directly that is to say that 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.330
 follow the applications csc which he 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.920
 do not have to turn off and all 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.140
 is true that those that are important 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.119
 if finally to the point of posing room must 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.770
 turn off that if they will not be very 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.229
 important of what so there I am told that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.000
 it's going to be 77 and word so here if I'm 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:47.819
 no toyer hop here I have the most ram 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.250
 so we also talked about useless files 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.179
 on so file used the recommended 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.030
 that is, everything they give us 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.849
 all the residual file caches and all 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.520
 and deepen his more little ones 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:03.340
 files that we would not have 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.750
 missed in the first the first bet 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.640
 up to date during the first in the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.470
 first cleaning 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.200
 so how's it going so 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.020
 recommended we will go in cash their 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.180
 cash and all all all everything and 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.470
 what about all the applications that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.900
 keep stuff in memory for 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.450
 power to be able to serve them 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.080
 prices have for example dropped flipboard and 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.000
 MyTF1 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.290
 so here I 'm going to get cleaned but 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.900
 I also expect this thing going 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.219
 emina what is folders that are 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.659
 created alone with surely 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.629
 applications I'm going I'm going 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:38.269
 to install and who are no longer 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.180
 useful so here I have to clean and the 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.920
 sabam clean 550 550 and month by little 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:50.959
 close so there after we have to wait 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:55.609
 I love will not be too long a 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.799
 asked that's done then the greenhouse we 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:01.120
 but that and after in a deep to say 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:04.040
 we can go and see what has 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.510
 of rest we can have deleted and 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.970
 it's not going to offer us any more stuff 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.870
 like as about the pictures so 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.700
 the videos the images 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.159
 so as you want to see thumbnail of 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.359
 gary in fact and all the pictures of the 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.069
 station and that will be saved for 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.180
 when you turn it on the images 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.970
 appear directly there no 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.669
 salary reload that no interest so 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.220
 you do it we do it for the tick we do 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:27.019
 ok we do re clean and it will 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.510
 delete all that and then we 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:35.930
 will save winning memory 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.199
 so here's a 10 522 and 26 his words 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.180
 was released completed so we can go 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.079
 in their privacy 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.870
 confidentiality 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.959
 it's going to be all the little apps 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.299
 of account that will save words 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.030
 password or what and in this case you 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.440
 can delete them have for example 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.389
 here you can delete 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.889
 pardon so you want to delete is 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.139
 innate month for a girl to avoid that 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.720
 when your phone can go 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.400
 on the county and all used so 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.099
 I do not do it because it's worth 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.590
 not really the antenna for me and that's it 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.840
 after flavors interest for you so there 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.859
 we have both the storage that it 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:22.970
 be internal 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:25.639
 where external storage forgiveness was here 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.840
 who how to say gift box these 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.590
 kinds of scorff cups 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.400
 the application of how to say facts 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.009
 advertising for other applications 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.919
 here we go here all that is all 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:39.110
 parameters so footage day will put 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.120
 never the application the notte 2 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.570
 delighted doing a quick cleaning phone 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:50.270
 for example there you see that it detects 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.130
 exactly 182nd to donations that will only 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.290
 my phone 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.970
 so here I get cleaned up and there it goes 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.720
 any job here and I'm still going 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.980
 gained from memory 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:04.130
 so we also have the parameters so the 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.360
 parameters this is for example reminiscent of the 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.640
 single file he knows when you 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.080
 download an application you have to 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.910
 uninstall and we will leave 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.410
 files or folders on phone 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.860
 and he will send you a notification 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.410
 here in the taskbar for 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.700
 tell you that this one has left a 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.400
 folder and they no longer delete it 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.050
 so we could be that it's all that 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.850
 the three days 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.440
 it puts a size over 300 and me 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.460
 after that we can change it I did 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.850
 more than 50 dead 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.470
 finished so there's a task killer that's 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.700
 the same but when the memory is too 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.030
 full when the RAM is too much 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.160
 full 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.700
 that will put you a notification for 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.470
 you say it the files would reign 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.430
 it's all the files that did not take it 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.190
 in account but we can still 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.900
 deleted and after that is all that 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.900
 is general the French language or 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.040
 already send a robbery 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.820
 so that's about all for 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.800
 this application 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.960
 I found her rather nice she can to 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.640
 access their phone if they rome or 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.800
 what too to be to both files 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.840
 sometimes it can allow you to 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.250
 save space 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.080
 so here I wanted to introduce it to you 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.410
 so now I invite you to you 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.180
 subscribe to my channel have watched my 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.050
 other videos in any case thank you 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.450
 have watched 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.400
 do not hesitate to go but if if you 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.870
 loved it he commented if you have 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.580
 questions or anything else 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:26.830
 and we end up in a next 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.830
