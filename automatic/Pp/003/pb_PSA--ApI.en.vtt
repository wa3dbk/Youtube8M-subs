00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.530 
brand new this is just being introduced
at<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> SHOT<00:00:41.219> Show<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.579> year<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:42.360> called

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
at the SHOT Show this year it's called

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.139 
at the SHOT Show this year it's called
the<00:00:42.690> marksman<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> collaboration

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the marksman it is a collaboration

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.950 
the marksman it is a collaboration
between<00:00:45.710> us<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.010> grant<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.789> Gavin<00:00:48.059> Hawk<00:00:48.239> they

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
between us and grant and Gavin Hawk they

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.229 
between us and grant and Gavin Hawk they
developed<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> initial<00:00:49.800> mechanism<00:00:50.789> we

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
developed the initial mechanism we

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.479 
developed the initial mechanism we
obviously<00:00:51.449> refined<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.469> had<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.949> make

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
obviously refined it and had to make

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.040 
obviously refined it and had to make
changes<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.360> able<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.570> produce<00:00:54.750> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
changes to it to be able to produce it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.290 
changes to it to be able to produce it
but<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.620> unique<00:00:56.010> mechanism<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.180> have

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
but a unique mechanism it is we have

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.549 
but a unique mechanism it is we have
filed<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:57.840> back<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.410> so<00:01:00.410> essentially<00:01:01.410> it's

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
filed for back on it so essentially it's

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.460 
filed for back on it so essentially it's
a<00:01:01.710> deployment<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.579> locking<00:01:02.910> mechanism

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
a deployment and locking mechanism

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.410 
a deployment and locking mechanism
flipper<00:01:05.470> right<00:01:05.710> here<00:01:05.950> very<00:01:06.790> fast<00:01:07.060> deployment

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
flipper right here very fast deployment

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.600 
flipper right here very fast deployment
it's<00:01:07.990> not<00:01:08.140> assisted<00:01:08.560> opening<00:01:08.650> very<00:01:09.160> fast<00:01:09.430> very

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
it's not assisted opening very fast very

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.180 
it's not assisted opening very fast very
smooth<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.360> tried<00:01:11.080> this<00:01:11.230> earlier<00:01:11.410> I<00:01:11.650> was<00:01:11.770> amazed

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
smooth I tried this earlier I was amazed

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.720 
smooth I tried this earlier I was amazed
at<00:01:12.460> how<00:01:12.490> smooth<00:01:12.940> it<00:01:13.390> is<00:01:13.500> amazingly<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.520> lock

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
at how smooth it is amazingly the lock

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.430 
at how smooth it is amazingly the lock
it's<00:01:15.970> a<00:01:16.060> strap<00:01:16.330> lock<00:01:16.600> you<00:01:16.780> can<00:01:16.930> see<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.230> here

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
it's a strap lock you can see it here

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.850 
it's a strap lock you can see it here
now<00:01:17.680> before<00:01:18.010> you<00:01:18.100> go<00:01:18.250> on<00:01:18.400> yes<00:01:18.850> why<00:01:19.120> is<00:01:19.180> it<00:01:19.510> so<00:01:19.860> it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
now before you go on yes why is it so it

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.880 
now before you go on yes why is it so it
is<00:01:21.040> smooth<00:01:21.340> because<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:22.300> we<00:01:22.810> use<00:01:23.080> inside<00:01:23.590> we

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
is smooth because it we use inside we

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.710 
is smooth because it we use inside we
have<00:01:24.040> a<00:01:24.280> couple<00:01:24.580> of<00:01:24.700> ball<00:01:24.910> bearing<00:01:25.270> raceways

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
have a couple of ball bearing raceways

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.520 
have a couple of ball bearing raceways
yes<00:01:26.320> yes<00:01:26.920> not<00:01:27.400> very<00:01:27.430> little<00:01:27.910> friction<00:01:28.530> moves

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
yes yes not very little friction moves

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.000 
yes yes not very little friction moves
very<00:01:29.740> easily<00:01:29.950> ball<00:01:30.490> bearings<00:01:30.820> obviously<00:01:32.010> very

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
very easily ball bearings obviously very

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.490 
very easily ball bearings obviously very
smooth<00:01:33.250> very<00:01:33.340> easy<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:36.250> does<00:01:36.430> but<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.690> it's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
smooth very easy it does but it is it's

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.010 
smooth very easy it does but it is it's
not<00:01:39.540> alright<00:01:41.490> lock<00:01:42.490> mechanism<00:01:43.090> unique<00:01:43.810> lock

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
not alright lock mechanism unique lock

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.560 
not alright lock mechanism unique lock
mechanism<00:01:44.650> it's<00:01:44.800> a<00:01:44.860> strap<00:01:45.130> lock<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:46.479> the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
mechanism it's a strap lock it's the

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.480 
mechanism it's a strap lock it's the
longest<00:01:46.930> strongest<00:01:47.410> lock<00:01:47.800> mechanism<00:01:48.280> we<00:01:48.400> have

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
longest strongest lock mechanism we have

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.300 
longest strongest lock mechanism we have
tested<00:01:48.910> really<00:01:49.780> I'm<00:01:50.619> stronger<00:01:51.040> than<00:01:51.070> any

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
tested really I'm stronger than any

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.920 
tested really I'm stronger than any
liner<00:01:51.550> lock<00:01:51.790> and<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.150> lock<00:01:52.300> back<00:01:52.509> so<00:01:52.720> far

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
liner lock and you lock back so far

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.530 
liner lock and you lock back so far
that's<00:01:53.170> what<00:01:53.290> we<00:01:53.350> found<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:55.210> other<00:01:55.300> nice

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
that's what we found the other nice

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.330 
that's what we found the other nice
thing<00:01:55.750> about<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:56.110> is<00:01:56.350> we<00:01:56.619> don't<00:01:56.770> accidentally

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
thing about it is we don't accidentally

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.770
