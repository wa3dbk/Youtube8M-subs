 fracture lived and problems with the arm at 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.800
 he most likely did not have these remains 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.570
 about 800 years exploring the find 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.670
 anthropologist Sergey Frizen confidently 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.750
 declares the lancers was well developed 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.760
 the medicine

 for the first time in North Ossetia, excavations are underway 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.080
 in such a large area almost 15 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.130
 thousand square meters scientists 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.960
 suggest that it is here 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.360
 all the largest city of Alan 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.280
 state and its existence science 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.829
 it became known in the 50s of the past 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.770
 centuries when discovered from a bowl 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.689
 burial notes burial is 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.759
 reference monument for this 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.390
 territories and for the central caucasus 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.579
 at all 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.119
 monument themselves represent the place 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:32.569

 burials burial grounds 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.929
 represent deep

 rectangular wells and stepped holes 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.429
 the body was not placed on the bottom 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:53.619
 and immured in the wall this image

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:18.220
 scientists do not doubt Alans were 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:20.930
 great with these here this thing 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.660
 called an optical nail cleaner 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.650
 it is a subject of such hygienic 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.239
 of character 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.940
 we also have artifacts and mirrors 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.900
 at a depth of 2 3 meters to extract them 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.450
 intact 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.519
 working manually about the technique here already 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.109
 long abandoned 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.530
 mechanically very hard to get to the bottom 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:45.620
 secondly the catacombs are not very good 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.540
 preservation and finds and skeletons and 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.190
 this is literally there jewelry work then 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.380
 have to be a small tool 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.139
 brushes carefully disassemble it all 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.639
 the work of archaeologists is coming to an end after
