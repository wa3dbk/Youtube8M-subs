00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:11.370
 Specializing in cooking science fluffy simmering omelette its secret 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.370
 I will have been related to Professor Shibukawa Emeritus Professor 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:20.430
 According to Dr. Shibukawa, the first point is always done at the preparation stage 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.590
 Say it's in trouble 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.590
 That's the way to solve the eggs 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.640
 Well until quite waist is no longer 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.640
 I will mix 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:40.199
 It mixes very well and mixes at the time of late 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:46.010
 Although that egg dishes by persons went to the mass 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.010
 You can say whether that or the shores of the way there is I'm very important 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.450
 Mr. Body carefully gets a whisk and white meat and yolk 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.859
 In addition, I use whitehead to break white tissue 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.859
 Fine and uniform 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.370
 Then I have a head at the end of the day like a soup. 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:20.220
 The ingredients are completely different in white and yolk 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:26.060
 Re There is a difficult nature of mass better of you who are Yasuku' chunks of white meat 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.060
 Set them in the teas by mixing both well 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:35.450
 Drop eggs in a frying pan etc 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.450
 It can be seen that the people of the white will change white ahead 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.090
 Strengths start to solidify at 55 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 You begin to set at 65 degrees 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:57.759
 This difference in temperature is different type and amount of moisture content and protein contained in white and yolk 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:04.740
 Say it happens for 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.740
 You do not harden as white even to begin to lump white is white As you can see 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.950
 While here it was polished routinely 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.920
 You can see white lumps here and there 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.920
 What happens if you try to burn it as it is 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:28.020
 Let's roll around when the setting surface with the frying pan was heated 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.020
 I was born at the border of white and yellow with different nature 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.150
 When white and yellow are separated , omelet of simmering inside comes out 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.020
 Good 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:49.770
 There is a feeling that the eggs will tear or not meshing 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:49.770
 If you compare the two, you can clearly see the difference in color unevenness in the front and the fineness of the texture 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:03:00.069
 Infinitely skin is thin contents is intends ass 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:04.079
 Professional omelet that makes people jealousy The point of the great one is public office erotic 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.079
 It was in the main significant sales expansion 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:19.180
 Essential conditions for fluffy omelettes 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.180
 Mr Mogi says it 's too hot 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.930
 The people of the wife who prepares in the process of the family of everyone usually think that the wife makes with low heat 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.930
 But 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.500
 The basics are weak 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.110
 After all 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.390
 I can not set 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.200
 very well 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.700
 The omelet stretch film I become want to see you is whether I scrambled eggs I say 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:46.250
 Make 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.380
 It is a feeling that the inside is a very hard-boiled Toro Toro state and it winds with high heat at a stretch 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:54.750
 Then 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.750
 What kind of technique is hidden in the fluffy omelet made by burning on high heat 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:06.620
 First pour the eggs into a frying pan with butter 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.620
 At this time the stove is still low heat 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.710
 And the firepower is raised at once and the frying pan is vigorously 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.150
 The important thing here is that it is to heat while mixing the eggs in a skewer 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.309
 The eggs inside 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:39.429
 I 'm moving the eggs and frying pan 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:39.429
 The face that contacts is changing every moment 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:47.669
 Though it is a movement that looks casually 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.669
 It is an important task to divide the omelet 's contrast 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:05:01.039
 If it is heated without scratching under low heat 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:05.349
 Will entirely become firmly in too baked by the time the egg is that heat is transmitted to the surface for thermal conductivity is poor 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.349
 I no longer can, such as rounding 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:16.640
 If you are jealous, the side that is in contact with the frying pan is 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.990
 In not a 8 the outside at the time but is not too masses became just the right temperature is also a fellow 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.490
 Harden 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.780
 Because of that, the time for contacting a hot frying pan is short 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.370
 Whole 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.580
 Contact ejaculation evenly 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.840
 Shake well for that purpose 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:38.060
 Now egg surface temperature is 50 degrees 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:43.060
 Mogi weakened the fire when it reached 60 degrees 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.060
 It is exactly the time when the egg starts to set 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.920
 Determine the tone of the egg here 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:55.380
 Stop the section 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:06:00.210
 Slightly bake the installation surface with the ply version to make a thin skin 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:01.110
 Harden as soon as possible, and it's about cooking and Bonick, but it's about 60 degrees 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.870
 About 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:10.660
 Luo whiff but so Rineru Tteyuu are wrong shoulder 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:14.129
 But it is than is the layer as in meat 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:18.490
 And start rounding at once 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:24.240
 Aim for a temperature of about 60 degrees 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:24.240
 Will it be baked to a noticeable temperature just by seeing with eyes? 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.419
 Measure the temperature of the contents with a special counter clock 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:38.560
 About 60 degrees as intended this is also rumor professional 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:42.430
 It is not applied the hand or as thin as this film deals 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.390
 It is already that it is prosperous that she keeps going beautifully 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.380
 1 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:50.249
 I think and always make it 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:54.120
 The first securing in preparation 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:07:01.430
 And the second passenger Hahn to perform while heating 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:01.430
 It It is this two sales was the secret of the omelet that is it is difficult to fire acceleration
