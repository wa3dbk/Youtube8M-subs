each other or anything so we're we've
got<00:00:59.870> beats<00:01:00.080> a<00:01:00.230> nice<00:01:00.410> day<00:01:00.620> nice<00:01:00.770> bit<00:01:00.980> of<00:01:01.040> wind<00:01:01.160> it

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
got beats a nice day nice bit of wind it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.310 
got beats a nice day nice bit of wind it
yet<00:01:01.489> I<00:01:01.820> mean<00:01:02.059> there's<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.270> few<00:01:02.480> people<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:03.199> are

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
yet I mean there's a few people that are

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.140 
yet I mean there's a few people that are
always<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.830> little<00:01:03.979> edge<00:01:04.309> above<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.760> rest<00:01:04.940> but

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
always a little edge above the rest but

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.120 
always a little edge above the rest but
I<00:01:05.180> think<00:01:05.390> in<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.960> pack<00:01:06.170> just<00:01:06.320> behind<00:01:06.620> that<00:01:06.770> you

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
I think in the pack just behind that you

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.500 
I think in the pack just behind that you
know<00:01:07.250> once<00:01:07.580> you<00:01:07.820> can<00:01:07.940> have<00:01:08.060> a<00:01:08.090> good<00:01:08.210> regatta

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
know once you can have a good regatta

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.210 
know once you can have a good regatta
but<00:01:08.990> you<00:01:09.170> know<00:01:09.260> we<00:01:09.380> might<00:01:09.500> not<00:01:09.680> really

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
but you know we might not really

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.530 
but you know we might not really
difficult<00:01:10.640> venue<00:01:10.909> but<00:01:11.030> really<00:01:11.300> looking

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
difficult venue but really looking

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.780 
difficult venue but really looking
forward<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.810> it

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:31.230
