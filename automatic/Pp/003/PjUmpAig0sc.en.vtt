00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 a few god my voice is still ugly but 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.599
 you forgive me because today's book is 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:24.539
 a little thing that is the story of your 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:26.090
 in a little while after a vignette 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.130
 History of Israel is a book about 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.040
 differences love but mainly 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.710
 about dreams he's nothing third person 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.300
 by the author herself and he is perfect 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.230
 for this type of information could not 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.180
 be better 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.520
 after you and the seven chapters 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.500
 of history is the will to put a 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.469
 double child of me I looked at her 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.120
 It's so cute but even being a story 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.820
 who wants to have a child 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.870
 It's not a children's book. It 's perfect. 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.660
 for any age 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.329
 the book divided into four parts and each 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.070
 country has its chapters in the three 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.829
 first parts we know three 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.899
 different characters being in the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.840
 first part we know mouse 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.979
 said dog that is a dog in the link was born 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.869
 different 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.909
 since the time all the others were born 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.990
 perceived that it was different from that of 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.960
 your kind 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.270
 And he has a dream of his and in love with 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.700
 music and is also finding 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.040
 human princess called pea 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.530
 he has been bullying since childhood 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.180
 differences because it is a path that 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.700
 likes music and not likes the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.470
 things are not like the second part 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.710
 from the book we know the mouse roscuro 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.570
 what happened as iptu is different from 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.570
 all others of its kind he 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.540
 whenever you find them and the others 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.070
 rats live in darkness very well and in the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.530
 third part we met the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.810
 little girl attached to sowing 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.299
 lived his whole life in the shadow of others 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.579
 no one ever respected heard your 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.930
 and I'm tired of it and I'm 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.909
 and also have a dream 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.469
 in all three parts of the book we 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.790
 follow the adventures of these 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.280
 characters 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.049
 their routine and we know a little about the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.969
 personality of each 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.340
 the story goes back in time in some 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.989
 moments to show a little of the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.250
 of each of them as well. 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.800
 but in certain 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.240
 moment she together like life 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.080
 of the characters 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.140
 the reading of parts 1 2 and 3 of the book 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.270
 also complete and full of details 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.390
 some of the elements cited by the author 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.100
 for example chapter comes and shows 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.560
 further ahead 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.270
 so ignore any details 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.880
 because they appear later is very 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.020
 It's nice to notice you interconnect a 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.850
 thing with the other 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.500
 how year author presents the 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.650
 characters is also very clear and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.200
 detailed but the fourth and last part of the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.739
 book I thought it was a little fast 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.080
 It is not that they lack anything, nor that they 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.390
 leaves loose ends in explaining right 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.010
 No, she explains perfectly, but it seems 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.560
 than in a more accelerated way than 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.239
 the other three parts of the book and 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.860
 kind of thing that seems to take in the 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.920
 heart of this book 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.370
 I think there's right to say courage 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.050
 You know why he shows us that people 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.850
 you have to face the things that 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.940
 happen in our lives to be able to 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.650
 achieving our goal is a 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.870
 book that makes us think of things that 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.989
 We already wanted to do but we did not 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.930
 we did for fear of our differences with 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:28.140
 other people and how we face 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.480
 This is what we show today without 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.459
 guard for fear of others is a book 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.160
 That makes us dare to speak, not me. 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.390
 I'm like that and that's what everyone has. 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.010
 differences 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.299
 people have to respect this way 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.000
 I'm going to run after my dreams, not 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.250
 Let's hide if the reader is a person. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.920
 who has already suffered bullying or bullying 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.459
 No, people do not get much from this book. 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.110
 very much and that there are very nice things 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.320
 for the life of here 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.709
 This is an adaptive person. 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.209
 of ripening changes will also 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.980
 also take many good things from here 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.310
 have courage to face things 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.860
 to run back even gives up never 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.630
 finally remembered very cute full of 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.500
 welcoming messages that give a warm 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:16.530
 heart that deserves to be found 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.479
 wines very well given the respective or 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.180
 I'm recommending for God's World 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.260
 even for you 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.560
 The history of your car has not been 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.180
 who conquered Brazil then is 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.300
 This is the staff that will exhaust what 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.730
 liked the favorite way describe on the channel and 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:41.770
 forget it was also right that you have 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:44.680
 There is a novelty there a kiss and a hug to 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:48.240
 We know the people ste 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.560
 the kitten that gets grease dirty 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.350
 I was wobbling on the bed and people 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.970
 realize he is not seeing that he had 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.970
 sleep in the car
